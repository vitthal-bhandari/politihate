    "text": " On Tuesday, Prince and Princess Privacy, Harry and Meghan Markle, claimed to have been involved in a, quote, near catastrophic car chase at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi. A quote, relentless pursuit lasting over two hours, resulting in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road, pedestrians, and two NYPD officers. Wow, quite the story. I was just waiting for the part where Meghan held onto her subway sandwich while the Nigerian white supremacist paparazzi told her that Manhattan is a naga country. And I was not the only person perhaps to be skeptical of the story. Four starters, these story resembled the car chase that ended with the death of Harry's mother Diana almost perfectly. Few other facts that raised some doubts about the Markle's claims include the testimony of the NYPD, which observed that the couple, quote, arrived at their destination, and there were no reported collisions, summonses, injuries, or arrests, as well as the testimony of the cabbie who said, quote, I never felt like I was in danger. It wasn't like a car chase in a movie, as well as the fact that it's New York City, one of the most congested places on Earth, where it is not possible to have a two hour or even a two minute car chase, because the traffic is always so bad. Even the liberal mayor of New York was not buying it. I would find it hard to believe that there was a two hour high speed chase. That would be a fight in hard to believe, but we will find out the exact duration of it. It's a very diplomatic way of saying it's just total BS, and it's not just the Markles, okay? If it were just the Markles, I'd let it go. We wouldn't open the show this way, but it's not just the Markles, it's the Markles, and the media, and the FBI, and pretty much the whole regime, we are ruled by a bunch of BS artists. That is the inevitable consequence of a culture that shirks duty and favors fantasy and rejects the very notion of truth. I'm Michael Nolz, just the Michael Nolz show. Welcome back to this show. We've got breaking news. I don't know if you got a push notification on your phone. Starbucks, India has gone trans. We'll get to that in just a moment to that very important story. First, though, speaking of lovebirds, did you feel it? Did the wind blow through your hair as we slid further down that slippery slope because you can go over to the chalkboard, you can put down another correct prediction for the social conservatives? We've slid further down the slippery slope. I think the score right now is 10 bazillion to zero in terms of predictions, but it doesn't really matter because the social conservatives continue to be right, and the liberals continue to get whatever they want. This time on polygamy and polyamory. Remember when the conservatives, those crazy, fuddy, duddy, neurotic conservatives, they said when the libs were trying to redefine marriage, that if we redefine marriage to include two men and two women, that pretty soon we're going to redefine marriage to include polygamy and polyamory. It's going to be not just one man and another man, but one man and three women and two billy goats and a sheep. And guess what happened? That's exactly what happened from the New York Times, quote, interested in polyamory. Check out these places. Subheader, laws granting rights to people in polyamorous relationships are being recognized in more cities. Now to be clear, this isn't polygamy yet. This isn't redefining marriage yet. This is the first step. This is the civil unions of orgies. Okay, the first step is we're just going to give some rights. So what does it matter? Love is love. Who cares? Why are you such a funny duddy? We're not redefining marriage to include polygamy. Okay, you crazy person. And then within a matter of years at most, we're going to start seeing these new rights that we're extending to some people who are just a little bit different. That's going to be extended to redefining marriage, if it hasn't been totally abolished already. Article J. Snite had heard about Somerville, Massachusetts while working on a PhD at the University of Alabama in 2020. The small city had recently passed a law granting domestic partnership rights like the ability to receive employment benefits or make hospital visits to people in polyamorous relationships. Mix night, that's what they do now instead of Mr. and Miss and Mrs. Even the feminist Miz. Now the people who are confused about their sex, they do MX period. Mix night, who is non-binary and has been non-monogamous since 2014 was impressed. In late March, Somerville passed two more laws extending the rights of non-monogamous residents, this time banning discrimination on the basis of family or relationship structure in city employment and housing. Similar ordinance focused on housing is currently being discussed in Somerville City. And that's because Mix night has two partners and a partner of one of those partners and you get the point. There are a bunch of other people like this, a bunch of other towns doing this. It's always the same script. It's always, we just want to visit people in the hospital. You can change hospital rules. You don't need to fundamentally redefine marriage and man and woman. You can just change visitation rules within the hospitals themselves. Well, and we want certain non-discrimination rights. I don't know if you're a complete degenerate who has orgies all the time and is living in this bizarre arrangement where no one knows anybody's sex and you're all doing weird stuff all the time with multiple people, I feel I should be able to discriminate against you. Discriminate meaning distinguish from one thing to another. If I got two candidates for a job, thank goodness I'm not in the position to hire anybody or the NLRB would probably be on my back already before the end of this show. But if I were, I'm just saying this hypothetically in principle, if I were going to hire somebody and I wanted to hire, I don't know, a guy to look after my house, someone to look after my kids, let's say, especially, but let's say just someone to look after my property. And I had two choices. I had a guy who was an upright, family man, married, took care of his responsibilities, went to church on Sunday, said just a good guy all around. And then I've got this other guy who doesn't know that he's a guy and who's constantly engaging in weird bachanols and orgies and is just so hyper focused on sex and porn and obscenity. That's the only thing that goes between one ear and the other that's basically melted his brain. Which person do you think is going to be more responsible to do the job? Which person is going to have a better grasp on reality and morality and the way that people are supposed to behave? But according to Somerville, Massachusetts, you're not allowed to even perceive that distinction. Haven't we gone a little bit far? Wouldn't you say there's a little bit of drift here from, hey, don't unjustly discriminate against the El Salvadoran over the Italian or something versus, hey, don't discriminate between people who can't even understand the difference between men and women to say nothing of the fundamental political structure. If you cannot discriminate on the basis of what people think a family is, then what you're saying is you can't discriminate on the fundamental political structure because that's the basic political unit. The libs are discriminating. Of course, the libs are discriminating. If you think that marriage is, and family is what it always has been, you're out, man. Your views are not accepted anymore. You will be discriminated against in the culture and through the law. And what will be discriminated for is going to be mixed night with his 17 partners and their 22 partners and the billy goat.

Speaking of slippery slopes. Some good news on this front. Bud Light continues to collapse. This is now, I think, the fifth week in a row. Retail data from Bump Williams Consulting and Nielsen IQ indicate that Bud Light sales have declined 23.6% in the week ending May 6th relative to the same period last year. This is an even worse decline than for the week ending April 29th, which was an even worse decline than the week before and the week before and the week before. Not only is Bud Light dealing with this decline in sales, but the other trans, trans, high or bush companies are also dealing with this decline in sales. Bud wise or Bud heavy sales have fallen 11.4%, the weekend being April 29th and 9.7% weekend, he may 6th, Niccolo, Baltra fell 4.3%, 2.9% respectively. Nadi Light has fallen 5.2% and 2.5% respectively. So all of those companies are feeling that downstream effects of Bud Light and they continue to lose ground. Though, at least for them, it seems to be leveling off for Bud Light. Not only are they losing sales massively, it's still getting worse. It shows no sign of letting up. Conservatives are showing no sign of giving up. Bud Light is not the only company going pro-trans. Obviously, we'll get to Starbucks India in just a moment. But this is a message. This to me feels a little bit different than other times that conservatives have pushed back a little bit against the culture. And the reason for that is that conservatives are keeping it up. I think Bud Light is just kind of done. Bud Light could fix it, of course. Bud Light, if the CEO came out and just apologized and said, sorry, we don't support the trans stuff. It's obviously a false anthropology. Sorry to offend you guys. Please buy our product again. We're going to put John Wayne on the can. Forget about Dylan Mulvaney. We'll put John Wayne on the can. I think people would go back and buy it. But Bud Light can't do it. This is the point that I was making with ESG and DEI and the international institutions like Garm that are partnered with the World Economic Forum, that are partnered with all of the Woke asset managers that are investing on the basis, not just of what is going to increase profits to shareholders, and not just what's going to please customers, but what is going to appease the radicals who are writing these ideological prescriptions for businesses. Bud Light is caught between Iraq and a hard place. Because the more they appease the radicals who write the rules for the industry and for their company, the less the customers are going to like it. The more the customers like their product, the less the Woke-minded investors are going to like the product. So what are they going to do? They can't apologize. If they could, they would have by now. But they feel that they cannot. The other thing that's really great about the story and people aren't focusing on it too much is how much this has damaged the Dylan Mulvaney brand. Yes, he's still getting partnerships. Yes, he's still getting sponsorships. But I think companies are going to think twice now. If one picture of this dude on one can of Bud Light was able to destroy the most popular beer in America, and conservatives are not giving up on it, that is going to make maybe not makeup companies, maybe not niche companies, but that is going to make normal big mainstream companies think twice before giving that guy any attention or any money. And that is a very, very good thing. We need to make this ideology. Well, it's not that we need to make it toxic for advertisers. It is a toxic ideology. We just need to demonstrate. We need to get it through the skulls of the advertising executives to see how toxic the ideology of transgenderism really is. Speaking of the relationship between leftism and business, Elon Musk continues to speak more and more clearly on political issues. He is going after George Soros, who is one of the biggest funders of leftist causes. And he's one of the clearest and most coherent in his radicalism. And because he's such a big hedge fund guy, he's able to fund a lot of those issues. Not just a few bucks to Joe Biden here and there, but funding for instance, a plan to install radical DAs in major American cities and then not prosecute crime really clever, really effective kind of left wing activism. So because he's so effective and because he's got such deep pockets, and because he's so radical, the libs hate it when we call him out. Elon doesn't care. Elon's going after George Soros and the liberal establishment, the guys on CNBC, they're begging him. They're saying, please, Elon, please stop talking about George Soros. We don't, we don't, we can't allow you to do that. You tweeted this thing about George Soros. I'm looking for it because I want to make sure I quoted properly. But I mean, you know what you wrote, but you basically reminds me of my dados is like, calm down people. This is not like me to pick a piece out of me. You also know, you said he wants to wrote the very fabric of civilization and Soros hates humanity. Like when you do something like that, do you think about it? That's true. That's my opinion. Okay. But why share it? Why share it? Especially, I mean, why share it when people who buy Teslas may not agree with you, advertisers on Twitter may not agree with you. Why not just say, Hey, I think this, you can tell me we can talk about it over there. You can tell your friends, but why share it widely? I mean, this is freedom of speech. I'm allowed to say what I would absolutely are, but I'm trying to understand why you do because you have to know it's got to there. It puts you in the middle of the partisan divide in the country. It makes you a lightning rod for criticism. I mean, do you like that? I, you know, people today saying he's an anti-Semite. I don't think you are. No, I'm definitely I'm like, I'm like a pro-Semite, if anything. That's a threat. Notice it's not an argument. It's not that the liberal establishment typified by that and as a or a CNBC guy, they're not saying, well, here's where you were wrong on the facts, Elon, or actually George Soros doesn't fund any left wing causes or actually fact check. Here, you know, it's not, it's not an argument. The guy's admitting, yeah, okay, fine. Your points might be true, but why say it? Why are you saying it? Hmm, some investors might not like it if you say that. Oh, Elon, now look, maybe it's true, but some advertisers might not like that. They, actually, you know what they might do. Now, I would never do this, Elon. Not me. Look, I'm your buddy, Elon, but they might call you an anti-Semite if you keep talking out about the guys who fund all the liberal causes. You might anti-Semite. Where'd you get anti-Semite from? They might call you a racist, Elon. They might call you a bigot because in America, the worst thing that you can be called is a racist. Anti-Semitism is one shade of racism. And George Soros is Jewish, so he said, well, that's the way we're going to do it. If George Soros, if the big funder of this particular kind of radicalism were black, you would have said, we wouldn't want to be called an anti-black racist, would you? Or if it doesn't even have to necessarily be about race. If the big funder were homosexual, you wouldn't want to be called homophobe, would you? If the big funder were transvestite, you wouldn't want to be called a transphobe. It's just a threat. There's no argument here. He's not saying, Elon, you're wrong on the points. He's saying, shut up, or we will ruin your business and take all your money away. And Elon, to his credit, says, okay, do your worst. See, you just don't care. You want to share what you have to say. I'll say what I want to say, and if the consequence of that is losing money, so be it. Okay. Great answer. First of all, just tactically, I think this is a great answer even to preserve his wealth because it shows confidence. It shows leadership. It shows a clear vision. It shows this guy's not going to be bullied by some cable news anchor, certainly. So tactically, I think that's very effective, just from a business standpoint. But at a deeper level, Elon is totally right. What Elon is saying here is, look, I'm the richest guy in the world. I've got all this power. I now own one of the companies that controls speech in the public square. I'm a powerful guy. And you're all threatening me and you're saying, if I don't tow the line, then you're going to try to take some of my money away. Well, if I tow the line and I don't wield my influence, and I don't get to say the basic things that I want to say, then what's it all for? Oh, I'm the richest guy in the world. But if I don't have the ability to state my own perfectly normal opinion, perfectly accurate opinion, as even the cable news has seems to insinuate when he doesn't contradict him or refute him. If I don't have that right, then what good is all this money? What good is all this power if I can't actually wield it? Now, one great use of your money would be to go get some good ranchers today.

Speaking of money, people who don't have money are being encouraged to kill themselves in Canada. New poll out. This is a result of the National Post poll in Canada. It shows that 28% of Canadians approve of assisted suicide for homeless people. A fifth of respondents said that medical assistance in dying, which is the real clinical jargony way of saying assisted suicide, should be offered as an option to anyone regardless of medical or psychological condition, but then a greater number than that. Not quite a third, but getting pretty close said that homeless people should be permitted to kill themselves. This always happens. I guess the theme of the show today is the slippery slope, which is always right. You will hear philosophers and you will hear social scientists and you'll hear politicians say, oh, please, please stop making those silly slippery slope arguments. Why? I can barely make a slippery slope argument right now because the wind is going so fast in my face. Wind's going through my hair. I'm going down that slide so fast. This always happens. This is what happened in the Netherlands in the Netherlands when they legalized medical assistance in dying, known as killing troubled people. We were told this is only for a handful of people. It's just for a handful of very, very old people who are going to die within weeks, days, hours, and they're in such terrible pain. And I know we have palliative care, but let's forget that for a second. That's not going to help my argument. We, these people, they're begging to be released from their pain, please, as a compassionate person, you have to allow them and respect their choice. Okay, this convinced a lot of people who didn't think too broadly about the issue. We'll never open this up to a and then slowly the age requirements started being lowered. The medical requirements started being lowered. All of a sudden people with depression, just depression, not terminal cancer, deeply painful, going to kill you in three days. No, no, just a little bit depressed. You could kill yourself. Then it came for children, children under the age of 12. Then it came for the handicapped, the disabled. Then it came for the mentally ill. Then in the Netherlands, there was a woman who had at an earlier stage consented to dying. Then a doctor came to her and said, okay, you ready to die? Now that it's been a while, your condition has progressed. So I think it's time for you to die. The woman said not yet. Then the doctor said, nope, now's the time. He secretly slipped her and, not an abortion. Another way of dying, a suicide pill in her coffee. She realized what was happening. She said, spit it out, was fighting, was fighting back. Her family ended up holding her down as the rest of the murder continued. In Canada now, 3.3% of Canadians die by assisted suicide. That's up in just one year. That's up by almost 50% from something like 2.4%. You've seen this now in the United States, you're always falling down the slippery slope. Now we're just going to kill the homeless. Now we're just going to kill the people who are inconvenient. They're a little bit of a burden. Oh, do you really? You've got to go visit Granny on Saturday. Can we just get this over with? That's what happens. That's what happens to a society that doesn't have a principle to hold on to. Something tangible. To bring it back to the marriage example, if marriage is a discrete thing, if marriage is the union of a man and a woman for the sake of the generation and education of children, if marriage is what it has always been, then we have marriage. But if we can just pull away at that bedrock moral anthropological principle, then marriage can be whatever the radicals want it to be. If we can pull away at the commandment, thou shalt not commit murder. If we can pull away at the aspect of natural law, which tells us about our obvious right and inclination to preserve ourselves, the radicals can redefine whatever they want. Speaking of homeless people, people seeking new homes, the numbers are in on Biden's migrant surge. And according to Alejandro Mayorkas and the DHS, there was a record inflow on May 17th. During the month, during all of this time, we've got 137,374 migrants admitted. And then, on top of that, you had roughly 40,000 new migrants through the border in the days just before May 11th, the April inflow exceeded 135,211 migrants who were admitted in April of 2022. Compare that all to Donald Trump. You see, the numbers going up under Biden, especially in the last couple of weeks. But what does that mean? Is it up 5%, 10%, 20%? Joe Biden's April 2023 inflow is 87 times as many migrants as were admitted into the country on Trump's watch in April 2020. It's not 20% higher, 50% higher, 100% higher, 200% higher, 300%, 400%, 500%. It's 87 times higher. Since January of 2021, when Joe Biden took office, the Biden administration has admitted roughly 4.5 million migrants across the southern border. We lose sight of the scale of this stuff. So we think, okay, the libs get elected and things get a little bit worse, the conservatives get elected, things get a little bit better. That totally denies the radical difference in scale. There's a difference in degree to the migration problem that almost seems to be a difference in kind. If you're talking about 87 times the number of people, that's very, very different. Joe Biden gets elected, we don't have a border. Donald Trump gets elected, we overturn Roe v. Wade and save hundreds of thousands of babies' lives per year. Those are very significant differences. In the past, it used to be, okay, one guy's got a red tie, one guy's got a blue tie. Whoever gets elected, nothing really changes all that much. But we're living in a much more polarized time. We're living in a time when people don't know what marriage is, when people don't know what an American is, when people don't know what men and women are. And so just necessarily, the swings that are going to occur when one party gets elected or the other party gets elected are going to be much, much greater. Even with the bureaucracy and other power centers in our society not shifting based on those elections, even though it's just the elected government and some of the appointed officials who shift, the less your society agrees on basic stuff, the wider the swings are going to be and the less social order and stability you are going to have. Speaking of lawlessness, the Supreme Court right now is going to determine the fate of the abortion pill in the US. Here is what New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy has to say about the prospect of regulating a pill that kills babies. If you get a bulk, a bulk order of mythopristone, would you be then prescribing it out in defiance of the Supreme Court? To be determined. But when I say everything is on the table, Katie, I mean that. I think this is going to cost this action generally, whether it's mythopristone or whether it's North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, by the way, it's six weeks. My wife and I don't think that we knew we were pregnant with any of our four kids at six weeks. So people need to understand that. But this is going to cost people's lives. It's going to cost them health. It's also going to cost people's lives, women in particular, sadly. So if that's what's at stake, we'll do whatever it takes to save lives. People's lives obviously are at stake when we're talking about a drug that kills babies. People's lives are always at stake when women take drugs that can kill their babies. That's why it's being litigated. So it's not actually at the level of the Supreme Court yet. It's now just being litigated before federal court in Louisiana. It seems like it's going to make it all the way up there. And what does the New Jersey governor say? The New Jersey governor says, okay, let's say that in the future, the Supreme Court makes its decision. Let's see them enforce it. What the New Jersey governor is saying is I will engage in an insurrection. That's what I mean. What's an insurrection? Insurrection is a violent uprising against the established political order. And what this guy is talking about is violent because the very act of taking this drug involves killing somebody, killing the type of person who is the most innocent person in society, a little tiny baby. That's what the libs are saying. That's a different kind of insurrection than the one we saw on January 6th. Sorry. And you're a sixth, the worst day in the history of our country. Because on that day, which we're told it's the most violent, horrific blood soaked day in history, on that day, some guy from Florida took a selfie sipping a corps light in the Capitol Rotunda and another guy waved at a camera while holding Nancy Pelosi's lecture. And the only person who was killed was one of the Trump supporters killed by a trigger happy cop. And in this case, we're talking about the governor of New Jersey saying that the Supreme Court of the United States can go to hell. They're going to keep killing babies willy nilly sent in the feds. The insurrection much, much more intense on the liberal side as it always is as we saw during BLM as we see with leftist violence around the country. That is not conducive to civil order and political flourishing. But we know this speaking of political lawlessness. What did we get this week? We got the Durham investigation, which shows that not only was there no basis for the government to spy on Donald Trump's presidential campaign, not only was there no basis for the entire liberal establishment, including the media, to go after Trump has a Putin stooge for years and years and try to undermine his, not only his election, but also his presidential administration. But we found out this week that the CIA director was in on it. The FBI director was in on it. The vice president was in on it. The vice president who is now the president of the United States, Joe Biden and the president himself, Barack Obama, they were all in on it. So one of the top dog Democrats to push the Russia nonsense was this guy, Adam Schiff, this congressman from California. Here I am in California right now in New Salini's hellscape. Adam Schiff, maybe not even so far down the street. And what is his answer on being shown to be a complete liar on the Russia hoax? Here's what he has to say. This is an investigation that started in a flawed manner. It was conducted in a flawed manner. And its conclusion is a flawed conclusion. It began a flawed way because this was the result of Donald Trump badgering Bill Barr who investigate the investigators. So it was brought really with no predicate except this is what Donald Trump was demanding. And this is what Bill Barr wanted to have undertaken. So we have four years of wasted effort. And worse than that, we have four years I think of undermining the department in a political prosecution. Adam Schiff, I don't think he is Italian, but he's clearly learned a lesson from those New York Italians on the other side of the country. Deny till you die. That's that's his answer. Um, congressman Schiff, what do you make of the fact that this long years long investigation into the origins of the of the Russia investigation showed that it was all fake and it was all cooked up. And we have on the record the biggest leaders in your party and in the government cooking it all up. Um, I suppose my answer to that would be la la la la. Can't hear you. La la la la la. That's his answer. His answer. Oh, the invent this special counsel investigation. Yeah, that was it was always flawed. It's fake. Don't look here. Nothing to see here. Move along and move along. And this is actually the best shot that Democrats have. I think I'm getting past the Durham report. The best shot they have. The best shot they have of maintaining their political influence and not seeing the pendulum shift back a little bit is just to say, Oh yeah, it's fake. That Durham report. Yeah, no, it's fake. You're on John Durham. He's bad. Don't trust him. It's all no. Don't don't believe your lying eyes. They can't apologize. They actually can apologize. According to their premises in politics. And the reason they can't apologize is because apologies and grace presuppose a shared theology. If we had a shared religious view in the United States as we had from our founding long before the 1776 founding up through just a few decades ago, if we had that shared religion, a politician could come out and say, Hey, I'm sorry. I got this wrong. Please forgive me. I'll try to do better next time. And the politician would have had a shot of surviving. We now live in an age where much of the country views itself as post-Christian, which there's no such thing as post-Christian. That just means not Christian. And so in that kind of culture, there is no grace. There is no mercy. There is no forgiveness. Adam Schiff knows if he admits that he was wrong anyway, he's done. He's toast. It's like Kevin Spacy. It's like any of the Me Too movement people. The ones who in any way acknowledge that they did something wrong, which is, I don't know, every single person in Hollywood. But the ones who admitted that, their careers were over. And the ones who just stuck by their story and they denied, they're the ones who got to survive. Give you a little tease for tomorrow because I want to get to the most important story, which is Starbucks, India, Transing, everybody. But just a little tease, we got some polls out on 2024. President Kofefe, who we were told could never possibly win reelection. Donald Trump, he's just going to drive us all off a cliff. His numbers are looking pretty great. I just leave it there with that because I want to get to a much more important story than who is the president of the United States. I want to get to Transvestites in India. My favorite comment yesterday is from K2BNY, who says, I thought the Lib's favorite talking point was incoherent screaming. It is, you're right. The most articulate spokesman for the Libs in recent years was that lady right after Trump got elected the first time who was staring at the sky and she was screaming, no, no. So you're right. That is their favorite talking point. Okay, Starbucks, what are you selling me? We got a dad. He's calling his son Arpit. He's looking kind of irritated. He's mama. He's smart with some atona. He's listening. Don't get angry this time, please. And in walks a woman. Wait a second, that woman looks a little weird. That woman kind of looks like that dude that the dad was just calling. And then the wait a second, that woman. She's got kind of broad shoulders. I know, but I'll be there. I know it's been years. But you still mean the world to me. And then dad is there. Even if his son's wearing a dress. Do you want coffee? Three coffees for Arpit. Arpit is the man's name, you see. But Arpit is the girl's name. And the dad says for me, you're still my kid. Only a letter has got added to your name. Some got subtracted to, by the way. That's the that's the grizzlier part. Letter was added. So we had one letter added and then we had some other body parts subtracted. So on the whole same person. Okay. Okay. Starbucks, India. I'd be curious to see what kind of commercial Starbucks Pakistan is putting out. Do you think Starbucks, Pakistan is putting out the pro-trans commercials? I'm a little bit skeptical. But in the West and in more pro-Western countries, even in the subcontinent, in India, you see this pro-trans propaganda. The most jarring part of this commercial to me is this man who now thinks he's a woman saying, hey, dad, I know it's been years. I know it's been years. What does that mean? Does it mean this guy hasn't talked to his father for years? I don't care what dress you're wearing or what delusions you're entertaining. That's wrong. That's not a nice thing to do. It's not a nice thing to just not talk to your father for years. So the father here, you really feel for the guy because he's sitting there. His son is engaging in bizarre, deviant, and destructive sexual behavior. But he loves his son and he wants to have a relationship with his son. So he says, okay, I guess I have to lie. I guess the only option I'm left with right now that this culture is leaving me with is I've got to just lie and go tell the barista to get me three coffees for Arpita. Okay, and now I lied and now my son will accept me again and now we can all sit and talk. It is so sad. It reminds me of that clip from Family Guy where Quagmire's dad is a transvestite and he's sitting in a bar and the bartender comes up and says, excuse me, ma'am, you can't look at pornography on your phone at the bar. It's just there. He's just watching porn at the bar. So you can't do that. We don't allow that at this bar. And then Quagmire's dad who is dressed like a woman, he says, no, no, you don't understand. I'm trans. And then the bartender says, oh, okay, in that case, do whatever you want. You can just do whatever you want and you'll never be held accountable for anything because you have a delusional perception of yourself. Okay, that's fine. That's where we are as though if you can claim this defective perception, then you can get away with anything and get away with murder. Okay. In the eyes of the media, you literally can get away with murder. That seems wrong, doesn't it? In the old culture, what we would have done is we would have said, hey, Arpita, no, you're a man. And no, I know you're doing bad things and you've done some bad things in part because of your defective perception. So we're going to fix your perception. And in our modern culture, what do we do? We say, if you want to be a good person, you want to get along in society at all, you want to be allowed to function even according to the law. You just have to lie. Write Arpita in the cup of coffee and then you're fine. Also in more trans pop culture news, because even as the people recoil against transgenderism, even as Pew Research shows that 60% of Americans recognize the transgenderism is fake, even as Bud Light continues to lose market cap and sales. Even still, companies are peddling transgenderism because the ideologues who hold on to the purse strings, they continue to push it. Now for a pride ad, some dudes are modeling women's bathing suits for Adidas. Okay, you get the picture. We don't need to see anymore. I've seen enough. I've seen enough. I'm not even totally opposed, in theory, to men wearing bathing suits that look somewhat like this because that's what men did in the 1920s in really old timey beach bathing suits. But they shouldn't be wearing these kind of thong like bathing suits, like full body bathing suits, like the Burkini almost, but for men. I could understand that. That's not what's going on here. The suits are stylized to be as womanly as possible. And then the dudes who are being picked to model them are fairly masculine. These are intentionally masculine looking dudes. And it's just to shove it in your face. It's just to beat you down into submission. The purpose of these commercials is not as the transgenderists would pretend to convince you that these dudes are actually chicks. The purpose of these commercials is to shove right in your face that these are dudes. They are so obviously dudes and to force you to lie. Then they say this is all for Pride Month. Here we go. We got another month. I told you, you know, I hate to say I told you so. You know those slippery slope fallacies are always so fallacious. But what happened? Back when Pride Day was a day, we all said, you know, this is going to spread. And then Pride Day became Pride Week and then Pride Week became Pride Month and that was the month of June. But June wasn't enough. So then the LGBT element of the people, they took October. October became LGBT History Month. So now that meant that the LGBT movement had one sixth of the calendar year. But I don't know if you've checked your calendars recently. It's not June yet. It's May. It's mid May. And we're already seeing all of the Pride stuff, which means that the LGBT element of Pete, they have colonized one quarter of the year and they are showing no signs of stopping. We are headed toward Pride year. We are headed toward Pride perpetuity. That's where we are. Get your bathing suits ready, fellows. Now we've got a lot more show coming up. But this is only for the creme de la creme. This is only for the inner circle of people, not you whoi puloy out there on YouTube and elsewhere. This is for the people who are daily wire members.
