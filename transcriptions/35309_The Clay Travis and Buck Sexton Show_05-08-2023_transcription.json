Welcome in everybody. Third hour of the clay Travis and bucks Xt and show kicks off right now. Clay's on vacation with the family. He popped in earlier in the show to weigh in on the election 2020 Jack Smith indictment against Trump, which we've been spending most of the show talking about. We have Julie, Julie Kelly joining us at the bottom of this hour to give her thoughts on how this is going to go. And specifically, who is this judge who is going to be dealing with this with the Trump indictment? What do we know about the judicial process that J six prisoners have received or J six defendants? I should say now prisoners, many of them have received, including from this judge and give us a sense as to how this is all going to be structured. This ongoing legal ambush of Donald Trump to subvert the 2024 election. I think we have to use that language. This is preemptively denying the American people a level playing field, a free and fair and open choice as to whom they who they want to be the president of the United States starting in 2024. They didn't even wait to see if they could beat Trump and then come up with some lies to why it didn't really happen. Like with Russia collusion, now they're going early. Now they're pulling out all the stops before we even see what the people would want because they know that there's a risk here for them. They know that Joe Biden is a feeble president in every sense and the Democrat promise of unity and prosperity. And these are the get the shot or you lose your job people in this White House. They've been a nightmare. They're a disaster. And there's I think a growing recognition of just how absurd it would be for Joe Biden to get four more years in office. I would hope that there's that recognition. But absurdity is the water in which the modern Democrats swims. This is how they operate. This is who they are. And let me let me tell you, it's hard to think of a more a more clear manifestation of this than they had this. I think he's a presidential historian. They love to find these left wing historians who then sit there and they say, well, I wrote a biography of, you know, Rutherford B. Hayes. And so now everybody has to listen to my every word about politics in America, 2023. Really? Not not sure that's how I feel. Not sure I care. But nonetheless, over at MSNBC, they have to get that audience as frenzied about this indictment as they possibly can. And that brings me to this comparison of January 6 to you ready for it? 9 11 Osama bin Laden and Pearl Harbor and Donald Trump is in this instance, kind of like Osama, a threat to America. Play it. Pearl Harbor, 1941, we were bombed. Our system was very much in danger. Our democracy, many people were getting it up and saying that, you know, the democracy had seen its last days. 9 11 2001, Osama bin Laden and other terrorists hated our democracy, try to destroy it. You see where I'm going. What we see in this indictment is that on January 6, 2021, Donald Trump, just like those other threats to American democracy, tried to destroy our system to take away our rule of law, came very close to doing it, to take away our system of elections, to take away our tradition of peaceful transfer of power to a new elected president. It almost happened. This is somebody on television over at MSNBC with morning Joe and Joe's like, yeah, that's right. More hairspray. That's right. He's telling everybody that this is best loss that Donald Trump is a threat similar to in the totality of threats toward democracy going back over a hundred years. He's saying that Donald Trump is in the same line of threat as the Japanese at Pearl Harbor. And remember, the Japanese plan was to knock out the Pacific Fleet and then continue and they allied with Nazi Germany and they declared war on us and global domination. There were submarines off the coast of California like they were coming for us folks. It wasn't just, you know, we're going to do this thing and then we're all going to know they were trying to be part of the Third Reich's plan of global domination. They became part of it. And fortunately, you know, thank you United States Armed Forces. And Japan was unsuccessful in that goal. But wow, Pearl Harbor, really? A couple of thousand Americans died in one day in a sneak attack, a day that does live in infamy. And then Osama bin Laden. Now that's one that I remember. I remember watching in real time as the towers fell. I remember thinking to myself, I have to get into this fight somehow. It is why I joined the CIA Osama bin Laden and his his circle in al Qaeda wanted to get their hands on chemical and biological weapons, wanted to get their hands on a nuclear weapon to destroy an American city. This person is going on television comparing Donald Trump to Osama bin Laden as a threat to this country and the audience is clapping. And the hosts are, you know, are just grinning and oh, yes, look at this scholar. It's just like bin Laden. bin Laden had his maniacs fly planes into buildings, killed almost 3000 in a day and wanted to continue. There were more. I was in the CIA's counter terrorism center. There were all kinds of plots, more planes to take down, more terrorist attacks. A lot of them did happen, but a lot of them were defeated in advance, wanted to destroy our society by any means possible. There's been happy to kill millions of us if he could have bin Laden and and Zawa here in the rest of the world. And this guy's comparing and but then we're going to have over to see an untrump is beyond the pale. Look what he said in this truth, social post Trump is beyond the pale. They're comparing Trump to bin Laden. They've compared him to Hitler. They need to get a grip. They are in the grips of mass hysteria. This has now become the great Democrat delusion. This self propagating myth that Donald Trump is this horrifying threat to the future of the country when about half the country is like, actually did a good job. And some people say did an amazing job, but people say did a good job. I voted for him again and I can assure you I would not vote for. I would not have voted for bin Laden as president for heaven's sake. So what's with these crazy comparisons? Because they have to find a way to justify emotionally, psychologically and politically the extreme nature of what they have done. At some level, there has to be a recognition. They're the ones who have done the crazy unprecedented things here. Now multiple times over indicting a leading presidential candidate and also list the fact that he's a former president shouldn't be lost on all of us either in this or shouldn't be lost in the conversation. We don't do this because what we never want to have is a system and this I've been in. I've been deployed to. I've been in countries where this is the case. You lose that election. You're going to prison. You defy the regime and run against them in an election. You're going to prison. Once that happens, it's all over folks because the the checks and balances the the laws that are in place, the existence of the rules that are supposed to give us common principles and common ground to come together. All of that. All of that just fades away. It turns into might makes right. It turns into whatever we want. We have the power to do. That's before we shall do because here's the question and like I said, we'll talk to Julie Kelly about some of this coming up in a few minutes. Here's the part of this that I want anyone who is who is skeptical of the gravity of this moment for our legal system, for our political system and for our country, meaning the prosecution of Trump with this multiple now multiple indictments. You think they're going to stop at Trump? This is the part of it that I this is why I keep going back in history to show. This is why I rattle off these names. Bob McDonald, Chris Christie, Scott Walker, Rick Perry. I mean, there's others I can't even think of. Ted Stevens, I said before they criminalize politics. They've been growing in boldness to do this over a number of years, goes back to the Bush administration. They said it really started with the special counsel, witch hunt of the leaked name. They knew it was like the no was an accident. No crime. Oh, but let's just try to get people in the White House locked up for it anyway. Then we'll make movies, horrible movies about this is preposterous. That was a what was that special counsel, Pat Fitzgerald, right? Look at that guy's record. That's what he does. He goes after he goes after people. Goes after people for political reasons. So I bring all that up, not just to show you the progression, but now to get to what comes next. They've done this to Trump. Does anyone believe go look at when Ron DeSantis was surging? It was months ago, I know, but when he was surging in the polls, when it looked like he may be a real challenge in this primary to Trump, you started to see these articles that say, Oh, Ron DeSantis is an even bigger threat than Donald Trump is. Do you think that was going to go away? I mean, if let's just say in an alternate, alternate universe here, you know, DeSantis was at 55% right now. Do you think that you think the Democrats would be saying, Oh gosh, you know, we have a more more mainstream politician that we can, you know, we can work with this guy. No, they'd be saying, Oh my gosh, you know, he's a, he's a white nationalist. He's horrible. He's worse, a more effective fascist than Trump. They were preparing that. Why does it matter? Because the precedent of going after Trump in this way is going to be used again. Why does it matter? Because when they say on MSNBC that Trump is in the same league as bin Laden as threats to this country and they're not horribly embarrassed. I mean, you know, morning Joe and Mika should resign, but they, you know, it's not going to happen. They'll never do that. They think they're amazing. Uh, if they can say that and not feel so foolish and not feel so humiliated that there's a extreme embarrassment and an apology afterwards, which they think that they did a great job. What makes you think that this is going to end with Trump? And this is why when Trump has said it resonates with so many people, you think they're coming for me speaking as Trump. But really I'm just standing between them and you. That's true of future Republican presidential contenders. As I've said, and I've, I've been ringing the alarm about this before I teamed up with Clay on my own show, I was ringing the alarm about this for years. They are weaponizing the law for purposes of political power. And I can take you through this. Is there a Democrat progression that's similar? No, in fact, what you see is the opposite, which is the abandonment of the rule of law to help Democrats stay in office or to win elections, whether it's Hillary Clinton or Hunter Biden recently or I could sit here. If I gave it five minutes thought I'd come with all kinds of cases or Democrats, you know, they get away with it. They get away with it. Bill Clinton got away with it. The Clinton foundation with Hill, Hillary and Bill, they got away with it. So my friends, this is a very serious moment for the country. And it's just the beginning. I can't say we're going to wake up tomorrow and this nightmare is over. This is just starting. But I do think that what this has shown and what everyone can see from it, if they think it through clearly, this is the beginning of a new era of wielding power in this country for a winner take all burn it all to the ground as long as we are in charge approach. That's what these indictments against Trump represent. And you know, I know the people that are coming out and speaking out against this, some illegal experts that we've had on the show, if they thought that Donald Trump had done something egregious and broken the law in doing so, they would say so. But instead, the people that I respect most on the right who are the most well versed in constitutional law and just in federal statute are saying, this is a legal abomination. And that is what we have to remember as we go forward here. And now we can look at whether we're able to actually win still, which is a big question, Mark. Vivek Ramaswami is in Nashville. And I believe he is holding a press conference as we speak about the transgender terrorist manifesto from the Nashville Covenant school shooting. So I agree with Vivek that this should be released. Many of you know, I've been saying this from the beginning. I've also said that they will hide this and everywhere they can. We'll come back to that in a moment. And also we have Julie Kelly with us to get into some of the what comes next after this indictment. That's what I really want to focus on with her.

So Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is in Nashville today. He has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice to well he says that they have failed to substantively respond to a FOIA request that he filed in June. That's one part of this. And he is also the FOIA request has to do with the Biden White House and also its its communications with Merrick Garland. It basically did Biden tell Garland go get Trump. I mean that's really what the boys about. But also he's talking about the release of the Nashville terrorist manifesto of that trans shooter. We all remember that horrible day when that story happened here is Vivek play 25 governor Bill Lee, the governor of this state pledged to release that manifesto yet today we're sitting here in August with nothing other than stone walled silence from our government. That is wrong. That does not build public trust that erodes public trust. I'm here today to make a demand of the governor of Tennessee to make a demand of the Nashville Police Department to make a demand of the FBI release the manifesto. Speak the truth. Speak the manifesto. I've been saying it for months as well. I completely agree with this and it goes to the obvious politics of this and why it has not been released. Look, I'm sure there is likely stuff in there that is beyond horrific. And there are things that might be very difficult for people, especially who were close to or affected by that terrorist attack in Nashville or in the Nashville area that would be very difficult for them to hear about, read about. I understand that, but the public has a right to know and what was the ideology of that shooter, the ideological disposition because we know that for every other match. And we all understand why they're holding back on this one.

And you should check out her sub stack, which Julie, what is the name of the sub stack again? Hey, Buck, it is declassified with Julie Kelly. There you go. It's like excellent sub stack. I highly recommend. So Julie. Yes, we've had you on for the, you told us so a few times and yes, you told us not only would Trump be indicted, but that it would be specifically an indictment related to election 2020 and January 6th. Were you surprised at all by the charges? I mean, I mean the specific charges, not that there were any. Right. Exactly. No, I wasn't. You know, a three out of the four were mentioned in the January 6th Select Committee report. I also suspected that obstruction of an official proceeding that 1512 C2 would be the top charge. It was actually the third charge, not that it matters. That is most common felony for January 6th, more than 300 defendants slapped with that felony. So I wasn't really surprised, but I have to admit, Buck, I was really surprised at how just sloppy and juvenile the indictment was. Basically, for the most part, a cut and paste job from the January 6th Select Committee. I mean, I think DOJ and Jax Smith should be embarrassed by the document that they filed yesterday. Yeah, to me, I said on Twitter and then today on the show, it's like a monologue you'd expect on MSNBC. I mean, that's it reads like, huh, and then, and he didn't even believe the thing he said to his lawyers, like, how do you know that? And what are you saying? And the whole thing just feels like it falls apart with any honest scrutiny. But now let's kind of get into, you know, there's, there's what's fair and right. And there's what's happening, right, Julie? And when it comes to this get Trump operation, we can't lose sight of the latter is in what they're doing to him and how this is going to play out. For example, on the obstruction of official proceeding, they have sent other J six defendants to real prison terms based on that, as I understand it. Is that right? Oh, they absolutely have. I mean, the most infamous defendant is the course Jacob Chansley, the QAnon shaman. And keep in mind, it not only prisons sentences after a plea agreement or conviction at trial, they have held these judges have held some defendants in pre-trial detention, meaning denying them bail because they were charged with obstruction and a few other misdemeanors. I mean, Jacob Chansley was not charged with assaulting a police officer vandalizing property directly. We saw him on video walking around in numerous instances with police right nearby. But they denied Jacob Chansley's bail. And finally, after 10 months in base solitary confinement, Jacob Chansley was tormented into pleading guilty for obstruction, then sentenced to 41 months in prison. So is that a guilty conviction can land somewhere anywhere between three and five years in jail, but also be the basis for pre-trial detention? And so will Jack Smith ask that? I know you and I have talked about that. I have a column up kind of detailing a major court decision and then recent case law that could justify that. But I guess we'll find out later today or tomorrow when Trump is reigned. But this is not the only indictment that's coming down in this matter, Buck. There will be superseding indictments. There will. And lastly, yeah, absolutely. And I think people should still prepare for a possible seditious conspiracy indictment with Trump and the co-conspirators were named cited in the indictment yesterday. We're speaking to Julie Kelly, declassified as her sub-stack. Julie, when you just said before, they may try to get a pre-trial detainment of Donald Trump. I think the first instinct that I have and everyone else listening has is that's crazy. And then it might kick in. The thought might come into our minds of, oh, but the judge in this case is about as anti-Trump as could be, right? I mean, like walk us through what we should expect with, because right, it would be up to the judge. And this judge, not a Trump voter from what it seems. Not a Trump fan at all. In fact, you'd be hard pressed with the exception of barrel Howell to have a worst judge, worst judge than Tanya Chutkin. I almost fell off my chair when I saw her initials at the top of that indictment because I and I tweeted, you probably saw Trump is doomed. Not only did she author the ruling that forced Donald Trump to produce all of his records to the January 6 committee denying him executive privilege, she is the toughest judge when it comes to handing down sentences for January 6. In fact, in a few occasions, she has sentenced J6 or to more prison time than what the DOJ has asked for. And I'll tell you what, Buck, I was in her courtroom a few months ago, an empty courtroom, of course, with a defendant who was convicted of four of the four common misdemeanors. He was inside the building for 11 minutes. She spent 15 minutes berating this man over what trespassing at the Capitol. She also berated him for choosing to move forward with the jury trial rather than pleading guilty because that wasted all sorts of resources apparently. Because most defendants who get her assigned as a judge, they plead out because they know how tough she is. And you could just sense, I was watching her, and you could just sense she was so condescending. You could just feel the contempt that she had for this man who committed no violent crime. And so this is what Donald Trump is up against. And getting time you chucked in as a judge was probably worse news than the indictment itself. Wow. OK, so this then brings me to the next part of this. You know, we had Andy on Andy McCarthy before, and I was asking about the timing here. You know, Clay has thought all along that I that they were going to be able to delay these trials to the left election. I keep telling Clay they're not bringing these trials to delay them, my friend. Like this is not going to happen. They're meaning the system won't. Yes, under normal, a normal regime, you should be there should be delays and challenges. But if they're going to ram it through, they're going to ram it through and clearly they want to do this before the election. So let's just assume I asked Andy the same thing. He said, I don't know. I mean, they might try to get this one probably before the election. If he's got the worst judge, he could possibly have or close to it. I think you said probably number two. And a jury pool that is comprised of the most high concentration of anti-Trump individuals everyday citizens in the country. What happens here? People keep asking me, can Trump go to prison? Are they really going to try to do that? Well, look, I sort of agree with Clay and I just told Meghan Kelly this as well. I don't see either one of these cases going to trial before the election. Most importantly, Jack Smith does not want the class by documents case to go to trial. It's a joke. There is nothing there. And they are trying desperately to withhold these alleged class by documents, even from Donald Trump, under these crazy protective orders. And furthermore, they have a very tough judge who has got DOJ's number, Judge Alien Cannon in Southern Florida. And she is not putting up with any bad behavior from DOJ. They don't want that case to go to trial. This would be really hard pressed a case of this magnitude to go to trial that quickly. For example, the Proud Boys trial, the seditious conspiracy, it was almost two years after the defendants were first arrested and charged and then a year later charged with seditious conspiracy. So it would be really hard, just in a normal circumstance, to put Trump's January 6 case to trial before the election. But as I said, Jack Smith is going to continue to supersede indict this original indictment. He's going to add charges. He's going to add co-defendants, which then sets the speedy trial act clock backwards to the very beginning. So I don't think he wants either one to go to trial before the election. He wants death by a thousand cuts because you could see how no matter what kind of bad news comes out about the Biden family crime racket or anything of the Democrats, this is going to be a great way for Jack Smith and the DOJ to use this as a ruse to pivot away deflect attention from what's happening with the Democrats. So then what I take from you is you think your assessment at this point and your assessment was they were going to indict him a whole bunch. So here we are. Your assessment going forward is they're bringing this is effectively the dirtiest political campaign in history, hijacking the DOJ to do it. Meaning they're not actually likely to lock him up in a cell before the election or even get to that point where they could through a trial. But by bringing all this stuff, they muddy him up and they create this whole Trump is a criminal narrative that they're going to run on. Is that about right? Oh, yes. Absolutely. They want the headlines. They want to suck all the oxygen out of the general, but also the Republican primary this is the top issue with this is a huge issue with Republican voters. So how Donald Trump's Republican opponents respond to this and we see really tough responses coming out from just a few of them. I mean Mike Pence's response was embarrassing. I don't think Ron DeSantis is with any better. So this is going to be a clarifying issue in the Republican primary. And then Jack Smith, who is a creature of DOJ, he spent four and a half years in the DOJ under Barack Obama. He worked for two and a half years at Mean Justice with Lisa Monaco, the deputy attorney general right now. He understands very clearly his marching orders and he is going to do whatever he's told or whatever he senses. We saw this yesterday with his pathetic statement that was, you know, he was nervous. He was clearly just overly agitated. He used all sorts of hyperbole that had nothing to do with the indictment. As he said, Donald J. Trump, he practically spit out his name. So very few people, Americans are going to view him as a fair arbiter of justice and nothing more than another democratic political operative disguised as a federal prosecutor.

Really there have not been any speedy trials for all the other J6 political prisoners. The only reason Trump gets a speedy trial is because of the upcoming election. Isn't this more proof of what's going on and that this is nothing more than a political attack? Thanks. Mark, I think yes, I and you heard any McCarthy getting into some of that before when we had him on. I don't look. I mean, you know, who knows. I know Julie Kelly and Clay both think that neither of these trials are going to happen before the election. I think that they I think at least one of them will happen before the election because think about this. If Trump ends up winning, this is all it's all for not right. And then you're going to have a Trump who is facing imprisonment. They're going to people say that they'll just drop the charges. I think he'll probably want to. I have to look at this. Will he actually the charges will be dropped, but we pardon himself as well just so that depends on what the statute of limitations and all that might be. Anyway, I think they're going to do one of the trials beforehand. I know how it normally works. That's not how it's going to work this time in my mind, at least. It could be wrong. But yeah, the other J6 prisoners, they were in a situation where they were held in solitary confinement in special in, you know, especially bad conditions because they were going to have another insurrection. That's what we're told. It's all lies. But yeah, I am definitely, definitely concerned about that. And also I think the way that this has gone down shows everybody what is really happening here, what the politics are. So yes, now a speedy trial only for Trump because they want to get it done before the election. Doug writes, the persecution of Donald Trump will definitely be before me. That's why I'll be voting for him as a side though. Why not get the scotis involved now in the constitutional validity of some of these made up charges? Well, Doug, the process will have to play out on this. And that would be they'll have to appeal it and depends. There's multiple cases, right? So let's just take the DC case. They could. I don't think the judges could dismiss the charges. I don't think anyone believes that. Not this judge. So there'll be an appeal and you know, this Supreme Court could try to fast track it, but I don't think it's, I don't think that's going to happen. I could be wrong. Let me see. We have Mark says, gentlemen, you've got O'Reilly. The last one was on a mark was the first one. We got another mark. Gentlemen, you've got O'Reilly, Victor David Hanson and a host of others, including me who believe there's no way Biden will be the Democrat nominee in 2024. Additionally, Jonathan Charlie just said it looks like Biden is involved in one of the greatest corruption scandals in the history of Washington. He says, mark my words and mark the words of others more alerted than me. Look, Clay thinks it's not going to be Biden. I think it is going to be Biden. So we'll see. Now the only thing that is there's a third way here, which is if Biden's health were to truly fail entirely, that that changes things, right? There's a reason we have a vice president. I'll understand what that is. So that's at Biden's age that could happen. But if we're talking about political strategy, I firmly believe still it's going to be Joe Biden because as I've said all along, all the charges against Trump, this drowns out. As far as the Democrats are concerned, this drowns out the Biden corruption network. And you could say, well, that's crazy. Yeah, but they're Democrats. They don't care. And then it just turns into the threat to our democracy of Donald Trump in 2024. They want the rematch. If they didn't want the rematch, they would have put it up forward another candidate, my friends, right? That's, I don't know how else to say it. They could have done something else, but they want it to be Biden v. Trump because they think they've got a plan for this. But I know they thought they had Hillary thought she had a plan. Hello. In 2016, Hillary thought that she was going to be able to pull it off with all the Democrat help with all the machinery and it didn't happen. So really this turns into, by the way, that election was close. The 2020 election was even closer. So it was going to be a close election. What we're left with is despite all the legal challenges and all the craziness and all the underhanded political behavior of the left in this, this Trump getting repeat of the 2020, the 2016 miracle instead of 2020, we will see.
