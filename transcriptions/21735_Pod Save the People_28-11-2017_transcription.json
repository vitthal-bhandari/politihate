    "text": " Hey, this is Durei and welcome to Potts Here The People. On this episode we have the news with me, Brittany Clinton-Sam, as always, and we also have DeWanda Wise, the new star of the Netflix series. She's got to have it the remake by Spike Lee. And we also have Shannon Mentor and Jennifer Levi to talk to us about the litigation to fight the trans ban in the military. Jan Packed episode. Now before we jump in, I'll just share a quote that has meant a lot to me. It says, if it's meant for you, you won't have to beg for it. You will never have to sacrifice your dignity for your destiny. And it's my Chelsea's Porter. What I love about this is that sometimes we have to remember that we don't have to force this work, that we should operate in the direction of our passions and our interests and our joy, and that it might not always be easy, but you shouldn't have to beg for the work that is your life's work. So when I think about this work on justice and equity, I've said it many times before, but find the issues that you really care about and then take the first step and keep taking the next step and the next step until you find your place. Let's go. And now the news with me, Brittany Pagnett, the former member of the Ferguson Commission appointed by President Obama to the task force on 21st century policing. And now a leader in public education, we also have Clint Smith III, our resident academic and Samuel C. Engrae, our resident data scientist. Hey, y'all. It's the news. This is Brittany Pagnett at Miss Pecheri on all social media. And this is Sam Cignangwe at Sam Sway on Twitter. What's going on, y'all? This is Clint Smith at Clint Smith III. Aye, aye, aye, this is Dorei at D.R.Y. on Twitter. So many of us celebrated a holiday this past week with our friends and family. I often refer to it simply as a holiday these days because I recognize as do we all here on the pod that Thanksgiving is a holiday fraught with a very violent history that is often a day of sadness for many Native Americans and people indigenous to this country. And so I want to ask you all how your holiday was. And before we do that, we certainly want to acknowledge that this was not a day of celebration for everyone. A friend of mine sent me a really great website called native-land.ca where you can actually put in your address or your county. And it helped me see where I was having that meal with my friends and family. And I was having it on Iroquois and Miami land in Missouri. And so I certainly want to acknowledge the people who were here before the rest of us on whose land we celebrated and enjoy time with our friends and family. And certainly want to be thankful to those activists and leaders continually in the native community that continue to enlighten all of us and push us ever more toward justice. But I was certainly thankful to be able to sit with my family this week as I know you all were. And I would love to hear how that went. I was with my sister and my niece and nephew, Salah and Isaac and they are amazing and they were great. It was good to be Uncle Dre for Thanksgiving. So I'm out in California with my in-laws and my mother-in-law is Nigerian. And so over the last several years we've had, I've been introduced to Nigerian thanksgivings, which include Joleph Rice and Suya and Iguzi Soup and Oxtail and Goat Me and all of these incredible Nigerian delicacies that I was not hip to and certainly not in the context of thanksgiving. So it's really flipped. I already had a sort of nontraditional thanksgiving because I'm from New Orleans and so we had Jambalaya, Gumbo, A2Fay and all this sort of stuff. But now I have a super unorthodox thanksgiving or maybe it is or maybe we need to reframe it, right? Because this is a land of immigrants as they say. And so it was just cool to have a thanksgiving that was not the traditional turkey mashed potatoes and whatnot. But what's interesting, I tweeted about it and apparently there's like a very intense Joleph rivalry, especially between Nigerian folks and Ghanaian folks. And I did a poll, which was a huge mistake, like one of the Twitter polls and then Sierra Leonians came through Liberians, Senegalese folks and everybody was very much offended or convinced that they had the best Joleph and my mentions were just awry for many days of people arguing whether or not their Joleph was better. But they were also very happy that my mother-in-law has brought me into the world of understanding how magical Joleph is. If you have not had Joleph, Google it. It is incredible. You should cook it. And it was just, it was funny and it was amazing and this was baby J's first thanksgiving and had a lot to be grateful for this year. Yeah, Ariel and I got back actually on a flight on Thanksgiving and so we got back around seven o'clock at night and then proceeded to make an incredible sort of traditional Thanksgiving meal for those who don't know, Ariel's an incredible chef's and I'm sort of good at cooking like three or four things. And to be clear to everybody, so there's no confusion, both my wife and Sam's partner are named Ariel so that people don't, I don't want people to be like, oh snap, Sam was out here traveling with- He's kicking it with Clint's wife and Thanksgiving. Oh man. I don't know if you knew, Clay. No drama on the pod today. That's a nice job for me. I love it. It's pod save the people living hip-hop edition. Basically. Okay, so my piece of news is a new report that came out, a new FBI uniform crime report on hate crimes in 2016 was recently published and an article in CNN goes over sort of some of their findings, most notably that hate crimes increased in 2016 and this was, it increased to an extent not seen in recent history. And so just to go into some of the numbers, there was about a 5% increase in reported hate crimes to this particular database. And there were 6,121 hate crimes reported in 2016 compared to 5,850 in 2015. But what's really interesting when you dig into the data is that you find that that increase actually occurred, so much of the increase occurred in the fourth quarter of the year around the election. And so there's a chart in this article which is just really fascinating which shows that historically hate crimes would decline in the fourth quarter of the year. But in 2016 and only in 2016, there was this spike in hate crimes coinciding with the final months of the election and then the months after. And so this sort of builds on an increasing body of evidence that in fact there has been this spice, something that we've heard all around, we've heard from many different groups, we've seen many incidents on TV, but this is just sort of the data that helps to quantify what's happening. And it's clear that Trump's election and what that represented for many people actually contributed to this spike of hate crimes. So a report that actually came out from the Southern Poverty Law Center looked at these two months following the election and they found a spike in hate crimes. So what you find is that 37% of these incidents actually included a Trump-related reference, which indicates that actually Trump and his presidency and the election itself contributed to a wave of violence and a spike in hate crimes in this country. And again, the FBI hasn't released data for this year, but it will be fascinating to see how that trend line changes, whether it increases or sort of falls back down to the baseline into this year as well. You know, sadly, I don't think any of you who are listening to this are surprised by this news. I'm very sure that none of us are. This actually, when I was reading this, Sam, it brought to mind the recent New York Times profile of the white supremacist, Tony Hovader, I'm not sure. Anyway, what struck me though, is that the tone of the profile seemed to be really emblematic of this prevailing social confusion that we really have to correct. And it's the idea that the people who are capable of hate and bigotry look a certain way. It's like, it's as if, you know, we expect every single white supremacist to show up in a hood or everyone who's capable of killing a trans woman to drive a pickup truck and live in the south, you know, or every person who gets spray paint a slur on a mosque to have a sleeve of tattoos and a shaved head. We often joke right about the white supremacist uniform that we saw on practically everyone in Charlottesville. But when some of those folks were exposed online, there were people who were surprised that they worked with these folks, right? That these people were working us in them at a call center or a restaurant because they didn't look the part. And we just seem totally baffled when bigots and supremacists show up like everyday people. But the truth is violent bigotry is a tumor that grows in every corner of our country. Yeah, I'm glad you brought up that New York Times article, Brittany. I've been thinking about that a lot. And it's interesting, right? Because as someone, so I'm someone who works with people who've been sentenced to life without parole. That is the focus of my research. And oftentimes these folks have done really horrific and egregious things. And I am not here to necessarily dispute that. And I am also someone who does the work of attempting to make sure that we know that these folks are are full people, right? And so I am empathetic to the instinct to humanize and to create a full picture of someone's personhood, even when they do egregious things. But so I think there can be value in attempting to understand people who do terrible things. But if that is done in a way that is both ahistorical and also unwilling to wrestle with both the moral and material implications of their violence, then the peace or the story is inevitably going to fail. You know, one, words have consequences. And in particular, words coming from somebody like a presidential nominee or a president elect have such tremendous consequences and it forces us to sort of ask questions like, you know, what does it mean for a president to cause a crime wave? You know, in many ways, like that's what you're seeing. Like you can trace this spiking crime directly to the president's actions and during the campaign and afterwards. And like, what does accountability look like in that sense? Like what, you know, what is the role of folks who are fighting this who are now being defunded under this administration? How do we continue to support those organizations to combat hate crimes and hate writ large? And then how do we hold folks accountable, not only the president, but you know, as you said, Clint, folks in the media as well, to actually starting to address this issue so that this doesn't get much, much worse. And I think it's important to also note just one last thing is that the New York's time piece is emblematic of this idea that certain people are worthy of empathy and certain people aren't right. And so always be mindful and always take into account and always try to notice who media outlets or who pundits or who governments deem worthy of empathy and deem worthy of humanization and take note of who are deemed as not being worthy of those same things. So recently Vox ran an interview with a UVA law professor and an author named Brandon Garrett about the dramatic decline of the use of the death penalty in America, which of course in and of itself is good news. In the 90s, the U.S. carried out about 300 to 350 death sentences a year. Last year in 2016, the number was down nearly 90% to 31 death sentences. But his book and his interview really explored the why and the how of that and what lessons there are to learn. So he essentially says that multiple factors have made it harder and more expensive for states to prosecute death penalty cases. But he says that the most important lesson is really in how that happened, that it wasn't a change led by policymakers or by Washington elites, but by hardworking defense lawyers on the ground. And that's actually who we owe this really dramatic shift in the criminal justice system too. So essentially he helps us reframe the death penalty and says that the evidence is crystal clear that the death penalty is not at all an effective deterrent, which means that it's not actually a matter of justice, but it's really just a matter of vengeance. It aligns with the idea that we often discuss on the pod that the criminal justice system is not truly interested in rehabilitation. And therefore we can just throw people away without regret or reflection. And as we discussed in the immigration case a few weeks ago, this news of this decline really comes from better lawyering and better resources for those lawyers. So the question that leaves me with though is will states possess the political and moral will to make sure that those lawyers have the training support and resources that they need to be more effective at their jobs, which really would represent a shift in the mindset around criminal justice that people that the right that most people can actually be rehabilitated and come through this system better than when they started out. Yeah, I mean, we've talked about the death penalty pretty extensively as we should. This was a really informative interview and I'm really interested in this professor's book. And the thing that sticks out to me about the death penalty, clearly the research is demonstrating that it's not a deterrent. Clearly it is emblematic of how our criminal justice system is not interested or committed to rehabilitation and instead is committed to retribution. All of these things are true and the list goes on and on. But I keep coming back to the fact that 4% of those who are killed in capital punishment are innocent and that was reflected again in this interview and that's been reflected in prior research that's been done. But that is that it's just I think people just need to sit with that. Like imagine you are in a room of 25 people and one of those people is just killed and is murdered by the state and they were completely innocent and that is what our system does. And it is astonishing that one out of 25 people who are killed in the United States by the death penalty are proven to have been innocent. We should stop doing the death penalty if that number were one out of 500 and we should stop doing the death penalty for a myriad of moral reasons. But one out of 25 is horrific. I mean I don't really don't even have the words to express how unsettled I am by that reality and yet that is where we are. And I'm hopeful that we will continue to move to a point where our Supreme Court with the federal government recognizes that there is no utility and there is no morality in the death penalty and that we move past it in totality. And I think from an advocacy point of view in terms of fighting against this one of the things that's important to know is that the death penalty is actually banned in 18 states and there are only a handful of counties that are actually responsible for a disproportionate share of executions. And so in that sense it means that there are a very small number of jurisdictions that account for so much of this issue that changing the prosecutors, the elected DA in those areas can have a huge impact in terms of addressing the death penalty or even state legislation in states like Texas and Florida which account for so many executions to actually address that issue can go a long way to ending it nationwide. Yeah, I just think too about how important it is that we tell the right story publicly because so many people do think that it's a result of some sweeping law shifts or that matter. But, Brittany, when you tell this story of it was defense attorneys or when we tell this story about what innocence looks like is that it helps reframe this issue for people. And when I think about the idea of so many people being innocent, it's like what is the goal here? And we don't tell the story either enough of the fact that mass incarceration hasn't decreased crime. The death penalty hasn't had any demonstrable impact on crime at all. I think that we often don't tell our story as well about how we got here, what the victories actually look like and what the work looked like because we are so focused on doing the work that the storytelling comes afterwards and I'm more and more mindful of how when we don't tell this story correctly, people tell this story for us and they often get it wrong. I just want to close by saying I know it can often seem as though the everyday actions, the work we're doing in our careers, the tiny tasks we take on every single day toward justice aren't really making a dent and aren't moving us forward in the ways that we want. But this is good news about the decline of the death penalty. I hope to see that number come to zero very soon, but it is a reminder that you don't have to be the most powerful person in the room. You don't have to have the biggest or most important title. You don't have to have the biggest office in order to affect change. I just want to shout out to all of these defense lawyers and the people working in those offices who have made this decline in the death penalty a reality and it's a reminder to all of us to keep on working at it no matter how long it takes. So oftentimes when we think about climate change, we are thinking of rising oceans. We are thinking of icebergs melting. We are thinking of certain types of wildlife becoming extinct. We are thinking about more hurricanes and all of these different things. These things are true. There was a recent piece in The Guardian that talks about the impact that climate change has on child brides throughout the world. This really struck me because that is not a connection that I would intuitively make, but what the piece goes on the outline is that the increasingly desperate environmental conditions throughout Africa and throughout the Middle East in many countries are creating scenarios in which families are becoming increasingly desperate, especially families who have lived off the land. When that land is either ruined by flood water from rising rivers and lakes and other bodies of water that makes the land something that is no longer fertile or conversely when the land is too dry, this struck me for a range of reasons, but intuitively it's not a connection that I would make. Part of what this piece outlines is that so many of the families in particular in this piece they're talking about in several countries in Africa are experiencing drought or conversely are experiencing the flooding of land that they otherwise would use to cultivate their crops and both eat off of and use to sell to feed their families that that land is no longer fertile. What's happened is that so many of these families have begun to sell the young girls in their family essentially into marriage at an earlier and earlier and earlier age. So you have girls as young as 13 or 14 and in some cases 12 who are given to older men and they are either paid a dowry which means they are given some semblance either crops or cows or money in exchange for the girl or even if the person who is the girl is being married to does not have the money to give to them, it is one less mouth to feed for these families. So I think we tend to think of climate change in this very insular way but I think that this piece really helped me remember that the impact of the changing climate is having very real impacts on people's lives across the world and it's most often and disproportionately affecting the most desperate people. There was one quote in the article that really struck me when they were discussing the fact that there are no fully detailed figures as to just how many child rides could be subjected to this essentially because no one has previously thought to connect the issue of child rides and child marriages to climate change and that no one has ever asked the right questions until now. It really struck me because I like you Clint had never asked myself this question had never connected those dots. Once the connection was made for me it made very perfect, very sad sense but it really struck me as a woman thinking about how desperate I have been and how desperate so many of us have been in America to finally be having an open conversation about sexual harassment assaults and abuse and how long that took and how so many stories of women around the world are still not being acknowledged even in the midst of this much more open conversation. The truth is anywhere in the world as dangerous as it already can be to be a young woman the issue is always exacerbated when poverty comes into the picture and becomes a factor. This article really reminds me of another article that I read actually a couple days ago which was about climate gentrification and so I was like climate gentrification I've never heard that and so apparently as sort of wealthier folks mostly white folks in places like Miami Beach are being displaced by rising sea levels by the hurricanes and all of these effects of climate change they are now moving into low income communities of color like in Little Haiti and Miami and other places displacing folks and it just goes to show how far reaching climate change as an issue is to impact so many other issues that we wouldn't think about you know that aren't even being measured as you said Brittany and how it just really exacerbates existing problems on every axis and how we have to be vigilant in addressing climate change and also in talking about climate change in saying that it's about more than you know just the climate changing or getting a little hotter or sea levels rising it is actually an exacerbation of so many other different issues that impact people and predominantly that impact communities of color and low income communities both in the US and abroad. Yeah the only thing I had is that you know it's important to remember that some of the places that the art of references have already tried to stop like child marriages by law and it just isn't catching hold so this isn't like a you know fixed climate change fix everything or that climate change is the only lever but it is a reminder that like there are so many unintended consequences of the policies that we either support or don't support and I had never thought about relationship between climate change and child marriages at all like that is like you know I want to talk to the researcher to just figure out like how this even like this this idea to research this came to play because you know the study suggested there might be like a three time increase of three times as many marriages over the next set of years because of climate change and that is just so wild so it makes me think about what other relationships and correlations we aren't looking at because we haven't asked the right question. And part of what this also makes me think about I think many folks saw the reporting that CNN did where they found that there was slave auctioning that was happening in Libya where immigrants or refugees rather who were trying to find work oftentimes trying to smuggle themselves to Europe on the way ended up being smuggled into unwittingly and unwillingly and against their will into being human trafficked by folks in Libya. And so I think that that was incredibly unsettling if you've not seen the video we'll put it on the on the site but it was a very real and astonishing example of what modern day human trafficking looks like and and that is something that we can't disentangle from the things that are being talked about in this piece with regard to climate change because the reason that so many folks in different parts of Africa are attempting to smuggle themselves knowing the chances of death but doing it anyway to Europe is because the circumstances of their lives like are becoming increasingly more desperate and more difficult because so much of the land that they lived off of is no longer again is no longer fertile and is not something that they can live off of so so many young men are attempting to escape and on the way to escaping often find themselves in the most precarious of circumstances and certainly finding yourself being being auctioned off as a human being is about as precarious and horrific as it can get. Well, mine uses about the courts. I'm just fascinated by this is that Trump will add twice as many lifetime members to the federal courts in the next 12 months as President Obama named in eight years and that is just so wild to me that that sometime in the next year one in eight cases filed in federal court will be heard by judge picked by Trump and many of the judges will likely be serving up until 2050 and it's because the Republicans have a whole new plan to change the judiciary so that he inherited 103 judicial vacancies and in the first nine months of Obama's tenure Obama nominated 20 judges to the federal trial and public courts in the first nine months of Trump's tenure he nominated 58 and they are racing to get them on the court so that is that sort of staggering because we always think about the courts is like a as a place that we can go when the other two branches of the government fail or there needs to be an arbiter but he is changing them in such a substantial way and perhaps the most interesting and damaging thing is that there's a proposal that was actually written by the federal society that is planning to pack the federal courts at the minimum of 260 but up to over 400 newly created judicial positions so under their plan the 228 year federal judiciary would increase in a single year by 30 to 50 percent and what's noticeable about this is that during the Obama administration Chief Justice Roberts on Chief Justice Roberts on the Supreme Court asked for more judges to be created because they were just a backlog and the GOP the Congress wouldn't do it and now suddenly the Trump's president there's there's like a mad dash to just change your judiciary and this is stuff that doesn't make the nightly news but has huge consequences on how we think about justice especially how we think about checks and balances. As a reminder to everyone the federalist society was started I want to say in the 1980s but you'll have to check me on that and by a group of conservative and libertarian law school students among those founders is one of the pods faves Antonin Scalia who perhaps is best known for you know standing in the way of like civil human rights for marginalized people for decades the federal society is so conservative that upon his nomination for Chief Justice John Roberts initially denied ever being associated with him because he knew it would threaten his chances at winning his nomination and so the tricky part here is that the federal society in their portion of the plan as you said Dorei is not just to fill existing vacancies with extreme conservatives but to create new judicial posts to really tip the scales as I was reading it and immediately brought to mind the three-fifths compromise which of course happened at one of the constitutional conventions to allow southern states to count enslaved people as three-fifths of the human being which besides being inhumane was rooted in clear political ideology it was all about making sure that southern states had an outsized power in the House of Representatives for at least the next 10 years so it was based 100 percent in the promotion of the south political strategy and that's exactly what this is it is targeted it is strategic it is undercover this is precisely how this administration has been performing and operating since it came into office to ensure their power outlast them to ensure their agenda outlast them at the end of the day this is what systemic oppression looks like and that's why we can't just fight Trump we have to fight past Trump yeah so if you wanted to know why some of your Republicans in Congress are being uh such cowards then you have to look no further than the courts I think they don't want anything to distract from or take away from or hinder their ability to fill the courts again and fill the courts with people who are serving lifetime appointments like these are not people who will who can be removed when we move past this Trumpian stage of our our political moment like these are folks who are going to serve for the rest of their lives until they either pass away or retire on these courts and and this is a this is a really huge thing and again this is we say it over and over and over again but the implications of elections are far far beyond simply the the figurehead that we put in office and you know we have to make sure that we are taking it to account the the full scope of implications of each election um and and that we are doing the work of of articulating that to as many people as possible and I think that's you know something that we didn't do a good enough job of in 2016 and and I hope that people are becoming more and more cognizant of of all of this as we move towards 2018 and um you know I feel like on every podcast from now on we should say make sure everybody you know is registered to vote but the not you know in 2018 isn't going to remove the president but it can um serve as catalyst to to ensuring that we put uh some sort of halt to these really really really dangerous um judges who are being placed on the courts yeah absolutely Clinton I mean 2018 you know if the Senate flips democratic then that can really um prevent a lot of these folks from getting confirmed and so it's a huge opportunity to actually stop this uh in a year um the other piece that's interesting about this is that you have not only are these sort of pro-Trump pro-Trump uh justices but 74 of the judicial nominees that Trump has made have been white men uh and so you're seeing how white supremacy is working not only in the ways in which it prevented and minimized uh the ability of Obama to shape the judiciary and you know in doing so shaping how justice is interpreted and um implemented in this country but you're also seeing how the system is sort of trying to change all the rules you know especially if they adopt this federalist uh idea in order to give Trump extra power uh to shape the way that justice is interpreted in this country um and in and when you look at the ways in which Trump is doing that it is very clear that it is a generational uh strategy of essentially you know blocking all blocking all types of uh social justice and and other important uh judicial wins from from taking place over the next you know 40 to 50 years when you think about um you know some of the younger justices who are going to be there for that long and so you know we have to this has to be part of you know what we're thinking about at the ballot box because this is ultimately um what got decided in 2016 uh and we can't let that happen again that's the news don't go anywhere more pining the people's coming and now my conversations for Shannon Minter and Jennifer Levi who are both lawyers working to stop the robust trans ban that has been put into effect by Trump with regard to the military now since we recorded this conversation just in the last 24 48 hours some things have changed two different courts of issue ruling stating that the Obama era policies in favor of trans military recruitment and retention must be here too and the lawyers I'm glad and the NCLR as well as lots of private firms in ASL you have been working hard to push back against the ban the cases were in Maryland and DC federal court so pay attention to the conversation that we're having on the podcast today and make sure to follow this in real time because it's changing every day Shannon and Jennifer thanks so much for joining us today on pot save the people I'm excited to have this conversation thanks Dorei we're both really excited to be on yeah I appreciate covered now both of you are lawyers who are helping to lead the fight against the transgender service ban that Trump has put with regard to the military can you start by telling us how you got to be lawyers working in this work sure this Shannon so Jennifer and I both are transgender and we have both been practicing law for I don't know a few decades now a couple decades at least and have both ended up being very active in the transgender rights movement both both you know litigating cases and developing policy and drafting and trying to pass anti-discrimination legislation other kind of laws that protect transgender people so we're part of a relatively small but growing network of transgender attorneys who are able to to do that kind of work and of course we work with a much larger network of transgender advocates and and allies and Jennifer you can explain it for yourself of course but we both work for one of the four major LGBT litigation organizations in the country I work for the National Center for lesbian rights and Jennifer can tell us about GLAD more and a little bit here but we were just really concerned when President Trump started tweeting about banning transgender people from the military and especially in light of all the litigation experience that Jennifer and I have litigating these issues and thinking about these issues about transgender people we reached out to one another and both agreed that if the minute it looked like those tweets were going to get turned into a serious policy that we wanted to be ready to bring a case and so that's when we started lining up plaintiffs and getting ourselves ready to file and and ended up filing you know the first case challenging the the military ban but Jennifer you should talk about your your background yeah sure I work for an organization called GLBTQ legal advocates and defenders were known as GLAD and we're a nonprofit law firm who primarily has focused on the New England states and but we've increasingly done work of national scope because of the ways in which the communities that we represent have been targeted I direct the transgender rights projects and as Shannon said I've been doing this work for nearly two decades and when President Trump pleaded out the policy that transgender people would be excluded from the military it really pulled together in you know one issue the kind of work on the efforts that both and I've been working on separately and together for our professional careers and so there was a real sense of urgency that we had to bring these cases that in which we've been involved for people that aren't familiar with the issue right now how would you describe it and what are the suite of cases that are that are in progress as we challenge as you challenge the Trump administration yeah so I mean I think that a couple of things that people may not know or understand and that is that transgender people have been serving in the military for a very long time and have been doing so at extraordinarily high levels of competency and the military has has already undergone a process of comprehensive evaluation of what the impact would be on allowing transgender people to go up and late and it was over a year ago today over a year ago from this time when the military adopted a policy that authorizes transgender people to serve openly and so when president trump changed that policy it was a dramatic reversal of military policy and it ignored the conclusion that the military itself had already drawn about the impact of transgender people being able to serve the second thing to make clear is that the military policy has already changed and is and now prohibit transgender people from serving and transgender people will begin to face separation or discharge from the military in March of 2018 that data set the policy has already been changed and so there's a dramatic impact on transgender service numbers right now meaning that they will be subject to discharge in March and transgender people are right now prohibited from enlisting and that due to the change that the president Trump administration has adopted yeah i will remind you just hang on that just for a little bit because i will say to read one of the things that has been so frustrating about litigating this case and we've seen president trump do this in other areas as well especially with rescinding the policy protecting dreamers when he rescinded the DACA policy he does he has this pattern where he will issue a terrible decision that has an incredibly harmful impact on people and in this case it was reinstating this categorical ban on transgender service members even though the military itself just studied this issue and decided like in June of 2016 that there was absolutely no reason not to let transgender people serve but so he reverses that he reinstates the ban and then immediately at the department justice and others start spinning the issue and being like oh well who knows we don't know what we might end up doing uh you know maybe we'll kick people out maybe we won't but meantime the president has issued a very clear directive with a date certain like Jennifer said we know exactly when the ban goes back into effect on march 23rd but it is very successful like creating confusion and we had to deal with not only like you know finding plaintiffs and putting our case together but then we you know have to spend time explaining to people even in our own movement in our own community like yeah you you all something bad is happening and it's happening right now there is no uncertainty we know exactly what's going to happen and if we don't file a lawsuit to stop it people are going to be kicked out of the military but you know they are really really good at doing something bad and then creating all muddying the waters and creating all this confusion and acting like nothing bad is really happening wow i didn't know anything had actually changed in practice already i thought that these are upcoming changes i know you touched on this already but can you just repeat like what has changed for active trans members of the military right now so right now the military is prohibited from taking steps against them while they're serving but that is only because of the fact that the federal district court in washington dc on october 30th 30th issued an order halting the ban that this administration announced so that has been an incredibly important order that halt what this administration has done which is to reinstate a policy that excludes trans end of people from serving in the military and and dreya might help because i you know it this is she's been really confusing to a lot of people and again that's been half our battle is to get people to recognize that what's happening now i mean it has helpful a little bit to just back it up and and recognize that the the military studied this issue up one side and down the other i mean they really did an incredibly extensive examination of transgender people in the military then secretary carter uh under the previous administration issued you know and now that the military changes policy in june 2016 and they said we know we have transgender people in the military you can all come out identify yourselves nothing bad will happen and then they were going to also start letting transgender people enlist in the military and that was all set to take effect the the enlistment part was going to take effect in june on july first 2017 then we had presidential election we have a new secretary of defense secretary of defense had already extended that deadline for letting transgender people exist to january first of this year so that was a status quote before president trump did anything before he did anything the policy was your transgender in the military that's great you can openly identify yourself you can serve on equal terms and starting on january first transgender people who want to enlist in the military can do so openly as a transgender person and then what president trump did is issue an order saying oh no oh i don't like any of this we are going back to the old policy of categorically banning people starting on march 23rd that old ban is back into effect and we're never going to let transgender people enlist like he extended that indefinitely so what started happening immediately as soon as he did that is transgender people who are in the military they were having problems re-enlisting we have a bunch of people who had medical care denied uh we had a bunch of people who were like all of a sudden you know i'm not getting uh the training i want i was going to be deployed i'm not going to be deployed anymore i mean basically everyone all around them including their commanding officers knew that they were not going to be in the military much longer and so naturally they started getting treated very differently and and much worse and so that's why we jumped in we filed our lawsuit we've been able to deal with most of those immediate problems including about denial of medical care and to get a court order saying oh no you cannot you cannot enforce this ban on march 23rd and on january 1st transgender people are going to be able to enroll in the military so i mean that's kind of the lay of the land right now the ban enlistment that uh was extended and it's currently still in place has had an immediate impact on a number of people including two of our plaintiffs in our washington d c case so we represent a young man who started at the university of new haven just this past september and he intended to enroll in the ro t c programming find up for ro t c housing as well as a class that's offered and um physical training with ro t c and the day he went the first day he went to participate in our t c programming he was told that he would not be allowed to participate because he's transgender so that for his you know prohibition against transgender people and lifting has had an an immediate um and direct impact on a number of transgender people including in that ro t c context i'm learning so much now and now what can people do about it is there anything we can do about it or do we just need to wait for the courts no don't wait no wait no we really need people to be engaged and i mean thank you dorei for doing this podcast to help us like let people know what's going on because we desperately need for people to be paying attention to this issue you know follow the cases of course that's really helpful but just like back in the marriage equality fight i mean we need people who have transgender family members our friends are who are just allies to be speaking up about this issue every chance you get and let people know that uh you support transgender people and let your both your state and federal elected representatives know that you think transgender people should be able to serve on equal terms in the military what i mean what the public knows and thinks about this issue is going to have a huge impact on how it eventually turns out including that i mean it's important i mean the courts of courts are going to rule based on the constitution but it's very helpful for the courts to know that the public is with us and that the public generally supports equal treatment for transgender people so the more attention and visibility and support we get from the community and the progressive community and the and broader the better yeah i just want to add that you know this is a president that seems to really test the wind and take uh measurement of the way in which the political wings are growing and i am hopeful that this administration could even walk back this ban and see that you know the military is opposed to it people are opposed to it it's not a political win for that so really getting people engaged talking to others about why they think it's so long um you know people who are impacted personally telling their stories is all super important um and they well impact the the course of this work there's a lot of people in this one of her losing hope who feel like there is no light on the other side of the tunnel what do you say to those people you know i get a tremendous amount of uh hope and optimism from the ways in which i see this administration impacting young people's engagement with politics and with policy and with ideas and there's a way in which i'm now i will never have picked this fight at all um but i am so inspired by young people who i talk to who are engaged and energized and enthusiastic about the idea of making political change making long lasting sustained political change and i think you know seeing the the ways in which people have mobilized bringing together marches reaching out across issues that people might not have understood the connection across you know across a whole range of issues really gives me hope and optimism in these really dark times where can people go to find out more information about both of you and the organizations that you work for where can people go to find more information yeah so i would invite people for uh we're interested in money more about glad in our work to take a look at our website which is www.blad.org and that's glad.org yeah and our

forward to bringing you back to keep us updated thank you so much really appreciate your covering this important issue and really all the issues that you focus on so appreciate it yeah thanks so much to write big time thank you hey you're listening to pod save the people don't go anywhere there's more to come and now my conversation with the wandewa is the star of the new netflix series she's got to have it i do want to thank so much for joining us on pod save the people thanks for having me if my memory serves me correct you're from baltimore right i am from baltimore i grew up on rolling road in wood lawn um and my dad presently lives in katon fell so baltimore county um that side but yeah i grew up in baltimore and i went to school in hower county you know it's such a small world i actually went to king's own middle and high school oh did you you know i have a similar story we lived in the city proper and then formed it on high school my father moved us so we could go to different schools and we moved to king's will maybe i live around the corner from your dad probably most likely they have been there my entire life i'd love to start with learning more about your journey to being an actress how did that happen for you yeah i so it was you know it was in high school like i have a lot of friends who um were really interested in acting a lot earlier than i was um but i kind of really it was this place um for me to put a lot of stuff actually it's it's pretty relevant to growing up in baltimore but you know i i'm from the city and i went to school in the county and i had a lot of like i was a deep empath um and i had a lot of anger i had a lot of like pain and angst and um a lot of stuff that i was just processing and trying to figure out um and so i started taking drama class when i was 15 years old and my drama teacher really really i mean like a 90s movie encouraged it and you know he like he gave me the tension for being late to class which was his way of basically forcing me to audition for the music man um our spring musical at the time and it was i mean it was kind of like it was really love at first sight it was something that clicked and it made sense and i realized i could also um have the kind of freedom and spontaneity and flexibility because i like to quit stuff you know so it was um it was it just became very clear and it brought it brought a lot of clarity to my life that you've been in such a range of roles from underground precious now she's got to have it how do you choose your roles like what's that process like for you um i think what what's interesting is you know i'm almost like i'm almost at this like place where i can just read something and say oh this is interesting to me yeah like i want it and i don't have to audition for it anymore um but i've always you know i've always auditioned for things and um what's what's like the truth is i i just think there's something in the dna of an actor um and not to get to like a femoral or pretentious about um how it works but projects really do choose you i mean you know i i audition for the gamut of things there have been plenty of things that i've auditioned for that you know would just be fun to do you know that that really don't have any you know deeper social ramifications other than just good old-fashioned and very necessary entertainment and i just i just got a couple of projects like all of a sudden i'm like you know like playing uh inmate firefighter and firelight and it's just i don't know um there's just something you know not only inherently political in me because i'm like a black woman but also something i think there's something extra um some extra heart or enthusiasm or love of the thing that just draws me to subjects um that i find compelling so i wish there was some formula i mean i will say i do say no a lot like i've always said no a lot because there's a lot but i just don't think it's good i love it i love it there's a lot that i just do not think it's good but i'm like that's okay and they're like but the wandah you know you you don't have you're still working at the at your restaurant job and i'm like that's okay i love my restaurant job i'll wait you're like i love my restaurant job that is so real you talked about this idea of the inherent political nature of your role as an actress as a black woman and i want to know what is it like to be an actress in this moment does it make you think differently about your work about your role does it do anything to the way that you think about your role or your work that's a good question i mean i i'm definitely among the scores of black girls who are like welcome to the club you know i'm definitely you know i've been going to a lot of these a lot of events and especially in the wake of these conversations about sexual harassment, assault, violation it's you know this past year overall both kind of in politics and you know in our culture the culture of hollywood the culture of america it's it has it's been like just like watching a sea of people wake up you know i will say when i first read the pilot for shots fired you know which is about police brutality i was like what we're doing this for tv you know i'm so accustomed to working in independent film i'm so used to telling the stories that i want to tell and tackling topics in a way where people can enter into the lives and have empathy for people that they wouldn't normally come across on a daily basis so i just i think it's interesting because there are more i'm obviously seeing more work that actually exists um that i find pretty daring and cutting edge and the opportunities have changed a lot you know um and where those opportunities are has to yeah i mean it's it's very it's just so clear i mean it's clear from you know the year i'm having that there's actual work that exists um and that's being green lit and all that but in terms of you know being like hollywood proper in the entire community it's pretty wild because i do i just feel like i'm watching people um wake up and you know i am open for sure to um facilitating the movement going forward and like trying to be compassionate about you know the place that everyone's at um in their process of you know waking up to the real world it has been interesting to see people sort of realize all at once that the world has not been a great place for so many people for so long they're like wow it's so bad and we're like it's been bad for a lot of people for a long time did you know that you wanted this role and she's gonna have it when you when you first saw the script was in the process was it love it first say how did that work oh how to come to be um it's you know i i saw it in my early 20s i saw it when i was um still uh in college and it struck me in it struck me in many ways um but for the most part it was just about her like strength of of mind right and with this process what happened was what happened was um i got the audition i saw it come across and i did my little nerdy dawanda research and kind of figured out who was in the writers room i just come out of two projects and if i in one i learned how import how important tv how important it is to know who's in your tv's writer group you don't you like you can't really know it's not something you know i feel like this whole last year i had far more information than actors mostly received before they sign up for a show for 70 years of their life you know but for me specifically what she's got to have it i needed to know that there were women in the writers room i mean it's very simple it's you know it's a woman's story um and i thought okay it was one of the few times where i felt like if you're going to do an update you know this makes sense i was like oh this one makes sense as an update it was already ahead of its time you know there's a ton to say and explore um about what it means to be a woman figuring her life out um but it it's paramount um that the voices who are writing for nola and writing for the other women in the series are you know some prolific um skilled um brilliant minds uh it it just it means everything and it's always meant everything you know i'm the script for me you know coming from the theater background like it's if it's not on the page it's not there like it doesn't exist there's nothing an actor can do to bring anything to life that doesn't exist um so yeah so i you know it was it was super duper important um and spike has been super incredibly humble about it and you know acknowledge that when she's got to have it came out in 86 you know it was completely from the male gaze it was like i mean clearly i wrote it i directed it i edited it you know entirely from the male gaze and it's 2017 like that's you know if we're talking our generation it's not an option you know and so then i was like yes i'll audition for it you know it's it's that i was like oh i do this with a writer in the room it's like oh yeah you know i'll audition for it then um and if if i'm if i'm ensues if i'm like if i choose to um go in for something i'm like i'm a 2 000 right i like i put all my like my mind just starts to go and and i submitted this uh i was still working on underground so i submitted the self tape and i do not recommend this if you're an actor listening to this i do not recommend this it's really ridiculous don't do this um but i decided you know nola has these she has these direct address to camera um monologue and so i was like okay we're talking 2017 you know i was i was planning on taping the day after um i'd gotten it you know i'd memorized and done all my homework and stuff so my like my hair was um band two knots so i could like have a cute twist out um which you see her twist out on the show so by so my hair isn't band two knots um you know how my septum ring in still um and i take the direct address monologue the first scene like as a selfie you know like as the whatever facebook live instagram live um i just taped it as a selfie by the light you know in my bed like laying in my bed um and that was my way of saying this is who nola is in 2016 you know i love it messa doe just a raw very stripped down honest no makeup and so much of that kind of depth and um insight and simplicity is is what you see in the show um so yeah that was it i submitted my audition tape um i had a director session with spike and he was pretty clear because he was not a man who was lacking in clarity um or purpose by any means you know he was just like he was like do you want to do this um and so yeah we went you know we went from there you know what do you hope people get out of she's got to have it it's a remake people feel like they know this story uh so what do you would you want people to walk away with with this ten episode netflix series of such an iconic film right i have a very simple agenda and it's the same agenda i've always had with all my work which is i want people to see themselves reflected and you can see yourself in you know in nola you can see yourself in any of our friends you can see yourself in um any of the guys um and i you know that's my only the guys my only like very simple agenda like i you know there were things that spoke to me that i thought were compelling thematically in the show i love that we now include a kind of village of women uh her friends her mother her therapist her um the teacher uh the principal who runs um you know the teaching artist program that she's a part of i love that we tackle body image issues i love that we're talking gentrification so there's a ton of things thematically topically that you know i found interesting and compelling but you know when it comes to what i want or hope in audience member takes away um i never limit it you know people always come up to me with something that they caught or that they like move them in whatever way or that they felt was hilarious um and i'm always kind of like surprised and open and interested in you know what people pick pick up because you know audiences are brilliant and um i love working on projects where the creators know that this is a moment where a lot of people are losing hope where they feel like it's just not gonna get better or it's not getting better so where do you go in the tough days or the days of the hope wings uh to find that that spirit part of being like melancholy kid um was definitely suffering from depression and it takes a lot it takes a lot to keep me buoyant um and it's a communal effort honestly um so now i've gotten to a space where i can actually like my husband my mom used to do this thing where you know they knew that it wasn't their sole responsibility to like pull me out right and so they would reach out to my friends for me um and i'm so thankful that i that i've always had people who were like yeah you know i know i'm not enough so um let me reach out to the people who can speak into your life um i'm christian so i've always had this idea the sense this knowledge this truth that like this isn't it like this isn't this isn't even you know a hair um in the grand scheme and scale of what you know of what life is um and you know i mean there's just there's a lot this list d-ray this list is long like it's helpful to talk about that you know because people think that they're alone and they're not alone yeah for sure they're not they're not i mean and i think my greatest in my in my greatest weakness my greatest strength has been reaching out always it's always been reaching out i mean anytime that i have struggled in anyway financially you know i i've just had to whether it's like i mean it's been strangers um whether it's an organization you know i work with non-me communications their mental health organization um and they have a brilliant model because they empower local community it's it's not this thing whereas like this top-down kind of you know format or reform it's very specific um community to community um but yeah because you know it is it's hard sometimes you feel like you can't go to your family or sometimes a family is the problem um and you know i do i i mean so i just i do i really encourage people to like you know jump online and find um like look up the thing um whatever's going on and and find your tribe you know at this point in my life i'm thankful i have really really great friends um and they cover me and you know they encourage me and we're we can be very transparent about where we're at but if you feel like you don't have that community you know i just say start building it um like start really really building it um and yeah that's my offering well thanks so much for joining us and i'm glad to hear the people consider your friend of the pot and can't wait to see you and she's got to have it thank you i appreciate your work for sure well that's it thanks so much for joining us on this episode of
