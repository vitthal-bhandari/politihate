    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Today, Kevin McCarthy is officially the new speaker of the house and Joe Biden visits the border. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Saragansola's happy Monday. I am joined today by America's favorite cowboy, also host of the Chad Prather show Chad Prather himself. Hi, I like that voice. Do you? Yeah, that's my radio voice. Hello. And welcome to movie phone. It's sound like you're on NPR. I just I just dated myself by talking about movie phone and now I'm dressed. Also joined by the youngest member at the table, Eric July, the ladies, you be contributor and of course founder and owner of Ripaverse comics who is way richer than us and we don't understand why he continues showing up. But somehow he does. We were talking at the table before the show and I was like, well, Chad, you know, we are in the midst of a one percenter now. So he doesn't even hear us. He's on his phone like, I don't know what these two idiots are saying. And I don't have to know because I'm rich. You don't want to make a million dollar deals. We're just talking about garage sales and stuff. All right, so headlines of the day, the reason you do all that stuff. Representative Kevin McCarthy is now speaker of the house after winning the 15th vote late Friday night. Matt Gates as well as fellow Republican holdouts, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Lauren Boebert, Colorado, Eli Crane, Arizona, Bob Good of Virginia, and Matt Rosendale of Montana, all voted present allowing McCarthy to clutch that he was elected with 216 votes and no Republican voted against him in favor of another candidate during that final round of voting because as I mentioned, they just voted present as a way around that. McCarthy vowed that among the very first hearings would relate to the crisis at the United States border and that he and his fellow Republicans would soon vote to repeal funding for 87,000 new IRS agents. I want to play a little bit of his speech right now, watch. We will hold the swamp accountable from the withdrawal of Afghanistan to the origins of COVID and to the weaponization of the FBI. Let me be very clear. We will use the power of the purse and the power of the subpoena to get the job done. Now I'm a little confused how a member of the swamp can hold the swamp accountable, but I guess they would call that minor details. I do want to throw into the conversation here. Obviously, Representative Chip Roy and some others really utilized these votes as a negotiation tactic and they did get to all of their credit, they did get quite a bit of concessions that would not have been gotten without, as the mainstream media calls them, the Taliban 20. They include the concessions, restoring the one member motion to vacate the chair rule, which would allow one single representative to introduce a resolution to oust the speaker. Four seats for Freedom Caucus members on the House Rules Committee, which controls which legislation comes to the floor for a vote. So that is very, very important, obviously. A vote on term limits for both representatives and senators. Now, of course, I did say a vote on term limits. I don't actually expect these people to vote four term limits for themselves, but they did at least negotiate the vote and they can put everyone on record as to what they voted, transferring the power to determine committee leadership to committee members themselves and away from party leadership and fiscal responsibility. So, for all the people who, I don't know, even members of their own party, I'm looking at you, Sean Hannity. I'm looking at you, Dan Crenshaw, who, by the way, called these people terrorists, for all those people who wanted to frame these 20 members of the House as horrible people betraying the party, what have you, seems like they got quite a bit done, actually. I'm going to venture out on the limb, I think, safely and say that I'm the only panelist at the table who actually watched all of this Friday night because Eric doesn't care. You got a life. I was up to one in the morning watching this. If you watch the nuances of the whole proceeding, it was pretty interesting to a little dramatic at times to watch this whole thing play out. This was a historic time when they actually went all the way to a 15th vote and just watching the body language. Even I said at the time, I said, I wish a bad lip reading would get a hold of some of these clips and do it. And they have a sense. And I was like, this is some pretty good stuff that's going on in here. And yeah, you bring up an interesting question, how can a member of the swamp and Kevin McCarthy is a member of the swamp, how can he bring accountability to the swamp? He can't. He can't. It took this Freedom Caucus doing what they did. And I remind everybody, I know that we try, we want to live under this Roberts rules of order type sentimentality of how American government auto work. It's not, it's very messy. A constitutional republic is very messy to keep it right. And we're so far off the rails and reservation and all the other, you know, analogies you can use. We're so far gone from the original intent of what this country was founded on that when you watch this, you go, Oh, that's such a just a nasty, these people are being terrorists to use Dan Crenshaw's phrase. No, they weren't actually they got a lot of stuff done. And everybody's like, why can't these guys just be brand name Republicans like the rest of, you know, the swamp creatures out there? Well, I'm glad they didn't in the grand scheme of things. Now, you basically take every single person in that room, put them in a bottle, shake them up and toss them out. And at the end of the day, they pretty much all look the same to me at this point. But I'm glad that those folks stood up and took the stand that they did. Yeah, I mean, you know, it's just frustrating because you see them actually taking a stand for very, I would say very reasonable measures. Another concession, 72 hours required before you hold a vote on a bill. I would say that, I mean, I would ask for much longer than that when you're talking about 3000 page bills. I think 72 hours should be, I mean, you're talking about bare minimum. And these people had to fight their own party just to get stuff like that done. It's just so frustrating because this whole party, the Republicans, Democrats do it too. Obviously, it happens on both sides of the aisle. But it's like, what is the point of electing our representatives to represent us if you think that they're just required to vote in lockstep with whatever the top of the party says? Like, what the hell is the point? Is this all a charade? And then you go, well, yeah, that is actually what they think it is. They do. Well, that's what it is. I mean, let's call it for what it actually is. But, you know, I'd have always said whether it be with the Liberty caucuses or Freedom caucuses of the Republican Party, they are the wing that is halfway decent. Unfortunately, they don't always get the support that I feel is, let's say, warranted if you actually or the people that were members of the party actually gave a crap about advancing, let's say, freedom and liberty and private property rights in our own like individual lifetimes, right? And this type of stuff is what's going to be required. And I hate that. And I love the point that you bring up about it's kind of supposed to look messy like that if it is going to work. I mean, I can use that term very loosely in the way that you think that it should. That's what it's supposed to look like. But right now, you know, government is this sort of federal government in itself and how they legislate is just this real kind of bizarre way. And everybody knows it's screwed up like this constituents even know that it screwed up. To effect that, to your point about the bills, we have this these massive bills where they're thrown so much stuff in there that has been going on for a long time. But it's not that it's just been going on for as long as it has. It's that everybody knows that it has, including the people that vote. And what has been done to sort of change it? Well, nothing. And you know, the voters kind of look at it like as they deal with this situation, they do it with, let's say, previous elections as well. And that is, well, you have to make the concessions because the other side of when at what point do you have to conceit? And this is this is the harsh reality. And this is what I believe after looking at this for as long as I have been. Maybe you are going to have to hold an ale for a short period of time in order to win over the longer period of time, because like to everybody's point, we know it's a swamp. We know it's dirty. We know it's screwed up. So but if we can't do anything to change it, because it's like, well, you got to make a concession because if you don't, whether they're going to win, and it comes to the primary, there's nothing changed. Then it comes to the actual elections, nothing changes. Well, how can we expect it to change? What do I say is the term of insanity or what that actually means? You know what I mean? That's what it is that we're doing. So it's more of a harsh reality. I like that there's that sort of internal conflict. It absolutely needs to happen. And the minute that we start looking at, this is the first time that I can remember in recent histories, where we looked at that internal conflict as something that should have happened. And it's healthy, as opposed to have generally any other time it goes on, it's like, well, you're, you must want the Democrats to just win and get it, get it in the way. Yeah, now it's like, yeah, let the conflict happen and let's sort it out after that. Well, if you go back to this whole uniparty, nonsense, big government notion, which is what I think we're looking at here, then you have these renegades that come in and say, well, we need to do things a little bit differently. And these people are suddenly look as they're traitorous or treacherous. They're terrorists. The problem that I have with the GOP, there's many, but the problem I have with the GOP and the reason I don't align myself with them by and large is because they're never ready for anything. Look at what happened when Donald Trump got elected president, they weren't ready to overturn Obamacare. They didn't have an alternative solution to that. And so we're still stuck with this nonsense. They weren't ready for, you know, they weren't ready to, they just went with the person who they thought has always been there, Kevin McCarthy. They weren't willing to think outside of the box and say, okay, obviously we saw this, whatever you want to call it, maga movement, America first movement, this, this group of people who put Donald Trump in office and then, you know, again, they wanted to so far move themselves away from being aligned with the insurrectionists. Let's go back to the old GOP status quo. Fortunately, there were some people with some balls who were willing to say no, we're, we're, the values stay the same, no matter how many, you know, deals you trumped up charges you bring against people who so-called are America first. We're going to stand our ground on this thing. I seem to recall when the, the Democrats used the party of no. Remember when they called, oh, they're just the party of no. They're just, I'm like, yeah, I wear that with a badge of honor. If we think that your ideas are crappy, of course we should be the party of no. And they just continue to, to purport that like they should, as you pointed out, Eric, they should have this relationship where like everyone just goes and locks up with whatever the majority thinks or whatever, you know, most of the, and it's like, why the hell are we sending people here? What was it that I texted you the other night while I'm watching this stuff and you had a life? Like I said, you're sitting there with your husband enjoying your world. I'm sitting there alone on a couch watching this. Watching these men. Elle's under a cuz of your Cortez. Jeff Rades. I'm watching this crap. And I texted you, I said, I wish I was, what was it? Is arrogant? Mm hmm. As Matthew Gates, at least a pierced me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know if he isn't real. I've been around him a few times. Lots of little, what's up? But I've been around like, but I'm like, this is a smug dude. Like, I wish I could give that much. I don't give a. I know. And you were like, what's he doing? I said, breathing? Just, I get it why people say he's got to face people on a punch. He's, but like, but he ain't wrong. He's not regard. He's great. And they took, it made me so mad listening back to Hannity's exchange with Lauren Bobert. And Hannity's a punk. God, it's like, he's a punk. And again, I'm sorry, President Trump, I'm not sorry, President Trump owes these people an apology. Sean Hannity owes these people an apology because remember Trump had, what is it? There does, Brett Hume, the fourth or fifth vote, he was already like, they need to get in line with Kevin McCarthy and look how much more they accomplished taking heat from their own freaking side. Yeah. Don't get me started on the Fox news talking heads. God, that bunch of rereads, they're right. And they right, they lock step with them. Who needs enemies with friends like these, which is again, why none of us consider ourselves at this table, consider ourselves members of the Republican Party.

Joe Biden got a watered down version of the border crisis in El Paso, Texas over the weekend, leading up to his visit, the Border Patrol Union slammed the president because of reports that the state and local authorities were ramping up detentions and cleaning up the migrant encampments ahead of his arrival. I said, El Paso is being cleared up as if nothing unusual ever happened here. Just in time for Biden's visit to the border, it turns out they can actually move these people when they want to because they don't want the optics to look bad. The tweet was posted after a report by El Paso matters that said large crowds of migrants had been detained in El Paso by Border Patrol agents overnight on Wednesday. Later reports suggested that the Border Patrol and local police ramped up these patrols and detentions in El Paso ahead of that scheduled visit. I want to play for you a clip from the El Paso news talking about how they had been cleaning up that area, that they were perfectly fine to just leave with a bunch of homeless illegal immigrants up until the president visited the area watch. Of course, this area, it was had a lot of police presence. We've been reporting in the past couple of weeks of police coming here. They've been arresting people for maybe paraphernalia. They had access to marijuana. Those types of arrests, we spoke to one woman. We asked her, have people been cleaning this area in preparation for President Biden's visit? One woman did tell us that yes, the city, seen city officials or city employees out here cleaning the area in preparation to President Biden's visit. Now, I also want to throw into the conversation Greg Abbott greeted Joe Biden when he got here. He handed him a strongly worded letter that I'm sure just really, really railed into all of Joe Biden's lax border policies that we know have been affecting, you know, border states the most. Texas, Arizona, California. I'm sure whatever he said is really going to change things. But Greg Abbott said that the Biden administration didn't call him before his border visit, before Joe's border visit, just sent him a last minute random email. Here's that. During this entire time, Joe Biden has not called me. He did not call me. Nor is staff called and let us know either about his visit or to invite us until last night. We got a random email to one of my staff members asking if I would be there to meet him on the tarmac. And so they have failed to communicate. And listen, this visit is about two years too later, about $20 billion short of what needs to be done. All he's going to do down there is rearrange the chairs on the deck of the Titanic. He's not going to achieve any solutions that will make the border safer, more secure and stop illegal immigration. Yeah, I'm sorry. But like, I can't stomach Greg Abbott of all people sitting up there talking about how horrible Joe Biden's been on the border. What the hell have you done? Because all I heard him do was say that he was going to declare an invasion and all of the as if all of these things were going to change. And nothing has changed. He talks the top. He but he doesn't follow up. You can't be anyway. You can't. Hey, let me bring this back on before you get canceled. Okay, let me bring this back online. First of all, Greg Abbott's the best governor Texas ever had. Oh, okay. Let me this is what I hear every day. This is what I hear every I made a mistake. He should never have run against Greg Abbott. He is the best governor tech. I hear it every day. He's the best. And I'm like, why? Well, because he's called it an invasion. Well, how did that do two weeks ago? He was on Tucker Carlson putting up more wall panels, more stock photos of the wall panels on private property. You know, there's three of them right there together. He's just, I think he's tearing them down and putting them right back up. It's like a kid playing, you know, in the playground, you tear it down, build right back up. And it's like, look, we're building the wall. You three panels. You got 60 feet of panel wall panel in there. So you're right. The hypocrisy of Greg Abbott, you know, whatever. But Joe Biden coming to town on a two hour layover, which is in essence, what it was in El Paso on his way to Mexico City to see what's going on. And you're right. You bring up a good point. Suddenly they found Reese to to arrest these people and detain them elsewhere. Who knew they had it in them? I mean, suddenly, apparently if you want to clean it up, you can clean it up because I've seen some pictures that look similar to this shot you got going right here. But at the wall, I've seen it at the bus station. There's other places on the street there in El Paso. And then, you know, within 24 to 48 hours later, I mean, those are clean streets. I don't know if they ran the sweeper through there and what they did. But man, those people, boom, I mean, they got gone. Yeah. Interesting how they can and it turns out they can enforce the law. You know what they did? The hired Mexicans clean up streets. That's what happened right there. They got it done. We are hard workers. I will say that. Clean yourself up. It doesn't at all surprise me that, you know, obviously with the president coming here and you want to make sure things look very good for him getting everything cleaned up. But the whole avid point, I mean, obviously, I don't differ necessarily on the issue because obviously, I think I probably despise them more than anybody here. But it's more so. I don't know. This man ran against you. Yeah, that's true. I don't got it. I don't got it. I don't got the years of his life. About $1 million invested in that hate. I don't know. Yeah, that's true. That is a great point. But, you know, until I think Texas, let me say this, Texas of all states, this is a little bit of a tangent, but it do whatever I always go on tangents on the show. Texas of all states is one of those, if not the most equipped in any given subject to tell the federal government to go screw themselves. It's because of its economy, because even its location, because it is still by the Gulf or whatever. So even in terms of like shipments and trade and all that, it's basically set up with own power grid. It's set up for success to say y'all go screw themselves. And even though this is the one subject that I think even conservatives will look at the of the guy, the Texas government, and its governor and say, look, of all issues that we would say, please go tell them to screw themselves on, immigration is certainly the one. I think I apply to literally everything else, because obviously I want the federal government dissolved. I can't have that. I'd rather Texas just break away from it. And because that doesn't seem to be the approach, I mean, we do have this kind of like nationalist Texas, I know the term nationalist is so freaky and scary to some of these other people that is kind of growing in this country where people are actually putting pen and paper and trying to spell it out for the normies like, dude, this not only can be done, it should be done and you benefit a lot more from it, because really the federal government doesn't do Jack did me. We help it more than it actually helps us. So I guess if anything, I'm more irritated that he's not using this subject as if to say, I'll even get my support of my, because the other stuff, you may not get the support of the normy conservatives on like the more anarchy stuff like myself. But on this one, I think this is the easiest one to say, okay, how about they are not helping you in this regard? In fact, they're making it a little more difficult. Just go tell them to screw themselves. Let's see what happens. Listen, you know, if you go to my Wikipedia page, Jack, I got one. I don't know who writes it, but someone fault jealous. I don't have it with the PDF. I thought somebody out there, you know, somebody was trying to insult me because they put these things out there that said, I ran for governor of Texas on the platform of the secession of Texas from the United States of America. They meant that as a way to insult me. Now I'm all about it. I didn't run on that. When asked about it, we discussed it. I didn't know that was not my platform. But you know what, badge of honor at this point, if that's what you think of me, fine. I like it. So I'm pulling up Greg Abbott's letter to Biden, but I can, I haven't had a chance to go through the entire thing. But I just, I had to get rid of his voice. You got to put it all together. And that was what you got, no, no sayation. Well, and I just imagine that it was like, if you don't start enforcing the laws at the border, I'm going to ask to speak to your manager. Listen, poo poo head. What are you going to do, Greg? You haven't done anything. Why would we expect that some dumb letter that you post on Twitter for likes and retweets is going to change anything? But I keep looking, I keep trying to look at the bright side, at least we don't have over work. I want to encourage everybody to go get a book right now. It's by Brian McLanahan. I thought you were going to say a chat, my friend, my friend Brian is spelled with O, Brian. Brian McLanahan is a great historian out of Alabama. He's written a book called how Alexander Hamilton screwed up America. And it talks about, he talks about in that book, the premise of the book is how we federalized everything. Everything has been centralized and federalized at the DC level. And how ultimately Alexander Hamilton, although he advocated for the Constitution or to get it passed, was not a constitutionalist at all in terms of its enactment and its enforcement. He didn't want states at all. And if you look at the federal government right now and you just look at the body language of how Joe Biden is interacting with Greg Abbott, the picture shows Abbott shaking his hand but pointing at that letter, Joe Biden doesn't even take his sunglasses off. Doesn't give a rat's ass what Greg Abbott has to say because again, these guys don't care about the Constitution. It cares about the centralized federalization of all governments in the United States of America to hell with states rights. Okay, let me, I know we have to go to break, but let me ask you a quick question. If you are governor of Texas, do you shake his hand or do you just hand him the letter? You know what, I think at that point in time, again, I always say you got to go to break. I have as much authority as you have. You're on my turf. Right. And I'm pissed about the- You disrespect me. Then let me show you what disrespect looks like. Look you eyeball to eyeball. And I'm going to tell you, this is what disrespect looks like. I'm going to show you. And you're going to feel it. And I'm going to point, I'm not shaking your hand. Here's what I want you to do, Joe. You want my respect? You read it out loud right now in my presence. I want to watch you absorb the words that I just gave you. Don't put a folded up piece of paper in his hand. Right. Right. Exactly. That's gone. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think I shake his hand. No, I'm like a scene. I promise you, you make me governor of Texas. I'm going to jail. That's a given. God, you've had your chance. You had your opportunity. You blew it, Texas. All right. We've got to go to break. First we want to thank our sponsor, Tommy John. So look, in my house, there is just a rule that I got my husband, Tommy John Pajamas. I also have Tommy John Loundware. Why are you all- Yes, there's a rule. This got intimate. No, it's- Listen, they have Loundware. They have like the really comfy sweatpants and stuff that you put on.

The most wildfire fatalities the country has seen in the century, but months on from the event, it seems like the media and local and federal governments would rather we all forget what happened.

In response to rumors and theories about Buffalo Bill's player, Demar Hamlin's collapse and cardiac arrest, who by the way, he has been discharged from the hospital. Really, really amazing recovery and thoughts and prayers continue to go out to him and his family. Yes, I said it. Thoughts and prayers, which apparently are now back in style. I want off the show. I want, I want. Yes. I tell you what I want. I want sensible football control is what I want. Well, let me just tell you, Chad. The doctor has spoken. Okay. And in response to all of us talking about saying, you know what, we need sensible football control. We need cancel football until they get to the bottom of it. We need to figure out why this happened, seemed a little odd and a what 24 year old very, very fit man for that to happen. Maybe we should be finding out why all of these athletes just keep dropping, collapsing. Well, Dr. Fauci has spoken. He says the rumors are false and that vaccine related myocarditis is very, very rare. Also relatively benign. Okay. Watch. In a very, very rare case, some of the mRNA vaccines can cause a self limiting almost in very, boom, boom, benign inflammatory response in the heart, which generally resolves in a very short period of time. It is very, very rare. When you compare that with the negative effects on the heart by myocarditis or pericarditis, which is inflammation of either the heart muscle or the covering of the heart and heart failure and heart medical problems, overwhelmingly COVID itself causes that in a dramatically higher rate than the relatively benign mild myocarditis that you might have with a vaccine, which is very, very rare. Okay. Yeah. I think I'm going to trust cardiologist Peter McCullough, who was like the most published decorated. Yeah. Scientist author of all of these studies and stuff on on cardio stuff who I interviewed at this very table and asked him if there was such a thing as mild or benign myocarditis. And he emphatically said, no, I think I'm going to trust him. Yeah. I'll also trust the numbers that say that since we've had the introduction of the mRNA virus vaccine into our world, that cardiac episodes in pro athletes worldwide has gone up 1700%. It's just the 1700. And listen, based on, okay, so based on his logic, I take away two things. One, all the more reasonable in China. Okay. Because he said, well, COVID has a bigger chance of doing all well than COVID really, COVID was released by China. So let's get to the bottom of this thing. The other thing is he says, what's a mild mild mild? You know, it was a mild thing statistically speaking was dying of COVID. Right. So when you had a 99.8% survival rate, why do you just go stick people's bodies? You're right. Why? Why do we stick stuff in people's bodies? Anyway, swear jar. You know what I'm saying? Yes. So but they did it. Right. They did it. And now we just don't know, do we? Because let me tell you what could have happened to tomorrow and thank God for his recovery and so many others that have gone through similar things that don't get the publicity that he got because it happened to him on Monday night football. You look adrenaline. Peter McCullough's told me personally, like any vaccine is going to affect your heart in some way. It affects all your organs, but specifically your heart, you know, you make a tackle on Monday night football in a professional level. There's going to be some adrenaline. Maybe you've got a heart defect. Maybe you've got some issues going on with the art. Maybe there's some inflammation. Maybe there's some any number of things people say, well, it could have not been that well, it could be a combination of eight different things we don't know. But you know what? I say we ban football and look, they shut down our economy. They shut down everything in the world over just saving grandma if it saves one life. So tomorrow, Hamlin, thank God he's alive, but we've got another we've got other cases we can point to shut down not another snap of professional football until we find out what it is that's arming these pro athletes. I noticed you said professional football. You do have a college football lesson. You do have a game to watch tonight. You do have a game to watch tonight. It's over tonight. You don't do what you want. Go ducks. The gaslighting of this whole ordeal was what I guess frustrated me because it's crazy how confident they can say, well, that had nothing to do with it. But then on the other hand, say, we don't know actually what happened. Right about it. So it's like bizarre. You certainly don't know what happened, but you sure know that it couldn't have anything to do with that. And I'm not here at the table saying that that's exactly what happened. I can't I have no idea. But we've literally over the course of the history of this of this professional around the NFL, something like that has never happened. Right? They've admitted that that has never happened. Yeah, it happened. So I don't know what happened, but that did. And maybe we should at least look into it instead of just immediately writing something like that all. But yeah, for him to say that I don't know your heart being inflamed. It's benign. Like a rather that that no, that something's wrong. The heart isn't supposed to do that, right? It's not like a cartoon where you know, you get shot by Cupid or something like that. That's not how it works in real life. If your heart is inflamed, something is fundamentally wrong. And obviously it because of what it's connected to, it's going to open it open yourself up for more issues. But all the data points to that we've had a, let's say, odd number, increasingly odd number of people that are professional athletes and that are very healthy that are now having issues after this. We know that in the tired, I mean, we can find you can say what he wants to all the time, but we already know that pockets of Europe have specifically banned young people from having certain, I can't remember if it was the, if it was Moderna or whatever, from young people under a certain age, from even getting it because of that issue. You can't pretend like there's this, oh, well, it's just, it's just nothing. It's just red. No, and I would push back and I wish the person I was interviewing them, push back on that data because when you actually look at it, it is by no means conclusive because you will find a study that points to the exact opposite of saying or rather than, let's say, like I said, it's more inconclusive that COVID or myocarditis, pericarditis, induced COVID versus the, the, the jab induced, induced versus sod, I pushed back on that regardless. But this is why and unfortunately what the conversation that did happen, we know what happened to Peter McCollough, we know him being banned up certain forms of social media, that conversation wasn't allowed to happen. So the talking has like, Fauci basically, even though they've been caught in a lie or more important land, I can say this on YouTube, we know, I mean, I think that's what you would ask is what else have you been lied about? Well, we know specifically that the jab was sold on. That's why you got the emergency authorization was sold on preventing the transmission of it. We know, because you admit it, it was a lie that not, it's not my opinion. You can't either YouTube allows me to talk about this even though I'm talking about this long before, back to back, strike champion by the way, just pointing to the data that the WA Joe even had on this, on this specific topic. So we know that it wasn't, it wasn't, you admitted it, Dr. Michelle Olensky, we talked about it when she flat out got on TV and said, look, we know now that it's not preventing transmission. Okay. So what it was sold on, it didn't do. So we have about these other issues. And we know that those issues are a thing and they want to gaslight the entire country and act like when people just drop dead from these hard issues that are, yeah, freak accident happened. I'm not going to pretend like nobody had ever died from a freak accident. But having athletes of this magnitude from from basically every sport, professional football is like as in soccer, that stuff happening. That's not normal, bro. It's not normal. And we to talk around it around the gaslight, the American public is just insane at these people that still do it. I would encourage all of you, if Blay TV subscribers, you can go to, if you have not already watched it, you can go to Blay TV and watch the vaccine special where it was myself, Steve Days and Daniel Horowitz. And I interviewed Peter McCullough for that particular special. And it was just, it was, I asked him that same question of, well, you say, you say very strongly that it's from the vaccine, the heart damage, the myocarditis, how do you know that it wasn't just from COVID? And I'm not even going to try to give you the answer that he gave because he's way smarter than me. And but I did ask him that. And there's so much there for those of you who have missed it. You got to subscribe to Blay TV though. You can use promo code news to save some cash when you do so. But I highly recommend all of you do. And by the way, we only did it just on Blay TV because big tech doesn't allow us to tell you these things. I mean, you're right, we got that detailed that we knew that we risked losing the entire Blay TV YouTube. If we were to put it out there, we couldn't. They wouldn't let us. So make sure you go there and watch that if you haven't yet already. All right, we got to take another quick break. First one to thank our sponsor, Moink.

Thousands of supporters of Brazil's former president, Jayar Bolsonaro stormed the nation's Congress and presidential offices yesterday on Sunday as they protested what they claimed was a stolen election. This breach comes after Bolsonaro repeatedly attacked the integrity of the country's recent presidential elections in which, of course, he lost to leftist Louis's Lula da Silva. Lula was inaugurated last week. The demonstrators, they're all comparing it to January 6th. They overran security barriers. They climbed on roofs. They vandalized the buildings. And Bolsonaro, who has been hiding out in Florida in recent weeks. And I believe I just saw, as of the time of this taping, I was walking in and I think I just saw that he has been hospitalized in Florida. But he has not made any comments condemning the incident. Of course, this is probably going to benefit leftists in the new Lula administration because they will use it to justify parts of their agenda that they are pushing according to political analysts. Very fascinating to watch happen. Well, in that little clip right there that you were showing that very first part, you know, it'd been kind of interesting if suddenly a dude with a buffalo hat would walk through. Listen, America normalized this type of persecution, right? You can't have political protests. You can't because again, now it's insurrection, everything, you can arrest everybody that you can put people away for two years without any real charges or anything like that. So, America has now normalized that and made it okay for big government and overreaching government to do this kind of thing to people who protest. So, you know, this isn't America where they are. And we'll see how this whole play this whole thing plays out. But, you know, you look at, we just went through, as Joe Biden said, July 6th, we just the second anniversary of January 6th and whether it's there or here or wherever it is, big government is always going to try to make you understand that you're not allowed to do this type of thing. You can't protest. So, like January 6th was all about making sure that the American people would never protest or even talk about a quote, fraudulent election ever again. They wanted to make such an example out of the American people. So, I have no doubt that they're going to do it here as well. Yeah. Well, I mean, obviously Brazil's governments are historically. I mean, it's as you would expect, they have their own set of issues. I know it's easy to get caught up in America and the corruption would definitely when you start looking at the history of some of these countries and not just North America, but South America and so forth, it can get dirty and it can get grimy. It is interesting. I was looking at some of these videos. The only thing that it shares in terms of similarity, if we're going to talk about the January 6th situation is that you see these authorities just sitting here. I saw one video where they were like watching these guys just kind of do their own thing and yeah, like the cops on the side and they were like taking selfies and stuff. They was chilling. Like they weren't trying to stop now nothing. So, you know, it's like, do you, is that a, you know, because they were let, hell, even in some of that footage there, just let it through the front door. It's not really anything. I'm going to go, I'm going to go, nobody's getting trampled or anything. It's kind of just strolling on everybody. It's a similar thing in that regards, but to your point, it's going to be some dramatization by way of the other side because they know they can use that to weaponize their enemies, right? And say, hey, this is why we need control. If anything, you'll come out on other side and say, this is why we need even more control because look at those guys are sort of getting out of line. So, it'll be very interesting and I guess it does share some similarities there. Yeah. All right, we got to take a quick break. We'll see back. Last week, Eminem's parent company Mars announced that it will offer a special edition all female M&M's package, which will feature the new purple character designed to promote inclusivity. Yay. The change, all of you were clamoring for purple M&M's and look, they flipped the package upside down. The graphic is upside down supporting women flipping the status quo. Oh, how bold. I'm so proud that M&M's did that. By the way, I'd like for you to pay way more attention on the package to the 240 calories per pack that it says right there in the lower left hand corner. If you could throw that back up on the screen control room, peanut butter M&M's, 204 calories per pack. No, we're not going to. There it is, 240 calories per pack. I think we should be paying more attention to that than the stupid character chocolate candies on the package that they want to make a big deal about. We have 40 seconds left. I'm here for thick women. Well, you're going to be real thick if you keep eating M&M's. I'm here for thick purple women. Watch my show. What was it? Tomorrow night? We'll unpack the story matters. So stupid. Everything is stupid. Just eat your stupid toxic junk food without talking about inclusivity. Eric, last word. I don't eat chocolate, so I'm all good. Man, what do you do this bad? It sounds like money. That's not bad. All right, they're the big game tonight. I got to go dogs. Good oaks. I'm rooting for my friends team. We'll see what happens and we'll see you tomorrow.
