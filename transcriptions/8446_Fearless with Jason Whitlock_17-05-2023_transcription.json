    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Welcome. Welcome to Fearless with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock, your host. Happy Wednesday. Happy hump day. Glad you're here with us. Awesome show plan for you today. TJ Mo, Royce White. Jordan Bowles will be here. We might, I haven't decided yet, we might have a little Tennessee Harmony. We made Tennessee Harmony to Thursday when I punted a bad word, but I just got to see how the first half of the show goes. I could get a little bit long winded and we may have to have Tennessee Harmony on Thursday, but we'll make that call. Fantastic show plan for you today. Round of applause for TJ Mo in studio with us. Thank you TJ for being here. I want to get right down to business because I love this fire starter and conversation we're going to have today. Royce White's going to join TJ and I at the end of this fire starter. So let's get rolling. No amount of money, security and attention satiates a weak man. He behaves no differently from a woman. The moment a woman secures a Louis Vuitton bag, she covets a lane apart. Marks get her a marks. She moves to Fendi by her a Fendi. She must have Chanel. The popularity of securing the bag. Mindset signifies the emasculation of American society. The bag is a purse filled with money, security and attention. Women are wired to prioritize money, security and attention above everything, including freedom. The bag seduces men to act like women. Pat McAfee is the example. Tuesday the NFL punter turned YouTube star officially surrendered his freedom and autonomy to secure the Disney purse. A few years ago McAfee appeared happy with his bar stool bag. Less than a year ago he was overjoyed when Fandall dropped a $120 million bag at his doorstep. He appeared to have it all. Financial freedom, total autonomy. A side gig on ESPN's college game day, regular appearances with the WWE. But you can't satiate a weak man. Disney stops the trendiest bag. So this week McAfee abandoned his Fandall deal and joined forces with the most corrosive cultural force in America. ESPN slash Denzze. He joined the groomers, the makers of cartoons and movies intended to sexually manipulate the identities and worldview of children. He joined the race bators, the sports network that specializes in stirring racial division. It's arguably the weakest and most disappointing move in the history of sports. It makes LeBlanc James' decision to take his talents to South Beach and team with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh seem as courageous as storming the beaches of Normandy. The list don't stop at sports. McAfee's cowardice rivals General William Holes' 1812 decision to surrender Fort Detroit to a small band of British soldiers and Indians. Holes, white flag, cost us all of Canada and nearly cost Holes his life. President James Madison, pardon Holes, treason and a death sentence. Why am I so hard on Pat McAfee? Because he has enormous financial security, a bevy of suitors and he's only 36 years old. He's supposed to be as fearless as Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson and Elon Musk. We're in the era and time where real men are prioritizing freedom over worldwide approval and money. Rogan has stood his ground and continued to do a show that exposes truth. Carlson walked the green mile at Fox News rather than watered down his wildly popular show. Musk, with his purchase of Twitter, has risked his reputation and a large sum of money to protect free speech. Yesterday, when a CNBC interviewer questioned Musk about his criticism of George Soros, a globalist spending millions of dollars to radically change America, Musk refused to back down. The interviewer even insinuated that Musk's critique of Soros could be construed as anti-Semitic. Take a listen to how Elon Musk handled his interviewer. I'm reminded of the scene in the Princess Bride, a great movie, where he confronts the person who killed his father. He says, Off of me money, off of me power, I don't care. So you just don't care? You want to share what you have to say? I'll say what I want to say and if if the consequence of that is losing money, so be it. That is what a man sounds like. Masculinity values free speech and truth more than money, security, and attention. ESPN and Disney are the enemy of masculinity, free speech, and truth. ESPN is the worldwide leader in promoting the matriarchy, the LGBTQ plus agenda, and racial idolatry. The network dropped the bag on McAfee for his bro show to serve as a beard for Disney's real agenda. McAfee's sellout move is being celebrated across the internet. He's being hailed as an amazing success story. He went from NFL punter to broadcasting superstar. It's allegedly the American dream. Selling out is not the American dream. Building a brand so that a global corporation can use your reputation to hide its anti-American anti-patriarchy and pro alphabet mafia agenda is not worthy of celebration. It's sick. McAfee can't plead ignorance. He can't deny what ESPN is doing by saying, I just talk about sports. I'm not political. ESPN doesn't just talk about sports. ESPN is explicitly political. ESPN is explicitly racially divisive. Disney and ESPN have chosen a size on the transgender issue, which directly impacts how the network talks about men who pretend to be women and participate in women sports. McAfee knows why ESPN dropped a bag at his door. McAfee's white male dominated show is intended to be a dog whistle to the white male traditional sports fans who have grown tired of Stephen A Smith, Kendrick Perkins, Ryan Clark, Jaylen Rose, Molly Kerm, L Duncan and Malika Andrews constantly pushing the white man as the devil narrative. McAfee is too cowardly to get in the ring with ESPN's army of race faders. Will Kane used to do it? He got tired of the role and left for Fox News. White former NBA guard JJ Redick has occasionally sparred with Perkins and Smith on first take. But ESPN doesn't host real fights, not on the issues that matter. ESPN lines up tomato cans to fight their race baters and pays white men such as Mike Greenberg to sign off on the racial division or ignore it. McAfee will be paid handsomely to ignore it. That's what sellouts do. I can hear my critics right now. They will claim I'm jealous of McAfee. I'm not jealous. I'm disappointed. He can't muster the courage to even pretend to be courageous. Dan Levittard and Bill Simmons musters the courage to pretend. Yes, they play woke to stay on the good side of social media. But at least they chose independence over obeying Disney commands. Disney is directly pursuing kids. The wickedness of Disney is obvious. Its strategy related to McAfee is just as obvious. McAfee is a weak man. He's no rebel. He's Joe Biden. That is my fire starter. Can I just before you go to Royce? Today was a really bad day for the people who say you don't criticize white men. Just lit Pat McAfee on fire and watched him burn for 10 minutes. You compared him to the biggest coward in American history, General William Hill, who was court marshaled, convicted and sentenced to his death over his cowardice. Yeah. And that, and I say that in all seriousness that this decision by Pat McAfee, he cannot play the role. Oh, I don't know. And I just, I don't do that. I'm not political. I don't, I don't know why they're playing me 10 plus million to be a beard period in the story to cover up their real agenda. It's the weakness of men. And at this time when there's so much money to be made and it seems so obvious disconnecting yourself from those corporate purse strings are the masculine thing to do and the appropriate thing to do for Pat McAfee to pretend like he doesn't know what's going on and how he's being used. Or maybe he does know and he just doesn't care. But I'm not going to allow him to get away with this. This is as cowardly an act as I've seen in the sports world. And I'm aware and we're about to bring Royce on. I'm aware that LeBron James and the way he ducks his head on China is really cowardly. I get in LeBron James has more money than Pat McAfee. But LeBron James has the excuse of like, hey, he's he's in the NBA the entire league. He couldn't make money playing basketball any other way than being in the NBA and being in on their gimmick. Pat McAfee perfectly fine keeping his distance from ESPN. He had a bunch of other options other than being the beard for ESPN and Disney. And he chose to be their beard. I have no respect for it. Phil Robertson here they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come. But it turns out our movie The Blind is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you. Wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten, if you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen. But when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Royce, am I being too hard on Pat McAfee? No, I think you bring up a very good point overall about people's impulse to sell out. There's an epidemic of sellouts in our country. There's an epidemic of selling out all across the world. It really speaks to a crisis of faith, but not even more so, but also a crisis of sacred honor. It's like, what is sacred honor? How do we define it? The morals, the values, the ethics you're willing to live by, fight for, and if need be, die for. This man has no sacred honor. You make an excellent point that you've made several times on this show, and I appreciate it, and part of what we're trying to do with this show and with these conversations is reset what masculinity is and help men understand because right now, everybody thinks the most masculine thing you can be is as rich as you can be. That is masculinity, and it can't be that. If money justifies your masculinity and money justifies every behavior, let's all just grab stripper poles. Every last one of us should be on a stripper pole, and everybody should just be a sellout. We have to re-establish four men and for the culture what masculinity actually looks like, and that's why I'm happy with the decision Tucker Carlson made and Royce, before I circle back to TJ, that's why I'm happy with what Elon Musk did in that interview yesterday. Again, I know we're not a thousand percent on board with Elon Musk, but he keeps doing things that make me think like, hey, man, this guy is showing some growth and depth that maybe we thought wasn't there. Were you not impressed with how you handled that CNBC interview? Well, I've been on a show before saying I don't trust Elon Musk, and that's just where I'm at, and I think anybody out there should have a healthy level of skepticism towards figures who conspicuously end up in the position that Elon Musk is in. Now, with that being said, I'm not in any way affected by Elon Musk in his comments in any immediate way. So, I'm a third party. I'm watching from afar, and in watching from afar, I'm not willing to pre-clude any miracles as a Christian, man. I'm not willing to pre-clude any miracles about Elon Musk and the trajectory of his journey, his life's journey. We've seen, I want to reference this in response to Elon Musk specifically. And I'm not comparing him to Pharaoh because I don't think that he's been involved in anything as treacherous or as sinful or as blasphemous as Pharaoh was in the Bible. But I referenced the scripture where Gabriel, the Archangel Gabriel, bragged to the other angels that in Pharaoh's final moments at the bottom of the sea, he kicked dirt in the mouth of Pharaoh so that Pharaoh couldn't repent in his final moments, because he was afraid that God was so gracious that God had so much mercy that God would actually forgive Pharaoh. So, I think that gives us all a guidance on how we should view people who we disagree with and not preclude miracles if we claim to be Christians. I'm not familiar with that story. That is interesting with the Archangel. To your point about what masculinity is and how it's been redefined. This trans movement is obviously a part of that, and it's just what is a woman, what is a man and all that. But it strikes me as you're saying, the most money makes you the most masculine, which is obviously ridiculous. The most masculine jobs we have across America are blue collar. They don't pay. These are guys in the coal mines, these are guys the linesmen who are up there, these are guys that have built all of them. These problems are firemen. Yes, they're both. And these are built in and you can't pay these people two, three, four, five hundred thousand dollars a year. These are public dollars. We'd all be taxed, it wouldn't work. But without them, all of these people that think they're men because they go out and play basketball, where your lights coming from, who's making sure that that building is staining. Those guys inside the arena couldn't have built that arena. It was men who built that arena. And so we are so backwards in what it has become. Once upon a time, you had to stay in shape that the reason we value tall, strong men is because you had to protect and you had to go get food. Right? You had to go up for your entire family. And so today we've gone away from like the physical idea of what a man is. You have to all these infrastructure ideas. It was actually, it goes back to physicality. And we've taken most of that away. We can have a five foot one guy that's got a decent brain on him and lucked into a tech idea in Silicon Valley. Now he's the manliest guy in the Mark Zuckerberg, the manliest guy in the world because he can donate 400 million dollars to the Democratic Party in the 2020 election. All right, he's a man. Mark Zuckerberg's no man. I've seen him. I've been around him. And so the idea of redefining manhood and this obsession with money, it is what Royce always talks about. Radical materialism. It is killing us. It's, wow, I didn't think about the radical materialism thing. Again, I did this morning just talking to Royce about this. I did think about the sacred honor. And I didn't even think about it. Yes, I am pointing out that this radical materialism, that's what the bag is all about. It's radical materialism. It's exactly what Royce talks about all the time. Royce, go ahead with your point as well. But I want to make one other little small point that TJ made to me either late last week or early this week. And it connects to my whole thing about the bag and how I'm saying, the bag is just a purse. And this is just, next thing you know, we're all going to want red bottom shoes. And TJ made the point to me earlier this week. He's like, hey, Jason, when you and other guys talk about giving people their flowers, that's actually a feminine term. You give women flowers. And it's like all of our language is being subtly manipulated into a more feminine version, a more emasculated version of conversation. And we don't even recognize it. But it's very obvious when you think about it. Well, number one, let me let me touch on a few things there because I got to go after YouTube. YouTube geniuses. So I got a few things to touch on. Number one, let's go back to Elon Musk for a moment. I thought, you know, Elon Musk is one of those people who we have to watch because he is the product of a hyper corporatized and financialized culture. It's not just that our system of politics or our governance or our everyday life, our local grocery stores or where we get our food, the Monsanto's and car gills who have become the special interest groups that control our politicians or Wall Street or who so on and so forth. It's not them. It's us. I have seen the enemy and the enemy is me. You know, we have this sort of radical materialism that goes right back to our biblical principles, greed, right? Greed, pride, ego, all of these things build on each other. And you know, it's funny that at the same time I want to give Elon credit, I want to show you where he's weak. It's funny that a man would reference the princess bride, right? That's sort of like, let's reference some material everybody all the boomers can relate to. Let's be real Judeo Buddhist boomer friendly. And there are a lot of Judeo Buddhist in our culture now and they are a lot of boomer Judeo Buddhist in our culture now. And he's even trying to cater to some of the younger Judeo Buddhists. You know, these are your meditate seven times a day and act like it has nothing to do with Christianity. Well, the archetype, the story that he's drawn on from the princess bride about not being able to be offered anything come straight out of the Bible. Matthew four, one through 11, Jesus was tempted, brought to the highest hill, looked upon all the kingdoms and Satan said, I'll give you all of these if you'll but kneel, bow to me. And Jesus said a number of things, you know, man can't live by bread alone. Basically Matthew would be Matthew six, three, three, seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, his righteousness, and all these things will be added unto you. We've gone so far away from these basic cultural values and all of these people are either silent about that or they're going out of their way to actively destroy that. And yeah, I mean, it's not me saying radical materialism. It's not me saying that Karl Marx tried to reduce the human existence down to price. It's not me saying that capitalism in large part reduces the human existence down to price. This is an idea that Christ himself, you know, laid out for us. And it's not by accident that one of the few times you see the wrath of Christ. And I get really mad with my 501c three Christians who pretend like there's no room for profanity or foul or you know, let's say hostile out of character behavior. In this age today, you know, a lot of our 501c three Christians all around the world hang their hat, the Christian there the hat of, you know, hang their hat of the hat of their Christianity on not using foul language, but they let Luciferians take over the whole country. They let Luciferians take over the entire country. That's the reality. And I use Jesus as an example, because one of the few times he showed a wrath that was uncharacteristic wasn't when he was hanging out with the robbers and the thieves and the job rents. Wasn't then that's not when he showed his wrath. When he showed his wrath, when the Pharisees in the temple tried to monopolize the Godhead, when those who lead us are spiritual and cultural leaders who were tasked with leading people spiritually, real leadership, because there are always real leaders. When those people corrupted those institutions, he came through like a whirlwind and he cursed them and he shouted them and he turned the tables over and he showed a real level of anger and what some would describe now in our soft society violence. When Christ showed violence was with the leaders who say they were spiritual guides and I think that reflects now on us in many ways. Yeah, we are being led by money changes. We are being led by corrupt profiteers. It's funny how the word profit and profit sound the same. I'm just preaching today. Go ahead. One of the points I really like that you're making there, Royce, and this is something TJ and I have talked about in private as well. Royce makes the point of like Elon Musk wanted to make a point to this interviewer and he used a secular reference. And you and I talk all the time about like, no, let's relate all these things to biblical principles. Let's go to the root. And we basically, and again, you and I have had the conversation TJ as it relates to me and the show and my monos and just like, because I like to make movie references. I want to speak to people in a way that they'll, it'll make them think of something. We've moved so far away from the Bible. People used to talk the way Royce just did. Is, no, I got a great biblical reference to point this out that shows Jesus and his behavior blah, blah, blah. Instead, now, hey, let's go to the, what was the name of the movie of the Prince and the Bride? Is that what? Princess Bride. Princess Bride and I'll go to the TV show, The Wire or The Sopranos to make these references to the Godfather. And it all speaks to how far away we've been driven from the Bible. And it speaks to why I get so upset when people try to diminish the founders of this country and people, and we all pretend like we're so much smarter than the people from the past. And the people from the past didn't have TVs and all these movies and everything like, they had the Bible. And so they talked about the stories in the Bible constantly. When they were communicating, that was just the way you casually communicated to people. The cultural reference points always came from the Bible. And it's why I sit there and go, I think these guys actually were superior to us because they were more biblically based than we are. And we sit around and we've let the world go on slavery. And again, I had keep making all this well abortion. And I was like, I can't wait to get to heaven to find out where God stands on slavery versus abortion. I have a feeling killing a baby in the womb is going to be worse. But yeah, I don't want to, I can't speak for God. But I love just that Royce took us right back to the root in a biblical reference. And that's the way we should be communicating. Because you can't, the root, the tree is greater than the fruit. Or it's more satisfying, more powerful than the fruit. Yeah, it goes back to Ecclesiastes, right? There's nothing new under the sun. And all he said is, they made a movie with the archetype of what they learned in the Bible. And they just decided, by the way, this is true about most of the Disney movies. Jordan Peterson with his psychological takes has talked a lot about this. He's like, do you know why the old Disney movies work? Because they're all taken from biblical arcs and biblical narratives that we can all resonate with. That's why all the new ones are crap. Because they've gone away from it. Frozen, one of the worst movies ever made. He's talked to all about that. He's like, go back to the Lion King. And you could see somebody sacrificed their life. Mufasa, sacrificed his life for his son. That stuff you can resonate with grow up, right? And so that what Royce just did a moment ago is why you and I had this conversation around New Year's, which is kind of one of my revelations that I had of like, because you actually do a better job at than I do talking. Usually you weave in cultural references, but there's always scripture in something. There's always Jesus in something. I am my everyday talk with my friends and stuff, do less of that. But Royce just did it for me talking about Gabriel. I've not heard that story. So the first thing I'll do, I'm going to be driving home and I'm going to go find an article and I'm going to read about the story of Gabriel kicking dust into the mouth of Pharaoh, right? He made a reference that's interesting that I want to know more about. And now I'm interested. Royce making an offhand comment to make a point about the culture has pushed me into scripture, right? And so that's the overall point for me. And the founders that you're talking about in the, this is one of my favorite stories, David Barton has talked a lot about this. Ben Franklin, who's widely considered one of our least religious founding fathers, when at the Constitutional Convention in 1790, he, we basically, it was falling apart, couldn't get it together. And he stood up and gave a 14 sentence diatribe where he said, you know, what are we doing? We've got to come back to prayer, you know, during the revolution we were in here praying in this very room. And we've gone away from that. We've lost it. And in those, he is a, his speech was 14 sentences. And during those 14 sentences, he quoted 14 scriptures. And it was, he actually is on record of saying, Hey, when I'm in America, everybody's so familiar with the Bible, I don't have to tell you where it's found. When I say something, you know, man does not live by bread alone. I don't have to tell you where that's found. You already know, because you know, scripture so well, when I go to France, when I go to England, some of these other places, I got to tell people and explain the Bible. When I'm here in America among us, I don't have to. And that's how we were able to grow it. As you said, before we had the wire and all these, you know, mash were a hundred million people were watching every episode, everybody knew all the scriptures. And so when you brought up Jonah and the whale, everybody knew exactly what points you were about to make. And it was a trusted source, one that we all knew. But it was just the most obvious thing. Now we try to think of, how can I most effectively communicate this to people? And we think outside of the Bible, because we know most people don't know the Bible. And I'd rather be doing what Royce just did. Let's push them back to scripture so they need to figure it out. Royce, I want to give you the final say on this. I, you know, I hope that the audience is following me and doesn't think I'm being too harsh on Pat McAfee. But I just, I'm not going to back, I have no respect for this decision. It's not jealousy, it's not envy, it's none of it. It's not personal. The guy is enormously successful, can go work anywhere he wants, have independence and freedom and autonomy, and has chosen to get back further in bed with Disney and ESPN. And to me, it's so obvious what Disney and ESPN are about. I get why some people take those checks. They don't have any other options. But this guy had all kinds of options and he's chosen the coward's way. Well, I don't, I don't want to take too much time here, but, but this may be a little, a little long when to do reference to the other. We got time. It dawns on me as I watch the show back, I watch the show often because sometimes I don't see the other segments or I'm watching other people who I love, Alex Jones, Bannon and all the other commentators. And I watch the feedback and I'm watching the conversation amongst the people, we the people, not just here in America, but all over the world. I'm watching the zeitgeist. And it dawns on me that many people understand general premise concept of what we're dealing with, but they still want to live in the mirage. And it's fitting that you, you know, you've so graciously named me, nicknamed me Morpheus. I really didn't follow the Matrix movies much when I was young and I've gone back and gotten into them now because of the nickname. And I think they're great. I remember them being much better when I was a kid, I was young and dumb and believe maybe you could actually dodge bullets. But I went back to watch the first Matrix. And I thought it was so insightful of their writers that the person who betrayed Morpheus and his crew and Neo to the agents and to the machines, he didn't want, he didn't want riches, he didn't want an exclusive special elite place in the real world. What was his one request? He asked to be jacked back in. He asked to be plugged back in. He asked to go be able to go back and live the lie as though he had never known the truth. He asked to go back to the moment where he was given the choice of the red pill and the blue pill. And he wished he had taken a blue pill. And he wanted to go forward with no knowledge of his previous life. I say that because many of us live in this mirage, many of us live in this mirage today. And those of us that would look at what you're saying about Pat, you know, Mac Fingo, it's not that big a deal. It's just one man who's looking out for his own interests. The whole circumstance of today is just a bunch of individual men who looked out for their own circumstance had no sacred honor and thus gave the entire country and the entire civilization over the wickedness. That's the foundation of the whole problem here. Just one man here and there in this small little tiny decision that seems to not affect anyone beyond them. That's who Pat is. But it's not Pat. It's not just Pat. It's Steven a it's it's LeBron. It's even you could pick a list. Just go down the list, right? Openly Lucifer. But it's not just them. It's us. And I want to put the responsibility back on us. It's me. It's me every day I try and repent and have my actions following a way that would say all the times where I looked out for me and me only. I'm trying to redeem myself of and follow more in the direction of Christ. And it's again, I said what I said about Christ and the script and pardon TJ might not be familiar with that that one of my Muslim friends taught me about that story from a prophet's rendition of the Old Testament where Gabriel, the Archangel Gabriel is actually named Gabriel and Pharaoh is is for on. But my my my point is that all of these things it's it's not by accident that they take those stories that are clearly from biblical principle and use them. They're not only trying to trying to benefit from their their resonance. They're trying to corrupt Christ. I mean, this is the anti Jew motif against Christ God and Abraham. They're using these stories and blending them with satanic demonic child pedophilia to try and bastardize Christ. It's not by accident. So we we can't take any of this as any small this none of this is is small warfare. None of this is our small battles. Every battle now is a big battle and Pat needs to understand that. And so does Rogan and so does Musk and so does Tucker and everybody else was involved in the game. The choices people make today will have ramifications far beyond the local, far beyond themselves. I'll summarize our butt your point or perhaps maybe I'll even dirty up your point. Who knows? But but I'll say that I understand your point because the people that thought well, we'll just look the other way on JFK's assassination. Didn't realize like no looking the other way in 1963 is how we got to 2023 and a president thinking sexually mutilating kids is gender affirming. It's it's how we got here. And so it is all connected. Our decisions today, the things that we decide, hey, we're not going to deal with today. We're just going to ignore and hope they just go away and pretend like it didn't happen. They're going to cause major problems for your kids, their grandkids and their kids. And we can just keep kicking the can down the road and burying our heads and pretending like none of this. Oh, no, no. I mean, these movies that Disney's putting out that are explicitly trying to confuse your kids along gender lines, along sexuality lines. No, no, no, it'll all go away. And one day Disney will start making movies like they used to and now this stuff's not going away. It's going to have your mat you're going to be dealing with gender and identity confused kids for generations because of what we're overlooking today. There's a I'm not going to get this exactly right, but Eric Metax is a talk show host. He just came to speak in my church last several weeks. And I don't even know how to pronounce his name. Deidrich Bonhoeffer, if you've heard that name from Germany, Lutheran pastor. He wrote a book about what was going on during Germany and all the issues. And so Martin Nemoeller is the German Lutheran pastor who has a famous poem about what happened in Germany under Hitler. And it goes like this, first they came for the socialist and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionist and I did not speak up because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews and I did not speak up because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me. And so the point of all that is that these got all of us like what is at stake? Every battle is a big battle. Even if it's not directly affecting us, I think it is. Every battle is a huge battle because the guys who watched this happen in Germany had no idea what was happening before their lives just to, hey man, as long as I'm getting the bag, I'm good. As long as I'm taking care of, I'll just be over here. I'm one of the elites. Pretty soon they come after the elites too. Thank you guys. Great job. Thank you, Royce. I want to keep it moving.

All right you can email me and us at fearlessbladeshowatgmail.com. Coach JB. All right welcome back time for some last chance Q. Although this time we're going to tap into J.J.B.'s basketball analysis. This morning I was perusing Twitter and saw JZ, JZ, JB snapping over J.J. Reddyk's appearance on first take this morning. Let's watch J.J. Reddyk talk about J.J.M. Moran. Again we can go into the backstory of the incident with the teenager, J.J.S. claiming self-defense that the teenager threw the ball in his face. We can go into the incident at the mall when he yelled at his security guard. We can go in the incident with the Indiana Pacers traveling party. As far as we know all of these things have been investigated and no law has been broken. I'm not condoning the behavior. I'm not saying there should be no punishment. There should be. There should be consequences. You are the face of the league. You are representing the NBA. You are a role model to young kids. All of that. I don't think half the season is the right answer. And the last point I want to make is you bring this up the guns on social media. We talk about consequences. Look, in our country right now gun culture is pervasive. It's pervasive. We've got mass shooting after mass shooting and nobody's doing a damn thing about it. So I get why we're so sensitive to this right now. But there's no consequence for Greg Abbott telling his constituents that they should go buy more guns. And then we have mass shooting after mass shooting in Texas. There's no consequence for an elected Tennessee official to send out a Christmas card holding AR-15s with his young family. And then there's a shooting in his very district. There's no consequences to that. So why are we trying to lay down the hammer on a 23 year old who didn't break a law? Explain that to me. JB, I'm going to give you first crack at explaining that because you inspired this. JB, the floor is yours if you'd like to explain to JJ Reddit. You know what I'm tired of? People don't understand, either coach it or you allow it in life. And everything he just explained was an excuse. He said, I'm not condoning it. You're lying. You are condoning it. So I don't understand it. He needs to have a punishment. But I don't believe half the season is it. I know it should be a full season. Like this is what we keep seeing, Jason, every single day on mainstream media, we keep seeing excuses for excuses as to why these kids continue to do what they do and why it's okay. And it just blows my mind, man, that the adult in the room can't figure it out. And wonder why we have a problem, especially in this particular demographic, inner city, black youth. Let's just be honest, which I'm around every day. I don't believe JJ is around it at all. I don't believe any of those people at ESPN are around it at all. And this is a guy from Cookville, Tennessee. And I think I have the right to discuss this being from Compton, California. There's a little bit different. And I'm frankly just starting to be a little pissed off about these cats that come out, who think they've been around a few brothers and sisters in their life and think they can speak about black culture, black lives, how it affects kids in the hood, because they played in a predominant black NBA. It blows my mind. I have the black friend quote, right? That's JJ Redick. I have the black friend. It don't matter. You're not from there. You don't know what it's like. You have no clue what these kids look at. These kids aren't looking at Greg Abbott, Jason. You and I know that they're looking at John Moran on IG Live. They're looking at all these cats that are in rap videos with pistols and AKs and guns. They're not looking at the white, backward, politician with AK with their kids on a Christmas card. Let's just be honest. And I don't understand how Stephen Jackson and all of these cats keep coming out and talking about this is a racially motivated attack on John Moran. No, it's not. You should be more proactive, Stephen Jackson, instead of reactive like we see all these tweets every day, Jason, about prayers, teas and peas, all the black kings and queens that have lost their lives. Why haven't I seen JJ Redick, Stephen Jackson, Stephen A Smith, and whoever else on a commercial tomorrow to create a commercial? How about let's make this commercial, Jason. Let's call it how not to be like Jaa. Instead of how to be like Mike, let's make it not how not to be like Jaa. Let's make that commercial. Why haven't I seen any proactive action by any of these cats who are claiming it's racially motivated? Monty Williams, the Phoenix Suns have fired them because it's racially motivated now. Really? They just fired Nick Nurse and booted holes in two after they just won championships. Is that racially motivated? I'm just tired of the race baiting thing, man. I just, it's time to start talking up at it because I've never really went into it. It's starting to just irk me to the core now because the truth needs to be told. I don't see these cats in Compton. I'm there. I don't see any of these cats in Compton. I'm the one talking to black kids every day. I don't see them, but they want to go on these platforms and utter pure nonsense to get a like and a retweet. That's my rant, man. JB, I got to say that's something your best work. It's a great setup for me to follow in behind you and just say to JJ Rettick, hey, man, what people are concerned about as it relates to John Moran. And it's great that you played basketball at Duke, with some black teammates. Great. You had a nice long NBA career, a lot of black teammates. It's great that you socialize with some of the most elite and well off and protected black people on the planet. That's awesome, JJ. Don't really want to ridicule you or belittle you, but you sound like an idiot because what John Moran is doing is putting himself in harm's way, and he's putting other people in harm's way. Him using and treating a gun as a toy, a prop, an accessory is putting John Moran in harm's way. When a police officer eventually pulls John Moran over in a car, because of all the videos, because the way John Moran has portrayed himself, that policeman is going to be very suspicious of John Moran. Does he have a gun? Is he drunk or high? Does he, does he plan on playing or flashing that gun the way I've seen him do in videos? And so if it doesn't get John Moran harm, maybe it'll get that policeman harm, maybe it'll get a passenger in the car harm. Maybe let's remove the police in this scenario. Let's suppose John Moran being 23 goes to a club in Memphis, in Memphis or anywhere, and gets in a dispute, an argument, an altercation with someone who's really about that life. That person who's really about that life is going to be, oh, this is John Moran. He carries a gun. Well, you know what? I happen to carry a gun. John Moran pretends to be about that life. I'm going to pull out this gun and use it on John Moran because he could potentially use it against me. John Moran is a walking billboard advertisement of, I want some type of gun violence drama to happen with me. He is sowing the seeds for that type of violence and misbehavior that, again, like JB just said, we know is commonplace in Memphis, in black communities, in urban areas. We know it's commonplace. And so we're watching a child play with fire, watching a child put his hand on a hot stove over and over and over again. And we don't need JJ Reddit for likes, clicks, retweets, social media, cloud, television ratings. We don't need JJ Reddit on TV trying to build his profile and brand. I'm the number one ally to all these idiots. We don't need that JJ Reddit because there are people that are actually out here saying, hey, JJ, hey, JJ, this behavior may end up getting you, someone close to you or someone you don't know hurt. And that's why people are calling for JJ Moran to be disciplined harshly to cut out this behavior. Greg Abbott telling people in Texas to arm themselves and use their Second Amendment rights. That does it. There is no clear cut connection between that behavior and these mass shootings that you love to talk about. There's no clear cut connection. There's no, there's actual political and real justification for Greg Abbott telling his citizens, you know, arm yourself, use guns legally, protect yourself from this tyrannical government. The founders wanted you on. They wanted the government to fear you. There is what was the other reference he made. It wasn't Greg Abbott. There was a second reference. He made that he was using guns in their Christmas cards. Yeah. The politicians using guns in their Christmas cards. If you can show me a clear connection between those Christmas cards and violence in the hood, in the suburbs, anywhere, not something you pull out of your rear end and speculate about. Because this stuff that we see in the actual NSE where JB is talking about in Compton, in Memphis, across the street from me right here in Nashville, I can walk from my very expensive apartment building where I can walk without losing my breath without any effort to a place right across the street from me. Well, there's been at least three murders in the short time that I've lived here and several shootings at this one particular nightclub and there's one particular demographic involved in every one of those shootings. And those guys take their cues from people like John Moran, whoever sent out the Christmas card, they don't know nothing about their behavior is not connected to whoever sent out those Christmas cards. And so I get it. Everybody wants to be the most down white guy in the world and wants to be the most down white guy connected to NBA players. And I'm sure all the NBA players are celebrating you. Yeah, JJ Redick, he's a real one. He kept it real for job. No, man. If you really want to keep if you want some clout, I would love to go back and see. And maybe I don't know. I mean, we'll do the homework and find out what a job what a JJ Redick have to say about Kyrie Irving when he was getting beat up over a movie poster. One, keep it real and show how down you are for the black man. Stand up for Kyrie Irving when he was catching heat over nothing, a movie poster about black people or Jewish people's history. This smells like a gimmick to me. Everybody wants to be the cool white boy. And this is your turn to be the cool white boy and get some points back from when you beat up on Stephen A Smith and people get upset with you. Now you got you some cool points. You defended John Moran and everybody waving a gun. Good job, JJ Redick. Sell out. I do not want to be the cool white boy. I go on record saying that. I also want to, you know, to JB's point, it seems like his takeaway from that was like, hey, what are little kids watching and all that? And you're not in comp. But I'm like, I'm not from Compton. Never been there. Probably will never go there. You certainly would have to pay me a lot of money to go to Compton. But I do have a brain. And so I understand what the average person who's criticizing John Moran is saying. And I could break it down really easy in just a couple sentences. Good, responsible ownership is good. Bad, irresponsible gun ownership is bad. It's that simple. If you're sitting there as a politician and particularly as a Republican, you know that you're supported by the NRA, which by the way, there's never been a single member of the NRA who has been a mass shooter. So everybody acts like, oh, if you love guns, you're going to go out there and murder everyone. That is not true. So you're pandering to some degree. But also, it's a message. Hey, don't come to this house. Everybody's armed. Right? They're not saying, hey, turn on that rap song and I'm going to smoke some inward. That's what they're not saying. That's what Josh's saying. And so what we're saying is what I have said for a very long time, gun culture is actually a good thing. There's just different types. There's different levels. America has always had a gun culture from day one. It's the second amendment in the Constitution. It is a gun culture. We want it that way. The more guns, the better. Everybody talks about, we got 400 million guns in circulation. Good. I wish we had two billion. I wish we had more guns. I actually think if every person got a gun when they turned 18 years old or 21 or whatever state you're in and when and got training, we would all be safer. But the way John Marantz handling it is the rap and hip-hop culture. You've never taken a class on concealed carry. He doesn't know that you don't hold a gun up with your finger on the trigger and that that is dangerous. The likelihood of that being unloaded in a perfectly safe gun, no, he's not handling it. It is so clear how to handle a gun. You can watch anybody who's ever taken a class on gun safety and know whether you'll know the difference between somebody who hasn't. Why? Because a person who has always points the gun down, no matter if it's loaded or not. You never have the barrel facing anybody. You always have it pulled out. If they're ever going to let you touch it, they take the magazine out and they check the chamber to make sure nothing's in there and then they keep it open no matter what. So there's so many small things you do you would never wave a gun around in front of a camera or anybody. If you've ever gone to Bass Pro, if you've ever gone to your local gun shop, you see how they handle it and then they hand it to you open so that there's no way a bullet could come out of there. This is why people were upset with the guy on Rust, the actor. Alex Baldwin, right? Yeah. It's like because someone should have had the sense to go check that gun. Someone, right? He got off and all of it but somebody should have had the sense. Gun safety is so easy to identify. So people are angry, particularly people like me who have taken their concealed carry classes, who do carry a gun virtually everywhere they go. I'm angry because you are out there displaying that you are very likely going to have a gun accident at some point and you're making it harder on me, a good responsible gun owner, to continue to operate within the Second Amendment and have our rights because your stupidity is making other people freak out and think they need to take my gun. JB, circle back, you got any additional thoughts? Man, to be honest, you know, the the cold part about this, Jason, is that you only see it from one point of view from from these guys that have these big platforms like Redic is now on. I haven't seen anyone on that network come out and call out, you know, racism for the fact that JJ Redic has moved in his discussion to be the new head coach for the Toronto Raptors. Well, I haven't seen this narrative be pushed. You know, Nate McMillan should be getting more getting more shot and opportunity than JJ Redic, who's never coached. But JJ Redic can come on and talk about something that he's never been around or done in his entire life. And everyone's going to think he's the guy that knows what he's talking about because he's on ESPN. I just this is the this is my take to end this thing, Jason. I appreciate you having me on. Marant will have to come to LA. And guess what? Guns aren't allowed in LA in the car. And he's going to now carry a gun, similar to what you were saying. And guess what? He's carrying a gun now because there's LA gangsters out here calling Jaa out if you haven't seen the videos. And they're now calling him out that you've been put on notice Jaa because you're throwing up certain neighborhoods on TV during your games. And now LA gangsters, real gangsters that do this for a living have now caught the attention of Jaa Marant. And now guess what? Jaa Marant, his security or detail or whatever is going to have guns on them. And now you've created an entire new group of or set of rules here like you were saying, and it's going to get worse, Jason. It's going to get worse now because you just said it. Reception's reality. They're going to think Jaa has a gun on him, whether he does or not now. And it's unfortunate, but that is a stereotype that is out here. And unfortunate situation, 23 year old, there's nothing worse than a waste of talent. And that's what we're seeing at all time high with this kid. JB, there's another point that you just led me to that you're the perfect guy to make or to discuss this with is that J.J. Redick wants to be an NBA head coach. And he wants black players, star black players to think of him the same way they allegedly think of Steve Kerr who plays Woke and does all these correct talking points, Black Lives Matter and all that other stuff. This is a gimmick that J.J. Redick is using trying to secure the bag, trying to secure a head coaching job in Toronto. Let me go out here and say things I don't really believe and know or nonsensical, but this is what I have to do to pander to these black athletes so that when I go in there as the coach, they know I'm on their side. I'll back them up on their stupidity. This is a gimmick to put himself in a better position to get a head coaching job in the NBA. Hey, Jason, I'm be honest. I've talked to a bunch of athletes, pro athletes right now, about three in the NBA. I'll keep their names out of it, but they all agree with me. None of them want that Woke speech given to them in the locker room. They want raw and uncut real talk banter that is genuine from the heart, whether it's a disagreement or agreement to those players. They want the real and uncut version of that particular coach or human being or leader in this instance. They don't want the Woke talk. I'm telling you, this is from three current NBA players right now. Not one of my black friends, homeboys, associates, hotness, whatever you want to get into. We want to be hood or not. Agree with JJ Redick. And I'm leaning on the majority on my Twitter and Instagram comments right now. They're agreeing with me as well. So why is the black side of things agreeing to me and all my friends are like, man, you hit that one on the head. Nobody's looking at these white backwood politicians and their guns on Christmas cards. They're looking at rappers, actors, entertainers Kanye West wearing a space suit and red boots. And now you wonder why these kids are wearing it on Instagram. They're not looking at why, why don't I see them doing, why aren't they in a suit, Jason, with AKs on a Christmas suit, a Christmas card? I see them with red space boots and looking like they're straight out of a movie like Kanye. I don't see anyone wearing politicians suits and ties. It's blows my mind, man. And I'm just glad that real people understand it. They see it. And these kids really don't want to hear the BS. They want real talk and real banter. And these coaches are doing this stuff that you just mentioned. They're actually losing integrity. They're actually losing everything that we've been taught. That's right. They're losing it just to try to adhere to a group of people in the locker room that when those group of people really are just there. And it's going in one ear and out the other because all they see is green money. They don't care what you say. But the ones that say the real Jason, they not only get paid, they also win games. And I hate to see pop of it go down the same route. Kerr. And this is going to be another one. And it's unfortunate, man. It really is. But we'll see. We'll see what happens. I think Malone is maybe the guy that's on top of it that maybe is not that way. And Denver may be on a way to championship. I don't know. But it's a very interesting take by you to say that. Thank you, JB. Great job. Appreciate it. I know some of our audiences missed JB. They've been at where's JB? Where's JB? Well, there's JB. What a great take. Now you're happy to kneel. All right. He lost the visor. He did. He did. He did. All right. Go to youtube.com slash Jason with like hit those notifications, hit the likes, hit subscribe. We'll finish. Are we finishing? I can't remember. We're going to go to Jordan Bowls, talk a little Nicola Yokech and the Denver Nuggets and the Western Conference final. All right. Well, I'm back. Let's roll out to Indianapolis, bring in our resident NBA enthusiast, Jordan Bowles. Jordan, it does. Am I ice fooling me? You got rid of the Westbrook. You got rid of the Westbrook, Jersey. I wasn't even going to comment on the haircut. You needed a haircut. I knew that. But you got rid of the Westbrook, Jersey. We're making progress. Charlie, you know what you're talking about? I talked to Charlene and tell her I appreciate that. Uh, Nicola Yokech and the Denver Nuggets off to a 1 O. Lee dominated that game. And then at the end, LeBron, and they make some adjustments in the second half and in the fourth quarter, slow Yokech down a bit, ends up a six point game, maybe a little bit even closer than that. LeBron had a big shot that could have tied it up late. Your thoughts on what we can expect the rest of this series, obviously I'm rooting for the Denver Nuggets. I can't stand LeBron James, but your thoughts on what we'll see the rest of this series. Uh, I think last night was a bit scary for the Nuggets to get up by. I think the highest lead was 21 and then get, you know, kind of stagnant. Yokech is lost a little bit of fire late, but what I will say is they had a good game. The Lakers had a great game out of really out tomorrow off the bench and they still lose that game with 80 with 40 LeBron with 26. Uh, if I'm the Nuggets, I'll let LeBron shoot from three all day. I mean, he's horrible from three. This playoffs, uh, I think he's 25% over all three rounds so far. He was over for last night. He had that three late that could have tied the game up. I believe and he missed it. Uh, you had Russell Wilson sitting courtside. I think he's rubbed off a little bit on D'Angelo Russell. I think it's a Russell connection as far as being off target. So, uh, I don't know about the Lakers. Jason, I'm gonna be honest. Uh, I think this series is just above everybody's pay grade on the Lakers roster, except for LeBron and AD. Yokech is showing he's the best player in the world right now. And though he had a slow ending to the game, he won't do that again. And Anthony Davis has shown time and time again. He has a great game. Everybody's like, AD top five in the league. He plays like this. It's if he plays like this. Every single time. He has never strung together two great games in a row. And I think this next game is gonna be ugly for AD and the Lakers might get sailed again unless unless they do what they did against the Warriors and get a free throw margin of 20 year above every game they won three games last series with a free throw margin wider than 20. That's the only way the Lakers win games in the playoffs best far. So you're, you're saying if Adam Silver calls the referees again, like he did the last game and they send the give the Lakers this huge advantage, I think that's where I land and not so much as it relates to the free throw shoot. I thought this archimora guy played way above his pay grade and way above his head. I just don't see that happening throughout this series. And if he hadn't played above his head, this game would have remained a blowout. He's the only reason why you know, I think they were competitive. AD did and the blind did what basically they're gonna do. You got this Joker from off the bench, not the Joker, but archimora that played well above his head and kept the Lakers in this game. I'm hoping my thoughts are my prediction is being a little Denver in five. I see the Lakers winning one game in LA, but I can see the Nuggets winning this in five because I really think Nicole Yolkich, he's not gonna say it. But I think he wants to quiet down every last one of his critics who questioned him being in the MVP race for the third straight year. I think this guy is hyper motivated to shut up his critics. And he got off to a great start last night in game one and getting that very low. He was the clear best player on the court. Go ahead. I'm sorry. I'll let you get to find a word. I was just saying, I love how Yolkich goes about the game. He doesn't do too much talking. You know, he plays. You look up, you wouldn't think this guy had 35, 19, 15, a sense or something like that. You think this guy was the big fat slug out there that couldn't play ball. This dude is unbelievable. I wish all players kind of took a page out of Yolkich's book and just played the game and whatever the stat line is, you know, you continue. You don't see any antics with a bunch of fans. Okay, the son's owner caught a little, caught a little smoke last round, but he tried to keep the ball from him. Other than that, you know, Yolkich comes out here, plays hard, gets those numbers and the rest, he just lets the game talk. You know what, Jordan, I'll give you this homework assignment. You should probably have a talk with your dad and your uncle because how you just describe Yolkich's game is how they would have described my game as a kid when I would take your dad and uncle out to the basketball court and put that work in on them. They would kind of talk. I was like Yolkich. I did very little talking. I just backed it up on the court. Your dad and your uncle did a lot of talking and a lot of losing. But to I'll let you talk to them about that. Yeah, I'll let you talk to them. Thank you, Jordan. Awesome job. Great job. We'll play some tomorrow and we'll see you tomorrow. Peaceful freedom. I won't feed them. No no cause she has to my system or relation. We just want to have freedom. Sitting on the corner, never been long. I'm back for freedom. Bless, we are living it back. We are receiving all the seed when we are on the beat for you. We're all freedom. I just want, I want to be. I just want, I want to be. I just want, I want to be. I just want, I want to be."
