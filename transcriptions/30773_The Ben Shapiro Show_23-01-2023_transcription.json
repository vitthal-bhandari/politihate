    "text": " Another trench of classified documents is found at Joe Biden's home. Biden's chief of staff takes the exit door and we examine the growing evil of schools hiding the new gender identities of confused teens from their parents. I'm Ben Shapiro. This is the Ben Shapiro show The Ben Shapiro show is sponsored by Express with VPN protect your online privacy today at Express VPN calm slash Ben. Alrighty. So Joe Biden He's so responsible with classified documents. He'll tell you himself So you recall that just last week he said that he has no regrets whatsoever in his handling of classified material He's done an amazing job sure they'd found classified materials next to his Throwback Corvette in his garage sure they've had a few more documents inside his home And of course they found some documents at the pen Biden Center for Chinese donation, but that was pretty much it I mean he didn't know Kate job. I mean, it's not a big deal, right? We were trying to find said last week he was doing fine guys. It was all good. Here he was As we found We found a handful of documents were failed of or filed in the wrong place We immediately turned them over to the archives in the Justice Department We're fully cooperating looking forward to get this resolved quickly. I think you're gonna find there's nothing there I have no regrets and following what the lawyers have told me they want me to do. It's exactly what we're doing There's no there there. He's reading it from a binder. There's no there there. There's nothing to find everything is absolutely hunky Dory now at the time this is already silly once you have classified documents in your possession in multiple places This raises the question of whether you were careful enough under the statute with classified documents This is not an intent crime now. I understand that James Comey entirely rewrote the law with her Hello to Clinton to make it an intent crime He suggested that basically unless you had taken classified documents with the intent to expose them to foreign eyes Then there was no criminal matter at hand It didn't matter even if you had taken the classified documents and put them into place or foreign actors actually got a hold of them It was still not a good enough excuse for prosecution. You remember that's exactly what happened with Hillary She took the documents She put them on her private server. Comey admitted that these were probably accessed by foreign powers But he said you know what she didn't mean to do that She didn't mean to hand it over to the Russians or the Chinese or the Iranians So no prosecution But then Donald Trump took home a bunch of documents and everybody on the left immediately went back to the standard Pre-Hillary Clinton. They were like well clearly clearly he did something terribly evil and we'll make up a motive Maybe he was gonna sell nuclear secrets to the Russians and when it turns out that that wasn't the case as well You know it was very irresponsible remember that Joe Biden said this right? It was super irresponsible and the legal standard is your responsibility if you're irresponsible with classified documents Then you must pay the price well the problem is that Joe Biden sure He's now quote-unquote abiding by statute in turning over the documents once they have been found although got to say I'm suspicious as to why these documents were found now This is a very serious question The vice president of the United States has been in the Senate of the United States before that since the 1970s That dude has been in the US government in positions of high elected power since well before I was born So why now are we finding these documents? Why were his lawyers searching the documents? This was a real question Again the suggestion was that when the Penn Biden Center for Chinese grift was closing down The suggestion was that it was just basically like the interns in the closet were going through the old papers and they found this classified stuff one Isn't that a problem mean they don't have classified? Approval there have any sort of actual top security standard too It wasn't actually interns who found it in the closet was lawyers which raises the question when you move do you have your lawyers search your old boxes? Or do you typically have some schlub move your boxes or you move them yourself or you call your unfortunate friend on the weekend and force him to move the stuff So if you are cleaning out Penn Biden Center for Chinese donations Why exactly are your lawyers going through that and then why are they going through your garage? And then why are they going through your house? The real answer here by the way is that Joe Biden probably had his lawyers going through these documents knowing There were about to be a bunch of Republican investigations that were going to request Some sort of perusal of all of his old documents and they were gonna find those so he's like okay I'm gonna activate my lawyers now and they're gonna go look through all of the documents. Okay fine All of this suggests of course that the standard that was applied to Donald Trump Which was if you are messy with classified documents, then you should be prosecuted Was going to be thrown away as soon as it was Joe Biden on the other end of that stick and that's precisely what seems to have happened here Just last week Korean Jean Pierre actually suggested that Joe Biden saying that there was no there there Which is of course a paraphrase of a gertrude gertrude Stein statement about a major American city. There's no there there and It's so dismissive. It's so silly. You can't simultaneously say you take classified documents very seriously and two there's no there there There is a there there. There are classified documents there that is literally a there there I don't know what else to say about that He literally did the thing you're not supposed to do you don't then get to declare that you're very serious about that thing Yeah, that's exactly what Korean Jean Pierre said said it just shows how serious Joe Biden is that he's saying it's not very serious Because he's also said he takes very seriously the handling of Classified documents, so I'm unclear what he means about no regret So I'm not going to comment further from what the president has said yesterday. I think he He laid out his thoughts. He was asked about it. He laid out his thoughts of whatever question He was asked. I'm not going to get I'm not going to get into specifics or I'm not going to go beyond What the president has said, but I will reiterate from here That and basically what he said to to all of you many times at this point that he does indeed take classified information And seriously he does indeed take classified documents seriously What so what she is the world's most untalented press secretary Well as it turns out over the weekend they found even more documents. I know I know you're shocked You're shocked. I thought that he was super careful about all of this sort of stuff But as it turns out, he's not that careful with this sort of stuff according to NBC News Six additional items including documents with classified markings were found in president Joe Biden's Delaware home after justice department officials Search the residence on Friday according to the president's personal attorney The search was prompted by the White House not the justice department according to a White House official and a source familiar with the matter The documents at the Wilmington Delaware home appeared to be related to his time as vice president As well as to his tenure in the United States Senate wait hold up a second his tenure in the United States Senate So He left his job in the White House in January of 2017 right this when the Obama administration ended He left his job as senator in the United States Senate in 2009 Um, it is now 2023 guys that means that there he's had classified documents from his time in the senate for 14 years For four minimum It made me 50 years because he was he was literally a senator for like three decades before that He may have classified documents from the Reagan administration This is a guy who says that he's really really careful about classified. I'm having a hard time with this So according to nbc News the documents at those Wilmington Delaware home They are related to his time in government They are found after Biden's counsel offered full access to the premises as the department investigates his possession of classified material Bob bower Biden's personal attorney said in a statement Bower said DOJ took possession of materials a dean within the scope of its inquiry including six items consisting of documents with classification markings and surrounding materials some of which were from the president's service in the senate Some of which were from his tenure as vice president He added the department had full access to Biden's home including personally handwritten notes files papers binders memorabilia to doulas schedules and reminders going back decades Apparently investigators spent about 13 hours of the president's personal residence on friday according to white house officials and biden's lawyer It was a planned consensual search of the president's residence in Wilmington, Delaware Biden this would make again the third tranche of documents that we have now found minimum that contain classified materials And apparently the word Iran has been mentioned in here apparently some of the classified materials included materials about Iran Otherwise the FBI that was actually pursuing this particular search apparently It was not just Biden's personal attorneys this time The federal search of Biden's home well voluntary marks an escalation of the probe according to cnn Into the president's handling of classified documents and will inevitably draw comparisons to his predecessor former president Donald trump Even if the FBI search of trump's residence was conducted under different circumstances So now we have the former president and the current president both under Investigation for classified documents mishandling everything is going great only the finest people in positions of high power in this particular country Meanwhile the justice department again is announcing that they are involved in all this and they are considering other locations Apparently they're not done at this point. So they're they've checked the penn Biden center They've checked his house. They've checked his garage But there may be more locations that they actually have to check now because it turns out that joe biden apparently leaves classified documents Like his son leaves cocaine ridden laptops. It's like everywhere They on the asela And it like a locked bathroom on the asela. There's just classified documents now Turns out that that joe biden at the local ice cream shop Well, he was eating rocky road just left a classified document in the in the garbage bin or something It is it is in crowd. Okay. So is he gonna be prosecuted? Of course he's not gonna be prosecuted. He's a special person You're not a special but it's where you you'd get prosecuted, but he's a special person So he will not be prosecuted in fact What is amusing is to watch the spin coming from democrats and from the medium on all of this At least senator diktorben of illinois He he was at least honest enough to say yeah biden has lost the high ground here It's gonna be very difficult for biden to claim that that he is morally superior to president trump when the dude is Apparently leaving classified documents like hansel was leaving Breadcrumbs through the forest. It's insane. Here we go. It's senator diktorben Do you fear that because of that the current president has kind of lost the high ground on this notion of classified information being where it shouldn't be Well, of course Let's be honest about it When that information is found it diminishes the stature of Any person who is in position of it because not supposed to happen Whether it was a the fault of a staffer or attorney it makes no difference the elected official bears ultimate responsibility Wow good good for a good for diktorben that diktorben is actually being less of a person than cnn's pamla brown Over the weekend cnn's pamla brown asked a republican congressperson about trump versus biden she like well, you know the difference don't you you do You know the difference here we go This this inequality this this hypocritical Aspect especially from president biden having condemned trump and then having done the same thing right and he did I mean he did condemn it and we have scrutinized that on this show that he said it was really irresponsible what trump did And now there have been approximately 20 classified documents found at various properties and certainly he has been under scrutiny But you know if you're being intellectually honest with yourself the key difference here that Trump and his team defied a subpoena They said they had turned over everything and yet evidence developed through the course of the investigation that classified documents were being moved Which started this obstruction of justice investigation Okay, but that's not a key difference with regard to the actual mistreatment of classified information It may be a key difference with regard to an obstruction charge But there are two separate charges for trump that are apparently being considered one is the obstruction of justice stuff Mostly trying to cover something up and the second is the mishandling of classified material And again, it's going to be very difficult to claim obstruction of justice when the underlying claim that Misclassification of material or classification material that was mishandled That if there's no underlying crime the obstruction becomes a lot less sanguine So yeah, the meter didn't try to spin by this way out of this bottom line is all of this is going to end up being thrown overboard Trump is now off the hook thanks to joe biden and his complete inability not to apparently take Classified documents home and just leave them in random places and the best excuse for joe biden is that joe biden doesn't know what's going on around him On a daily basis.

Probably not the reality is that 85 percent of the american budget is mandatory spending that'd be social security Medicare Medicaid food stamps snap assistance Military spending where all of that falls under the mandatory spending bucket and then you've got the discretionary spending stuff That's like 15 percent of the budget So you might get some minor changes around the edges here and sure that'd be great Save a little bit of money. Is that going to impact systemically the 31 trillion dollar national that it will not but Can republicans get a few wins here? They probably can According to the washington post-op republicans on sunday blasted president biden for refusing to negotiate a deal over the debt ceiling Renewing their threats to leverage the fiscally calamitous prospect of default to secure spending cuts from the white house The party affirmed its political demands biden prepares to sit down with house speaker kevin macarthy in the coming days Even though the president has maintained he will not haggle over the need to address one of the country's most important fiscal obligations Emerging and potentially catastrophic stalemate concerns the maximum amount the u.s government can borrow to pay its existing bills Congress must act to raise or suspend that cap known as the debt limit or risk pushing the united states into a recession with global implications According to economists and administration officials the country's debt now exceeds 31 trillion dollars Republicans have tried to pin the blame on democrats as they pledged to seek steep reductions in federal spending this year House majority leader steve skilies said you can't just increase the debt limit and that president biden q spending like he has done Representative nancy mays republican in south carolina Senator publicans had to seize on the debt ceiling because clearly the budget process is not working any longer It's just the giant omnibus packages now. Here's the thing They actually do have an ally in jon manchin So manchin obviously is running for reelection in short or in west, Virginia He like kerson cinema has been seen as a swing vote in the senate cinema as you already call recently to clear herself a political Independent no longer a member of the democratic party Joe biden is Joe manchin is starting to reorient himself away from joe biden in expectation that he's running in an extremely red state West Virginia went for Donald trump in the last election cycle by some 30 points So joe manchin could be an ally to republicans in the effort to use the debt ceiling to exact some concessions from Joe biden here is joe manchin saying with regard to for example the classified document scandal that joe biden absolutely should have regrets What are we not here? I think the special counsel will do a better job Then the politicians and the political circus it was gonna follow President biden said he had no regrets and how he handled this do you have any advice for him and how he should handle this? Oh, I think he should have a lot of regrets. Yeah, I would think that I said whoever's responsible I mean the follow people accountable and I use whether I'm my chief of staff or my you know my My staff was that we're doing this and I'm looking at then I'm gonna hold someone accountable But basically the buck stops for me a mansion as I say is probably looking at the possibility of starting a swing block with with kerson cinema In the senate of the united states now you'll recall that this would have made a lot more of a difference If republicans had not actually done so poorly in the united states senatorial election last time However, it would make a difference mansion and cinema actually formed sort of their own block that make a very large scale difference against joe biden Manchin actually says he might not run as a democrat next time You run for office in 2024 You're gonna run as a democrat Check out the made a decision what i'm gonna do in 2020 for I got two years ahead of me now to do the best I can for the state And for my country what are what's on the table is reelection on the table Everything's on the table is running for governor on the table or no No, I've done that that you've ruled out. I've done that so everything on the table There's basically only one other thing the presidency is that something you would do outside the democratic party? The only thing I can tell you is what I will do is whatever I can when I make my decision what I think is the best that I can Support and represent the people of west Virginia But also be true to this country and the constitution of this country Okay, so manchin obviously is trying to reorient himself away from joe biden that means he may join the republicans in trying to exert Some sort of pressure on biden with regard to the debt ceiling. Okay speaking of that senator joe manchin He says that it would be a mistake for joe biden not to negotiate on the debt ceiling He says listen we could come to some sort of deal here stop pretending that there's no deal to be cut at all president biden Let's turn to the debt ceiling. Yeah, the white house says that they want congress to pass a clean debt ceiling entries Um no negotiations with republicans at all. Is that a mistake? I think it's a mistake because we have to negotiate. This is a this is a democracy that we have We have a two-party system as if you will and we should be able to talk and find out where our differences are and if they're A reconcilable then you have to move on from there and let the people make their decisions Manchin happens to be correct about this. It's always funny how the language becomes you're holding somebody hostage When a negotiation takes place that you just don't like so the white house is gerryd bernstein who's on the chief I believe is the chief economic Advisor to president biden. He says the gop can't hold the economy hostage over the debt Well, it doesn't work both ways isn't joe biden holding the economy hostage over the debt He's saying he literally will not negotiate on spending at all unless he's able to just raise the debt limit So which side is being intransigent the answer is both sides are being intransigent Frank pretend that one side is being intransigent the other side is not as ridiculous The difference is the republic Republicans are being intransigent in the interest of the future of the country by attempting to at least lower the $31 trillion debt jubins like I want to spend as much money as I want and if you won't let me take out another credit card Well, then you're holding the country hostage. Here's gerry bernstein at making that particular case Why won't the white house Initiate some conversations over the debt limit kevin macarthi signed an increase Without any negotiations with any conditions three times under president trump So if they want to talk about fiscal responsibility bring it on if they want to Hold the uh the economy hostage and threaten default Threaten the default of force cuts in social security and medicare. Nope. He's not there for that Okay, so i'm just confused for a second You're telling me that the republicans moved with trump to raise the debt ceiling with and did it in clean fashion And you're surprised that they're putting some sort of pressure on joe biden Why What wouldn't democrats presumably do the same thing if they'd been in control of congress? Well, president trump was president Stop pretending that this is about principle. It's not okay What this is really about is that the democrats constantly wants to increase the amount of money they are spending no matter the consequences They do have the help of the press in this the new york times ran a piece over the weekend titled how the u.s Government amassed 31 trillion dollars in debts their answer was tax cuts Okay guys, it's not the tax cuts. It's the spending it's the spending Pretending that allowing the american people to keep their own money is what contributes to the debt as opposed to you know spending money You don't have That's ridiculous. This is like your parents give you a 20 dollar allowance. You the go and you spend $50 They're like, well, this is really my parents fault for not giving me a $40 allowance. No, it's your fault for spending $50 I'm sorry. You can't pretend that your parents keeping their own money Somehow alleviates your responsibility for spending within your makings Okay, the american people are not there to subsidize your your drug like spending habit over at the federal government but according to the new york times That's exactly what they're there for most money actually according to the new york times belongs fundamentally to the federal government And they allow you to keep some every so often so a tax cut is really the problem According to the new york times quote america's debt is now six times what it was at the start of the 21st century It is the largest it has been compared with the size of the u.s economy since world war two It's projected to grow an average of about 1.3 trillion dollars a year for the next decade United States hit its 31.4 trillion dollar legal limit on borrowing this past week putting washington on the brink of another fiscal showdown Republicans are refusing to raise that limit unless president biden agrees to steep spending cuts echoing a partisan standoff that has played out multiple times in the Past two decades but america's ballooning debt is the result of choices made by both republicans and democrats since 2000 politicians from both parties have made a habit of borrowing money to finance wars tax cuts expanded federal spending care for baby boomers and emergency measures to help the nation endure to debilitating recessions There have been bipartisan tax cuts and bipartisan spending increases driving that growth said mia mcgittis president of the committee for a responsible federal budget And perhaps the preeminent deficit hawk in washington It's not the simple story of republicans cut taxes and democrats grow spending actually they all like to do all of it Well, no republicans like to cut taxes and and grow spending and democrats just like to grow the spending They don't like to cut the taxes So again democrats don't want to raise the taxes to like norwegian levels They're not interested in the sort of scandinavian tax program that bernie sanders has on tap But pretending that this is about the tax cuts as opposed to the spending habit that both parties have engaged in for literally decades is really really silly And again puts the onus on the american people to fund all of this when the onus really should be on the federal government to cut Now at a certain point the american people are going to have to take responsibility For the fact that they keep saying that they want the spending cut and then they refuse to name exactly what kind of spending They wish to have cut but a negotiation should take place and good for it germanchin and good for the republicans for at least saying they want to do that The question is what concessions can they say that they will try to exact from president biden? This is an opportunity to point out specific things they want joe biden to do And then they should say to him you're willing to sink the american economy because you won't cut x y and z Where x y and z are unpopular programs? That is the way that you do all of this meanwhile joe biden continues to happy talk his way Through what is an economic downturn? Joe biden over the weekend says our plan is working guys the plan is doing great Well that that comes to surprise to the 12 000 members of the google team who were cut over the weekend Now two years in is clearer than ever that our plans work and we're building the economy from the bottom up in the middle out Not just the top down i'm sorry He's so boring everything he says is just a terrible bumper sticker The bottom out in the middle end and the and the top down and the and the outside in and inside out and Move it all about Meanwhile larry summers the former treasury secretary under belklyn he points out the real problem here Which is that the federal reserve looks as though it is slowing its rate of interest rate increases The the idea here presumably is that well, you know those those inflation rates are coming down They're coming down fast so they should be real careful about increasing those interest rates and larry summers is like guys You are going to miss that target here. You're not going to be able to land the plane You are going to increase the interest rates, but you're going to do so at too too low a rate To actually curb the inflation you're going to end up with stagflation again Here's larry summers who's the only person who happened to be right on this over the course of the last couple of years Transcitary factors have contributed to the declines that we have seen in inflation and as in many journeys The last part of the journey is often the hardest and that's true with respect to a return to the inflation target the greatest tragedy in this moment would be if central banks were to Lurch away from a focus on assuring price stability prematurely And we were have we were to have to fight this battle twice He happens to be correct about this meanwhile the federal reserve is preparing to only increase those interest rates at a much lower rate According to the Wall Street journal federal reserve officials are preparing to slow interest rate increases for the second straight meeting Innovate how much higher to raise them after getting more confidence that inflation will ease further this year They could begin deliberating at the january 31st february 1st gathering how much more softening and labor demand spending and inflation They would need to see before pausing rate rises this spring in recent public statements and interviews fed officials have said slowing the pace of rate increases To a more traditional quarter percentage point would give them more time to assess the impact of their increases so far as they determine where to stop I have a feeling that um If they take the current trends as indicative of future trends that is a large scale mistake as larry summers Is suggesting okay meanwhile It's kind of fascinating nancy Pelosi over the weekend recognized that um democrats Basically lost the house because of crime this happens to be correct She's not wrong about all of this She told the new york times over the weekend in an interview with moraine doud that one of the reasons that democrats lost the house of representatives Is specifically because of the crime issue which again look at the map and that's true democrats lost a bunch of seats in new york They probably should not have lost Doud wrote about her sitting with Pelosi quote she believed that the democrats could have held onto the house in november If top nyork politicians had realized the key issue in that state was crime That's not wrong And joe biden's beginning to realize that also is that moving forward if democrats continue to leave the crime issue on the table They're going to pay the price the problem is they're sort of boxed in so over the weekend joe biden for example Told mayor's a group of mayors they actually need more police that defund the police is really really stupid I'm glad he's saying it. I just wish he actually and his party actually believed it And by the way, you know when a cop turns off in a domestic violence case or someone's on a stand on edge of a bridge They don't need a cop. They need a psycho a psychologist with him. That's where we're putting more people though. I'm serious We're beginning to understand this all again And a lot of you are applying for the money and using it for these mental health issues as well You know they're countless examples when it comes to public safety when it comes to public safety We know the answer is not to defund the police Okay, now notice that he's actually arguing in that clip He says don't defund the police but the problem is he's boxed in by his own party So he's saying don't defund the police and then he's saying actually take all the money that you're using for the police and shifts it over to mental health Specialists and then he's also saying that the police are Miss trained that they're always shooting to to kill as opposed to shooting to wound or something You know what police are trained to shoot to kill because there are no one on planet earth can do the jackbauer thing Of being 200 yards away from somebody with a handgun and shooting them the need to incapacitate them That's not real but Joe Biden lives in fantasy land and so do many democrats on this sort of stuff You know when I was coming up as a kid, you know cops were learned to you know required to learn to shoot to kill Well, you ought to be able to shoot to stop You know everything shouldn't be in extreme. There's so the way we train police officers is changing We should actually train them that they should you should shoot people in the finger in their sugar finger And now if they hit them right in the trigger finger then then they won't be able to shoot anymore because they won't have a They won't have a trigger finger or maybe they can shoot them right in the ear There's like a tip of the ear just a warning shot bam right in the ear And nobody then the then the cops will know that they're the bad guys and that's how we can Guys Maybe the reason that you did poorly in the last election because of crime is because you are bad on a crime We'll get to more on this in just one second first If you are tired of the government playing games with your savings and your retirement plan You need to get in touch with the experts at birch gold today See here is the thing gold has always been the most stable store of value like throughout human history across civilizations You can own gold now in a tax-ex sheltered retirement account birch gold makes it easy to convert an IRA or 401k into an IRA and precious metals Text bend to 98 98 98 claim your free info kit on gold then talk to one of their precious metals specialist When you purchase from birch gold by january 31st They'll get a signed copy of my book how to destroy america in three easy steps Which seems kind of like the Biden administration playbook these days with an a plus rating from the better business bureau Thousands of happy customers and countless five star reviews You can trust birch gold to help protect your savings today I bought gold because I was tired of my money being controlled solely by the folks over in washington I mean they really do control the direction of the stock market these days They control the future of your 401k I wanted to diversify so I got involved with the folks over at birch gold If you want to be more like me text bend to 98 98 98 claim your free info kit get a signed copy of my book That's ben to 98 98 98 today Also, you may have noticed that the business climate has been rather bumpy for the past several years from covid to bidinflation and now to stagnation Well, here's the thing if you've spent a bunch of money on taxes and you could get some of that money back Why wouldn't you you need to call it my friends over at innovation refunds if your business has five or more employees and managed to survive covid It could be eligible to receive a payroll tax rebate of up to 26 grand per employee It's not alone.

They said they believed that the gunman tried to carry out a second attack nearby Again, this is just the latest example of syrgus deadly violence in los angeles where they've had skyrocketing primates over the course of the last several years The good news is that the la pd is now banning the thin blue blue line flag As an expression of solid area with police officers who have been killed on the job I can't imagine why crime rates are spiraling out of control Maybe it's because you have morons at the top of the police policy or trying to mirror the perceptions of joe biden Or trying to mirror the perception that it's the police, you know They keep wearing they keep doing this stuff that alienates people like wearing uniforms and morning dead cops It's just the worst. I can't believe that they're doing that sort of stuff If only there was some wearing the dead cops probably there would be fewer criminals According to yahoo to others he black and white american flag with a single blue stripe as a potent symbol of the ties between white right wing extremism and american law enforcement The tension between those irreconcilable interpretations spilled over in the la pd this month when chief michael moor ordered the flag Which was widely displayed in station lobbies around the city to be removed from public view Well, I mean listen as long as the cops have to fly a pride progress flag I think that that in the american way has been upheld I mean honestly unless every Police uniform is replaced with a ymca logo. I think that pretty How can we expect violence to go down along with banning the flag from station lobbies Morissette is order includes patches on uniforms and bumper stickers on police vehicles Violators could face discipline and department spokesperson said on thursday in an apartment wide email Morissette the flag's original meaning of support for police have been overshadowed when it began appearing at rallies for the proud boys and other far right extremist groups Well, I mean you could say the same about the american flag which has appeared from right to left I mean but but apparently as long as some bad guy flies the flag now cops have to be stopped from flying a flag that symbolizes honor for police officers been slain in line of duty He said it's unfortunate that extremist groups have hijacked the use of the thin blue line flags symbolized their undemocratic racist and bigoted views Flag service powerful symbols symbols with specific meanings So yeah, I'm sure that this is um It's a great way to fight crime. You guys are doing an amazing job Just an amazing job speaking of doing an amazing job in terms of fighting crime Obviously things are going incredibly well over in atlanta over the weekend According to the new york post an angry crowd took to the streets of atlanta on saturday night smashing windows Torching a police car in response to the death of a 26-year-old protester on wednesday reports said By the way when they say 26-year-old protests, they mean someone who shout at police Atlanta police chief daren shear bomb told reporters multiple protesters were found with explosive devices on them One of the devices was used to set in atlanta police car and fire So those would not be protesters those would be violent rioters I've been to protest before and see the way that I can tell the difference between a protester and a an a violent rioter is that protesters don't have a bomb on them I know it's subtle. It's a subtle thing Protesters who hit the streets after calling for a night of rage by antifa members We're also seen throwing bricks at the atlanta police department vehicles and smashing property largely in black neighborhoods They had a bunch of spoiled white rich kids throwing bricks through the windows of black businesses, you know in the name of social justice and all Georgia governor brian kempt condemned the protesters actions on saturday night He said violence and unlawful destruction property are not acts of protest There are crimes that will not be tolerated in Georgia and will be prosecuted fully Apparently the protest began peacefully marching in the city around 5 p.m When some members then began smashing property The mayhem came after a person named manual estemon pays taran was shot and killed by Georgia state patrol troopers who are trying to clear protesters camping You're the site of the atlanta public safety training center dubbed cop city So what exactly did pay is do um he shot and wounded a police officer And in the media covered this as though a peaceful protester had been slain by the police as always The bad media coverage helps facilitate this sort of riding and then There were headlines that were coming out of atlanta after half the city got burned or at least after after significant violence took place Suggesting that these were peaceful protests. It really is an amazing thing how the media will go out of its way To determine based on political clauses Whether uh, whether something is a political protest or whether it is a violence active bridge If it's a right wing thing then you have to ban every symbol associated with it In up to an including totally legit symbols like the thin blue line But if it's the antifa burning down a city you have to say that it's mostly peaceful By the way the footage from the atlanta and tifa night of rage uh pretty ugly stuff guys. It didn't go amazing over there We now understand they're marching through the streets of downtown atlanta. Courtney fransisco our reporter is there with them Courtney What's going on? Well right now we're walking toward What we see here traysbank the hard rock cafe uh police presence Swarming downtown, but you can see fire are Working to extinguish that right now We've also seen windows broken out At what i believe was a hotel and over here to my right you can see Officers are setting up some caution tape to rope this off A bunch of people by the way were in fact charged for their crimes. Um virtually all of them are white I believe all of them actually are white So just Excellent job as always by by the antifa dopes as well as a media that seems tempted always to cover for antifa's violations in the name of presumably their political agenda Okay, meanwhile Another continuation of a shocking story that was reported by luke rosyak last week So luke rosyak the investigative reporter here at dailyware last week He reported on a shocking story of a 14 year old who was found sexually assaulted and trafficked in texas after she Had fled her her home. She ran away from home. She was 14 years old claiming she was transgender She ran to maryland. She was then found with a pedophile And or an alleged pedophile and then instead of the state returning her to her parents They said her parents her adopted parents her grandparents That they they apparently were not in line with her new gender identity They called her a her And so she couldn't be put back with them. So instead they placed her in a maryland foster home She ran away and she ended up being sex trafficked in texas Well now it turns out where exactly did she come up with the idea that she was a boy in the first place at school of course According to the federalist in august 2021 by concealing 18's at newly asserted transgender identity from her parents Virginia's apomattox county high school participated in a chain of events that led to that girl falling into the hands of sexual Predators not once but twice when the fbi found sage In maryland where she was victimized by a sexual predator a judge refused to return her to her parents on the grounds They were abusing her and not affirming her as a male Housing the boys quarters of eight children's home away from her parents. She told her mother She was assaulted again. The girl soon fled then was brutally sex trafficked again until her rescue in texas by law enforcement Apparently sage was essentially mainlineed into all of this stuff in school Sage is a slight pretty 15 year old girl with elfin features and an edgy style Recently reflecting back on her transgender identification. She told her mom quote. I don't know who I was I'm a totally different person now. I never was a boy. Everybody was doing it. I just wanted to have friends So basically her school apparently started socially transitioning her They started calling her by a male name school records Indicate school staff were calling sage by her chosen male name and pronouns and at her request concealing this from her parents Sage recalls her school counselor telling her during her first week of school that since since she identified as a male She could use the boys bathroom School records also indicate bullying although they don't capture the severity of what sage eventually told her mom boys were following behind her in a group touching her Threatening her with a knife violence and rape and even shoving her up against a hallway wall On august 23rd according to school notes reports were received from students and teachers that sage had used a boy's bathroom and encountered hostile boys there The school counselor met with sage the next day to direct her to use the nurse's bathroom for safety reasons I Again, they just they never actually contacted the parents by the time they did contact the parents sage was basically gone And when you have educational institutions that are outright participating in the sexual indoctrination and destruction of children Our society is gone. It would be really awry How bad is this particular situation? This situation is so bad that even the New York Times is beginning to notice this I know that that here's how it works in in the world of transgender coverage first The transgender movement comes out with a statement that is just not true a statement like boys can be girls Then somebody argues with it somebody says that's not true and then the media immediately level that person a bigot and a transphobe and a terrible person And they say it's absolutely untrue and if you oppose the original argument and this most mean you want trans people to die or some such nonsense Right jk rallying is a murderer is the argument then about two years later the new york times reports the counter argument that was always correct So now the new york times shockingly enough is actually reporting that maybe schools should not be socially transitioning kids without making parents aware Quote Jessica Bradshaw found out that her 15 year old identified as transgender at school after she glimpsed a homework assignment with an unfamiliar name squalled at the top When she asked about the name the teenager acknowledged that at his request teenage teachers and administrators at his high school in southern California had for six months and letting him use the boys bathroom and calling him by male pronouns Mrs bradshaw was confused didn't the school need her permission or at least needed teller It did not a counselor later explained because the student did not want his parents to know district and state policies instructed the school to respect his wishes his to girl There was never any word from anyone to let us know that on paper and in the classroom our daughter was our son mrs bradshaw said The bradjaws have been startled to find themselves at odds with the school over their right to know about and weigh in on such a major Development in their child's life at a spute that illustrates how school districts which have long been a battlegrounds and cultural conflicts over gender and sexuality Are now facing wrenching new tensions over how to accommodate transgender children The bradshaw has accepted their teenagers new gender identity But now without trepidation especially after he asked for hormones and surgery to remove his breasts Doctors had previously diagnosed him as being on the autism spectrum The reason I read it that way is because one of the things that they found at the tapestock children's clinic in britain Which was just shut down is that there's a wildly disproportionate number of of autistic kids who had been Mainlined into transgender ideology and then mutilated Doctors had previously diagnosed him as being on the autism spectrum as well as with add Ptsd and anxiety His struggles with loneliness during the pandemic and to his parents seem not to know exactly who he was because he had repeatedly changed his name and sexual orientation Given those complexities mrs bradshaw said she resented the fact the school had made her feel like a bad parent For wondering whether educators had put her teenager a minor on a path the school wasn't qualified to oversee It felt like a parent a parenting step in the back from the school system She said it should have been a decision we made as a family The student now 16 told the new york times his school had provided him with a space to be himself He otherwise lacked he had tried to come out to his parents before he said but they didn't take it seriously Which is why he asked his school for support This is absurd schools have pointed to research that shows that inclusive policies benefit all students Which is why some education experts advise schools to use students preferred names and pronouns Educators have also said they feel bound by their own morality to affirm students gender identities Especially in cases where students don't feel safe coming out at home Wait, so why why are educate why why are educators sense of personal identity and morality the issue here Who hired them to do this who allowed them to pervert children this way? There's no other arena of american life where you would allow a teacher to prefer to cut a child this way Seriously a child comes to school and says i'm a sex addict All right child comes to school and says i'm engaged in sex with an older person That's immediately reported to police and or to parents a child says i want an aspirin and that gets reported to parents A child comes to school and says i am a member of the opposite sex and the teacher like well My moral scruples say that it's my job to help socially transition the kid The key line in this article from the new york times by the way is this one Many advocates for lgbtq youth counter that parents should stop scapegoating schools and instead ask themselves why they don't believe their children There's no legitimate room for debate according to these advocates for lgbtq youth. They are your surrogate parents. They're stealing your kids And then they are pretending that they are the advocates of good They said ensuring schools provide enough support for trans students is more crucial than ever given the rise of legislation that blocks their access to bathrooms Sports and gender affirming care Every state in the union needs to immediately pursue legislation that forces educators to let parents know what the hell is going on at these schools This is perversion It is a form of ideological grooming at the very least It is the destruction of children in the name of a perverse ideology It is godless nonsense and logical less nonsense and reasonless nonsense and it has serious real consequences from Every kid who's being indoctrinated into this crap to specific kids who end up sex trafficked in Texas because schools decided to lie to their parents in the first place All righty guys the rest of the show is continuing right now.
