    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast Welcome everybody to the clay Travis and Buck Sexton show on this Thursday appreciate you being here with us 800-282-2882 on the phone lines We're still waiting for a written house jerry verdict So we do not know but we will bring you the moment we do It could happen today could happen tomorrow We'll also do a little bit of To be honest analysis bordering on speculation about what this jury is actually thinking The latest is with that plus we've got some numbers When it comes to covid out of vermont out of Michigan Troubling stuff we look like we're heading into at least in some states quite a thanksgiving period surge here And then the way the media covers joe biden that'll be discussed that we get to as well He likes cars and ice cream and walks on the beach This is from the washing post by the way, it's supposed to be a serious newspaper But one thing that's been fascinating to watch it play out As we've seen the facts in this trial shatter the initial media narrative about cow written house as white supremacist cow written house as a active shooter as an evil doer is that somehow the narrative of Racism continues he shot three white guys. He's a white guy They all attacked him. They all have extensive criminal records And yet it's a story about racism here is Joy reed who does manage it is it is actually Something of a skill she does manage to take anything And somehow make it about white supremacy white racism Here she is Taking the written house trial which anyone who's been watching understands Is in no way shape or form about cow written house being a racist? But she still thinks is i know by the way for good measure brings in none other than The supreme court justice Brett kavanagh into the discussion So it's car written house trial. It reminded a lot of people of something Something that can't remember what it was. Oh the Brett kavanagh hearings And which Brett kavanagh who had been accused by a high school friend of committing sexual abuse of her Cried his way through the hearings in america. There's a thing about both white vigilantism and white tears Particularly male white tears really white tears in general they care now and then as soon as they get caused Green waterworks White men can get away with that too and it has the same effect Even as the right tries to politicize the idea that masculinity is being robbed for american men by multiculturalism and wokeism They still want to be able to have their tears like can i just ask do you think there is an extent of anti white rhetoric that msnbc would not would would not be okay with at this point i just wonder is there an outer limit to viciousness and sadism from the anchors over there i'm i'm curious Buck pretend that tucker carlson or shawn hannity or laura ingraham Did the exact same bit joy read just did but they said instead of white men black men Hispanic men asian men Is there any doubt That all of the woke vigilantes out there would immediately demand that they be fired for racism That this is the thing that i think is significant here We have created a world where white People can be attacked based on their race That is not allowed in any way anywhere else these are the peculiar rules of identity politics and buck what it does is corrode Everything because if you're not applying consistent standards first of all if you're basing anything Let me just be clear on this if you are basing anything Success failure significance and significance on someone's race You are an imbecile Because that is the definition of racism to say Somebody did this because of the color of their skin or someone can or cannot do this because of the color of their skin And this is the sort of convoluted circular logic that we have arrived at where Now modern day left wing wokest are the most racist people in america And there's not even a close second to them buck and so joy read is not intelligent She doesn't make ever strong arguments All she does is embrace identity politics and cancel culture which are the twin pillars of democratic party Uh association now which are going to destroy the democratic party And she is going to be leading them right off the cliff into oblivion You see this with even the left's approach to CRT and the parents who are upset about CRT being taught to their kids You're supposed to submit to a leftist democrat narrative of anti whiteness Of whiteness white supremacy as bad things inherently oppressive You're supposed to say you're right and if you don't The game is that in and of itself is evidence of your racism as a white person If you won't sit there and say white fragility is a great book. It's not idiotic It's amazing if you won't sit there and say you know what? I should teach my kids that somehow the sins of their ancestors fall upon their heads today in america And they are guilty just because of their white skin color. This is the kind of rhetoric that is all over the place among democrats they put these people on tv Who will speak about this as though there's some kind of p.h. D and anti whiteness that this is They create these pseudo academic frameworks for the discussion and quite some people on the left are finally realizing You know, even irrespective of whether there's any truth veracity any reality behind some of these different frameworks for an analyzing race in america If they stay with this CRT Is either a fiction or parents who don't like it are bad They're going to get Annihilated in the midterm election and I think bill mar we brought him up several times again definitely a liberal But does have you can have a rational discussion with him. I've done it before on certain Topics and he even admits that on this issue of essentially anti white Racism yes, which the left says does not exist by the way. It's impossible to be racist against white people They're wrong bill marclay says this is a big problem. We learned about the civil war I mean they mentioned racism we understood slavery and lincoln and blah blah blah But they didn't really go into it any more than gone with the wind goes into it It was there, but you didn't feel it viscerally now. We're doing that and I think that's a good thing people should understand that That's different than teaching that racism is the essence of america That's what people get upset about or involving children who are probably not old enough or sophisticated enough to understand this very complicated Kids are taught and sometimes separated into groups a presser and oppressed Again, does a kid even know what those words mean? I think this is so well said by bill mar and and what we should say also while we played the clip of joy read some of the four most proponents of anti white racism Are white there is a in fact, that's the primary cadre of woke liberals It's typically not black, kespannic or asian people that are embracing anti white tropes as much as it is the woke Your brooklyn brethren in in new york city you can kind of look at them and feel like okay This is the kind of person who is going to come out and say white people are awful The number of white people that run around on social media talking about how awful white people are And propagating modern day racism That's the legion that i see buck. I mean those are the people that are desperate to uh sort of advanced this woke ideology is people who are Driving the the democratic party like i said right off the cliff most of them are not black women like joy read most of them are white men and women of Extremely liberal bent who have convinced themselves that america is a fundamentally awful place And they define america entirely based on slavery and this is important too in a larger context buck Slavery existed everywhere. We have this idea in america That uniquely america was a proponent of slavery and almost nowhere else in the world had slavery It's a flagrant misunderstanding of world history. Look slavery is a sin is a stain and a sin on american history But in america that i think this is significant Slavery was only legal for 80 years From 1783 when we gained our independence to 1863 when lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation This country had legal slavery for 80 years pre that you should be angry at england Which allowed slavery in the colonies when we had no actual independence And you can argue well, we didn't have the full fruition of equality in 1863 when the emancipation proclamation happened But for the vast majority of kids that are in school today The idea that they're responsible for something that happened 150 years ago is fundamentally to me barbaric and insane. Yeah, what are we actually supposed to do based upon this framework of whether it's critical race theory or the the essentially the rhetoric coming out of the left today, which is that white supremacy is infused in Everything about america it's infused in capitalism and free markets and the constitution or government If everything around us is racist well, then what exactly are we supposed to do the only answer to that The only real answer to that is to submit to and obey and give power to whomever is making that argument The whole purpose of this is essentially to deconstruct it's about power It's about to deconstruct america as we know the society all around us And allow the people that are pushing this movement to reconstruct it in whatever way they see fit It's essentially and this is why I do think the term racial Marxism is very apt here because they do view this as A beachhead of sorts into creating an internal Revolution certainly a cultural and political revolution from within america to undo so much of what has Been built and kept this country together for a very long time and create a new image of america that is rooted in Intersectionality and essentially oppression studies And as you point out clay if you actually know the history If one knows the history they would know that there was a massive slave trade in the mediterranean of white christians by the muslim slave traders There were african tribes and slaving other african tribes the as techs and slaving all the tribes around them here in the americas We can go on for the green the robins like all of these years about the jews in the jews in egypt I mean, you know the bible we go back all over the place What does that have to do with how we can? Make schools better today for everyone's kids by adopting school choice right? What does that have to do with the principle that we're all equal in the eyes of god and in the eyes of a law in this country as individuals as human beings Irrespective of skin color. They are pushing constantly the critical race theorists a different approach and by the way They keep doing this. It's not CRT whatever this Version of america as a white supremacist state which is the narrative from the left now Is so destructive and it's also going counter to the best things about this country Which are rooted in individual equality in the law and in the eyes of god meritocracy the best man or woman wins They're creating what the supreme court has referred to at least I believe it was in a in a descent by elito The racial entitlement state and who gets to make the determinations? This is where the marxist Revolutionary comes into play who makes the determinations about what's fair? What's right? Who gets what where do asians fit into the hierarchy? They don't because they're too successful. Yeah, does the lgbtq community Are they to be put in a in a place of greater hierarchy in the oppression studies then the black community or how do we how do we figure that out? If you're trans if it's dizzying and it's incoherent. It's just meant to frighten people It's moral blackmail against america By people who are either ruthless in their pursuit of power or idiots are both actually a lot of both And I also think a lot of it's coming from china You know, they're taking advantage of our social media openness and our enemies in the world Recognize that the way to destroy america is not to attack externally It's to get us so riled up Divided based on our diversity in this country that we're throwing punches at each other in the country Instead of recognizing that we're getting punched in the back of the head every damn day by china kgb We were doing this in this country with direct operations against us trying to pull at our seams and You know, they don't teach that in the schools though. They don't teach about the communist penetrations of this country either We'll do some of that on this show We love our pets on this program. They're a part of our families. It's why we want to make sure they're healthy and live a long time You gotta add some stuff into their dog food though because dry kibble sits on shipping crates or warehouses for gears sometimes And so the manufacturers have to use a sterilization process Well, that's not good because in that food you would normally have things like enzymes probiotics vitamins omega oils Rough greens adds that back into your dog's kibble It's a healthy supplement you put into your dog's food with all the live nutrients necessary for superior dog health Rough greens is a 100 vegan Additive with no gmo's antibiotics hormones or filler So you just add this in and rough greens will make your dog healthier by making your dogs food better The folks at rough greens are so confident your dog is going to love it They've got a great way to get started go to rough greens dot com that's r uff rough greens dot com slash eib And they're going to give you the first bag free all you pay is shipping That's rough greens dot com slash eib rough greens dot com slash eib Welcome back in clay travis buck sexton show Buck i am fighting it. We had a great patriot awards last night But people may be able to hear in my voice Got a little bit of a cold and i'm in the coldest studio in the history of the world here in miami But we had an incredible crowd last night and ron desantis came out at the patriot awards that fox nation did I think it's going to air on fox new soon And did you see this while we're in while i'm in florida i wake up this morning and i see the headline buck Desantis is signing anti-covid vaccine mandate laws in brandon florida today Ronnie is the man. Rony d is the man. It's fantastic They uh, there were a lot of trump desantis chance If you right now buck if you presume that trump is going to run Is there a better? Running mate for trump because you know if he wins, which i think he would he only gets four years So the vp selection is going to be massively important. We know he's not going to go with pence again Would you go trump desantis beyond a shadow would you sign up for that ticket right now in 24? Oh absolutely And i think that's the best one. Yeah, that's that's based on what i see right now I mean do you do you have an alternative that you think is even in the same? Category of excitement right now for the base for the folks across the country listening i don't think so i think that would be I think that's like a super team. I think i think it is and uh, look that's assuming trump decides to run because obviously There will be a wide open primary if trump doesn't decide to run and desantis would probably one of the people running for president But down here in florida seeing the reaction that he got in person at this event and also Thinking about the fact that trump would only have four years his vp selection would be so important I think that desantis would be an incredible choice for him It takes florida off the map to the extent that it's on the map at all And I think everybody listening to us right now would be ecstatic to run to their polling place and vote for that ticket I really do. I think it's the best possible ticket that's out there Uh when we come back we'll break down a little bit more on the written house case. Joe biden has hit a new low in Overall approval believe it or not.

It's an incredible deal That's pound 250 say pure talk some restrictions apply call for details do it I Hello can Joe's approval go Question we're gonna address here at a moment. Welcome back to the clay and bucks show I'm an NYC clay down in sunny Miami, Florida Hello And we are gonna be diving into this because the by-administrations got problems We know that and then i don't have a way of turning it around very easily Now that's in part because biden is as we all thought he would be a facade at rojan horse for a far more left wing democrat party Then what he pretended to be representing as a candidate in 2020 And we see whether it's the failure at the border the rise of inflation Any number of areas of incompetence that withdraw from afghanistan all these different Things that have shown that the biden team Can't get it done. They have to come up with the media who are in biden's pocket just imagine for a second that biden had to deal with what trump did a corporate journo establishment that is 95 devoted to nothing but the eradication the destruction of a presidency willing to lie ruthlessly and relentlessly about russia collusion try to undermine them imagine what Befuddled joe biden would sound like with that going on More fires in the west burn to the ground homes businesses and forests then the entire state of new jersey From kate made in new york city. This is the united states of america for god's sake And why is it happening? Well, the severe storms that are knocking down all the wires anyway So what going on we have to this law builds back our bridges our water systems our power lines our grids and for better and stronger resilience You know clay in the washing post just to give a sense of what i said a second about the corporate media Here is a a piece In the washing post about the current president given all the problems that are going on joe biden's entire life has been crafted in many ways around cars The affection for automobiles as much a part of him as his irishness And his love of ice cream as biden again gets behind the wheel Re-upping quote i'm a car guy a take on biden. That was in the washing post today Do you remember anything like that when donald trump is president about his irish mission is charm We talked about this buck If the media weren't biased This is just fun for everybody out there to think about There would have been Inaccurate stories about donald trump that were beneficial for him Right, we know all of the lies that were spent spread about donald trump But if it were just media incompetence And not agenda driven anti- trump narratives Then there would be some great stories out there that might not be true and i'll just make one up Donald trump gave 20 million dollars to uh to uh the the kids uh make a wish foundation Right, i'm just making that up that story could be out there and you'd be like, oh That was really nice of donald trump to give 20 million dollars to make a wish And then it comes out that he didn't actually give 20 million dollars to make a wish But it's a story that was wrong Right that would have been very beneficial to trump every single person listening to us right now All across the country All the podcast None of them think about how crazy this is buck There is no positive story about donald trump that spread widely that went viral And was later determined to be untrue Now compare that with all the awful stories about trump that spread virally that later was proven to be untrue That's what agenda journalism is if it was just incompetence Sometimes it would be incompetence in his favor never happened We also know that they're trying to explain to the american people This administration in the most favorable way they can and they're and they're struggling in part because How do you explain this? Conversations around those kitchen tables that are both profound as they are ordinary How do I cross the bridge in the snowstorm? What happened no i'm i didn't think about it You know you're in a situation what happens in the bridge collapses and there's a fire in the other side It's going to take 10 miles longer to get to the fire People can die. I mean this is real. This is real stuff All random sentences that are just mixed together that have no connection whatsoever This is what sadly a mind that is grappling with dementia Sounds like buck every time i listen to that i just think my god This is so uncomfortable and our country is in such an unfortunate position that this is the guy They've also created for a long time now this notion of Good old, you know uncle or now grandpa joe that everybody can count on he's such a good guy Sure, he says things little off the cuff sometimes But you know he's a charming irishman with a big grin who likes cars and ice cream They've created this whole story around the guy Joe biden's actually a jerk folks that what people don't realize is he's actually not a super nice guy at all And if you want an exhibit a on this one Joe biden used for a long time he used to tell a story And the story was about the very tragic death of his wife and his young daughter in a car accident Now that's horrible joe would tell the story obviously a tragic event A lot of political sympathy came to him as well. He told the story for many many years Which fine right this is a real life event and obviously bow and hunter biden when the car too they survive The issue is that multiple times in public giving speeches Joe biden claimed because it was an even more tragic story that the driver of the truck that hit his wife's car was drunk That is a lie That is a lie that is not true that actually affected the life of that truck driver Because he then became known as the guy who killed joe biden's wife because he was driving drunk even though that is A lie joe biden said this numerous times they've actually had to do fact checks on this He didn't care clay because it was too valuable a story to tell in that way I mean who does that? By the what happened was his wife tragically blew through a stop sign and was hit by a semi it was a car accident It was not the truck driver's fault But he said multiple times in public the driver was drunk That's a reckless thing to say it's a wrong thing to do Joe biden's not some cuddly grandfather folks. That's just the act And unfortunately he's not even a good actor anymore buck because acting requires cognitive ability that he doesn't have and again going back to the larger bias at play here And I think we need to keep hammering it on this show because I don't hear very many people talking about it We spent years talking about the 25th amendment and donald trump Have you heard a single legitimate debate on cnn or msnbc every time donald trump misspoke It was evidence that his brain had deteriorated. He had to take a Cognitive test he cheated on the cognitive test There's no way he could pass it. They had doctors on to analyze his mental capacity Buck over half of people in a recent poll over half and this is a very divided country But over half said joe biden has dementia that his brain is not working well And the problem clay is that they used identity politics as a primary decision-making point on who the vice president would be And now we're seeing what do the american people actually think of The vice president and the role she's in no one thinks she's particularly adept or capable or even likeable And so this is how she pushes back on it month after month after month I've traveled around the country as has the president we have convened Members of congress we have convened people around our nation Asking what do you want? And this is a response to what they want And it's actually going to hit the ground in a way that is going to have direct impact on the american people We're getting things done and we're doing it together So you don't feel misused or underused? No, I don't I am very very excited About the work that we have accomplished, but I am also Absolutely absolutely clear-eyed that there is a lot more to do and we're gonna get a time Every time I hear comillist speak it really reminds me of being in a brutally useless hr Meeting, you know one of those eight like one of those hr trainings that you don't want to sit through Where they're telling you things you already know that no one needs to hear but the person telling you knows You have no choice. You have to listen I think this is also a function buck of what one party rule creates She came out of california. Nobody was really a viable opponent to her The media was cheering for her and as a result she didn't develop political skills that analyze the uh the best attributes of her side and the other side and she seems wildly uncomfortable In her own skin does that make sense like everything she does feels like it's an actress who isn't particularly Talented at being an actress trying to pretend to be something She doesn't ever seem like a real person. Oh, she lacks authenticity when she is speaking to the american But she feels like she's a Bad actress along the way Clay, we got to get you some uh some hot team My man mike lindell the adventure of my pillow and his team have hooked clay and me up With so many of their amazing products and i'm sleeping better than i have ever before You got to trust mike lindell to give you a great night's sleep these pillows won't go flat You can wash and dry them constantly most importantly they're made here in the usa mike lindell's built a great american company Employing a lot of americans you should be supporting what he's up to for a limited time Mike is offering his my pillows the one that started at all for his lowest price ever You can get a standard my pillow for 1998 originally 6998 that's a $50 savings with promo code clay clay and buck Yeah, it's super easy.

We have Alexis in texas. What's going on? Alexis? Hi, sir. How are you doing? So I just wanted to cover on and talk about Governor ronaldessence has possibly been a running maker president trump Uh, I have mixed films about it. Most definitely a president trump was to run today I would vote for him if he was to run in 2024 with uh ronaldessentas as his vp I would definitely run for go for it. But I just feel like Right now we're all seeing how corrupt our federal government is. We're all seeing how corrupt the Establishment the the system is so I feel like why would we throw our best governor? Um to the wolves when we can just stay in for it for as long as he can and protect those that are running there because at some point, sir We're telling everybody to move out these cities move in bulk go where you're you know You're valued in where your values are so why would we take our best governor and send them somewhere where it's a good It's a good question and Alexis. I appreciate how polite she is. You're you can call me buck Alexis Thank you for the call. I mean I understand I was talking to a couple of my buddies who live in florida now And they made that same argument. They said look if he's not going to be president I would rather have him in florida from 2022 to 2026 fighting all the battles that matter in the state of florida And that's as high of an endorsement as you can get for a governor to be that popular that people who live in the state Don't want to lose him. I think presidency. I think there's a lot to that because it's that's an excellent point for mlexis and also you see how California has really become the distillation of leftist liberal democratic party rule in america. I mean, new york is pretty bad too, but California more than any other place. Of course, it's funny because new york. I do a show. I mean, I'm sitting here clay We're doing this show. I'm in new york city. There's over a million republicans here Right? So you got a lot of republicans around me, but of course we're greatly outnumbered same thing We've got big audiences in places like los angeles and san diego and on the stations there But they're surrounded by libs too, but california has become the distillation I think that's good way of putting it or the the uh, epitome if you will of left this rule florida Continuing to be a place of freedom prosperity Success and people voting with their feet to go there and it it's not a super red state, you know, I think that's it's not the decodas It's not uh, you know, utah florida showing that if you just leave the republicans in charge Great things can happen for your state is a very powerful political message Here's a good question for you too buck florida is like you said a very 50-50 itch state although it seems to be moving as ron desantists told us the last time he came on there now more republicans Registered in florida. It's never happened before there's always been more democrats But if you look at california the full fruition of democratic ideals leads to disaster Has there ever been a state that embodied full on republican politics that has ended In disaster. I mean it's kind of interesting to think about right. It's an interesting test Because as you mentioned there's the utah's there's the decodas, you know states that you know Are going to go red There's no equivalent of california where people can't even feel comfortable Like leaving their cars parked on the road because they're going to get broken into or where walgreens is shutting down Well, because you can't even stay open. This has been a Really almost a parlor game or conversation for conservatives for a long time now where they'd say can we just i've spoken to many people that that folks listening would know People in media conservatives people in politics on the on the right We say can we just flip one city and make it a tested and make it the Conservatives, you know, even for example where you are in tennessee, right? Yes, Nashville is blue. Yes, you know, you look at these cities dallas is blue Yeah, what's the reddest big city? I think it's four worth is basically 50 50 But what about salt lake? I think four worth is bigger than salt. I actually I shouldn't say that. I don't I made that up. I made that up So i'm gonna check me or salt lake audience is like how dare you sir I'm thinking in the context of you know sports teams, right? Because you have to be a decent size city by and large Most of them. I mean I know they picked somebody can be like well green bay's not very big Yeah, okay for the most part Professional sports cities have to be pretty big. I'm trying to think you can tweet us at buck sexton at clay travis On a four worth is much bigger four worth is 800 000 And salt lake city is like 150 000 so very Very different some four worth is much much bigger All right, so 200 000 is what I see here for salt lake four worth is 800 And once this is one of those things where you get complicated right like because some places define themselves Like for instance jacksonville We have a lot of listeners in jacksonville The city of jacksonville never ends buck you can drive for like four hours and you're still in jackson Oh my god, some cities are tiny right like I just checked this out too. The fact check You're totally right by the way if you want to expand to the suburbs Yes, you know and counties and people all a lot of the freedom lovers in houston for example Live you know 30 or 40 minutes from downtown houston from what I understand not that there's really a downtown But you know what I mean from the center the center point um Salt lake city 50 according to what I see here on the on the interwebs 53 of salt lake city residents voted democrat in the last election so there's another one think about right another's almost no red city Yeah, we I mean that's so we can call the conservative city project It's a dream we've had for a long time. You sort of run one city where we have you know clean streets low taxes back the blue Like I don't know it would be fun. I'd love to know what the closest city to that is play uh You want to tell us what's going on in vermont by the way we come back because the numbers are And i'm starting from a covid perspective. We'll get into that plus we're watching for the written house verdict We'll stay with it. Stay with us You're listening to clay travis and buck sexton on the eib network"
