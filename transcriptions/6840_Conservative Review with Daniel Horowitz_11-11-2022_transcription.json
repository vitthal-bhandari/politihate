    "text": " A Netflix original film. The Wi-Fi is working. In the event of a global communications breakdown, do the following. Stay inside. What just happened here is happening everywhere. Avoid strangers. We've all been deserted. I don't trust them. And most importantly, do not panic. Julia Roberts. What happens next? Mahershalabi. I knew something was coming. Leave the world behind, radar. Now playing only on Netflix. Politics without the soap opera. With unfiltered constitutional conservative truth. The conservative review with Daniel Burns. And welcome back, fellow American patriots and Minutemen standing at the ready to fight a new our life, our liberty and our property to fight for what matters at this critical juncture. Uh, your host, Daniel Horowitz, back here today. Indeed, it is a crossroads on this Friday, the 11th of November. Very important time to be alive. As I mentioned, it would not be the election. No matter the outcome that would be important. It's the aftermath. And the more things go on, the more I do believe that God is actually giving us a better chance than we would have had with a great big rep-hob-lack in party blowout election. Because it reaffirms what we knew was happening anyway. Half the country's lost. And the other half is being governed by a controlled opposition, but it doesn't have to be this way. If nothing else, the fact that we're engaging in introspection about what we need to be doing. That's a good thing. Now I was working all day on this fight for speaker to get rid of Kevin McCarthy. Running chip Roy is just an option. Doesn't mean it has to ultimately be him, but he's probably going to put his name out there. But then of course, you know, I'm sitting and thinking, okay, do I focus on that? Do I focus on the state legislative sessions? Do I focus on local issues? All of the things we need to do to fortify ourselves. We obviously have to get back to the COVID stuff. Just had a friend's father walk into services yesterday. He looked half dead. He said his hemoglobin plummeted after he got the shot, hit that surgery, almost died, walks around with a pulse ox and a cane now. And even his doctor finally realized, oh, yeah, these are death shots. This is a big issue. What is going on is greater than one man's freaking ego. So there's so many things to focus on, but we all have to stop. Stop. Excuse me, one man's ego needs to be serviced. I'm sorry, nothing matters. So one feels bad is upset that Ron DeSantis, one Palm Beach County where he lives, and so astoundingly demolished the communists that everyone, even some establishment people are standing in awe of it and it needs to be dumped on. I shouldn't have to talk about this, but I will because it does tie into our ultimate agenda. And I'm probably the best person to talk about this because I'm truly independent. I'm not a Republican anyway. I don't service any one person's ego, whoever that is. I don't want anyone announcing for president now, whether it's Trump, DeSantis, or anyone else because it distracts from what we want to do now. And it implies that somehow we could wait two years to fix these problems anyway. I was also the person fighting the establishment on every front before it was cool, before Trump was a thing, before DeSantis was elected, although I was one of the first to endorse DeSantis in 2012. And he was fighting for our cause back then. Very quietly. He was always like that. It's not like he's a Johnny come lately. So all these people want to insinuate somehow he's establishment. So I'm the best person to kind of give that nuanced independent analysis of what is and isn't going on. I have a column out today, by the way, about the need to get rid of McConnell and McCarthy. And in it, I have a political cartoon that my wife drew for me for a column I wrote. This must have been more than 12 years ago, because it was during the 2010 Tea Party elections. And the, the, the upshot of it is it shows a bunch of elephants and then rhinos and donkeys and just kind of the typical, you know, Thomas Nastyle and just showing how what's the purpose of a Tea Party, if it just makes Mitch McConnell and Lamar Alexander leaders back then Lamar Alexander was going to be the GOP whip. And I said to myself, here we are 12 years later, 12 years later, 12 and a half years later. So that means I had all my four kids, some gray hair and we're still having the same problem. So if this anguish from the GOP is going to finally give us the opportunity to engage in this introspection of what is anchoring us, what is weighing us down from getting our message out, but more importantly, accomplishing policy outcomes certainly needs to be about McCarthy, McConnell and all their people. But yes, Trump has to be part of that discussion, particularly because he is making himself part of that discussion. I don't believe that we that they lost a lot of these races or had a lethargic showing because of Trump. It's because the GOP sucks and it's embodied by McCarthy and McConnell. But it is also true that every time we try to rectify it, he always gets in the way. I don't think he was a the problem. I don't think he's the solution and headed forward. I think everyone is starting to realize that cause benefit analysis is really unfavorable. Both policy wise and electorally, just a couple of days ago, Fox News had an article I just saw. He was touting the vaccines and warp speed even literally now. It's unbelievable. We can't afford that. But to understand what's going on, the dynamic, this is not a binary. It's not a two pronged war where, well, you could say, well, if these people are saying bad things about a, a must be good or if these people are saying nice things about be and they're jerky establishment people, he must be bad. These shallow minded thoughts. It's not binary. There's actually three camps. There's our camp, the Patriot camp. People like us that just want to live in freedom, want to live unmolested by a bunch of trans humanists, trans gendered, feudalist, globalist, freak show idiots embodied by both parties. We don't want anything radical. We don't want to dominate other people. We just want to live normally in accordance with the values, lifestyle, progress that our parents lived with. That's all we want. We don't have representation yet. The closest thing we ever got to it was in Florida and there's so much more he needs to do and likely will do, but, you know, we need to prod him just like we would anyone else. And he won so astoundingly. Then there's two other camps. Okay. Then on the other end, there's Trump and his die hard supporters. And what I mean by die hard supporters, I don't mean people voted for him. I don't mean people to support the America First agenda and those of us who supported it, by the way, long before Trump was around. I mean those that worship the cult of personality. It's all about him in a way that none of us worship descendants. That's number two. And then in the middle is a very large group that consists of a lot of subgroups, what you would call the GOP establishment. And that could range from conservative ish establishment media from kind of the consultant pollster, donor class that they certainly don't believe in what we believe, but they're not necessarily always 100% ideologically opposed to it. They just kind of want Republicans to win. That's all they care about. And then there's like the Mitch McConnell's that are ideologically opposed to our ideology and are subversive and would rather even be in the minority and have Republicans lose, you know, so that we don't win. So there's a lot of different umbrellas in there. There's the thumb sucking conservative media. A lot of different people in that kind of, you know, broad group. And it's important for our discussion because they'll have different motivations for saying different things. But all of them are unhelpful to our agenda, our distraction, you know, headed forward to what we want to accomplish. But nonetheless, among some people in that crowd, it's important to understand. So this might create some subgroups more than three. There's one important element working in our favor now. You see, we've had this problem. I've had this problem. My entire career that we can never get a moment of introspection where we're not focused on ours beating D's no matter who those stupid Rs are. When we're not focused on sub, you know, you know, just just the next election where we could actually look and say, look, we're losing. We're losing everything. We're sliding backwards on every issue. No matter what, what we're doing is not working. The Republican party is a controlled opposition. We don't have a plan. We don't have a party. We don't have a movement. We don't have a strategy. And we can never have these discussions. How to get rid of McConnell McCarthy. Likewise in more recent years with Trump, as he went on and his flaws over time outweighed his benefits, we were never able to have this discussion about like, okay, at what point is it becoming at best a distraction and at worst a saboteur with everything he did on COVID? But it's not. I don't even blame him for that. But this day he won't get off of it. We need to have that discussion, especially when at the moment we finally are having the discussion, he comes out, bashes the scientists out of nowhere like a psychopath, just weird things, and then is announcing his run for presidency on Tuesday. We don't need that. More than my opposition to Trump running for president, it's my opposition talking about any run for president. We now have an opportunity to finally have a family discussion and maybe some people I wouldn't consider our family, but maybe they could be helpful because we have a movement that doesn't care that people are dying and being injured left and right from the shots. They don't care about the pain. All they care about is the political soap opera game. And the one thing they care about are general elections. Ours being beating D's, whoever those Ours are, I want a scoreboard of Republican victories. That's conservative media. That's a lot of the donor class. That's what they worship. That's all they care about. Typically that has gotten in our way because we can never do the surgery intro movement that we always needed because always, oh, we got to defeat the Democrats. And I was worried that on the other side of this election, we would be living through the penultimate environment of, oh my gosh, ours are great. D's, ours rule, D's, drool. And we would be really suffering through the same pain we are now with a lethargic Republican victory because they wouldn't be addressing our issues and discussing the things that need to be done. But now that Republicans and conservative media, they're idle has been slayed in front of their eyes. They are mourning. They are in so much pain. They're terrified that Biden, I mean, he's a nothing, but, but the people controlling him are so emboldened. They're going to continue doing what they're doing. They're going to do it worse. And they're terrified that we have no backstop. We actually do, by the way, and this is what they need to understand. And they're finally saying McCarthy and McConnell need to go. I worked the Boehner fight three times to try to get rid of him. We didn't have conservative talk radio that I can go on like I can today and get support for it. We didn't have Tucker back then. There's a huge advantage. Now, when McConnell sits and goes and literally at a time the FBI is rounding us up, gives billions of dollars to the FBI to red flag political opponents. Remember that? That he passed 350 billion in chips and science to fund the biomedical state, to fund the cartel, the semiconductor industry, and give away his leverage that allowed Schumer to use budget reconciliation to pass the Green New Deal. They didn't, I didn't hear anything when he announced that he is going to give away the GOP leverage with an omnibus bill. Didn't hear anything. It's bizarre. It's frustrating. There is no human being alive. You are listening to that man right now who has done more to try to get rid of McConnell. My wife made me that political cartoon 12 and a half years ago. I was the one who wrote the famous storming the castle essay when I recruited a candidate to run against him in 2014. I've been recruiting against Rhino and Rhino. I've been helping people fight rhinos since before Trump knew what a rhino was and at the time he made rhinos look like Jesse Helms. And then when he did get on the play nine times out of 10, he actually gotten our way and helped the other candidates. And he wants to talk about loyalty that somehow if he endorses you, you're never allowed to. You have to stand in front of him and publicly say you will never run for president. He has no loyalty to his own people. No loyalty whatsoever. I'm not even just talking about die hard conservatives, but die hard Trump supporters that supported Trump over crews in the primary in 2016 when they were running for Congress for other offices. Trump endorsed the worst rhinos against them. We did endless shows with with candidates like that over the last number of years. You want to talk about loyalty? You know, good news in honor of a veteran's day today. Ryan Nichols. He is probably the most egregious example of the political persecution in the D.C. Gulag from January six. He's the Marine search and rescue specialist. Literally did nothing wrong. Not even like some others did something wrong, did nothing wrong. Pre trial, solitary confinement. Almost two years. Now he's not out yet, but the judge in the case did agree to the motion that will get him released. He just wants to work out. Like he's complaining that the guy's wife said something he doesn't like. So somehow he might not be able to live with his wife. I mean, crazy, it's still crazy, but thanks to the just amazing work of his attorneys, Joseph McBride and Jonathan Gross, dear friends of mine, kudos to them selflessly putting themselves out there. And Ryan, hopefully in honor of this veteran's day, he will be returned to his family, you know, as he's able to work on his defense. But I could tell you, cause I know this firsthand, they got no help from Trump's orbit. They're outgunned out man. They need lawyers. They need money. No help. The people that bled for him, honestly a little bit too much for him versus the broader agenda, they were left out to dry. I don't want to hear this crap about loyalty. We can take, take it and shove it up his rear end. But I digress. I just had to get that out today in honor of a veteran's day and we have so many great veterans in this, in this audience. But anyway, it took a terrible election and it's not, it's kind of exaggerated even. It's not even that terrible, but two, I'm just telling you to conservative talkers, Republicans, they are devastated. And that is a good thing. We have never had this much of an opportunity. This is finally the bridge too far. McConnell, McCarthy, you failed us. They could support Pfizer. They could support the homosexual agenda. Literally, they're, they're about to, and they might still pass gay marriage, men didn't gay marriage in the States. That's fine. What else? What else? If that is what's going to take my colleagues, that's what's going to get them. To do the right thing, I'm all for it. But that's where we are now, just so you know. That's the momentum we have. In comes Trump and makes it all about himself. Now, a lot of his supporters are like, you know, I like them both. I just want Trump to be president. It's his turn. It's his time. Um, it's not good we're fighting. Yeah. Well, who, who the hell is doing it? There's only one man. No, it's an establishment plot. It's the media's getting the media's trying to create a civil war. Um, I don't know what the media might concurrently want and do and not do, but what I could tell you what we're seeing prime of fascia is one man's tweeting about, you know, safety advice for the hurricane and the other one is taking his clothes off and just debasing himself. He's the one making it about that. I agree with them that it's McConnell and McCarthy responsible for the electoral loss, not Trump, except for Oz. But again, it's, that's the Trump establishment. That's where they merged. They were both wrong. The answer was Kathy Barnett and they both opposed her when she would have, she was about to win. She would have been, I don't know if you can get past their cheating firewall with their mail in stuff. I don't know if anyone could, but, but you would have had a much better chance with Kathy than with the Wizard of Oz, who was the worst candidate in history of the world. That was extremely gratuitous. I don't want to hear this. Oh, it's Trump or the establishment. Trump is with the establishment more often. There's a third option. There was Kathy Barnett there and Trump is single-handedly responsible for that. But generally speaking, again, I don't want to get caught up in one race because it's not just bet like Senate picks, establishment Senate picks, Trump Senate picks. If you look at the house races across the board, they underperformed. So it's not just about candidate quality. We talked a little bit with Steve Dasey yesterday about what we think happened. How do you have an R plus five, R plus six generic ballot and have that result? Different theories. Who knows? Is there cheating? I wouldn't rule it out, but who knows? And certainly obviously what's going on in Nevada and in Arizona is just transparent in front of our eyes what's going on there. But part of why that's going on is because we didn't have a DeSantis in any of these other states is because we had Doug Dunsey as governor of Arizona with a GOP legislature and they allowed this to go on. And every time we tried to get rid of these people, Trump stood in our way. So I want to hear this garbage that somehow if the establishment media wants to get rid of Trump, somehow that's a reflection on DeSantis. Let me, let me get a couple of things off my chest here on that, on that point. Yes, there's no question that elements of the establishment of the Republican party want to use this to get rid of, um, to get rid of Trump. But that doesn't negate the fact that just because it's more McCarthy and McConnell's fault of what happened in the past that henceforth Trump is not the solution. And I don't mean just Trump running for president. I mean announcing right now as opposed to maybe like cooling it off a little bit and helping us out on, on things that he could be helpful with. But I mean in general, the entire focus on Trump's personality and servicing his daily ADHD and servicing whatever he cares about, which is always himself. And, and, and distracting from what needs to be done. Meaning I'm not into the soap opera. I'm not into this business of it's always the next election, the next presidential election. But let's face it, most people are the Trump people are and everyone else is. Hence Trump's announcing right after this election. So you can't blame other people in, in an era where someone makes one good speech. They give one good questioning, you know, line of questioning at a house hearing and everyone's like, that guy needs to be present. So obviously if you have the guy who's the most successful conservative governor of all time and then electorally just levels the place in a way that just shocks the consciousness, you can't, you, you have to understand why people might be like, hey, wow, that's what we want for president. That's not really my message because I think that in itself is a distraction. Whether he does or doesn't run for president does doesn't want to whatever. But you can't blame people for thinking that. That is a very cogent argument. More over. This is what I was talking about. Different types of establishment people, some of these guys are like, oh, you know, there's all these people saying nice things about the Santis and all these donors and this and that he's an establishment person. Okay. So, you know, notice who's not saying nice things about him. McConnell, he never will McCarthy. He never will. In fact, descent is fault McCarthy before anyone else when he was in Congress. He promoted a Raoul Labrador against McCarthy as majority leader in 2014. But more broadly. It's these other people, McConnell McCarthy, the other governors. They hate his guts. Is there a single governor that has come to the Santis's defense? No one's making this point. Name me one governor. Pompeo said something nice about him. He's not a governor. He's one of the people that might want to run for president and he might have his own thing. He wants to get rid of Trump so then he can come in and you know, whatever, run along, you know, against the Santis, whatever. But no other governor did and I'll let you in on a secret. If we're going to judge someone's character by who hates them, I will tell you every single dirt bag governor hates his guts and they bedmouthed him privately. People like Kristi Noem, Kristin Uno, they hate him. They're jealous of him. He's everything they're not. The people praising him are kind of like the GOP hacks. What I mean by GOP hacks is they just want to win. They just want ours to win. So you do have to understand, well, broadly, they're not helpful. Broadly, I want to not be in the Republican party. That's my agenda. But if you are someone who wants to, you know, be all into this presidential stuff and lead the party, which the Trumpists want to do, well, you're going to have to grow a coalition of support. So it's not surprising to me that there's a number of donors that just they want to be on the winning side. People love winners. They never supported him when he was, you know, four years ago. They would never have otherwise done that. But now they're like, that's a winner and they're fun with it. You know, it's a rare circumstance. Usually we don't have a winner because we never get a guy elected who could show the effectiveness of real conservative governance. Think about it. When's the last time we elected one of us as a governor? At best, we had it as House and Senate, but you don't get to govern. All you get to do is kind of rabble rouse. It's a very unique circumstance. So it doesn't surprise me that there are people that you and I wouldn't like really, but they're GOP hacks and like, man, this guy's really getting it done. I want to be on the winning side. I'll, I'll donate to him. I'll support him if you're on for president. It's a very logical thing. If you're a Republican consultant, Republican donor and you want Republicans to win, you have no problem supporting horrible Republicans, but if you have a good one that is more successful like totally than anyone else, it's not surprising that people are going to be impressed by that. So Daniel, but no, but still, you know, you're like, it's better or he not be, it's better he be governor for another term or be a leader of the Confederacy, not run for president. So he needs to say he's not running for president. Let me address that. He would be stupid, put Trump on a shelf for a minute. He would be stupid to publicly get up there and say, I absolutely under no scenario will run for president this coming term. He'd be stupid because part of his effectiveness of being a governor that serves as that much needed immediate check and balance on the Biden administration is the fear that he's going to go national. The minute he tells the media he's done, he loses a lot of his clout. So even if he, I have no idea what he plans to do, but even if a hundred percent he sits there with his wife and family like, dude, I'm not up to this. This is stupid. I don't want to go through this. I don't want to put my family through this. I'll never do this. He'd be stupid to say that publicly. There was this Washington Post article a while back that showed how he's living rent-free in Biden's head. He single-handedly served as a check and balance on those critical moments when Biden was about to take it, the COVID fascism even further. That was so important that he's not just another governor. So even if you're the type that's like, you still would rather vote for Trump for president. You have to understand it's stupid for him to announce it. And also, if you are still one of those that want Trump to run his president and even to announce now and blow up everything else we're trying to do, that means that you believe he is really a strong, strong man. Wow. I mean, he really has so much to bring to the table. So if that's the case, then you're right. DeSantis is a little nothing. He's a little pipsqueak, disloyal fool whose campaign was in disarray before Trump came and saved him. Why does Trump have to go ballistic that he won so handily and have to piss on it? Ignore it. If I were him, I would say, hey, no, it's great. No, you see, look, I endorsed him and you see a good things came out of it. That's great. And I'd go on to do everything I said he should be doing. Go after McCarthy, go after McConnell, promote the transgender legislation that just came out of Tennessee, kudos to Matt Walsh there, he lives there for pushing it, pushing every state. You'll be that hero. You'll remind people of what they liked about you in 2016, but it's got to be a little different this time. It's not enough. Just rhetoric, I think, get involved in policy. You'll win. You're still the top dog, although he's trying to lose it very quickly and he might. It's very simple. And even the Trump people are like, yeah, Daniel, yeah, I mean, that's what he should be doing. You know, I still support Trump, but yeah, it's kind of stupid. But that's the point. You're right. It is stupid, but he's doing it anyway. That reflects who he is, what he's always been, and what he certainly will be headed forward. It's not worth it. Oh, if only he could shut up, but he won't. This is the most bizarre thing I've ever seen. He's literally trying to get him in a pissing match. And I don't want to give you a data point here, a detail that embodies everything I'm talking about, how what he's doing, it's not just unhelpful, how it's nuking and contaminating our agenda. That's my beef with him. I don't blame Trump on the GOP's failure since Reagan. That's the GOP's fault. I blame him for getting in our way of rectifying that and sometimes downright supporting the other side and then contaminating every potential. And let me give you this perfect example that I find extremely disturbing. And that is this. What is the most important thing we can do right now? The most important thing Democrats are emboldened. There's no limit to what they want to do to us. Publicans, whatever good they were, didn't get as much power as they thought. Okay. Some of these blue states, New York, and now Michigan, Pennsylvania, they're going to be horrible. I mean, the crime in Pennsylvania, Michigan is good through the roof, fascism, biomedical tyranny. They're going to be complete California. What is the single biggest check on that behavior? I'm Trump running for president. No, no. It's the scientists being the leader, not necessarily running for president. But again, the fact that that's not off the table gives him that clout against the left and the media to work together potentially with as many governors as possible to say this will not happen in our States. Almost a year ago, to Santas was on the show and said, I will work with other governors to have a state based reciprocity program to repatriate illegal aliens. By the way, Trump, when he was president at a federal level, which is immigration is all federal, his deportation record. And I did many articles on the data on this was much worse than Obama, especially in Obama's first term. Now Biden now completely shut it off, but you know, some of us remember that for all the talk, oh, the dream areas and this and that here's a man who's willing to go out on a limb when the courts will clearly say it's unconstitutional and as a state start deporting illegals. And I think you know, he means business, but there's one problem. We don't freakin have a single other person to work with. That's how bad the party is. That's how bad these Republican governors are. Except as we speak, as Trump makes this about himself, there is one other person we have hanging in the balance and particularly with illegal immigration, a very important state, Kerry Lake in Arizona. And yesterday on Stephen Crowder, my colleague on his show, she had on Kerry to talk about, you know, just the craziness with Maricopa County counting, but somehow it veered into Trump and whatever. And she made a comment to the effect and I don't have the clip in front of me. You could look it up. Something like, you know, DeSantis goes out and gives a speech and everyone wants him to be president. I'm paraphrasing, but I think that's pretty accurate. Now, it wasn't like a direct take as a direct attack on him. More attacking the people trying to do it. I mean, literally that's where the words are. I mean, it's the people doing it, but like really, really all he's done is given an acceptance speech. Like that's why, no, no, they were telling him his president even before the insane victory he had, but no, no, it's everything he did. Again, if you're into presidential politics, which most political and all side are except for me, it's a very logical thing why people would promote him as a presidential candidate. You know, every time someone has one good moment to like, Oh, you know, Kristi Noem, Trey Gaudy, 2024, like, you know, that always goes like these memes online. This is a whole other level like by a magnitude of order of 10 deviations over. Even if you strategically like maybe you should wait, it's not worth that. There's different arguments, but it certainly is a very coherent logical reason. Like, well, you literally punched them in the face, the left on every issue. You drove them out. You made people come there. You made it a refuge and you won blacks, Hispanics, suburban voters. You won Palm Beach, you might want to take a look at that. If presidential politics is your end all, which it is for most people, I don't agree with it. It's kind of logical that you'd start looking at a man like that. So to reduce it to just giving a speech. Now we have too much riding on this. I don't want to create a needless rift. I would look forward to working with her. But the point I'm trying to make is this man contaminates every damn thing he touches. So now the one other governor, I think everyone would agree on it. No matter how much you're on the Trump side, that the most important thing, probably more important than even getting out in McConnell McCarthy is for the Santis and Kerry Lake if she becomes governor to work together. I think we would all agree that it's probably the most fruitful relationship that you can have. And here's what's starting to happen. Okay. That is not a two way street. Oh, that's not like a bow sides need to stop thing. Like it reminds me like when the Hamas and these types would declare the Intifada on Israel. So it was always like the State Department would put out bow sides need to stop. No, that's not what's going on here. Okay. There's there's one side that can't help himself. You know, so that that's what that and by the way, one other thing with Trump. So he endorsed him. Okay. Let's set the record straight here. Trump was a sitting Republican president. He was a sitting Republican president that promised to drain the swamp to be that voice against the establishment. So it's very logical that when you have a conservative warrior who proved himself founded the free freedom caucus, co founded freedom caucus in the house and runs for governor of one of the most important states against an establishment hack that yes, you would seek that president of your party, his endorsement. Okay. And to his credit, he made the right choice. Whereas eight times out of 10, he actually didn't and carpet bomb does. But like somehow that means that for the rest of his life, he has to service him. It makes it seems like he grew like he did him some particular favor that he went out of his way to grovel to him. Everyone did, including all the establishment candidates he endorsed and we're paying for including freaking Mitt Romney. So if you're going to own Mitt Ron DeSantis to that extent, you need to own Mitt freaking Romney. Because remember, there was a candidate against him who by the way, won the Utah convention, could have easily supported him. He endorsed McConnell when we went after him. He supported McCarthy when we tried to build support against him. I'm sick of this one way street. Oh, no, but somehow no, it's it's DeSantis is working with with these guys to, you know, to get rid of Trump. No, Trump is getting rid of Trump. So again, I don't believe that we lost the election because of Trump, but I, but I do believe that headed forward, it's going to be all pain and no gain. And his behavior is actually self fulfilling that it's proving that it's proving that point. And it's not like he was minding his own business. He was it. DeSantis before he attacked him after he's announcing for president at the wrong time from anyone's perspective. So yeah, I mean, it's not surprising that everyone, including people we don't like and don't trust, but you know, they're Republican hacks and they want Republicans to go in and say, you're going to ruin our chances. Now it's a valid statement that look in the mirror, you yourself ruined your chances by saddling up to McCarthy and McConnell and all these people. You're the idiots. And that's true, but it doesn't take away from our argument that they're both problematic. They're both problematic. This is the point everyone needs to understand. We're at a point where we must do everything in our power. Everything we can to fortify red America, to Florida, red America. And what I mean by Florida is I mean, you put you pedal to the metal on the policies. Make incentives for good people to move in and disincentives for bad people to move in. Use the machinery of government to go after to go after the bad guys. In other words, like not only do you not have the health department promoting biomedical tyranny and transhumanism, but you have them going after it and have a snitch line for hospitals that won't allow treatment. The opposite have that education department go after the masking, go after critical race theory, go after the grooming. That's what we need right now. The solution to the fact that the Democrats not only have an impervious blue state wall, but then have now pretty much short up most of the traditional swing states, the solution is to shore up red America. It will do one of two things. Either that will serve as a shining example to spill over in some other states eventually, or if not, it will create the climate for national divorce. And it just will have a refuge will have an alternative system. But you go into South Dakota with the great hero, Christine home and the Department of Health, the Department of Education, the state bureaucrats. It is made as well be California. The machinery of the business, cultural tech, government access in every other red state is pretty much as bad as New York and California. So because of the people and their voting patterns and the legislature, certain things are overtly stopped and not done like they are in New York and California. But that's why no state is as red as it needs to be. And believe me, Florida, there's a lot more work that Cannon should be done. And we'll see what he does in his second term. But that's the most important thing. That's what Trump needs to be working on. And you know what? If he did it, that in itself would make a great case for him to be president. Because remember, it's not like he needs to build name ID and support. He could announce any time, but it's that he cannot handle not getting the attention. He cannot handle people celebrating what happened in Florida. He could have easily celebrated along with it, even thrown in there. Yeah. And see how powerful my endorsement was. This is awesome without dumping on him and move on attack McCarthy, attack McConnell, help us in the States, shame these loser governors into doing the right thing. And you know what? People would say, look, I love DeSantis, but you're that kind of national leader that we need. You know, let him be governor again. You be president. If I were advising him, I mean, I don't think that's an outcome that would help us personally, but if that's what floats your boat, that's what he needs to be doing. But he never will. And he never did because it was never about you and me. Never forget he is not the American Nigel Farah. She's not like the creator and leader of a populist movement. It was there. I know because we helped lead it long before him. He co-opted. He saw an opening and co-opted it. And in many ways tarnished it. That's just the reality. You don't have to ignore that there's any good or any value in 2016 or whatever, but it's it has to be a recognition that headed forward. Just because the establishment always wanted to get rid of him, it doesn't mean that from the Patriot side, there's not a legitimate reason to start engaging in introspection, especially as he's forcing us to do it because he won't shut up. If you lied low a little bit, there's one thing we focus only on McConnell McCarthy, but now it's kind of like the triple crown, which frankly, what do you think we had during his presidency? We had the Trump, McConnell, McCarthy, Paul Ryan a little bit. They work together to screw us on issue after issue. I'm not going to rehash hundreds upon hundreds of our shows that we did during those years, but those of you who are older listeners, you remember that where he was helpful. I praised him where he needed prodding. I prodded where he nuked us. I went after him and I'm always consistent in that respect. But what often happens, even with someone who is far less personally flawed than Trump, what often happens with a leader of a movement is that often they become a caricature of themselves over time. Some of it's their fault. Some of it is just, it's kind of like a casualty. Like the first wave of an amphibious assault, they're going to get mowed down and they're heroes. But eventually you overwhelm with more waves, but yeah, they kind of go down. But it paves the way for another wave. So you just get tainted even just from just the battle. You have to fight. You have to fight the system. And I after you, even if you don't give people independently reason to hate you as a narcissist without the media going after you, even a really good guy. Let me give you a great example of that. My father was a fanatical Ross Perot supporter in 1992. And there was so much to this day. It's such a shame because I think I shudder to think what could have happened. The country was ready to finally get rid of the duopoly. It was after Reagan, we had Bush. See, too many people either make a hero out of Reagan or then now revisionist say, ah, Reagan was kind of stupid. He was a, he was a rhino. And neither is true. Reagan was a great start. He did a lot of good things. The problem was his VP was H.W. Bush. And that so the dissolution of his entire revolution and the rest is history. But right at the beginning after those first four years, like 30 years ago, we had an opportunity. Ross Perot ran on largely a very good agenda. My father was a big supporter. I would go with him to some of these United. We stand, you know, cabals, these, these meetings in the local chapter or where I lived. And he was, he was obsessed with him. And he did so much good. He used his money and, and Perot, if you understand his lot, a lot of things came out about his personal life, what he did for veterans, what he did. I mean, he was a really good person. But everyone has character flaws or personality flaws. And he, he kind of had this goofy side to him and everyone knew that. So over time, like, you know, he, he said that Bush or Clinton or both of them, the sabotage his daughter's wedding, he was before that. He was actually leading. He was leading both parties. It was an unbelievable time in American history. But he kind of like ruined it. So he amazingly got 19% of the popular vote. Didn't wind up winning any estate, but, you know, fine. My father always said to me, the mistake was that he didn't hand it off to another person. And he ran again in, in 96, kind of a shell of himself. And I forgot the numbers, but only got maybe 8% or whatever. And the rest is history. And we're stuck today with that false dichotomy, the duopoly, you know, Bush, the next Bush and just, you know, everything, everything else since then. That was an unbelievable opportunity. And I think, you know, with Clinton's scandals and with Bob Dole being just such a nothing burger, just not just a rhino, but just so uninspiring everything. If he would have built it. See, Buchanan, Buchanan was ahead of his time too, but he was a little bit rough around the edges to, to, to, to, in my view to kind of win a national election at the time. But if you had someone kind of with that message, but, but more kind of the pro focus, but without pro rose kind of goofiness, I believe you could have upended American politics forever in 96. But he didn't hand it off to another person. And I think any truly intellectually honest person, you don't, you don't have to be establishment. So, it's not a matter of that just because they're trying to get rid of him. It doesn't take away the fact that you could be the most diehard Trump supporter. But if it really is about the agenda more than the man, you would recognize. Thank you for your service. Even going forward, there's a lot you can do, especially in the super red states that still a majority of people very much like him. There's a lot he can do. He could really do, he could do, I say to this day, he can do better than he did as president. We're going to be coming out in the coming days. And we're going to have guests on from different legislatures, different states to give you a flavor of what's going on, what we could do in each state. We have so many good ideas. Now, let me, let me just give you an example. There's this Tennessee bill that that's coming out. And in the Tennessee house, we actually do have good leadership. And they're going to push a bill to ban all drag shows in the state. I have to check the details. It might not just be minors. It shouldn't just be minors, ban it all. So I was speaking back, I was texting back and forth with a friend of mine, Savannah Maddox in Kentucky. She's in the legislature, but she's actually running for governor. And that primary is around the corner because that's a 2023 election. And she said, I had, she sent me a copy of the bill. She introduced it four or three years ago. She has a bill doing just that. We never heard about it because even though Republicans have three to one majorities in both houses there, we can't get anything done. That's where a Trump could come in in a state like Kentucky, name the speaker, name the Senate pro temp, name names and say, are you going to allow drag shows in Kentucky? That's what the men could do, but he won't do it. That's, that's the, this is the non binary to, to, to take a chapter out of the trainee agenda, the non binary view that you're not hearing from anyone else. It's a long view. It's a deep view. It's a broad view. It factors in multiple factors. This is how we take politics here to the next level. Politics is not a math. This is more than this. It's not a number. It's an art of the amalgamation of multiple different factors and issues and strategies and trends. And it takes a long view. This is what we need and this is what we're lacking, but headed forward. It's not so much like, Oh, the Republicans are doing great until Trump came. No, I mean, I, I said all along. I never wavered. I was remarkably consistent. I'm the only one alive, one of the only ones alive that hasn't flipped all over the place with Trump. And I said, when he came on the scene and all the Republican and conservative establishment was like, he's destroying the Republican party. And then, you know, the, the MAGA people were like, he's the savior. And I was like, dude, he's not destroying the party because the party already is destroyed. There's nothing more to destroy. I just don't think in the long run he's going to be the solution and not the way you're going about this cultish worship rather than maybe trying to, to build a broader movement and, you know, get him disciplined and focused on issues. That was my, my original assumption. It didn't change when he was present. Certainly hasn't changed post presidency. There's always been my view. It's all about what matters, what matters to our cause, literally sustaining our way of life. And there's a certain imminence, immediacy to this. We need immediate relief. We cannot afford distractions. And going forward, it will not be helpful to anything we want to do. And remember, you can't ignore the fact that medical freedom is the number one issue. We have people dying left and right, injured, left and right, cancers, autoimmune, exploding. We can, hospitals are death camps. You can't get normal treatment anywhere. We need answers to that. You can't, it's a fifth of our economy. They control our government completely. Every legislature, every, you know, agency, they're a bunch of Joseph Mangalos. We're worse than a third world country in terms of medical care, most aspects of it. People are sicker than ever. They're making people sicker than ever. RSV is a huge problem now. It's directly from the shots. It was in Moderna's own clinical trial. It's in their own write up that it seemed to cause more RSV in children. It's doing it now. And now they're going to come out with a poisonous RSV shot. Trump will never, can never be a force against it. Three days ago, he was praising Warp Speed. He thought he'd kind of tone it down now. No, he never will because it's all about his legacy. It's all about that I cannot allow myself to go down as a defeated president. So I have to run for president, even though tactically, if you cared about yourself, but also the country in a more strategic way, he would follow my advice and he'd be more influential and more accomplished that way. But he will never let go of this. And that's his own problem. I'm not going to waste any more time on this. I already wasted too much time. But I just want to end off closing the loop on a couple of things that we didn't have a chance to get to. So man, we're almost out of time here, but let's say the speakers race. Okay, the speakers race. So here's the deal. Here's the deal with the speakers race. Some of you are just asking me different questions, so I just want to answer them. We're never going to have the votes through the front door to get to 18 Republicans to support one of our type of guys. But here's the good news. They don't have the support for that either. You see, unlike majority leader and majority whip and conference chair and the other things that they're going to vote on in the GOP conference next week, there's another vote. So in conference is a secret vote. No one knows about it. So we can't shame them and they're going to vote for all the bad guys. But when it comes to speaker, that's a constitutional officer presiding over the whole body. So you elect the speaker, both parties, you know, the whole body votes. They stand up in front of everyone and they have to give an aim. It's a very dramatic vote. So if we build so the thing is you need a majority of those present and voting. So let's say there's 225 Republicans, you only need in that scenario eight to get up and just say I'm voting for Jim Jordan or whatever. Chip Roy, that denies him the majority. Oh, so the Democrat wins? No. Democrats would only have like two oh seven. So even a plurality wouldn't even be enough. They need a majority. It's deadlocked and you have to negotiate. But you build the support now and you say, look, you could vote in conference for whoever you want among the GOP. And that's just a majority vote. And he is your nominee for a speaker, but just knowing the house floor, you're not going to have two 18 for him. And Chip Roy announced on Glenn Beck's show today, he does not have two 18. So what would happen? Ultimately, you'd have to compromise because then they would block our guy and you'd have to get a third type of guy. And that's how you negotiate, but we need to change in leadership. All of you who live in a district where you have either a returning Republican, Congressman or a congressman or a new Republican who just won or ballot still be being counted days later, but will likely or possibly win. You need to flood their offices, find their number, flood their offices. Next week, Tuesday, Wednesday, freshman orientation, the House Republicans of the incoming Congress are coming to meet. Who are you voting for? I want to know right now, right here, right now, who are you voting for? Oh, it's a private vote. Yeah, I understand that. But you are our representative. And that is a very pivotal, probably more pivotal than any vote is who you're going to pick for a speaker. We have the right to know. We want to know. And I would say tell them to vote for Chip Roy. It's not that there aren't other options. It's just that he is likely going to the problem is that they're all going to tell you, look, we'd like to, but there's no other option. So that that's what we're saying. No, there will be another option. Don't tell me there's an vote for Chip Roy. How could you tell me McCarthy is a better option? Chip Roy represents Texas. McCarthy represents California values. If you had everyone doing what I'm doing who's more influential than me starting with Trump himself, we could do this. Same thing with the Senate. If you're in a state with one or two Republican senators, call them. Rick Scott will likely challenge McConnell. He's not great. He's a lot better than McConnell. Who are you going to vote for? Oh, it's a private vote, but it's the most important vote that controls the floor. I want to know who you're voting for. And then you publicize it. You shame them. You pressure them. Like I said, that's the only purpose of having a Republican over a Democrat is that at least you could hold them hostage and pressure them. This is the type of thing we need to be focused on. I'm going to be focused on this and so much more next week coming up with agenda item strategies for working that speaker fight. Notice I didn't say the most important thing is to work on building the case right now for DeSantis to run for president, even though, you know, I'm a big fan of his because it's about more than any one person. And I want to just end off today just tying this into veterans day. You know, obviously there's amazing veterans of all generations, very few unfortunately from World War two left a lot from Vietnam. But you know, when I think of a lot of you in the audience who are veterans, the ones that really stand out to me are kind of like the Gen X Gulf War era. You know why? Because this is after the draft when it was all volunteer, but before the military got destroyed. It was very much a peacetime before, especially before 9 11, although certainly we had so much of a surge in patriotic recruitment after 9 11 and who served amazingly. But it's those people that just that ultimate peacetime, the Soviet Union collapsed. There were no big things going on that piece dividend and they signed up. Those people kind of in their 40s, 50s really serve the backbone, the kind of the Schwarzkopf era. It's so sad to think of what has happened to our military. And now you can't even have the children of those people sign up without having to get the death shots and the Republicans still next week. Likely they're going to pass the NDAA, the defense authorization bill. Again, they still the 10 Republicans. They need to pick off 10 Republicans or to get closer in the Senate. So I don't want to hear all, you know, they have the majorities. They don't have 60 votes. They only have 50 McConnell could whip against it. He never will and use that NDAA next year to demand changes in the military. That's what it means to be pro military, not just to throw endless funding at a woken broke military. But you know what? Maybe one day we'll get to a point of a national divorce where we'll have state militias that are worthy of that same sense of sacrifice from that and other generations and their willingness to serve when 99.5% of others were unwilling. Maybe Florida is the place to start. But it shows there is so much more at stake than the ego of one man. Folks, we had a very, very heavy week. It's going to get heavier next week. We'll be there to cover everything. Some of your comments, questions, concerns to Daniel Harwards, Hock Daniel Harwards at startmail.com. My voice is still messed up. Until next week, hope you guys have a great, terrific time with your family. We'll be back same time, same place Monday. God bless you all and thank you for listening. After years of battling Big Tech, we're no longer willing to play their game and watch them stifle our reach, cutting us off from you. It's time to make a big change. Go to TheBlaze.com for some exciting updates and join the fight against Big Tech censorship."
