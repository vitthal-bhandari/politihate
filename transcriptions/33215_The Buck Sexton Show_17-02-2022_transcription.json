    "text": " Team Buck welcome to the Freedom Hut Thursday February 17th edition of the program much to discuss You've got a new DHS report about how many migrants were Arrested the border illegal immigration out of control in the month of January. No surprise the Canadian Justice Minister says if you're part of a pro-Trump movement Probably gonna steal your bank accounts, you know a No big deal no big deal and Governor Youngkin has signed legislation That makes the mask mandates a thing of the past In Virginia and the Loudoun County Circuit Court ruled on it. We will get into all of this You've got to hear this, you know probably gonna start with a Canadian justice minister They're not even hiding the fascism anymore. I mean they actually seem like they enjoy it They have gone from here are my pronouns and I'm a male feminist and I really believe in you know Justin Trudeau is the absolute worst worst Politician in North America took the title away from Bill de Blasio, which is remarkable, but they've gone from oh, I'm just so social Justice oriented and to do what I say I'll send men with batons to beat you in front of family members That's what they turn into over a vaccine mandate for a vaccine that does not stop The spread so that's an interesting one That's when we'll come to in just a second friends because it is wild stuff going on up in Canada I mean it's essentially right now is the Trucker protest about to have a Trudeau invasion against it and as Ukraine about to have a Putin invasion against it various tyrants on the move You got to help my man Mike Lindell these days by standing with him against the cancel culture They're coming from Mike all over the place. You know this. You know why because Mike is a patriot. He's a conservative He's a Christian. He stands with shows like this one He actually puts his money where his mouth where his heart is and he also makes amazing products I've got the pillows the my pillows on my bed the geezy dream sheets the mattress topper When i'm in florida, I sleep on the entire sleep system of mike lindell's my pillow company the the actual mattress the box spring Everything is from my pillow the my towels are amazing too Look if you haven't tried any of those try this one the my slippers They're fantastic and they're 50% off with promo code buck these slippers offer all-day comfort with extra cushioning made to wear both In and outside the home you can also check out their overstock sale So there's a lot of deep discounts on the pillows towels sheets and more Make sure you enter when you go to my pillow calm promo code buck.

It's time to get producer mike some my slippers He's gonna love them All right. I I promise you know this is a short one canadia canadias Canada's Justice minister david lemettie Says you know, he's asked by a journal up there Hey, sir, excuse me, but um Seems kind of like you guys are going full fascist You're saying you're gonna see these bank accounts of people based on their politics and the justice minister's like yeah That's exactly what we're doing a lot of folks is look I just don't like your vaccine mandates and I donated to this now. It's illegal Should I be worried that the bank can freeze my account? What's your answer to that? Well, I think if you if you are a member, you know a pro-Trump movement who's donating hundreds of thousands of dollars and millions of dollars To this kind of thing then you ought to be worried You ought to be worried He straight up says it if you're part of a pro-Trump movement. This is a canadian pal at canadian Justice minister. This is like their attorney general equivalent Could you imagine if the attorney general in this country was like if you're if you're a canadian a and you're donating to blm You know, oh actually well our our guy wouldn't say a probably but you know what I mean He says if you're a canadian and you're donating or maybe he would detroll Uh, you're donating to blm. We're gonna seize your bank account Seize your bank account. How do you think that feels? Not we're going to stop the transaction You've got 10 grand in savings total five grand in savings total you give $50 to the truckers boom No more groceries for you. No more rent payment. I'm gonna seize your bank account You think it's gonna be easy to unseize your bank account friends. This is financial warfare Call it what it is. This is financial warfare against people in what is supposed to be a free society The truckers thank heavens are still going strong. I am worried though right now I am worried because there are leaflets Being passed out that are essentially telling the truckers or rather telling people at the protest You are To leave the area right now Anybody who's there they're being they're handing out leaflets now. Maybe they're just trying to see if that Works maybe they're trying to see if that gets it done but I remember what it was like Before they uh before they cleared out the occupy wall street protest in zucati park You know they did They gave everybody a warning I believe there were leaflets pass pass that and this is over 10 years ago I was down there covering it for the blaze at the time And they went in there and they they had batons and the whole thing and if you didn't move you got pepper sprayed You got hit with batons. I mean they cleared it out And that would get really ugly in Ottawa right now So we we have two tyrants on the brink just in trudot in canada is he going to send in the Jack booted thugs of the canadian government right now and look i'm just gonna say this if you're a a member of the royal Mounted police, you know You remember whatever the rcmp or some real Canadian. Yeah, that's right rcmp nice work, but If you're one of those or if you're just a Ottawa police officer non comply You have law enforcement Proscute or executive authority in a sense they can fire you But it's all it's in the discretion of an individual officer whether or not you're going to actually use force They cannot make any of these canadian law enforcement officers use force they can't do it Right, it's not they're not defending themselves against the truckers the truckers are peaceful the truckers are Hiding them, you know pulled pork sandwiches and maple glazed donuts. They're the truckers on a problem Don't go for it. Don't be a tyrants stooge Don't use force against these truckers They will they will live in infamy if they do the truckers are morally right and pose a threat to no one The true go the true doe government must go it should fall there should be a vote of no confidence Now onto the other tyrant Vladimir Putin and Ukraine Now today they're saying he's Moving more military resources toward the border So is he gonna invade i was just talking with the team here in uh in the radio studio, New York and we're all either saying you think do i did i'm asking them i don't know Can you imagine i mean this guy is Playing a game of yo-yo with whether there'll be a major invasion of a european country I mean it at some point it's like He's he's either gonna go or no go and if he goes through too many motions i feel like it's gonna have to be go What are we going to do about it what will all that look like it's it's impossible to tell I mean here is just to give you a sense of it mr. Magoo can even see I mean, you know usually he thinks of bulldozers and ostrich but here he is joe biden Saying the threat of invasion is very high It's very high Very heavy because they have not and they have not moved any of their troops out that move or troops in Number one number two. They have reason to believe that they are engaged in a false flag operation to have an excuse to go in Every indication we have is there prepared to go into his brain attack the frame number one Number two I've been waiting for response to Putin So my letter that my response to him It's coming to that mob to hunt this be the faction of here Not faction of their Foreign border we're gonna have the worst year of illegal immigration in history This year and i'm going to explain to you how I know that and what the early indicators are One of the smartest actions you can take to preserve the value of your savings account Is to invest a portion of your savings in real gold That's been proven to be the most consistent precious metal and commodity over time In a year like the one we've had with inflation figures showing a 7.5 Increase in a year's time And more of that coming our way this year Real gold is a form of protection and buying real gold is made easy by the oxford gold group They also make it convenient and easy to take delivery of your purchase of real gold too The same kind of thing can happen with your ira or 401k real gold and silver in your retirement accounts The oxford gold group will beat any competitors price on gold silver platinum and palladium Called the oxford gold group today to request your free precious metals investment guide By dialing pound 250 on your cell and speaking the keywords gold ira You'll receive your precious metals investment guide directly to your phone and get all your questions answered with one call to oxford gold Simply dial pound 250 saying the keywords gold ira again from your cell phone right now Dial pound 250 so easy and say the keywords gold ira Okay, uh, what's the latest on immigration? Well, it's completely illegal immigration is completely out of control federal court filing obtained by fox news dhs reports 153,000 941 migrant encounters in january Basically doubling january of 21 basically doubling january of last year think about that And quadruple january of 20 In two years the same month-to-month comparison 4x the number of illegal migrant encounters at the border DHS also reports 62,573 migrants were released in the us last month alone They will never ever Be deported or have to face the actual immigration system in this country in terms of consequences They may be given drivers licenses free health care free school all of that they'll get that But getting deported friends. We have an open border We have an open border I mean you could say oh, but we turned some people away not really I mean if you mess up you get turned away, but if you show up and you know what to do and the cartels have prepped you you get in We've also got our border patrol officers who are supposed to be doing a security mission Doing a humanitarian mission which means that the fentanyl the illegal drugs That are killing over a hundred thousand americans a year now think about that 100,000 and these are people who are in their 20s 30s 40s You know you look at lost decades of life from a fentanyl overdose It's horrible stuff. It's all across the country small towns big cities everywhere And it's flooding across the border Why? Because instead of having border patrols say wow there's a pickup truck They've got enough fentanyl in the back of that thing and they're making a run for they get an offense at all to you know Kill a million people in this country Uh by dosage at least instead of that situation Right They're getting sand i've seen them do this They're actually getting sandwiches and water bottles and medicine and things for Families arriving at the border saying okay. We're here feed us let us into your country Ha ha yeah, that's what happens That's what they're doing So It's remark we've got a million legal immigrants coming in the country every year. This is so amazing It's like don't be xenophobic. What's wrong with people coming across our border? It's illegal If congress wants to make it legal they should do that And then we'd have a different discussion, but it is illegal. Okay. I don't want to pay taxes I think my tax rate is confiscatory, but it is the law so I deal with it Oh, and we all know if I didn't pay my taxes or we broke the law. It's a bad person Does my tax does my little check to the irs change anything about the treasury? No Literally means nothing means nothing to the federal government. Would they lock me up over it? Yes, they would Because it's the law they say oh, but immigration's not the law. Hmm It's interesting how that works, right? But aoc for example Here she is just saying yeah distribute as much taxpayer cash to the illegals as you possibly can This is the game they're playing what I can say is that as an elected official um, i've been one of the most vocal members of congress on inclusion of a path to citizenship for For the over you know 11 million third potentially upwards of 13 million immigrants undocumented people Um in the united states. We've thrown everything on the line And And not just in a path to citizenship, but we've also fought for the inclusion Uh, we fought tooth and nail for the inclusion of undocumented people in uh in relief packages stimulus checks FEMA Assistance and we've actually helped all right you get the idea taxpayer cash for illegals She's bragging about this because this is what the democrat base wants This is what the democrat base demands Right not the all not all the democrat party a majority of the country is not down for this at all But the base and the NGOs and the elites the elites want that cheap labor I was just at a dinner recently. I mean it was off the record. So I can't give any details dinner or some Names of people you would you would know? And there was one person there who was not a name you would know who was just straight up Very rich person who was just straight up saying I hire illegals Can't get americans to do the jobs Is that that I was just flabbergasted? What do you mean pay them more? You know illegals will work for the lower wages. Why do you think that is? Because they're illegal. They're not supposed to be in the country. So you're exploiting them But you think that they're just naturally harder working You know, they're just naturally more likely to do a good job That's a fascinating argument that was being made, but this is what the elites in this country say this is what they do Whatever benefits them some good news on the mask front.

We'll get into it in a second Online identity theft is a crime that can hit you out of nowhere You don't see it on television shows.
