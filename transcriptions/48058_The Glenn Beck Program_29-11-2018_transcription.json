It makes a big difference You know I was gonna start with Nancy Pelosi, but I don't really get been anti Pelosi's not gonna affect my life She's not gonna affect my life. I'm not gonna allow her to affect my life What's going on in Washington is just a total scam And we all know it nobody really likes Nancy Pelosi nobody really wants her there This is all a power struggle. So I thought I would start instead with two stories You on the good story or the really weird story first I guess the The good story let's start with a good story And then I want the really but I do want where I'm still getting the really you're really good You're gonna get the really the really This story is a story about a woman who has made a choice on her on her daughter now, you know the one that the six-year-old daughter she says is is You know trans gendered and needs to have a sex change at six and dad has said no Dad lost custody mom has custody. It's being called child abuse. I think it is. I mean, it's crazy This story makes that story look normal Wow, okay, I'm okay. I'm in so let's let's let's have some let's have some some good news first When I was six weeks old I went to have an ultrasound For tummy issues and they noticed my ovaries were not hooked upright the doctor at the time thought it would be best to remove them Completely when I was 13 I found out that I'd never be able to have children It was then that I started researching adoption as I grew older My biggest fear was to have somebody tell a perspective to have to someday tell a perspective So the spouse that I would never be able to have birth For our children Then I'm at Jason. He was a single dad to two wonderful little boys and we fell head over heels Before we got engaged. I told him the biggest secret of my life one of only a handful of people knew about me I sobbed as I told him he grabbed my face and he told me it didn't matter how our children came to us They would be our children I went through this with Tonya and there is something about women that when they can't have children they It just changes them and it's just so devastating to them Tonya was not supposed to be able to have any children and Didn't know that until we were married and it was so softly devastating to her and I kept saying to her what he is honey We can adopt that child's gonna be ours. I mean it won't matter and We we did adopt and it didn't matter Rafe is well for some strange reason lately Rafe is my son But when he behaves You know he's her son Anyway before we got engaged I told him about this so we took out $55,000 because there was too many shading shady adoption agencies Where they would cost you? $55,000 and you know all was said and done so we set out to do it on our own we marketed ourselves online and through social media We made a Facebook adoption paid page and paid for targeted ads We had an Instagram page with pictures of our life We also put a profile of a dot on adoption dot com We were contacted by a handful of women, but most turned out to be scams Then we got a message on Facebook a young woman emailed us telling us that her friend was pregnant and looking for a family September 1st we got a phone call from this woman in Missouri and we talked for about an hour and a half over the next month We built our relationship and became increasingly excited. However, she never got us official proof of pregnancy People can fake ultrasounds and blood tests online all the time. I was ready to commit But I because I trusted this woman, but my husband wanted to renew our adoption dot com profile one more time We renewed it in October 1st, October 7th a second. We got a message from another expectant mother She had been watching our profile and wanted to meet us two days later We met in a little diner 20 minutes from our house Just when we thought she had stood us up in walked a very pregnant girl and her mom We hugged and she showed us the ultrasounds of a little baby boy He then started kicking and she had me feel her belly Toward the end of breakfast. She asked how we felt she then asked us if we would adopt her baby and love him forever Jason and I sobbed in the middle of a diner in complete shock and three weeks later We stood there and watched as our son Andy was born I was the first to hold him and kiss his tiny hands. That was October 30th 2017 as we took Andy home and adjusted to being new parents I had continued to talk with the first expectant mom that we had matched with She had still never given us any proof She had told us congratulations and that she had found another family for her baby I was happy for her and maintained occasional contact over the next couple of months But in January of this year I received a phone call from the same woman She told me that she had just told the other family that she didn't feel good about them adopting her baby She then told me that she knew this baby was supposed to be ours. I Stood there. I stood there holding my three-month-old baby boy And she sent me pictures of an ultrasound of the baby boy growing inside. I was speechless But I also knew deep down I knew Over the next two weeks my husband and I prayed a lot about adding another newborn to our family only months apart The same resounding answer came again and again Six weeks after that phone call we flew out with Andy to Missouri and met another woman and her three children The night before she was being induced we all Instantly connected the next day we stood at her bedside and watched as our son Ellis was born Jason even got to cut the cord. I was the first to hold him as well and kiss his tidy hands Never did we imagine having two newborn babies only four months apart a top Adoption is an amazing thing Because of a woman's greatest sacrifice and selfless decisions I have become a mom Two two of the most perfect baby boys I could have ever asked for We have open adoptions with both boys birth parents We can talk and send pictures and recently met up with Andy's birth parents at a nearby park Four months after Ellis was born We had a strong feeling to reach out to his birth mom and she had mentioned that they were in a rough spot Jason and I decided to fly there fly her oldest child out to visit us for ten days so he could spend some time with Ellis Sean and I Sean had never been on a plane before And he had never been that far away from home. We instantly fell in love with a sweet boy Ten days eventually turned into all summer at the end of the summer He asked if he could watch his new family try out for football Before we knew it he was talking to the coaches and asked if he could try out Sean made the top football team for the eighth grade in his first year of ever playing an organized sport He called his mom and asked her if he could stay She said whatever would make you happy Sean has now been living with us for six months and his football team made it all away to the playoffs Never did we imagine a year ago that we would be adding three more children in under nine months To the two that we already have Now I have not given birth to any of the five boys we have at home right now But I am their mom We have since finalized both Andy and Ellis's adoptions and they are officially ours We share custody with our oldest two boys and their mom And we don't have a time-long line on how long Sean will be staying with us Family doesn't have to be made from blood. It can come in many shapes and sizes. It is the love that matters So here we are a current family of seven and we love each other deeply and we go out on a lot of adventures together It's not always easy. There have been many ups and downs and everything in between But we would never trade this for the world So many people would love to be parents so many people Cry themselves to sleep because that's what they were born to be a parent If you are listening to the sound of my voice now And you don't know what to do Please please adopt that child of yours out Because that child of yours Is a miracle a true miracle That somebody else has been praying for That child has just happened to come through you This is the best of the Glenbeck program Remember the the drag queen Children's story hour. Yeah, it was happening. Mm-hmm where they invite drag queens. You're not going to preach your hate are you? No, no, no, no, this is a wonderful story of how good of love and appreciation Some drag queens would be invited into this library and would read stories to kids in their drag queen get up Which it looks a little frightening for children, but I mean white face and then a series of five horns all over the head of the drag queen and then this person reads stories to the kids so Some parents took issue with it and they were haters obviously They literally mongering in hatred and does all this person was trying to do wait It just did just read stories to the kids. That's all it's about right The kids the parents said well, what about are you like indoctrinating our kids? Oh my gosh Listen, they say of course not of course not right well now amid all that controversy One drag queen has admitted that the events are meant to groom the next generation huh Dylan pontiff who is one of the drag queens says this is gonna be the grooming of the next generation We're trying to groom the next generation to be accepting of lgbtqq. I a2 values Three that sense again for you, please. I'm so great We're trying to groom the next generation to be accepting of the lgbtqq values Plot was drush dressed in street clothes for this meeting but goes by Santana Pilar on Andrews when he's on stage Oh, he said that he's been bullied most of his life for being gay and he blasted those who opposed the drag queen story hour Even those gathered at a city council meeting in Lafayette, Louisiana who complained about it because they were haters however now LGBT qqia2 activists have said that they're determined to indoctrinate children to accept the movements agenda could I could I could I ask you just real quickly to For those who don't know I know and I know you know could you just tell me what each of those go through the letters? Yeah, well the L. Yeah lesbian course gay. Yes bisexual. Yes trans yes Q is queer then the next Q is questioning good then the eye is Intersex Which means which means you kind of escape between both I believe you're like you can go there fluid You're fluid. All right, so why isn't that F instead of I I don't know okay I a then the last a is asexual you don't have any sex with anybody And then the two is two-spirit you got two-spirit people you got two inside of you You're both male and female inside and I think we've that be called when you have two spirits Don't you do it. Don't you do it? You hateful jerk Really I can't even question I can't know Kelly what you Questioning not hateful questioning. I just wanted this a loving question We're you're accepting intolerant will it end in love? Well, I think everything ends in love all right. I mean I am as optimistic And as well grounded in my optimism optimism as a taco is I by the way, I believe we're all on the bandwagon of quilt bag. Yes, I think that's a much better acronym Yeah, it's a little easier to pronounce an LGBTQ QIA It's sort of feels like an insult, but it's not It's actually the thing seem to like it Yeah, quilt and I think first of all you have to make it the sequel quilt bag two And I think for all the things we haven't covered it you if you do quilt bag to electric boogaloo You're gonna cover a bunch of different things we have in your liking. Are you mocking? Are you mocking? I know I think Open up that quilt bag and put a lot of stuff in it right all sorts of things yeah, but I like how open they are in about it because This trans shit person says I'm here to tell you all all that time that I said I wasn't in doctorate Anyone with my beliefs about gay and lesbian and bi and trans and queer people that was a lie I have come to indoctrinate your children into my lgbt qq Ia to agenda and I'm not a bit sorry All 25 years of my career as an activist since the first very first time as a 16 year old I went and stood shaking and breathless in front of 11 people to talk about my story I've been on a consistent campaign of trying to change people's minds about us I want to make them like us. That's absolutely my goal. I want to make your children The your children like me and my family even if that goes against the way you've interpreted the teacher teachings of your religion so there it is there there you know the mask is coming off not this mask right With horns right now that one that one stays right it's a handsome mask and you don't want to mess with a handsome mask or beautiful Whichever you want to go by right?

I'm a little confused by everything that's going on in today's world We are not alone in that yeah, alone in that the over here we have we have an additional set of problems we have a Government that was elected to gay regain our independence that has managed to do a deal that would Probably I've been rejected by the French after they collapsed in 1870 I mean no sovereign nation on earth has ever been asked to Surrender quite as much of their liberty to leave an organization as as Britain has what John what do you have to for? Americans have been so You know concentrating on what we're doing and it would be it's a mess But if you're not following it every day, what is exactly what is this deal look like for Brexit? Well, it looks it looks basically as if we will lose any of the advantages that we had by being in Europe and And but still be bound to it in terms of we cannot leave the customs union. We cannot leave the the We cannot make Trade treaties with other people without the consent of the EU. Why would why would anyone sign that? Well, we've got a big scare thing going on now everyone is saying oh my god You realize well, I mean at the end of March where we're gonna fall off the cliff you realize the disruption the chaos We have 15 the Bank of England. There says that there's 15 years of chaos coming up ahead Any economic forecast that goes 15 years ahead has got to have some Element of error in it. Can you predict to me what your bank account will be in 15 years? I can't I mean it's it's nonsense but there is the possibility that the The extent of the nonsense will Will confound the actual Brexit moment itself and and and then I think we're into a very different world because It was the Democratic will of the people that we should leave the EU and And once again if an elite blocks the wishes of the people by subdue or coming or ignoring or distaining or Then that elite it will ultimately find themselves in a very uncomfortable situation I find this fascinating that people are saying that you know people who want to leave the EU or Standing up against the the immigration thing which now our own Hillary Clinton was over in Europe saying You know that was a real big mistake. Oh, you think so Hillary But anybody who is standing up They're immediately called big it and racist and everything else instead of saying wait a minute Here's a group of people that are tired of being told that there's nothing unique about their culture There they can't recognize their culture. They have to live in service of everyone else's culture You know if you if you fly the British flag or the Swedish flag now, you know, you're called a racist You have to you you're you can't have any pride in your country and there's a difference between a European Nationalist and somebody who is just proud of their country Well, you're quite right of course, but but there is a There's a great train of a sort of some some mutant virus in Western European and and you're part of that civilization Which actually despises it? diminishes it believes that all history is bad wherever we are we occupy I mean just the abolition of slavery alone is one of the glories of civilization and of mankind and it It wasn't it it wasn't a Chinese abolition. It wasn't a Muslim or Arab abolition it was British and Western European Christian civilization that got rid of it You know, we have a All of us have a check at history in terms of national identity and things like this, but on the whole I'd soon to be in a Western European Christianized world then in oh, yeah, any other civilization that's going at right at the moment I mean you really want to live in China or Saudi Arabia or anywhere other than you know a few countries in Europe and and and North America How are you? How are you feeling about? You know the Asia BB who is has asked the United Kingdom for? refugee status here's a woman who's going to be killed her children will be killed because she's a Catholic and She will not conform. You know even the Pope is offering her a place to live She's gonna be beheaded and killed and dragged through the streets of Pakistan if she doesn't get out of there soon What what it's an absolutely disgrace, isn't it? You know, we are we are constantly asked to accept refugees from war zones and things like That and some of them are genuine refugees, but many are just simply smart economic migrants who want to do better for themselves But once somebody is actually being persecuted And they happen to you know The Catholic or Christian or anything like that where we can turn our backs on them somehow Somehow they represent well, not terribly important people. I mean like kashoggi now clearly was terribly important but this poor woman Not not important John you're you've narrated a film I am Israel and it's in 4k and it it it it really shows the inspirational story of Israel and the holy land Like people have never seen it before Where does your where does your your courage to do things like this come from? I Am at least courageous man, you know There are countries there are countries Financing films at the moment that I I have to bite my tongue not not to speak up but When it's friends money and things like that you have to be quiet sometimes, but in truth In truth there are there are certain fundamental things that we should believe in the right of freedom of speech the right to exist for God's sake in some places Israel Israel is is a historical obligation that Anyone who belongs to Western European Christian civilization or is a beneficiary Must acknowledge must be preserved it would be I you know that then to you Most of the good things that we have freedom of speech freedom of conscience These things have their germ in second century AD Christians in Rome Saying I don't believe that the emperor should have to make can can make a choice of me for me whom I would worship and our whole tradition of Freedom of speech freedom association right to vote and all these things they basically stem from that idea I don't know where the few other ideas as well, but you know we have an obligation to to to remember our past and remember its inception and and and honor it and Israel that curious people With their Barmy extraordinarily magical Relationship with their God is is we are indebted to them and and we must not allow that to be To be lost You're listening to the best of the Glendec program You Well if you haven't read this yet, it's it's disturbing to disturbing reading It's a long read but the Miami Herald has done an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein No, if I were to say to you that name you're Jeffrey Epstein is that a Jeffrey Epstein? I don't know But when I said that name there's a there's another name that immediately pops into my head when I say it For you Bill Clinton Bill Clinton that's exactly it because there was a big if you remember this There's a lot of reporting on it bits and pieces at the time where this guy Jeffrey Epstein hedge fund guy really rich guy Took people like Bill Clinton in his private jet to all sorts of places around the world including one island that he owned that was Believed to have sex slaves sex slaves and they called him an underage sex slaves And on the plane they called it the Lolita Express was what the media kind of picked it up I bill Clinton was good friends and you're really close. I think I was very close very tied into politics in general and so It was amazing when that popped out to see the headline from the Miami Herald This is separate from the story and there's amazing reporting in it the headline However is how a future Trump cabinet member gave serial sex abuser the deal of a lifetime So again the obsession with Trump continues here now Trump is He also was on this plane He also was Friendly with this guy who's a very powerful guy in the community It does not condemn Bill Clinton that he slept with minor with minors and it does not condemn Donald Trump that he slept with minors There's no Prevenants of that at all but they were this guy was a big money guy He was very friendly with people in the community to live in Palm Beach One of the girls who was abducted worked at Mar-a-Lago one of the women who was actually abused that's revealed in the story I think for the first time Wow was actually it was actually approached at Mar-a-Lago to do this That's the way it happened is insane though He Jeffrey Epstein had a he has multiple mansions and he has a private island But the molt the mansion he has in Palm Beach he would He went out and was able to recruit 16 15 14 year old 13 year old girls from local high schools and middle schools in the area and The way it would work is he got at the beginning there was only one Rodin won and it was somehow he convinced her to give him a massage for $200 now the massage some Would I don't think the first one didn't even turn sexual but it started to escalate and When he would get bored of the girl which a lot of times is after the first or second interaction He would offer them more money To first of all get more sexual and do more sexual things with other with these underage girls and some of them He had sex with some of them. He did all sorts of crazy, you know twisted sort of stuff with But then he would pay them even more to go out and recruit new girls Oh my god from their high schools from their middle schools from the mall From all of these local places where teenagers hang out He essentially turned it into a underage sex pyramid scheme in which he would reward the girls who were in early to go Recruit new girls to come in They go through they now have for the first time a bunch of these women giving interviews about about what happened and this is not like ancient history This is the mid-2000s like 2005 to 2008 something like that and They would come in they'd they'd have sex with him He had another sex slave that he had apparently imported from the Eastern block that would was hooking up with the girls while he was Watching I mean there was a lot of sort of twisted sexual stuff that went on And of course these you know, they were all almost all targeted in communities where in households where they were in need they were Disadvantaged people who didn't have money who were abused to it was all the typical sort of horrible stereotypes You'd expect out of the situation and it was people who would jump at $200 for almost anything so he was able to just keep paying and paying and paying and When he of it and you think about yourself it got up to the point of like a hundred different teenagers a Hundred he was able to do this with over a relatively quick period of time They talk about times where he'd have three of them in in a day Three in a day. He was his appetite was not able to be say so yeah, so They go through this whole thing eventually as you kind of expect you get a hundred different teenagers in this situation like this Eventually one of them talks the police goes Talks to their parent the police goes interviews them finds out. Oh my gosh. Well, this is this credible This really rich, you know important guy here. Did he do this? Well, that one gives them two other names the people who they recruited and who recruited them Anyway, every time they go to a new girl There's two or three more names they're getting and if the list builds and builds and builds and builds and builds eventually gets to like a hundred So the story is already super twisted at this point They all have really credible stories. They can describe the insights at the house They can describe what was in certain drawers like sex toys where they were they go eventually the police raid the house They have I mean everything they have names all of the the names are on the flight registry from flying them all around the world some of them they have Black books with phone numbers of all these like, you know 15 16 year old girls that came over for massages You know now there's been accusations from some of the girls that he would loan them out to other People all VIPs and that's not necessarily confirmed in here, but they go through all of that Sorted stuff then we're really kind of the Miami Herald and again despite the title of it And this is where they focus some of it. It's an incredible piece of reporting really is But they go into talking about the actual investigation the police Tried did everything they could to try to make this This case stick. I mean the people who are actually investigating it really seemed to care and did everything they could to make this stick But political influence money was able to get him to a position where the the the higher-ups locally were actually Negotiating and having the defense attorneys help write The deal that was being made now again you have you hook up with one 15 year old and this guy's like 50 That's you're basically I mean in my mind you're in jail forever You're you're everything that people accused Roy Moore of right Roy was accused of horror a worse horror. It's not even remotely close. Of course. He did no with one with one one Yeah, this is hundred so this guy should obviously be in jail for ever So the it's the the police locally got started getting wind that this was they were trying to make a deal with this guy They're like what this is crazy now the Trump official was the guy who was the the local District attorney or I can't remember it's it's not even that it's another position I lost the name of it, but it was he was the guy who was had the power to make the deal and there's a couple people who were a power to do it Costa his name. He's the current labor secretary his defense is look the other guy We were dealing with wanted to just make it a misdemeanor and go away So I got a better deal in that he had to register as sex offender He was charged with two counts of felony prostitution one with the underage mark two counts two. There's a hundred so he basically got the The cops locally were like that we can see what's going on here So they turn the investigation over to the FBI and the FBI started looking into it And they found tons of stuff in the middle of the FBI investigation. They sign a deal get where he gets just 13 months, I think it was in prison 13 months and In there is a promise not to prosecute which I had no idea This was a thing that I didn't even know this could happen a local official signs a deal not to prosecute So it cancels the FBI's investigation They can't do anything because they signed a deal where no one can get prosecuted not only can he not get prosecuted They sealed all the records and in addition to that no one else associated with him can get prosecuted over this So if he did lean loan them out to other VIPs, they can't get prosecuted. It's unbelievable. He goes to jail 13 13 months in jail, they give him a private wing of a prison. Oh my god with his own personal security Oh my god, and they let him leave and go to the office 12 hours a day This is his prison term. He leaves and go to his own office for 12 hours a day And he gets to have lunch outside in the park This is I can't remember the name of the character from Daredevil This in in Daredevil this this this Marvel thing on Netflix the the chief bad guy Horrible horrible human being he's let out by the FBI he can live in the top floor of this, you know Like Ritz Carlton. He's living a luxury life. He's got everything back, but you know He just he has some strings he can pull it's Unbelievable that it's happening in real life and in America This is the kind of stuff that people are fleeing their country To get to us because there is no rule of law This is the best of the Glenn Beck program and don't forget radar on iTunes Mike Lee senator from the senior senator from Utah is on with us now. Hello Mike. How are you? Doing great. Good to be with you. Thanks I want to talk to you about a couple of things and I think one of the reasons why I really like you is because You always look at things through the Constitution. I mean you you know you were clerk for Supreme Court justices and And you're talking about I want to talk to you about two different bills one is Is about protecting presidential power? Can you tell me about this with Manafort? I'm sorry molar Yeah, yeah, sure. So the the Slake Coons legislation Is designed to protect Robert Mueller from being fired. There's only one problem with that. It's not constitutional Justice Scalia pointed out in a great opinion. He wrote in a case called Morris and the Olsen The Department of Justice is part of the executive branch. It's run by an attorney general who's appointed by the president Confirmed by the Senate serves at the pleasure of the president You can't create a new de facto fourth branch of government within the Department of Justice one that's completely isolated and Insulated from the executive branches chief executive officer. It's wrong to do that That's for that reason that Congress allowed the former independent counsel statute to expire What Coons and Flake are trying to do with this bill would be to create a new de facto type of independent counsel That's wrong. It's unconstitutional, and I oppose it Okay, so I just want to make sure I understand this this helps the president But this is not something that you're trying to do to help the president You're trying to make sure we protect the Constitution and the structure of our country the Exactly right. I'd be doing the same thing in it with a Democratic president right because this is about the structure of the Constitution And that is a nonpartisan issue So the president because he's the chief executive he oversees and he runs these departments the Department of Justice so he is the chief executive so he's the guy who can fire and hire now that could be horrible politically for him Could the could the Senate or the House Congress take any action against him? Constitutionally if he did do this or is it just sure okay? There's no doubt there would be political consequences And there's no doubt that there are some things that would happen in response to it in the Congress If he did it and that's one of the reasons why I don't think he's gonna fire First of all, it's been almost two years for credit out if he would have fired him by now, right we're going to right Secondly he knows that there would be dire political consequences for him doing so and that's why he's not going to do it Anyway, that's why this is Much ado about nothing in my opinion in any event even if we're not much ado about nothing It's still constitutional and we shouldn't do it Because it would then create a fourth branch that the Congress is overseeing in the Justice Department, right? Yeah, yeah effectively and because This is a principal Propsic tutorial officer all of our u.s. Attorneys in the country Like the attorney general himself are appointed by the president confirmed by the Senate and serve at the pleasure of the president That's how the system works This bill would create a Many department of justice within the department of justice one that would operate outside of the executive branch chain of authority and that's not okay So I can break this down for people in ways that maybe they they understand in their real life You know we all may have our own roles as mom and dad but mom and dad have to agree that What the roles and the rules are this is like You saying no to your son or daughter for going to a movie And then mom says well, no, there's this special carve out over here dad can't say that on this movie because I disagree with them Yes, you can go that just causes chaos in the family and destroys the family in the end Yeah, the analogy is not perfect, but I'll give you a point for trying Just close Okay, all right Mike there is the uh the other that you are really in some ways getting hammered for by conservatives on on criminal justice reform And you've been you've been spearheading this along with others and I happen to agree with you Um, but some conservatives are saying well, you're just going soft on crime Yeah, the the opposite is true. They could not be more wrong In order to fight crime we have to be smart about the way we fight it Oh, michael mukazy Hardly a squish, you know former attorney general of the united states former federal judge Uh, and real hard-nose prosecutor Uh Has explained that pretty soon we will cross the threshold where more than one third Of the money going into the department of justice goes to running the prisons Part of this is because of the fact that we've relied on these sometimes excessive And the mandatory penalties within the federal criminal justice system Uh guys like this guy. Well, don angelos who i've talked about in the past who sold three dime bags of pot while carrying a gun And he got 55 years in prison for it. It's ridiculous And it diminishes our ability to fight crime effectively So our bill would fix problems like that giving judges an added degree of discretion Uh to put the long that the really bad people the dangerous people behind bars for a long time Uh, but make the right choice on other pieces of risk this bill would also Provide incentives for prisoners to go through Training exercises that will have been proven to reduce their rate of recommitting and offense once they get out This will make the american people safe. And that's why president trump supports it. That's why i'm proud to be part of this effort michael Why have we not heard heard any The the president come out in favor or anyone in congress stand up for asia bb And say we welcome asia bb the christian from pakistan that is Uh, you know spent nine years in prison because she blaspheme the prophet and and supreme court in pakistan heard her case and said It was a travesty of justice Uh and because of that her her and her family under threat england his past germany his past Why are we not leading the way on this? I don't know that's a good question. I'm happy to look into that would you look we've got countries? Yeah, i'd be happy to We've got countries around the world would do crazy things. This sounds like a particularly egregious one And uh, whenever we've got a country that purports to be an ally in at least some respects We ought to be able to exercise some degree of leverage on that. I mean we have we have uh We you know, we we should be welcoming we're having this problem in the border now and we're having a debate on what a refugee is Uh, well, here's one here's here's a catholic woman who refuses to deny her faith And so she is she is going to be beheaded and dragged through the streets. She's in hiding now She's trying to get a western country to take her Nobody will and at the same time We have two million people now these weigers in in concentration camps in china And in washington dc just two days ago. There was this this woman who has escaped from china She was pulled into one of these camps five times and she begged them for death They're they're doing things that are worse than george orwell was doing in 1984 and i think they're trying to sterilize The entire weager population and we don't seem to be even be talking about this We should be as a as a government as a party We should be showing the world what a real refugee looks like and it's not somebody who wants to come here for more Economic opportunity a real refugee is somebody like these people Yeah, that's why we have refugee programs. It's why we have asylum laws is to take on People like that. We're being persecuted and there is a real distinction. This is not to diminish The direness of anyone's circumstances around the world But it is very significant the distinction between people who live in the country economically depressed generally on the one hand And live in a country where the government is actively persecuting people based on their faith Or based on some other immutable characteristic based on who they are more than what they do Mike i'm curious if you have any Any thoughts on the investigation on jeffrey epsstein this just came out. It has a lot to do with i mean, certainly a lot of really shady Interactions of very seemingly a sweetheart deal in which you know he had Reportedly allegedly You know done all sorts of things to teenagers and it was a very Sort of really twisted tale and he wanted perceiving 13 months in prison with all sorts of beneficial treatment And it certainly seems like he was the beneficiary of his political connections and his money Is there anything we can do to stop that sort of thing from happening going forward and is there anything we can do about this particular case? Probably not not anything that we can do about this particular case or wants a deal like that is done Uh, it can't really be undone as far as that deal is concerned. How do you either in this case that In this case there was uh, he made a deal with what was it the local prosecutor not to prosecute? Yeah, I didn't even know that was possible. Basically they said they they the agreement was a non-prosecution agreement which Covered not only him but his friends and others associated with this These incidents from being prosecuted even by the fbi The way it read was it essentially canceled the fbi investigation that was going on. Is that even possible Mike? It does happen in some instances. I would want to know more about it before attacking it wholeheartedly I will say normally that is not the kind of sentence you expect to see Uh from that type of really long criminal behavior Once in a while you will see agreements like that if there is a failure of evidentiary Proof if there's significant uncertainty as to their ability to prove the crime um if there are uh, chain of custody problems with their evidence or if somebody has Uh, the ability to offer more evidence Circumstances like that can come into a play but like I say that's not the kind of uh Response from the government that you typically see with regard to offenses like what you're describing because this kind goes back to your Bill on criminal justice reform. I mean, you know, we can't be in a country in which someone who has a small amount of marijuana Gets 55 years in prison and jeff rieps team moles Potentially up to a hundred underaged teenagers and makes them into slaves. Yeah, and and winds up with 13 months I mean because I think yeah when it comes to criminal justice reform. Is it both sides of that? Is it making sure we punish uh real criminals more harshly and Ones that are with minor offenses a lot less harshly is it is it both sides of that equation? No, it absolutely is and this this gets right to the heart of the point I was trying to make earlier Which is that this bill that we're talking about Really is hard on crime if you if you want to make the american people safer Should pass this bill because when we're so focused on locking the guy who sells three dime bags of pot Up for 55 years That ends up having an effect when you have minimum mandatory sentences that automatically take you there And then you have cross-cutorial policies that encourage prosecutors to bring those cases because they're easier to win Easier to prove and result in an automatically really high sentence You end up missing the boat or you end up diverting scarce resources away from other far more dangerous offenders And so yeah, I think this quite arguably helps prove the need for this bill Yeah, I just think that there's a we're we're growing into this state and and it's it's You know, it's why people are clamoring to get here They're they're not clamoring here to to work at walmart What they really are clamoring to work here for is a fair shake and a system of of justice that isn't corrupt And it seems like our justice system is becoming one where we're we're hammering people for doing very little If you have no connections, you of course get the maximum sentence But if the same person has a lot of connections, they had nothing they walk away No, that's exactly right in that undermined the legitimacy of the criminal justice system And it's yet another reason why we need to pass this bill and I also like how you connected that to the border crisis I I think the two are related they are Look what what scares us about this is not the country of origin. It's not anything about their ethnicity It's the mob behavior that we've seen The mob walllessness Now if you go to anywhere any venue in your day-to-day life, whether it's church the grocery store A sporting event a rock concert And amusement park even your workplace chances are pretty good. You're gonna have to cross through a gate a fence a door Something where there are rules governing your entrance and your exit If you break those rules, especially if you break those rules as part of a large mob there will be consequences You will be thrown out And if you can't be thrown out if we reward the behavior of a mob in that respect Those same venues that you today enjoy will quickly become ruined. They will quickly no longer be created They won't be there for you to enjoy Well, I just can't believe so many people are standing up for this as you would say this mob And and yet at the same time The people who created those mobs in in Europe, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, the the policy that we had in Libya They're now going and talking all over Europe saying you know this migration thing this immigrant thing that was a real mistake And yet they're still standing up for it here Doesn't make any sense And they're disregarding the fact that there are people right here, man I lived for two years along the Texas, Mexico border and I can tell you there's no group of people More concerned than the poor middle-class Americans Many of whom in some neighborhoods most of whom are themselves immigrants or the children of immigrants There's nobody more scared than they are about uncontrolled waves of mass migration you know, it's easy for people who are hundreds or Thousands of miles north of that border living in their gated community sending their kids to elite schools To say let them all in it's quite another thing for those who actually live in the areas most effective We ought to be worried about them. Yeah, senator mikeley. Thank you so much The best of the glenbeck program So We want to welcome to the program A friend of the show and his mom Mike ro and uh and his mother peggy. Hello peggy. How are you? Good morning. I'm fine. Thank you good. I i mike. I'm sorry that we're going to waste your time here We really wanted to talk to your mom um, but uh Your uh, are you there mike? I'm here is my mother there. I didn't hear her. You're not wait. You're not wasting his time after all. Okay. All right good so uh Peggy, I wanted to start with you and first give you a compliment on raising an amazing son Uh, he is I don't know how you did it. I'm raising a son. I don't know what you did, but he is kind He is smart. He is one of only two People that have come into our broadcast studios uh in the last uh what almost 10 years now and After he was done he went into the control room and shook the hand of every person that He had no reason nothing to gain from any of these people Uh, and he is he's a remarkable man. You did a great job Well, thank you, you know, I really can't argue with anything you've said. I was hoping you would He is Well, he has his moments of course. Yes, not perfect Um, but he is unfailingly gracious to everyone He respects, um people and the jobs they do Um, and you know, it's always been like that and that's sincere. Yeah, no it is That's nothing fake. Yeah, so mike Can you tell me what it was about your mom that helped you turn out this way? Well glen, I'm at somewhat of a disadvantage because I can't hear my delightful mother Oh, no, talking to you. So so god knows what she's saying. She just says she's Yeah, go ahead That works to our advantage by the way I mean it is how proof booth You really do I can't hear anything changing game show if we do this right Uh or the end of my misspent career, but either way glen What what was your question? Precisely. Hey, I was just now apparently peggy can't hear you either So this is not going to work out well, um, but I don't know why can we do we were working on it? Or some technical issue some technical issue. This is this not happened before I what I was asking was what is it about your mother that? Helped you turn out because I I know a little bit about her, you know her mom What is it that your mom did that helped you turn out the way you are like? Mike Yes, um, she Well, look like any good mom she provided a great example But she also had something that a lot of good mothers today don't have and that is her own good mother living A hundred yards away Who basically had carte blanche to walk into our home anytime day or night Uh, and completely upset the apple cart in a way that was both fun horrifying instructive unforgettable And um, it just I mean, okay, so thank go ahead. Mike When you have a force of nature living in your neighborhood who has a key to your home You you simply sit back hope for the best and take good notes. So peggy, that's where I want to go I don't know if you could hear him yet But mike was talking about your mom and said one of the things that really Affected him was that she was a force of nature and she had a key to the house And uh, and it which made things exciting What little I know about your mother you describe her and this seems like an understatement as in as a baltimore aureles fan Uh that would throw her underwear at the tv and swear at the umpires Uh Can you by the way, I by the way, I could hear mike. Oh you could okay good You're my hi mom. How are you? Yeah? Hey mike long time. Hey, yeah, you miss me. Be honest Okay, so minutes together we talked so tell me so peggy tell me about your uh, tell me about your mom And growing up with your mom Yeah, you know, I I say in the book that I actually had two mothers and that's true mother number one Was refined and sophisticated She enjoyed the opera the ballet. She played contract bridge She dressed impeccably and her home was always ready for guests And then in 1954 the baltimore aureles came to town and mother number one just kind of disappeared Um mother number two was a crazed baltimore aureles fan. She did she jumped up and down and hooped and hollered Um, oh and she would drag me out to memorial stadium and baltimore And she would dance in the aisles and shout obscenities and umpires and you would never see any of this from your mother before Oh, absolutely not this was a complete 180 from my mother Um and for a young teenage girl. It was very embarrassing horrifying It was i really had to be very careful when i invited friends over i had to make sure there was no ball game on that day Okay, so so so after the ball game she would go right back to mom number one You know in most cases she would unless of course there was a sports program on uh like baseball talk or um You know where they would talk about the game the post game. I mean it mother number two Would remain as long as there was anything baseball happening in the area And then number one, you know mother number one would return Now Was there i mean i know of it was was there something wrong with her or was this just her passion I Well, I don't think there was anything really wrong with her. It was just a passion He just loved baseball and you know to my knowledge This was her first encounter with sports Except for high school where she played basketball and my mother was always in charge So I always think that she probably was the captain of her team um, but no Previously she had not really had anything to do with right so this was a surprise to all of us Yes, so mike, let me ask you the same question Was there something wrong with her or? Oh, yeah Yeah Yeah, i'm gonna go with you know a fundamental defect in a chromosome probably um, you know, I So far to say It was a deficiency, but it was definitely an anomaly Um because among her many other traits my my grandmother She was a corrector, you know in the same way like if she was still around today and on on facebook much like my dad actually Um, you know, she couldn't bear to hear a story being told Uh whose facts didn't comport Precisely with her recollection of them unless Unless she was talking about my mom or any of her grandkids in which case she lied like It was no my amazing Oh Lip mom Honestly, what did she say?
