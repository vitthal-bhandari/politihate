    "text": " Hello and welcome to Hysteria. I'm Erin Ryan and I'm Alyssa Mastromonico. So Alyssa as Mask Mandates all over the country are sort of falling by the wayside for reasons we're not going to really debate because we don't have time because it's a cold open of a show. Do you think America is ready to see everybody's mouths again? No, no, no, no. I have found it quite jarring going into stores where people have taken their masks off. It's like, oh, hey, also people recognize each other now. There is no being a ninja in and out of a store. Yeah, that's true. That was a great, great thing. That was a great side effect of mask wearing is like if you saw somebody and you're like, I just, not today. Not today. You could like easily dodge them. Man, I'm not ready to see all these mouths. I gotta say, not ready. Keep it together. This week we are joined by Aijen Hu, Jill Gatoitz and Riri Chaney to tackle the following questions. What's really behind all these bills targeting teachers and schools? How do we keep pushing for domestic workers rights given recent setbacks? How have our favorite queer female characters impacted us? And who has the energy to cook anymore? All this and more right now. We're going to do something a little different this week when we talk about news. And that's because a lot of what we're going to talk about has been talked about really well on other crooked media podcasts. Like I just guest hosted pod save on Tuesday of this week and Tommy and I got to talk about Florida's Don't Say Gay Bill and what they're doing in Texas. But one thing that I think is a common thread between a lot of the really naughty laws we're seeing now is that they target teachers. And you know, they force teachers to do things that teachers, that's not why they got into the profession. And they penalize teachers for not snitching on their students or outing them to their parents. And so I kind of wanted to get into all the ways that Republicans are now targeting public educators. And what that means. So we've got some good data here from Penn America. Since January 2021, 122 educational gag order bills have been introduced or pre filed in 33 different states. So fucked up. It's so fucked up. 12 become law in 10 states. And 88 are currently live. What is what's going on? Um, well, Erin, they I think that all these sort of crazy fringe groups, you know, look at all a lot of it goes back to Donald Trump, giving these people the room to think that people can stop progress from happening by putting cameras in classrooms and keeping teachers from teaching the current state of affairs. You know, and they're like, Oh, no, they have they have made subjects taboo and and vilified the teachers who are teaching curriculums that have otherwise been non controversial for years, because they think that it's going to help the pendulum swing back in their direction and create more little mega babies. I don't know. Here's it. And my my view of it is a little bit more paranoid. As one of you on many things is paranoid. I have, you know, I'm sitting here like collecting my fingernails here. But my my view on it is it's a little bit more insidious than that. I think that conservative groups are targeting educators, like forcing them to have cameras in classrooms. Like you mentioned, forbidding them from speaking about LGBTQ issues as they're doing in Florida, forcing them to out students to their parents as they're doing in Florida, penalizing making teachers mandatory reporters for parents who are providing any sort of medical care at all gender affirming care for trans kids in Texas. But there's other states too, I think what they're doing and oh, and in Florida, they're also like trying to sell like we're preventing critical race theory being taught where just increasing the, you know, we're making it so that the curriculum is accessible. So nobody is hiding the curriculum, which never was happening in the first place. I think what they're doing, these conservative groups are selling to extremely media illiterate people. Yeah, totally. That the way that students become radicalized is in schools. When that we know that that's not the case, students are becoming radicalized and they're accessing information through the internet, that horse has left the barn, that horse has left the barn left the barn in like 1999, you know, like there is the information that students want to get, they will get. So they're selling to these conservative old people, you know, crazy school board meeting, low media literacy people that this is what that that people are being radicalized in schools. But meanwhile, I think the end game for these groups is privatizing public education. I think what they're trying to do is hobble teachers make teaching so undesirable a profession that more and more people leave it. That's that public schools become less and less desirable and that we eventually end up with privatized public schools. And I think I really think that's what's going on. In the meantime, all of these like vindictive, spiteful, awful, small-minded, Helen Lovejoy style people think they're like helping, you know, in the culture wars, the culture wars, that that's done. That's done. These kids have already figured it out and they will figure it out without your help. I just I think they want to take public education away. That's my theory. Well, and you're correct because we're almost exclusively in all these bills. And of course, it's private come a lot of private companies are targeted and public schools. And in some states, they're even targeting like public colleges. You know, like when you look at some of this, the through line feels like it's kindergarten, it's younger kids at high school. But there are some states that are trying to sort of like censor what college professors at public universities can teach. The other thing that all these groups are doing, which we saw with the abortion laws in Texas, is suing people. So like your point is entirely correct about just trying to drive people out of the profession, driving teachers out of teaching because in Florida, parents can sue schools under that bill if they think that the lessons that they are that kids are being taught are inappropriate. And there are similar laws in like Tennessee, Oklahoma, and Kansas. So it's like how much being a teacher is not a profession that you go into to get rich, that you go into for a lot of glory. It's like you go into it because you believe and you want to teach young people. And I mean, it's like how much are you going to put yourself on the front lines of all of these sort of things coming at you? Like, where's the upside at some point? So I think you're right that that's they're just trying to drive people out. Yeah, I mean, and another thing is a lot of the people that are empowered to file lawsuits have no fucking business filing. No standing it's like it's exactly right. People who don't live in the district, people who don't have children in the district are empowered to sue schools for carrying materials that run contrary to these laws for discussing things in classrooms that they've denoted as like controversial. It's the Texas abortion law, like the Busybody Karen Act, but like applied to public schools. And that's something that I'm hearing from teachers who have been kind of impacted by this kind of round of craziness is that a lot of the people that are the loudest that are complaining the most have no fucking business complaining. Right. They don't have any kids in the classroom. You know, they're being busy bodies and they're doing foot soldier work for these organizations that actually ultimately don't really care about what's being taught in classrooms. What they care about is that private companies are not able to profit off of education as much as they want them to be able to. And so that is it's so this whole thing is like so insidious and gross and I don't trust the Supreme Court to protect teachers. And I'm really, really worried about the state of public education in this country truly. And it really it's it's deeply upsetting. I want to talk a little bit about Missouri. We don't really hear Missouri in the conversation as much when we're talking about Florida and we're talking about Texas, but Missouri has 16 bills pending. All of them introduced since the start of 2022. They want to ban the 1619 project specifically, right? A lot of conservatives really hate the 1619 project makes them very uncomfortable. It makes them very uncomfortable. Interesting snowflakes. Divisive concepts are banned. Certain ideas about race and sex are banned and students must be presented with a positive picture of US history. Honestly, here's another thing that I've been thinking about. Like, this could kind of be summarized as the all children left behind act because when these kids go to college and they're confronted with the fact that America was built on stolen land and stolen labor, they're going to look like real fucking dumbasses. They're going to be like, wait, what? What? That's not what I that's not what I learned. And also in Missouri, something that I found particularly offensive on behalf of teachers is that parents or members of the public, there's a bill where parents or members of the public should be able to go in and watch teachers while they take. So like animals in a zoo, watch teachers while they take professional development courses. Could you imagine like just some bad adventures backbenchers watching you just take a professional development course? Are you fucking kidding me? First of all, the kind of insanity that you would have to have to willingly watch someone else's workforce development courses. Like, that was, oh man, my teachers are not, they're not exciting. They work for his development. They ask a teacher. It is not exciting. All you have to do is watch Abbott Elementary and their professional development episode. And you, that is the truth, Erin. It is, it is right there on, on this big screen. Right. It's, it's not that exciting. But if you're the type of person who is so bound to determine to fuck with teachers that you're willing to sit through that, you are really made of stuff that I do not want in the water. Um, it's, it's really deeply, deeply weird. And it's again, like relies on these people who have just totally bought into the conservative mindset that public education is out here indoctrinating kids and turning them gay. Um, which is, is just crazy because we, I mean, like we, TV is turning the kids gay, you know? Euphoria is turning the kids gay. To your point, again, Erin, your point at the top just like, keeps, keeps being proven over and over because in Indiana, Indiana was the one I think that tells on itself the most because they get to the heart of the matter where they're like, oh, their bill, I think it's HB 1040 bands teaching socialism or similar quote unquote similar political systems that aren't compatible with principles of the US. It's like, what are you talking about? Which, you know, if like Republicans just hadn't like made every ad in 2020 about, about socialism and 2022 about socialism, which doesn't exist and isn't happening. Like, yeah, it's, it's socialism and critical race theory. Are there two faves in these bills? Yeah. Also CRT just to remind people is a law school level course. Right. It is not your, your fucking Braden and Kinsey are not learning critical race theory in second grade. Here's another thing that's kind of like a big picture thing. As I was reading about North Dakota, North Dakota banned critical race theory and also is requiring all instruction be factual and objective, which is funny because the implication here is that objectivity is, is the perspective of being like a white man in power because like, why, why is that the objective viewpoint and not, like the viewpoint of a person of color, a queer person, whatever. Anyway, you know, something I, that I was thinking about is, is these are the same people that think that teachers are babysitters. Yeah. Like you can, I think with a babysitter, when you have somebody coming over to your house and providing childcare, you can say, this is the schedule of naps that, you know, we're following. This is what I'm feeding my children. And these are some books that I have purchased that you, you can read to my kid. You have like, like, it's a baby. It's a person providing childcare. Someone providing public education is not somebody who you, you don't get a say over what public education is as a parent, you do as you get to elect a school board, right? Like, exactly. You don't get, you don't get to tell the teachers how to do their job because they don't work for you. They are providing education to children to make them better citizens, which doesn't necessarily mean they're doing what you want to do at home. And that's, I think, a hard thing for parents to come to terms with, especially if they just think that teachers are glorified daycare workers or just look, they're to look after the kids. And, you know, again, like we're talking to Aijan Pu in this show and like looking after children and providing childcare is super, super important. And it's a highly skilled job. But it's not the same as what teachers in public schools do, you know? And like, of course, and it's just, I just find it all. It's just a real salad of crap because it's disrespectful to a majority female profession, deeply disrespectful to a majority female profession. It's disrespectful to students. It is disrespectful to the people that they're trying to exploit into enforcing their agenda because it treats them like true idiots. Like you truly have to be an idiot to think that what you're doing is fighting the culture war because what you're doing is furthering an agenda. Right. And it's not until we talked about it in the way that we did today, I think that even when I was doing the research, this is not isolated. This is happening in so many places that it's not, it's not something that people can ignore because it's going to, these things are going to start popping up in places where you don't even expect to see them, I think. Yeah. And here's another thing that I find very insidious about all of this. Like there's a bill in Iowa that would require classrooms or be filmed. There's cameras in every public school classroom except for fire and special ed classes. And the cameras would feed live streams that could be viewed on the internet by parents, guardians and others. Really? Like you want to live stream the kids onto the internet. Great, great call. Way to go. That sounds like, that sounds like something Chuck Grassley came up with. Chuck Grassley and a bunch of like ancient evil and people. Chuck Grassley came up with it and I promise you, Olivia Benson opposes it. Exactly. I'm hearing the law in order, don't, don't in my head. But here's the thing, like they're, they're selling these laws like, well, teachers need to be, you know, safe, blah, blah, blah. And it's absolutely true that in some cases it would be helpful for teachers to have access to cameras in their classroom in the, in the case of fights for example. Totally. Like I know that in my sister school that there are fights a lot and it's, it's a safety issue. But the way that this is actually written and the way that it could be enacted is just like deeply. It's for snitching. It's first for snitching. It's not for safekeeping. It is for snitching and streaming. It's so weird. Like, I mean, look, this is the real pizza gate, man. You're, you're going to live stream a bunch of second graders to anybody on the internet. God, look, when I grew up in Wisconsin, I had relatives in Iowa. My dad's brother lived in Iowa. My cousins lived there. So we would, we went to Iowa a lot, a lot. So I have very fond memories of central Iowa. But my dad would tease my uncle by saying Iowa stands for I owe the world an apology. And I think in this case, I think in this case, it does. It's quite clever. Yeah. Or idiots out wandering around, which really, really made my uncle angry. Look, we, we know that there are great Iowans. We know that there's like a lot of hope for the state of Iowa, for the state of Indiana, for the state of Missouri, Texas and Florida even have people down there working as hard as they can to make sure that this shit doesn't happen. And they're, they're doing the Lord's work. But right now it's, it's gross. What is, what is happening? What the people in power are actually doing is, is deeply, deeply gross. And I don't know, Alyssa, are teachers a group to be fucked with? I wouldn't fuck with teachers. I would say no. Because you know what I'm going to just say? Didn't we all get here because of our teachers? Yeah. Like, why would I want to fuck with the people who got me here? Like, seems kind of illogical. Some would say stupid. Yeah. Maybe dangerous. Yeah. As a, I'm a product of a public K through 12 education, a brother and sister are products of K through 12 public educations, lots of great products of public educations. And for this country to move in a direction where we are endangering that opportunity for other kids, deeply fucked up, I do not approve and we will not, we will not be shutting up about this. No, we will not. Okay. Let's take a quick break. And when we come back, my interview with Aijen Pooh. And welcome back. Today, we're so pleased to finally welcome Aijen Pooh to hysteria. Aijen is the co-founder and executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, a nonprofit organization working to bring quality work, dignity and fairness to the growing numbers of workers who care for and clean in our homes, the majority of whom are immigrants and women of color. Welcome Aijen Pooh. Thank you for having me, Erin. We're so glad you're here. We've, you've been on our hysteria dream guest list forever. No way. That's so exciting. I love your show. Oh, thank you so much. Well, we love you back. So let's get this started. Okay. Conversations about the care agenda the past couple of years have been elevated to the national level and become for whatever reason, a controversial part of the infrastructure conversation. So this didn't happen overnight. How many years of work did it take for this issue to become a national conversation? And can you tell us a little bit about the people who came before you? I think probably if you asked Gloria Steinem, she would tell you that this work has been happening for generations. I know for me, I've been a part of about 25 years of organizing on behalf of mostly women of color who work in the care economy as professionals, as nannies, as childcare workers, as home care workers, and supporting our families with the care that they need across generations and really struggling to survive doing that work. The care workforce is overwhelmingly women, majority women of color, and earn poverty wages and don't have access to paid sick days and paid time off. And these workers have been organizing for decades to try to lift up the dignity and the essential nature of this work. And I think in COVID, more and more of us finally realize just how essential care is to our economy and our society functioning. And we are on the verge, I think, of a really big breakthrough in how this country values care thanks to a ton of organizing on the part of women and not just care workers, but family caregivers, moms, all kinds of people with disabilities, older people who've been fighting for the services and supports that they need in order to live whole dignified lives. All of this advocacy and organizing has kind of come together and converged in this moment. And it's really exciting to see Aaron. Well, we're in Women's History Month. So in that spirit, who are some organizers from the past that our listeners might not know about, but that whose work you're building on? Like, who should we know who was like a care organizer? I love this question. There's a woman named Dorothy Lee Bolden from Atlanta, Georgia. And she was a Black domestic worker in the South organizing. She actually was a neighbor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. And in the Haida Civil Rights Movement, she walked down the street and knocked on his door and said, domestic workers want to be a part of this movement. And he said, well, great, I need you to organize domestic workers. And she founded the National Domestic Workers Union, which ended up organizing more than 10,000 domestic workers throughout the South and was a critical part of gaining some protections in our federal labor laws for domestic workers that we were then able to build upon in the work that I've been doing for the last 20 years or so. Wow, that's great. So in that spirit, what priorities should public officials have today when it comes to the care economy? Like it was a part of Build Back Better. Build Back Better is kind of on the rocks. How would you like to see the conversation move forward? Well, I would say first that we still have a huge opportunity in the Senate to get components of the care agenda in Build Back Better across the finish line. So it is not over. In fact, we are in the middle of ramping back up our organizing and advocacy for childcare and home and community based services and paid leave, including improving the wages and working conditions of the workers who work in the care economy, either in our childcare system or in our home care system. And I think we have kind of a six to eight week time horizon where there will be a window where we could get this done and it would be a game changer. And for those of you who don't know what we mean when we say care economy, we mean the programs and policies that support our families to care for the people that we love so that we can go to work every day. And it includes childcare, making childcare more affordable and accessible. It includes paid family and medical leave. So if you need to take time off to take care of a loved one or spend time with a newborn, you don't have to worry about leaving your job permanently or losing that income. And then home and community based services for older people and people with disabilities makes it possible for our loved ones to be able to stay at home and in the community with the support of home care workers and other resources so that they don't have to be in nursing homes and separated from their families. So it's a big, a big program that's kind of about how we support families in the 21st century in this country and really long overdue. We are so far behind other countries on this. And with this agenda, the president's agenda, we can actually make a hugely forward into the future. So there have already been 10 states and two major cities to have passed legislation that's sort of along the lines of the national domestic workers, Bill of Rights. How and why was it successful on the state and local level? And how do we make that successful either on the federal level or in more states and localities? Well, we definitely need to do both. And you know, the secret ingredients is just great organizing, good old-fashioned organizing, where women have come together and built coalitions in states and in cities around the country to really recognize and protect domestic work, including nannies, house cleaners, and home care workers who are almost by definition invisible and isolated and really vulnerable to abuse and have faced a really long history of exclusion from labor laws and protections dating all the way back to the new deal. When Southern members of Congress didn't want black workers to have equal protections under the laws, so farm workers and domestic workers were explicitly excluded and that kind of set a tone for how this workforce would be treated as kind of second class. And so we've been organizing and literally, you know, domestic workers thousands going to state capitals and city halls and sharing their stories and organizing and pushing building coalitions with faith-based communities and unions and women's groups. And it's been really exciting to see the movement grow around the country and we now have a federal domestic workers Bill of Rights that Congresswoman Jayapal and Senator Gillibrand have introduced. And we're really excited to get that through because there's so many states, especially in the South, where it's so hard to get labor pro-worker policies passed and those workers are some of the most vulnerable and undervalued in the country. So we want to make sure that everyone has basic protections. So another way that the NDWA is crucial in the work that you do is that you work with Hollywood to engage in telling stories of domestic workers so that maybe people to whom their stories are invisible can kind of get a sense of who these people are and what kind of work they do. Why is the language we use about domestic workers and stories we tell about domestic workers so important? And what are some examples of like triumphant and important depictions of this work on screen? It's such a good question. I think early on we realized that even if we pass a whole bunch of laws to protect the rights of domestic workers, so much comes down to the way that we think and feel about this work and the people who do it. And until we shift that, until we change dominant cultural narratives about this work being unskilled or help as opposed to the profession, it is for millions of women and women of color, until we really change that, it will be hard to change how people treat domestic workers in the workplace every day. And so that's how changing culture and changing narrative really kind of became a priority of our movement and who better to shape and reshape narratives than our country's best storytellers who are telling stories that move our hearts every single day in the entertainment industry. And we've been really proud to work alongside people like Alfonso Cuaron who created the film Roma that just a stunning beautiful story that had an indigenous domestic worker as the main protagonist. And you know just for those of you who've seen that film thinking about seeing a domestic worker as the center of the story, as a protagonist, not as kind of someone in the background doing things that supports everything else, but somebody who has dreams, who falls in love, who gossips with her friend, who does sit-ups by candlelight, who is a whole human being with dreams and disappointments and heartbreak, is really, really important because part of how we allow for injustice to occur or exploitation, or part of how we allow for the devaluing of someone's work to happen is by thinking of them as less than fully a professional, fully a mom, fully a human. And that's what these stories allow us to do is see people in their three-dimensional whole human selves as messy and inspiring as the rest of us. And that is what's so important. And I just want to also shout out a show on Netflix called Made. And the showrunner Molly Smith-Metzler is just a genius. And that show, you really see and feel viscerally the cruelty of living in poverty and how difficult it is for a single moms who are doing everything in their power to take care of their kids and how many obstacles they face and just how impossible the impossible choices between food and a toy that costs a dollar at a dollar store for their kid and enough gas to get you to your job interview. I mean, these choices that are just so impossible that moms have to make every single day in our country because of our failure to really support them adequately. There's a unique way that storytellers like Molly can actually depict that that I think is so important. And I think it was based on a book by Stephanie Land. It sure was. A big shout out to Stephanie. Yeah, she's another dream hysteria guest. So Stephanie, if you're listening, come on, hysteria. Yeah, you know, it's really interesting. I have a kid. She's four months old and we're now at the phase where we're like interviewing or looking for child care. And there are chapters and chapters in books about like how to find a great person to provide child care. And it's like you need somebody who is like, you're saying qualified, it's a profession. And it's crazy to me, the bifurcation that people are able to hold, like two competing ideas in their head. On one hand, this person needs to be an educator, a caregiver, a person who can perform infant CPR, a person who has all these very specialized skills. But on the other hand, they're not a person who deserves protection. Like, how do we force people to put those two thoughts against each other and expose the hypocrisy inherent in them? Like, is there is there forcing or is it something that people need to come to organically? I mean, I know that's a complicated question, but it's just something that's been on my mind a lot. I think it's both and I think we have to really strengthen our laws and protections to make sure that they include and protect this work. And the isolation and invisibility of working inside of somebody's home in particular just makes it all the more important that you have these standards and protections in place. That is one piece of it. And I think that it's on each of us to really lift up the skills required to do this work. And just how essential it is, you know, this work has been referred to as help. It has been deemed unskilled. It has been, you know, relegated to the realm of reproductive labor as opposed to productive labor. And all of those narratives and mindsets reinforce the fact that this isn't work that is equal to other professions. And it's on each of us in our day-to-day interactions to really disrupt that, I think. And I think now is a moment to really do that. I mean, what bigger disruption to everything about the way that we live and work than COVID and inside of that disruption, we have the opportunity, I think, to reset how we do things, how we approach things, how we value things. And I think valuing what care workers produce, the human potential of a child, the dignity of an older person, the ability of a person with a disability to live in the community and work. These are invaluable assets that they produce for our society and our economy. And the more we start to move it into that framework, I think the easier it'll be for people to be like, well, absolutely. This work deserves benefits, protections, like everything that we would eat, all of us would expect at work should apply here, too. Well, Aijan Pu of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, thank you so much for stopping by to chat with me. Really appreciate the work that you do. And please come back again sometime. Thank you so much, Aijan. Great to be with you. For this week's Madam Histeria, I want to tell you about the Fox Sisters, Leah, Maggie, and Kate Fox, born in New York City in the 19th century, these sisters epitomized messy, complicated women. They were OG scammers, but also played an important role in the creation of spiritualism. They grew up in what was rumored to be a haunted house. Okay, fine. Kate and Maggie allegedly communicated with the spirits through wrappings, which were really just snapping sounds. And again, allegedly developed a code to talk to the spirits who again, allegedly told them that not only had a man been murdered in their home, but that his remains were in the basement. And they were. Well, there were someones remains at least. Maggie and Kate were sent by their parents to live with their eldest sister, Leah, in Rochester, which was a hotbed for reform and religious activity. Leah exploited their newfound gifts as mediums and became their Chris-Genory Momager. The sisters appeared before 400 people who came to hear these spooky noises from spirits. After the performance, the sisters were even asked to be examined by a panel of skeptics. No evidence of a hoax was found. Though we do wonder, what would that evidence have actually looked like? The sisters went on to New York City where they became full-blown, seance-giving mediums. By 1849, these witchy bitches were foundational to the rise of the religious movement known as spiritualism. However, the younger sisters started boozing and shit got messy. Medical doctors and Harry Houdini himself became super suspect of their gifts. The drama took a toll and the sisters' relationship began to fracture. Maggie did an interview where she copped to the hoax. The quote-unquote rapping sounds were made by snapping their toes and using their knees and ankles to make the cracking sounds. Oh, also, the remains in their childhood home? Chicken bones, it turns out. Although the seances and gifts themselves were revealed to be fraudulent, the movement the Fox sisters inspired continued for almost a century. And there you have the story of the Fox sisters. And we're back. Alyssa, do you remember when we were kids? Well, you were kids before I was kids, but you remember being a kid? I'm still a kid. Of course. I remember being a kid. One of my least favorite things about kids stuff, stuff that was aimed at us was it was always like a gang of pals hanging out. And there's always like one girl in the gang, like she had to embody everything. Like with Power Rangers, there were two girls, but they were like the girls. You know, they weren't like fully realized characters. Yes, of course. And like the tokenization of the female character, I guess, is we're not totally past it, but we're kind of in a new age of tokenization, which we're going to talk about today with two of my favorite people to talk with about this. First of all, we haven't seen her gorgeous face in a while, and it could not be a better site, making her triumphant return to hysteria. And finally, when we're not talking about depressing breaking news, right? You check out her new show she wrote on Killing It, streaming on Peacock in April. Riri, Chaney, Riri. Oh, hi, guys. What's up? Now, am I mistaken? Or did Instagram tell me that you went and saw the Katy Perry Las Vegas show? Oh, I sure did. Thank you. Thank you so much. I have a cold because of it. But yes, I went to see Miss Catherine Perry this weekend, you know, with it can only be described as a gaggle of homosexual women, 14 of us stepping out exclusively driving in party limos because of efficiency, scarring little girls and tutus as we move from space to space. And then Katy Perry, she put on a good show. It was like, I don't know what I was expecting. It was fabulous. She did yell out, let's go Ukraine at some point, which we all she had these like, it's the whole theme is like a toy store and these crayon soldiers came out and my friend Gus whispered to me she's about to say something about Ukraine. I was like, she wouldn't, she couldn't, she couldn't, she wouldn't. She did. Didn't let it sit and just kicked on the next track, just like kept going. And that's when I thought I'm gonna need another double vodka. Oh, man. Yeah, there's some, you know, as celebrities, we're in a golden age of celebrities feeling empowered to speak up about politics, but just because you can doesn't mean you should doesn't mean you should doesn't mean you should, but glad she picked it back up. So glad you're here. Also, we have a very special guest panelist today. Jill Gutterwitz is here. Jill is a writer, director and author living in LA, just like everybody else in LA. Her work has been featured in the New Yorker time, Vanity Fair vulture, Elle Glamour Cosmopolitan Vice, and basically any place that you would want to read things, her work has been there. Her debut book of essays, Girls Can Kiss Now is a very good, very, very good. And available now via atria books, her first short film and directorial debut, The Ladies, starring Lisa Ann Walter, who is having a banger of a year. Jason Lewis and Alexis G. Zoll and Annie Corzine is coming soon. Jill, so glad you're here today. Thank you so much for having me and thank you for such a kind intro. I feel like, wow, thank you. I'm also like the biggest Lisa Ann Walter stand. So I'm like, if you want to spend 45 minutes just talking about that, I'm here. The power of Chesy, man, like, speaking of queer culture, the parent trap, Chesy's like appearance in that was so important. Yes. You really read. Really? Jill, speak to that. You guys are agreeing on the power of Chesy and the parent traffic. What does that mean? Well, I feel like there's a trend happening on lesbian TikTok right now of all of these queer girls coming forward and being like, Chesy was a seminal queer crush in the 90s. She's like, has this maternal warmth, her outfit was perfect, outfits she had like zingers. She was like, you know what I mean? I don't know. She was awesome. That's so funny. I feel like as a straight woman who is on lesbian TikTok for some reason, probably because it's like the best corner of TikTok, I think. Yeah, it's like where culture is made. Yeah, totally. I'm seeing a lot of like kind of commiseration of queer women being like, oh my God, I thought that too. I thought I was the only one that where they're like kind of low-key queer moments in their childhood that they didn't know that they shared with like all these other people, which is like kind of cool. Jill, can you tell us a little bit about your new book the question that's written is, can you tell our listeners who haven't read it yet? I think it came up this week. So if you haven't read it, can you tell us a little bit about how it came to be and what made you want to write it? Yeah, it's called Girls Can Kiss. Now it's a book of personal assays. I feel like it's a good mixture of some really silly, smooth brain content, like a list of items that are lesbian and some really like personal, emotional stuff that I was happy to get into because I haven't gotten to do that that much in my more editorial online writing career. I feel like the gist of the narrative of the book is that originally when I sold it, I sold it in February 2020 and with the intention to start writing in March 2020 and then the world flipped upside down and it was kind of originally supposed to be more, I think, light-hearted, more like essays about film and TV, kind of like humorous, analytical, whatever. And then I think like, just like the world changed and I felt, we all felt heavier. There were things on my mind that I think like tonally just like came out through the book writing process. And so now it's like a little bit, you know, I think it's, I mean, it's better for it. It's like a little bit, I don't want to say heavier because it is still like overall a light-hearted book of essays, but there's definitely like more and more and more personal in there. Yeah, that's great. What was your first pop culture memory? You know, it's so funny is when we were just talking about Chesie from Parent Trap, I was like, there's also so much other like queer signaling in Parent Trap, like another thing, Riri, maybe you saw this also on lesbian TikTok of like the renaissance of the tie-dye shirt girl, the one who like rips the duffel bag out from underneath. I don't know, she was like, she was so strong. She was so powerful. And because she had the hat and she was just so cool. Also the Marvas like- The Marvas, yeah. The Marvas, that was the whole thing. Clearly a lesbian couple. Yeah, I was like, they were like Janice from Friends, but gay. Yes. I, yeah, I, so I feel like maybe like as I'm even having these conversations this week and looking back on this, I'm like so much about the Parent Trap was queer to me. And I feel like, yeah, like Lindsay Lohan in the Parent Trap and tie-dye shirt girl. I'm a 30 year old woman now and I still look at them and I'm just like, wow, they were so cool. They were so hot. That's what I want to be when I grow up. These are, I don't know, eight year olds. It's so funny. It's like deeply ironic that a movie about tricking a divorced hetero couple into getting back together, hetero sexually. It's, yes, it's viewed as like queer art. Riri, I wonder what your first moment of engagement with like queer art was as a kid. Yeah, really I thought this was coming. The best way to describe it is that I didn't, I didn't know I was engaging with it. I'm like identified as bisexual since I was 17 and then was just going about my business really like live in my life. When I was about 20, I walked into my roommate, Bill's room, stricken because I went, I loved Zina so much that when it went off the air, I went and he just went, yes. And I just said, how did I not know? I don't know, baby. I don't know. I really like, Jill, the moment of whether or not you want to be Zina or you want to be Gabrielle held by Zina is like a very large space in my body. Absolutely. I don't know. I think it has to be that. Even you, like, Erin, you're speaking about the power rangers. I always wanted to be the yellow power ranger because I think I thought she was more independent than the pink power ranger who like made so much of her personality being, it wasn't Billie's point, but like the red power rangers, girlfriend. So like to have, like, she stood on her own and she was always the person of color, which you know, obviously, but it like something about that was also had like a queer tent to it. So Saturday programming, where I guess you could get something out that was a little more gay, like Zina in a bathtub hiding in a beautiful woman goes underwater and like shares breath with her. So she's officially kissing her by giving her oxygen. Like, I love to share. Yeah, like to share that. Also, weirdly, another big one for me was Dr. Quinn. And here's why, because she took care of everyone. Like, I think there is something of when you're like speaking of chessies, speaking of like heterosexual spaces. And there's this one character who like so nurtures with beautiful hair. Yes. That you have to co-opitate for yourself as like, as signaling to you that like an attraction to this mommy trope, which is a huge thing in my life makes sense. That's so interesting. I have like a whole paragraph in my book just talking about these kinds of characters, like whoopi Goldberg and sister act, Miss Honey and Matilda. Like, Oh, God, break me apart. Truly. She like sucks now, but like Kirsty Alley and it takes two. Like, yeah, it was like all these like kind of like a little bit maternal figures who were like, I see you child who is different. They're like women with great hair in like a high waisted pant was like a real space, which if you look at what we're wearing these days, it's like it all came back. Yeah. So it makes sense. It's like the Annie Hall sort of look, Alissa looking back on like your pop culture upbringing. So like you were watching like you were watching like Little House on the Prairie. You were watching. Let's like take me down. Let's just explain my age. You guys were talking about power rangers. I was like, I think notionally, I know what the power rangers are. Well, it was about a there was a woman who wore pink who fought with by back flipping. And there were aliens and stuff. Right. So like different than Voltron. Yes, totally. But you know, a thing that now and we'll get we'll get to this in a little bit. There's like queer characters on TV that are overtly queer and their queerness is like written into their characters. Right. But Alissa, like, you know, when you and I were small children, like we probably connected with queer characters and didn't under like they were not we were not told they were queer. Like who is the first queer character that you remember seeing and being like this lady is awesome. Well, it's funny because my first real memory was when on Golden Girls, when Blanche Devereux, her her brother was gay. And so it was like it wasn't the character obviously Blanche was not gay, but it was my first memory of being like, what is this? What is this they're talking about? And most of my pop culture intake was probably more through music than it was through TV. That makes sense. Did you ever go to a Lilith Fair? No, I missed Lilith Fair, but I listened to it on MTV and I had the album and everything. I mean, it was like, I could rattle them all. I could rattle off everybody who was there. It's like one of the greatest things that ever happened. I remember really wanting to go to Lilith Fair, like really wanting to go. It was like all my favorite artists. And I felt like if I was going to go to a concert, I would rather be surrounded by women because I feel safer. Safer, 100% than I do around men. Some men are fine, but many are not. So I really wanted to go to Lilith Fair and I came to my parents. I think it was like 12 and I had this sheet and I was like, this is why I want to go to Lilith Fair. And my parents looked at each other like, what's going on? What's going on? What's going on? What's going on in a village craft is going to happen at this Lilith Fair? Right, right. And I remember being like, why won't they let me go to Lilith Fair? And I think that back then in what I would have thought. You were probably pretty young. I was. It was like 90, 96 or 97. So I would have been like a young teen. And I was thinking about this episode and I'm like, that was a formative memory of like not being allowed to go to Lilith Fair. And like, man, I'm not going to do that to my kid. Can you go to Lilith Fair? All she wants, man. See, and you, you were in your early teens when Lilith Fair came out and I couldn't go because I was in finals at the university of Wisconsin. Oh, sure, sure, sure. So Jill, I want to talk a little bit about a piece that you recently wrote for time. And you would talk about like the proliferation of queer characters all over TV now. And just to kind of summarize the piece, you say like you're kind of tired of just seeing these like tokenized queer people just thrown in and you would rather see queer stories. Can you expound upon what that means? Yeah, totally. I feel like it's so crazy even say something like this because also like, you know, when I was growing up, there was so much nothing that if there was a queer character, it was like completely insane to see them. And they were probably like tropey and awful. And so it feels like completely insane to say like, you know, maybe let's do less. And I don't, I certainly don't mean less queer characters, but I do feel like I've seen this trend lately of it almost feels like like studio note where they're like, well, we need to throw in a queer person in the show or we'll get in trouble. And then it becomes like, you know, this kind of like half baked, like just almost like embarrassing kind of offensive character that's like, you know, like, the name on everyone's lips is Chadia's. But I know, I just feel like so many of these characters end up being like queer people who just talk exclusively, like exclusively exclusively about their queerness, you know, and not just like about their lives or their relationships or dating or their jobs or, you know, whatever. And so I feel like, you know, the reason I wrote the time article is like, I want to get back to a place of like, just seeing like really good human authentic real queer stories and queer characters to me that feels like better and more meaningful than like throwing a queer person in every show to fulfill some sort of like studio quota or something. And then, you know, ending up having them be just like quite offensive. Riri, what are your thoughts on that? Are there any particular queer characters that you're just like, Oh, shut up. This is this is not this is not it. Hey, it's Chadia's. I felt scared when you said felt like fear. Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm and I don't even I don't even want to take shots at that because what I think the problem is having been in a couple of these rooms at this point is that every time there's like a new group that someone has decided they're finally going to acknowledge the folk often straight white guys who are in charge of it of the rooms are like, all right, how are we going to do this? Yeah. It's like approached like you just said as a note as an obligation rather than like a human. And so it was black people and Asian people who are Hispanic people and gay people and well bisexual people may not exist. So maybe we'll do that. And now it's trans folk. And this idea that and like Jill, you put it so beautifully of this like they have to be either like only talking queer theory all the time. And this is from someone who took queer theory first semester of college versus like eventually allowing them to have nuance and fault and different they're paying not connected to their queerness, but like what it is to be human. What is it to look at these folk as if they're human? And that's you know, that's really frustrating. And I feel like it's we've also been taught to be thankful for what we get, which is the most frustrating part of it, right? Like I get hired often. I'm a black queer person. So I've now like weaponized that in interviews. I'll be like, so I understand why I'm here. You want to talk about that? Like I step forward with it as like a armor of sorts. But then sometimes I get great responses to like being actually in the room and sometimes it's more like, well, we got it. We got like the gist of it, you know, but so I'll it's you. I don't know, you want to go for authenticity. You want to fight back for like you should just be grateful for what you have and try to also look at characters that come and go that you know, we now look at with a lot of side eye, but recognizing how much of a fight it probably was to get them on in the first place. So now that we have all of the because there were so there were so fewer shows, but now that there's so many options, you don't have excuse anymore. And you have so many people out here like really like hustling to get into these rooms and to give you that authentic experience. We just need some white guys to listen. Are they to be unthroned and so that we all rule the world? Which is my plan. I think that that's a great idea. I have a tattoo of a deer head between my shoulder blades that represent people I've seen it have been like, Oh, that's beautiful. And it's like, no, it represents me killing the man in charge like wearing his head. But but like here's something that you and I have talked about reread. And that's like the pressure that comes from being the only one of something in a room like I think maybe 10 years ago, there was a lot of people who were the only woman. Alyssa, I'm sure you were looked to sometimes is like, Alyssa, you're a woman. Yeah, I'll tell you kidding. Tell me tell me how the women think. And you know, just having one. And I think part of it is because the people who run things are willing to make just like the least amount of room possible. Like what is the least amount of space we can give in our writer's room for a person who can like offer a new perspective? And then we'll put the maximum amount of pressure on that person to represent the entirety of possibilities of that perspective. Jill, you're nodding. Yeah, well, I was going to say, you know, for the time article, I talked to Nori Reed, who is a hilarious and really thoughtful comedian. And you know, like, we like Nori said this in an email to me that like, you know, like I don't blame the, you know, the person who like got hired to basically like the like token voice here, because it's like they're under so much pressure from, you know, the higher ups who are mostly still like white cis straight men that like, you know, it's like, you know, with J. Diaz or with any of the like characters that I feel like have come out that feel kind of like, you know, like flimsy. It's like, you can't you can't blame the like queer people that are writing these like, obviously the queer people have the authentic experiences and like are we're definitely like in the room fighting for like, Hey, guys, like, what if they didn't say, you know, like woke moment or whatever, like, like, what have we just like talked about, you know, their life? So yeah, so it's like, you know, it's also like challenging to talk about I think because I don't want it to come across like I'm like placing blame on the like queer people who are being tasked with doing these impossible things, you know, yeah, I think I think that's totally fair. But I also think that like people will make bad faith arguments that that's what you're doing. But those people are totally, but those people are not they're unserious like they're people who don't want to make space in the first place, I feel. Well, I think that's the huge part of it. It's like this, the people who are in charge of what finally makes it on the page or what gets on air and by air. I don't know the internet. On stream. There is, yeah, there is this like bitter judgment that folk with different identities dame to exist. And that's what we're reading off of it. It's not the joke isn't from them. It's on them. Yeah. And that's what's so agitating about like we fight you finally get trans characters and non binary characters showing up in spaces that aren't exclusively there or something exclusively in their corner of the internet. And they feel more caricature, which is in stark contrast to the characters you've actually thought of you like allowed to have a little bit more nuance or like exist with a little bit more grace. And I think that's what folk are, or especially queer folk on the internet in gay Twitter are responding to. And because we can't help ourselves. Well, Twitter is there. What are you supposed to do? Not tweet. What are you supposed to do? Not go on? Exactly. Exactly. Elissa, what are some things from like your upbringing or from pop culture past that you look back on now and you're like, that did not age well in terms of homophobia, in terms of queer phobia, like, oh, God, shit. I mean, here's the problem is that like, I feel like by the time I was old enough, I had like, I think I really wasn't exposed to that much when I was young, that I have like these very, like, I look back and I'm like, Oh my God, that was terrible. It's like, I mean, yeah, I watched all in the family growing up, but I felt, you know, my parents, I may have been three or four years old, but my parents were always like, and here's the lesson, because we didn't leave cartoons necessarily. I think that for me, I identified with people and picked out people who I love that were like me. And I think that I felt different. Do you know what I mean? Like, I wasn't ever feminine. I've never been a feminine person. So I gravitated towards what were then called, you know, tomboys. But I think either I have eliminated all problematic things from my foundational years, or I just don't, I just didn't realize what was in front of me at the time. You know, what's interesting about like queer characters or queer quoted or like tomboys or whatever, right? Riri, you brought this up earlier in the conversation that you liked the yellow ranger because she wasn't so much focused on boys. And I think one thing that queer characters have to offer the queer characters are not necessarily entirely focused on like being boy crazy. Like, I really loved having female characters that related to each other about things that weren't right little boys like Nancy Drew. You just wanted to solve the crimes with best, you know, that was exactly I want she was about her business. She was about she was an entrepreneur. Nancy Drew would definitely have gotten murdered. I'm just going to say that Nancy Drew would have gotten murdered in like book two by somebody in some idiot. Jill, what are some depictions of queerness from your youth that were played for laughs that you consider especially egregiously bad looking back? Yeah, I mean, like, for me, I feel like there's like, like a super cut of like things that were small that are actually were actually super meaningful, you know, like to me, like, in Bring It On, which I wrote about in my book, like when Courtney, the Mean Girl, calls Missy, who is like a object objectively the coolest character in the entire movie. Well, I mean, honestly, there's like four of them that are fucking iconic. But like one of them, she's like painted as the cool person in this movie. And then she Courtney calls her an Uber Dyke. And I felt like, and then everyone like laughs at her, she gets like laughed out of the room, she like stomps away through the gym. That like those kinds of moments I felt were like really challenging, where it was like, yeah, like a like a gay joke played for laughs. That one specifically, I feel like was set up in such a weird way where it's like they make you, it's like they set me up a like young girl watching Bring It On to be like, oh, whoa, like here comes like Eliza Dushku, like she's fucking cool. She's got a wallet chain and a tattoo, an eyeliner. And so the end, and so I was like primed to be like, Oh, fuck yeah. Oh yeah. And then they call her a dyke. And then it was like, I'm like, now I can't trust my instincts. I'm like, wait, but I thought she was cool. Now, but now she's bad. Okay, no, don't I don't want to be like her, you know, like those kinds of things. Even like a more recent example that always comes to mind is like in bridesmaids, when Chris and Wade goes like, lesbian, like those kinds of things, I feel like really got me when I was younger, because just like the insinuation that like if two women were at all intimate, even in conversation that they were like lesbians, which is bad, you know, and that made me really like aware of like not building intimate relationships with other women because I didn't want people to like yell lesbian about me. But I feel like in the age of TikTok, in a place like Los Angeles, that would be like a cool thing to happen. Like if it's absolutely in like most in like most neighborhoods where there's like fun stuff to do, someone yelling that, it would be like, oh, all right, thank you. I must be wearing a very smart pants suit. But laser looks very good today. Yeah, exactly. Okay, well, we are running out of time for this conversation. Jill, always a pleasure to have you here. We're going to ask you to stick around for I feel petty, but first we're going to take a break. And welcome back almost to the end of the show, but not quite. We are going to talk about what we're feeling petty about this week. Riri, why don't you start us off? Okay, I'm going to start a bit called pre-pettie. Like I assume this is coming. And so I want to be on the front edge cutting edge front page of being petty about it. So Florida continuing to be the state that should be cut off their Senate passed the Jones State Gateville, which you know is trying to persecute children who are just trying to live their lives in BC. And so in an effort to get more visibility of the protests and just people standing up for what's right down there, there's going to hashtag going on on Twitter of we say gay as a sort of response to what's going on there, which you know what I completely understand trying to get resources into one place and folk want to see what's going on. That makes a lot of sense. Yesterday, Mark Hamill, Luke I walk up posted in response to the we say gay hashtag gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay oh oh oh it hit it hard because I see what might happen here. And I see an imagine we are the world sort of bullshit video that could happen. And I just want to say please don't, please don't. No one wants to see you from your tea garden. Say gay. It does it, it does it, it's not going to do it's not going to give what you think it's giving. And we already spoke about like celebrities who feeling too free to speak on what's going on politically and but and not making the choice not to. Maybe I don't know if we've learned since spring 2020 or June 2020 or the summer of 2020, but the performative allyship or you know protest just aren't hitting the way or not giving you the past like it used to. So if anyone's PR team is out there listening while on their peloton, stop them, stop don't let them do it. It's not going to turn out well. Oh man, Luke I am your father, dad I'm gay. They should put that in Star Wars. I think that would mean something more than Luke's camera. Treating the opening scroll of Star Wars is just like gay. Well yeah, Disney seems so so excited to do something about it. They should just replace that do it up. Alyssa, what are you feeling petty about this week? You guys, how on earth are there pajamas made that require dry cleaning? Like I love pajamas. And you know what, I have really run through my gap bottoms. And I was like, you know what, it's time to invest in some proper PJ sets because I love them. And it was like my birthday. And so I'm like, I'm going to do it. And it didn't occur to me to check that for some reason, 100% cotton pajamas require dry cleaning. So one, why is that? Also, they weren't like $500. They were just like normal pajamas. So anyway, it is my custom to not buy things that will require a more to maintain than it was to purchase in the first place. So the cotton PJs are going to go gentle, gentle night into the washing machine night. But I just don't understand. It should be like a blinking beacon on pajamas if you're buying them. And it's like, oh, you're going to dry clean these after you have perimenopausal sweats in them one night. Like if I can't, like if I can't watch them, I probably shouldn't have night sweats in the meter. Right. Like I got a cat bed that's like dry clean this cat bed. And I was like, no, like that doesn't work. No, I'm throwing it away when it gets dirty. That's what's happening to this cat bed. No, not dry. Let me tell you, I've gotten very acquainted in just the last few weeks with for anyone listening. It's very helpful. You take a pillowcase, you put your dry clean, either washable silk or cotton pajamas in the thing, in the pillowcase, tie it off, little wool light gentle cycle. So far so good. That is a great household tip. That is a really great household tip. I really appreciate that. Okay. This is like so stupid, but I have to do this every week. And so I'm really reaching. But here's what I feel petty about. I think if you own a grocery store, or if you are in charge of stocking a grocery store, you should be familiar with cooking and what people might want. You know, there's a huge grocery store in my neighborhood, a giant Vons. And it's deceptively big. Like you go in and it's like, whoa, there's like too many aisles. But the thing is, the rice aisle is pathetic. I think you can tell a lot about a grocery store's quality by the rice aisle. There's no Israeli style couscous. There's no regular couscous. There's only like, there's like 10 kinds of jasmine rice and like no black rice, no wild rice. It's like, I feel like if you don't know your rice is and you don't know how like what a person who cooks might want in their pantry, then you should outsource the stocking of your grocery store to a person who does know. Also, I live in a neighborhood that is pretty diverse. And a lot of the people who live in this neighborhood come from cultures that cook with rice a lot. There's a lot of Filipino people in the neighborhood, a lot of Mexican people in the neighborhood, South American people in the neighborhood. You got to know your rice if you're going to have a grocery store here. That's what I mean. Aaron, I like to send a shout out to my little Hanaford over by Bell's Pond because it's the tiniest grocery store ever. And we do have all aforementioned rices. So proud. That's great. You need to get your rice act together, Vons. That's what I'm talking about this week. Jill, what are you feeling petty about? Mine is also like quite dumb. And I think, you know, revolves around cooking. Actually, I feel lately, I feel so pressed about cooking on a weeknight. I think like cooking on the weekend, like beautiful feels like an event, feels nourishing. It's healing can be done with family, with friends, a beautiful, a beautiful moment to be had on like a Sunday evening cooking moment. Cooking for yourself or yourself and your partner on a weeknight can't be done. And I think it should be, it should be illegal. I don't know. It's like, I, to come off of a work day. And it's like, and especially during like 2020, when I was feeling like, you know, when I was like, truly losing my mind, I mean, we were all losing our minds. Like, I was like, no, this is good. At the end of the day, you like, you wind down, like chopping the onions, it's going to heal me doing something with my hands, doing something physical. But like, now I just feel, I can't, I can't do it. And it hurts my feelings when I have to begin the process of chopping onions or crushing garlic or whatever it is at like 7 p.m. on Tuesday. That's not for me. So you know, I had a conversation with my parents about this not that long ago. I was like, you know what I made the other night for dinner? And they were like, what? And I'm like, hot dogs. And my dad's like, and my dad's like, and I go, so many fucking pots of pans. I'm like, a pan for the hot dogs, one for the beans, some for the french fries. It's like, that's the thing about cooking. The cooking part may be soothing, the dishes, not soothing, not remotely. Not soothing at all. Not soothing at all. We, so Juniper goes to bed, my baby goes to bed between 6 and 6 30 because she's a baby, which means we don't start cooking until she's down. But also like, we can't make too much noise in the kitchen because after she's down, if we wake her up, we have to start the whole process over again. So it's like, yeah, I feel paralyzed by like the prospect of cooking at this point. And it's also like, we don't even really eat until like nine. And we have dishes. Yeah, I think the cleaning is really actually if I can like boil it down. It's like the pans. Yes. You know, like, like, I could maybe like eke out some like healing chopping of vegetables, but to then afterwards be tasked with pans is no more pans. The sheet pan meal is really great for that because then you just have the sheet pan. Like you're not. You just bunch up the foil. Yeah. You just bunch up the foil. By the way, have you done the foil in the dishwasher trick? No, what's that? Oh my God, I learned about it on cleaning tic-tac, which I am also on, where you just take some aluminum foil and you make a ball, like a loose ball and you throw it in your dishwasher before you run a cycle. And there's some sort of chemistry that happens and your dishes get cleaner. I swear to God. Really? Yes. Well, you know what my science lesson. And here's what I was going to say for some baking invest in those silicone mats. They'll always keep it's like the scrubbing. It's like that's the thing. Because like, you know, then you put the pans in and you're like, I'm so tired. I'm going to let them sit overnight. But then the water gets cold and that shit's just congealed again. So it doesn't matter. Yes. I need to get on cleaning tic-tac and stop like rotting my brain on lesbian tic-tac. Hashtag clean tic. There's a lot of there's a lot of good stuff. It'll show the things that people do with baking soda. I was going to say, seltzer lemon vinegar baking soda are the foundational elements of clean, clean tic. Yes. It's really incredible. Now I have like a gallon of white vinegar and like a giant thing of baking soda under my sink. And I use it to like, you know, disinfect my pipes from soap. Sure. It's, it's, which I didn't realize that I was supposed to be doing. But now I'm doing it because of clean tic-tac. This was a great show. Jill, thank you so much for stopping by. And thank you so much for having me. Yeah. And everybody should read your book. It's, it's so good. It's so, it's so good. And also like, can I just say, I love a great essay collection because you can read it before bed and you're not like, where am I in the plot? Right. You just read when you have time, put it down, pick it up again. It's, it's great stuff. Thank you to Riri for stopping by. Alyssa, thank you as always for being my writer die.
