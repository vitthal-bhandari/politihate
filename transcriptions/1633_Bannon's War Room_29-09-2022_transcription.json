    "text": " This is what you're fighting for. I mean, every day you're out there. What they're doing is blowing people off. If you continue to look the other way and shut up, then the oppressors, the authoritarians get total control and total power. Because this is just like in Arizona. This is just like in Georgia. It's another element that backts them into a quarter and shows their lies and misrepresentations. That's why this audience is going to have to get engaged. As we've told you, this is the fight. All this nonsense, all this spin, they can't handle the truth. War room, battleground. Here's your host, Stephen K. Bannon. Thursday 29th September in the year of earlier 2022. And we're all out here within what is it? Six weeks of the election, 40 days that we've got before the biggest midterm in American history since the Civil War, 1862. We want to go to Matthew Tirmont. We've got a packed show this hour, so we're just going to have to clip through it. We want to go to Matthew Tirmont about tonight. Remember, the Chinese Communist Party is all over Brazil. They want to take the resources of Brazil, the assets of Brazil. They need to control them. They're all over this campaign. Here is right now, we just had this huge win in Italy before that in Sweden with the Swedish Democrats around that same time. The populace taken over the conservative party in Canada. It's win after win after win. But the big win is on Sunday. Matthew Tirmont has been all over this. There's a debate tonight. You had a debate back in the summer. Bolsonaro keeps winning because Lula is just not on top of his game. But is that going to matter? Is this thing rigged or is this thing? I don't understand the polling on this whatsoever. I see these massive, massive crowds for Bolsonaro. I see the ground game. Matthew Tirmont makes sense of it for our audience. Tonight, we have the second debate. They only faced off twice. The first one was at the end of the summer. J.B. Gyar Bolsonaro went on the attack against Lula de Silva calling him a rough accurate. The guy was a felon. He was put in jail for the famous Operation Car Wash where him and his boy were in the former chief of staff and then who followed him into the office. President Dilma Rousseff were caught money laundering their ill-gotten game selling Brazilian assets to China, to the CCP, via Petrobras. Tucker did a great specially talked about them selling the access to the ports, all the systemically important institutional frameworks of the country. The Chinese were coming in and buying in Brazil on the ground. It's a highly Catholic country. They do not want to be communist. They know communism leads to the death of religion, gulag, slavery, mass executions, Brazilians are smart. They've had a tough history. They know what it looks like. Tonight, we have the second debate. This is the main debate. It's a couple of days. J. Hang on. I want to say something. This is about the friendly competition we got going on in the chat from the two movies, St. Michael versus the super spread of the traditional Catholics versus the evangelicals. I think the most Catholic country in the world, the largest, biggest Catholic country in the world. The Bolsonaro is really, he's an evangelical as is the family. And really the evangelicals are the driving force, the driving religious force in Brazilian politics. Is that not correct, Matthew or Tirma? That is true. But it's not competitive. They are all on the same side. And that's the side of, like we said in the Italian and the Polish slogan, the Italian slogan that Maloney's been running, God family homeland. In Poland, you say, bug owner or cheese nut. That honor fatherland. This is what the Brazilian right, the silent majority, the masses feel, you know, we did, I did a Frank Gaffney's podcast today and that'll be live in the next 24 hours. And we talked about Alan dos Santos and myself, the amount of people that show up to the rallies, you think Trump rallies are big? Five, 10, 20, 40, 50,000 people? No, no, no. Add an order of magnitude and exponential factor of 10. It's 500,000. It's a million crowding the city's Rio Sao Paulo, Brasilia, Porto, or leg right. They're packed up. People are enthused and now they have to fight against this sort of kleptocracy that has been working hand in glove with the Chinese Communist Party to colonize to allow the Chinese imperial hegemonic ambitions to colonize this hemisphere. And they're where they want to take root the most is Brazil. Add products because of the natural resources because of the size of the economy. 212 million people in Brazil, we expect 40 to 50 million of them will tune in for this debate tonight on global, which is sort of the Brazilian CNN. If you think CNN works hand in glove with the with the Dems and the the State Department and the FBI, global is even worse in Brazil and how politicized they are. There will be candy, crolly moments galore. If anybody remembers that from a few years ago, would she wait in on the debate with Mitt Romney? This is going to be an absolute just circus and JB is going to handle it really, really well. And then of course tomorrow you'll read in global that Lula, you know, has the voice of the is the voice of the people has a sport. He's going to get the four dusted by him. It's why he doesn't campaign people spit on him. Okay. Here's his his right to understand. Here's your understand. He's running a Biden campaign, but there's no there's no there's no COVID to talk about. He's literally running the Biden strategy. You don't see him. There's not big crowds. You're seeing three, four, five hundred thousand people show up for Bolsonaro. How can the polls be where there are and how can he win not just with the machines, but when the Supreme Court seems to me given I read your five thousand word description, an analytical piece on this, it seems they've already weighed in and say, Hey, Lula's going to be the president. You're going to have to suck on that. Matthew Tirmon. And that's what they're pushing. You got a bunch of other candidates, two others that will pull that will poll and return in the high single digits, which should spoil any chance of one of the two leading candidates, Bolsonaro on the populist right, Lula on the sort of workers party, laborite left from winning the simple majority, 50 plus one to avoid a runoff. So everyone knows that if that were to happen that, you know, Lula came in and got 50.001 percent and one that it would be totally fixed because you got to two candidates, Gomez and Tebet that are going to get five to 10 percent. You got two other candidates as well that are going to get a couple of points. There's a small shot that JB, you know, if we overwhelm the system, if the right comes out with the right energy and people are angry and motivated, then he might win the wrong. He might win it in a, in a first round without runoff, but all of the since institutional systems of the Supreme Court that I write about, their subsidiary court, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the election court, where they're going to weigh in. They just passed a law, but they don't have the right to pass a law. They just passed a law by a, by judicial fiat that you will not be allowed to bring your cell phones, the voting group and the, it's a Congress's job. Tebet, they've, Twitter, Twitter's already shut down your piece. You and Jason Miller, what we're in the country and you got rusted by the police, right? They want to see everything about you, why you were there, all that. This is the police. This is the police that has been created out of the Supreme, this law of Supreme Court. It's a federal police like an FBI that has the right to investigate arrest, subpoena, go through records, call big tech and tell them take down accounts, arrest journalists, arrest Daniel Silvera, a balsanaireista congressman. And they have all the powers rolled into one of, if you could imagine the biggest leftist in our judiciary, in our legislature and in our executive branch, the, the molars, the Merrick Garland, the Sotomayor, the ships, the Nadlers, if they all had the same powers rolled into one way, they can take their enemies and imprison them. That's this court. They oversee the elections. They have a system run by Smartmatic, a digital system. Yeah. Ant on the ground on the streets. Give us a paper back. Oh, so there's no prop. There's no problem there. There's no problem there. No, we got a winner. When are you going to, are you going to live stream? Are you live streaming? Are you live streaming this tonight on get our meme? I mean, my point is, are you going to do live commentary that people can follow? How can people follow this? I am going to comment like I always comment, which means run my mouth off and I appreciate you allowing me to do so in your show and Polish television as well. Yeah, I'm going to be commenting on this all weekend. You know, pray for, pray for JB. Hey, where do they go? Where do people go tonight? During the debate on getter, you'll be on getter. Be on getter. I'll be on Twitter. You know, predominantly I'll probably make some longer posts on Facebook. And again, it's my name. My name's a rare name. I'm the only name with it. So you're not going to find any other Matthew Terrell. Well, I have. Well, we'll have you on tomorrow morning to give an assessment of this. The elections on Sunday, they couldn't get any bigger. All the chips in the table. One other point. One other point. Matthew, thank you so much. One other point. One other point. Data point up today talking to some of the people in Brazil. They're so apprehensive about what this court's going to do and how aggressively heavy handed they are. The military, and this is a scary thing, but the military, much like in Sweden when the cops in the firemen were all on the side of the Swedish Democrats because they were sick of seeing their daughters raped by open borders policy, the military is firmly involved in ours camp and they are going to be overseeing the election to the best of their ability. And I hear murmuring that if the court goes out of line, there may be some stuff that looks like 1970 South America, which is scary. But you know what? I don't care what the New York. CNN says laws under attack because rule of law is under attack by the fascists of this court and those who are in bed with the Chinese Communist Party who have been in jail and who were released by this court. So we're all fired up and let the chips fall where they may, but we have a lot of forces of good on our side, including the Brazilian military. Matthew, look forward to watching it tonight and look forward to talking to Mara. Thank you. Do you have a cold open for Joe Allen? We're now going to go to some really dark places, but hey, we've got to in the battleground because you've got to understand what's going on. Can we play Joe Allen's cold open? A built in personal assistant could be implanted right into your brain. Instead of typing up your shopping lists or social media posts on a keyboard, you could have a brain computer interface that automatically types your words when you simply think about them. No stranger to this group here is the development of closely deep brain stimulation devices. And this is an active part of the brain portfolio. Clearly, they're important for developing therapies to help cure people of diseases, but there are other uses that I can imagine. Malign uses as well as other uses, for example, enhancements we're gaining and so forth. One of the things the Neuralinks allow Pager to do is to play his favorite video game, Pong. The reason Neuralink works is because it's recording and decoding electrical signals from the brain. We take out a sort of a small section of scale about the size of a quarter, replace that with what in many ways really is very much like if it put Apple Watch or some kind of smartwatch thing. Can you imagine that in 10 years when we are sitting here, we have an implant in our brains and I can immediately feel because you all will have implants, I can and we measure your brain waves and I can immediately tell you how the people react or I can feel, how the people react. Our team became the first in the world to receive a green light from the FDA to conduct clinical trials of a permanently implanted BCI. What is this going to mean for humanity? What's really got me thinking is the future of communication. Take emotion. Have you ever considered how hard it is to express how you feel? You have to self reflect, package the emotion into words and then use the muscles of your mouth to speak those words but you really just want someone to know how you feel. So what if rather than using your words, you could throw your emotion and have them really feel how you feel? At that moment we would have realised that the necessary use of words to express our current state of being was always going to fall short. The full potential of the brain would then be unlocked. The global health crises are being used as an excuse for greater authoritarianism because today it's immunity therapies but in 10 or 15 years it might be people who reject some kind of brain computer interface. Okay, I want to go to Joe Allen. Brandon is going to follow on from the Christian post. Joe, this is very disturbing. Walk us through what's going to happen and I know everybody, all the fanboys on the right with Tesla and Elon Musk and Twitter and all that but we're having developments every day. This is extraordinarily dangerous, sir. Yes, Steve, you know we've been covering this for about three weeks with the federal government funding, brain research and genetic engineering. I've got a piece up at the Federalist right now. It's entitled Federal Research into Brain Manipulation and DNA Rewriting Should Terrify Us All. This is an incredible development because what we have is the federal government basically laying the foundation to allow every sort of transhumanist objective to take place in regards to the brain and DNA rewriting. So you had last week the announcement that the NIH is putting up 600 million for a total ultimately of 5 billion for the brain 2.0 project to map the human brain all 86 billion neurons and the trillions of connections. He's been compared to the Human Genome Project in scope and scale and the purpose is to map the entire human brain for medical purposes obviously but when you listen to the director of the brain initiative, John Guy, he has a peculiar obsession with brain computer interfaces. When asked by stat news what the sort of concrete applications might be, he pointed to a brain computer interface that was implanted last year at the University of California San Francisco. He also pointed to a Baylor University study where brain implants are used to alter mood and behavior such as chronic depression and OCD. And then you have the involvement of DARPA, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is partnered very closely with the brain initiative and everyone knows that DARPA is obsessed with creating cyborg super soldiers and that that project includes non-invasive but also invasive brain computer interfaces. So what I'm saying here is that you have federal funding going towards medical programs that are directly linked to transhumanist brain computer interface sort of projects and that's not to mention all that we've covered on the DNA rewriting coming out of ARPA-H and of course it's new inaugural director Renee Waggers. Okay, just to set the stage, this is all kind of coming out of this executive order. This is another line of worker there which is quite dangerous and hasn't really had hearings or had discussions or people talk to not just the morality of it of where this is going. And I wonder if anybody understands, they are obsessed with the brain computer interface. That is basically the merger, they keep talking about the merger of man and machine and this is an obsession with them and these experiments are going to be going on and it's going to go on on your money, on your tax dollars and nobody is actually having hearings, investigations, debates of exactly what we're doing. I want you to stay there Joe because I want to start bringing us some other guests and I want to come back to this because this is so deep and so worrisome about what we're doing here and I told you in 2024 this is going to be a major political issue. It's not a political issue right now but the war room is going to make it a political issue because it has to be. I want to go to the Christian post and Brandon Showalter, Brandon, another aspect that has not really gotten the hearing it needs and the focus it needs is your work at the Christian post on this transgender ideology, the experimentation that's going on, the operations from some of the most important institutions in this country medical. And that's the point I want to make with Joe Allen. You're talking about the elite of the elite, DARPA, ARPA age, the top universities, the top institutions, the biggest money, the best professors, the best surgeons, all of it. Walk us through your latest discoveries in reporting and investigation about this entire situation, sir. Well, what's really interesting Steve is that the media now is pivoting from their line just from a few weeks ago when I was on your show, I mentioned how the corporate press, the legacy press are totally running interference for all of these prominent institutions where when journalists like me and a few others have been holding up the mirror to these medical facilities like the Boston Children's Hospital, Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago, a number of children's hospitals nationwide where the data, if you actually look at the receipts at the journal articles, they themselves said that minors are having their breasts cut off, for example, they're having their genitals mutilated. If you actually look at the literature, the peer reviewed articles, it is indisputable that these disfiguring surgeries, these gender surgeries, I don't really like to call them because it's such butchery. This is the on ramp to transhumanism. First you dissociate young people, young children from their bodies, and then from that foundation you can introduce all manner of chaos. The latest I just had to shake my head because earlier this week, JAMA pediatrics, JAMA, which is the Journal of American Medical Association put out a study that they flat out admit that there's actually, I'm reading it right now, where the inclusion criteria for this surgery where they said top surgery, which is amputation of the breasts of teenage girls, inclusion criteria for treatment of patients were 13 to 24 years of age at the time of surgery, trans masculine or non-binary gender identity, DFAB, which means designated female at birth and English speaking. Okay, so the media has pivoted. C.A.B.S. ran with this narrative that this dramatically improves, this new study from JAMA pediatrics dramatically improves the quality of life of these transgender young people. They are totally pivoting from denying that it's happening when we expose it with the receipts from now saying, the gene users like it, and it's good for them. This is improving their health. So just notice how they're gaslighting you because they've moved on from the narrative that no, this isn't happening to actually, yes, it is. Okay, hang on, hang on. This is kind of what Joe has been doing with the transhuman aside. First they deny and lie about it. Then when they know that you've got the receipts and you have the peer reviewed journals, I want to go to what they, because I, you sent me some of these articles, I sent you some. Then they say the headline is, it's helpful to these individuals. When you get down to about the fifth paragraph, there's these very soft focus groups or some really soft things about their mental health and suicide rates. The actual act of mutilating them is a fact. The things that says that make some better and things is very soft and they really never come out. You don't see the studies, you don't see the cross tabs. It's very squishy. But the headline says they're better. And so for mental hygiene and mental health, clearly Brandon show water is a bully and he's mean and the people, the Christian posts, the publishers are mean and everybody that does this are hurting these kids and these heroic doctors who are now under bombs, you know, the bomb, you know, people are calling in bombs like that. They're the heroes in this war to help these kids. Is that basically the summary of where we stand right now? Oh yes, these studies that they put out are complete junk. The one that we were just referring to here where you're talking about this soft language. The only example that I think 30 some people who got their breast, now one is too many in my estimation. You should never cut the breasts, physically healthy breasts off anybody, especially not a minor. But this is just, I think there were 34 or 36 maybe they got their breasts cut off. And yes, what they call it is mental health outcomes, you know, whatever that even is. It's only for three months after they were interviewed only three months after the surgery. Steve, I've interviewed D transitioners. These are individuals who have undergone these experimental procedures and heart amounts and surgeries. It takes much longer than three months before the regret starts to set in. And usually in some states, I think California for sure, and I'm pretty sure other states, they only have one year statute of limitations where if you're not happy with it or you regret it and you want to file some sort of a malpractice lawsuit against the doctor that did this to you, you're out a lot because it's only a year. But the way these studies work and put those studies in air quotes is there's just a very short time they craft the narrative to their liking, the media runs with it, and then the public thinks unless they're really just keen and tuned into what's going on, that this is actually the standard of care. This is health care. This is health for these kids. We're going to make sure people understand this. They can make their own decisions, but they have to get the facts. The last thing for I'll let you go, Brandon, you said that this gender ideology or gender affirming surgery, whatever you call it, this is the on-ramp to transhumanism. Explain that to the audience, please. Well, I think it's philosophically speaking. If you can be dissociated from your sex body, you can be dissociated from everything. This is what the gender identity industry does is dissociate us. And so if you can deny your sex, you open yourself up to all manner of experimentation. Martine Rothblatt is the leader, I believe, of terrorism, which is a transhumanist cult. And they fall on say. He gives lectures where he talks about tech transgenders and tech transhumanists. If you desecrate the body in this way, it is not very much of a leap to then start to program it with all sorts of other technology because if you can deny sex, which is one of the most fundamental aspects of our being, that's just where that's it. You've broken the boundary. That's just it. Brandon, how do people get to you on Christian Post and follow your investigative reporting, sir? You can follow my byline at the Christian Post. I do have a film review recently of a film called the D-Transition Diaries, Saving Our Sisters, which is about D-Transitioners by the Center for Bioethics and Culture. I recommend it. I recommend everybody go see it. And I also can be on Twitter at BrandonMShow. Brandon, thank you very much for joining us. Thanks, Dan. Joe, hang on. Joe Allen, hang on. I want to bring in Terry Shilling. Terry, before I get to the report of the Republicans, I don't know, a thousand students across Virginia that come off of Virginia, walked out of school the other day about this very thing, about Governor Youngkins. Really not that tough of policy about this. How big a deal is this becoming now in American education? We're going to have some school board members on in the second half hour. How big a deal is this game to be, sir? Well, just to put it bluntly, Steve, transgender ideology is essentially in every public school across the country. And that's by design. That's from federal government policies, all of Joe Biden's executive orders where he directs every federal agency to interpret sex under civil rights law to be inclusive of gender identity protections. That includes a department of education and everything else that falls underneath it. And so what's happening now is these public schools are afraid of losing federal money. That's at least the excuse they give. And so they are changing these policies every single day. And what that translates to is kids across Virginia stepping out of school, inciting with the transgender movement over their own parents, right? That's at the heart of this fight too, is dividing the household, right? What the state is essentially doing is it's legalizing state sanctioned kidnapping. So they're grooming your kids, they're transing them. Then when the parents disagree with that, they kidnap them and remove them from the parents' home. It's absolutely criminal, but this has been institutionalized. Why has the left chosen this as kind of the hill they're going to die on in the metaphor? Why they made this a centerpiece of so much of what they're doing? I think that's why we're going to some school where I think that's why people that don't follow this at close to saying, why would they do this? When you see show orders, pieces are so radical. Why have they chosen this, Terry? Well, at the heart of the Democratic Party is the progressive ideology. And the heart of that is the belief that any barriers, any rules, any structures or institutions that keep you from really choosing to do whatever you want to do, including mediate your own body, including having your kids consent to sex and consent to sex changes. Anything like that is going to inhibit human flourishing. And it's going to lead to all the bad things in this world. And so they're removing it. And the transgender fight is central to that. If you think about what they're doing and what they're institutionalizing in our country, it's sex changes for minors. Like, if you can make Americans accept that and have it be bolstered and supported by our legal system, to where anyone that opposes that, what can't you do? Right? If you can force the American people, if you can force parents to sexually transition their children against their wishes, what can't you get away with? I'm having a hard time thinking because once a kid can consent to a sex change, how much longer before we allow them to consent to sex with adults? It's not that far removed and it's not that crazy. In fact, they're already making these arguments in Spain about allowing children, liberating children sexually so that they can be free to have sex with adults. Terry, hang on for one second. The Republican study group led by Jim Banks, they've got a solution for this, maybe around the American family. Short commercial break room returned to the war room in just a moment.

By the way, we're going to do a deep dive on the Chinese Communist Party with Dr. Bradley Thayer and the Gray Jason Jones on Cardinal Zen's trial, what the CCP is doing right now, how the American taxpayer and pension near our funding, their military operation. We're going to do that tomorrow because I've got to spend more time on the topics we have before us. Okay, Terry, with all this going on, we're going to have two really brave women come on right after you about school boards and about them trying to talk to people about parental rights and all the blowback people are getting and all the scare tactics in all of this madness. And this is why November 8 is so important. Jim Banks and the Republican study group have put forward a really a plan for the American family. So walk us through it. I want to make sure we put the article up that everybody can get it and read it. But walk us through your assessment of where the Republicans are right now, sir. Well, Frank, Frankly, Steve, this signifies that the Republican Party is a completely different party than where it was in just 2016. And what I mean by that is during 2016, the Republicans were running from even simple bills like bathroom bills that kept men out of women's private spaces, their locker rooms and their showers. What the Republican study committee did led by Jim Banks is they released an 80-point plan to protect parental rights, protect the family and protect our children. And it has everything included, including Marjor Taylor Greene's sex change ban and sex chain procedure, you know, hormone treatments and everything for minors. It's got parental rights protections. It gets rid of transgender ideology in schools and eliminates funding for critical race theory all throughout the federal government, including our schools. It's tough to pick out my favorite part, but it's just such a good sign that the Republican Party is no longer afraid of engaging and getting involved in these controversial issues. And really ultimately, Steve, it's because they know that these are winning issues. They know that opposing the progressive regime and the woke ideology on all this stuff, they know that that's what voters want. And they know that there's groups like APP out there that have the campaign and financial resources to now back them up in their campaigns and elections. So we've really started to build something incredible here. And this is the revenge of the parents, right? It's a tea party way for families. And you know, but this proposal is very strong. I fully endorsed it. I think Jim Banks is doing a great job over at RSC. And I just want to say, I know one of your next guests is Nicole Solas. And she's, you really know how to pick out these guests, Steve, because she's a real fighter. She's fearless. You got to address this at you can't just address at the top, like what APP is doing, you have to address at the bottom as well. A lot of this stuff is happening from federal grant agreements. But if you don't take over the local level, you're going to have all these woke activists at the school board level just directing this stuff anyway for free. I said this in April of 2021, this is village by village. The school board is what picks the lock and the moms are America or the forefront, the vanguard of this. I'm going to go into more people say, well, hey, what are they going to do if they win? Here is something that directionally is very powerful. It's an 80 point plan and it incorporates everything. Is it perfect? No, but man, is it directionally close to perfect? It is. And here's the politics of it. If you put that plan out and have an up or down vote for the nation of would you want this or you want the Democrats, we win 90% of the people, 90%. If you want to get 65% of the Hispanic vote, if you want to get over 50% of the African-American vote and 65% to 75% of the Asian vote, let's vote on this. This is and I got to thank banks and these guys have put this together. The men and women put together. It's incredibly powerful and it shows you direction. Now we need one in economics and border security, all of it. But you're seeing in fact, banks is leading one in the CCP and they're all not perfect to begin with, but your point is this is a process. You look at where we were in 16 and you compare it to today. Six years later, it's a dramatic and we're about to take charge of the House of Representatives and the fights are going to be over this on appropriations and funding and you wait to hear the hearings and the investigations that go through all of it. Terry, how do people get to APP and particularly I know they're going to want to find out more about your analysis of this 80-point plan around the American family because you've built APP around the American family? Two places, go to americanprinciblesproject.org. That's where we've got all of our legislative analysis, including on this parent rights package. We've sent out a few statements on it. But also follow me on Twitter, get her true social, all Instagram, all that. It's just shilling 1776. Terry, thanks for coming on tonight. I really appreciate it. And you're right, our next two guests are both killers. Let's start with Laura Blackwell. I'll get to Nicole in a second. Laura, your vice chair of what the school board down in Cabaras County in North Carolina, I think it's outside of Raleigh or Charlotte. Tell us, walk us through. We know you know Sloan. What's the fight that you've got down there in the Tar Heel State? Well, Steve, thanks so much for having me on your show first. I appreciate it. Yeah, this whole thing is blown out quite a bit that I honestly didn't expect once. I was made aware of a book that was at the CMS school district and a local parent brought this book to my attention. So being on a school board, obviously, if you're bringing material to me that I think is inappropriate for our children to read, or at least I think a parent should know the material that's in it, I'm going to do something about it. And so at one of the school board meetings, we, well, I read the book out loud. The school board meeting, rather than waiting for a parent to come and read it to us, which I've seen multiple times at multiple school board meetings, just wanted to kind of take the initiative myself and say, this is a book that's in our school system. And this is what the material is. I think parents, when we talk about some of the books that are in our, in the system, okay, but hang out, hang out, hang out for a second. There's 50,000 books. Is this pornography? What was the book? What's the title? And what was the big deal? Is it pornography? Not pornography? I mean, there's a hundred thousand books. We reading Grimm's fairy tales of what were you reading? The book is called Looking for Alaska by John Green. This book has been in production, I believe, since 2005. And the scene out of the book that I read was an oral sex scene that was in the book. And it was appalling to me to know that this material was in a book that children had access to in the schools. And so for us to bring it to the appearance attention. Okay, but hang on, hang on, hang on a second, hang on a second, slow down. Why would a librarian put pornography in, or by a book that had pornography and graphic pornography, at least literary pornography? Why? Who made that decision? Is that the librarian? Is that in conjunction with the school board? Is that teachers? How does a book like that get selected to even be put into a library? Ma'am. So what I think is based on the information that I have learned through this process, is that media specialists have avenues of which they look for material for the schools. However, the material, it doesn't have a rating system with it. So basically what they rely on is whether the book has gotten great reviews or whether it's one certain awards. And vetting the material as far as being able to read the book in its entirety is not something at this point that the media specialists that I've spoken to do. They kind of rely on just the reviews and they rely on the awards that the book has won. Was this book well reviewed and had this book won awards? This book has been well reviewed and won many awards. And one of the things that I have been told is because I don't have a master's degree in education that I don't have the relevance to be able to speak on any of this material in the school system. Hang on, Ho Ho, stop. This had, by the way, was this, we said oral sex, was this heterosexual or homosexual? This was heterosexual sex. Yes. It was basically described. Why? It basically described. What, why do you need a master's in education to know if something's pornography can be available for children, right? School children. Why did they say you needed a master's in education? Well, I definitely think that that is a narrative that people like to use. That I have a sense of discernment from what I believe that children should be exposed to and being on a school board, I have to be the adult in the room. I have to be somebody that can stand up and say this material is not appropriate for our children. And that's basically what I chose to do is to speak out. Did your fellow members of the school board vote unanimously to pull that book from the library? So what we have right now is something called a literature and supplemental material committee, which I have been appointed as the chair. And we are, our job is to come up with processes and policies. Our, a school board is run on processes and policies. And so creating a process and policy that will help moving forward, parents be able to know what type of material their children have access to. We have a process in place now where parents, if they object to materials, there is a form that they'll be able to fill out and be able to send that into the school system. And now we also have a vetting process that we have been discussing that will be reviewed by several companies and eventually make its way up to the. Is this, is this happening in real time? Is this book been pulled in the interim until you work out your processes and procedures? Is this book, in other words, if somebody in the fifth grade can't go into the library and check it out today? Correct. This book is not available for anyone to check out. This is on the high school level. But I definitely think that people need to realize that when you're talking on the high school level, you're talking about 13 and 14 year old children. Not everybody. Are you, the media is going to smear you as a book burner and a book banner. Are you a book burner or a book banner ma'am? No, sir. I am not. And that is exactly what this committee has been affectionately. Tidal is the book burning committee that is not what we are set up to do. We are set up to make sure that there is a process and policy that is in place. So that this can be followed no matter who is on the board of education. This will be a policy that will be followed throughout the school system. And it doesn't, it doesn't matter Republican. It doesn't matter Democrat. It just matters having, you know, the common sense and discernment of knowing what is appropriate for a child to be reading and sexually explicit material in my opinion. Not a perfect law. Laura Blackwell. Laura Blackwell. Are you going to back down on this at all? No matter how hard they come after you ma'am. No, sir. I will not back down. I have been attacked on many levels called a fascist, called a Nazi. You know, to me being a mother, you can come at me with whatever names that you want to, but my ultimate goal is to protect my children and to protect the children of this county. And that's what I'm going to continue to do. Laura, how do people follow all this on your social media or website? Where do people go? Well, you can follow me at my Facebook page. Laura Blackwell for a Comeris County School Board. And also have email at lwblackwell78.com. I imagine there's some nice comments on your Facebook. I mean, I know you have a lot of support, but the left is for the audience. This is going around in every school district in this nation. I hope everybody understands this. This is a fight. Laura is emblematic of the fight of moms and citizens of this country to defend school children. It's going everywhere. And it's going to only get nastier. And part of this is by these radical librarians. Laura, thank you very much. I'm honored to have you here in War Room. Look forward to having you back. Thank you, Steve. I appreciate you having me. Yes, ma'am. Great fight. Okay. I want to go to Nicole Solis. Nicole describe, you know, I was honored to go to officer Canada School in Rhode Island. I absolutely love the state. It's just fantastic. It's beautiful. The people are fantastic and great. But there's a disturbing story came out of Rhode Island the other day about a lecture or talk you were trying to give. Can you describe what happened, ma'am? Because it looked like it was kind of dangerous. Yes. I was holding an educational event to inform parents about how schools in Rhode Island are teaching gender ideology and keeping secrets from parents if their child has an identity crisis and things they are the opposite. Which is, of course, a life-threatening situation that parents should know about. I advertised this event, which was a private event event. If I invited you, you could come if you RSVP'd and there was space you could come. And I received a phone call from police a few days before this event went on that they had in-tailed that there were people coming that could be violent. They've been arrested before. And the police told me that I could not hold this event unless I hired five police officers to protect me and to protect my attendees. During this time, I became the target of an onslaught of harassment and bullying on social media by not only radical progressive trans activists, but by legislators in Rhode Island senators, college professors, journalists. These people went on to Twitter, smeared me as a bigot. They said that I would hate all and they were all coordinating to come to my event to sabotage it. They also coordinated the harassment of the Cranston Public Library and made public calls for everyone to harass the library and demand that the library shut down my event. Even the ACLU of Rhode Island came out with a statement that defended my free speech, that also condemned my speech and said that it was the thought that we hate and that I intended to present discriminatory views and they painted me like I was the Westboro Baptist Church. And here I am just a stay-at-home mom that wanted to inform other parents about factual things happening in Rhode Island schools. I wanted to inform parents about the indoctrination of children into gender ideology into school and how that leads to the not the level of grotesque Dr. Frankenstein medical experimentation of children, which is what my featured speaker Chris Elston, who is on Twitter as Billboard Chris, then talked about. And our presentation contained only facts. We had slides backing up everything we were saying. But before we could even say it, I had all of these progressive radical activists trying to sabotage me, smear me and bully me and try to intimidate me from simply giving this educational presentation a necessary conversation about the health and safety of children in Rhode Island and all of America. So it was probably the most intense experience I've ever had in my life. I had police following me like Secret Service. I had to hide my car. I had to get a police escort back and forth from my car. I had to stay inside the library for my own safety. The library had to shut down because they didn't want people sneaking in through other entrances like possibly to harm us. I mean, it was just amazing because they're painting us as the bad guys, but the library and the police were doing everything they could to protect us from potential bad guys. And I had people RSVPing to my personal email to come to this event pretending like they were coming. And then I would look them up online and find that they were these people that had been arrested at other protests. They were violent. So I had intel that I was then forwarding to police myself. And I still am not sure about the exact intel that police had, but again, I couldn't have my event without spending over $1,000 on protection, on police protection. Nicole, I got to have you back on the morning show. What is your social media? We'll reach out to you after this show because it's such a profound story. How do people get to you and how do people find out more? We got the article up and we'll push it everywhere. How do people find out more about you and your fight, ma'am? I'm on Facebook. Nicole Letton, Nicole. It should have Nicole Solis in parentheses. And I'm on Gutter as Nicole Solis. And I see OLE, S-O-L-A-S. I just put the Gutter profile up so it's not active yet, but please follow me and I'm going to start using it more. And also, I went into kind of a network. Thank you. No, it's fantastic. And you're an incredibly brave individual as all the women, part of the group are. Nicole, we'll talk to you after the show about having you back on. Thank you. It's unbelievable. I want to get Mike Davis. You had a couple of big wins today. We only got about 90 seconds, but I want you to tell what the posse was able to do in securing at least these small wins. What happens, sir? Yeah, so three important big tech antitrust reforms got passed in the House over the strong objection of the Google funded House Republican leaders. And we need to give a lot of credit to Congressman Ken Bock, a conservative all-star from Colorado for getting 39 Republicans to join forces to bring these much needed reforms. This is an important first step to bring accountability to big tech. And I think we're going to build on this momentum to get more done. And so Congressman Ken Bock deserves a lot of praise, a lot with my former boss, Senator Chuck Grassley from Iowa, Senator Tom Cotton, Senator Mike Lee. They delivered three important wins today. It's a signpost along the way. Where do people go to fund it more about you? We're going to have you back on to have a discussion of where another at least 100 Republicans were, but that's a topic for tomorrow. Where do they go tonight to get to you? Mike Davis. Yeah, it's article three project dot dot dot dot org article three project dot org. And it's at article three project at article number three project on getter to it or truth. And my personal is M R D DMI and thank you again, Steve, and to the war room posse that you guys really made this happen. Well, it was you. You're the tip of the spear. We're just here in support function. I got to tell you, and the posse is very proud of you. This is a tough I B C. All the madness we saw earlier in the show. The way you take care of it, victory begets victory. And this is what David's fighting for. We got to get control of these tech oligarchs and understand it's a philosophical difference. We got to get into it. Be back here at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. We're going to be on fire. See you then in the war room."
