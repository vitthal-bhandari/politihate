Thank you for being here with us. We wanted to tell you some exciting news before we dive into our next topic which will be a little bit of commentary from the view we want to get into. Coming up here and also RFK Jr. and I agree on something else. Very happy to hear him say it. And that's come up in a moment. First up though starting Monday the 10th of July. We are going to be Clay and Buck. This show we're going to be on the airwaves in our nation's capital. That's right. We're going to be carried in DC on Freedom 104.7. We are so excited to expand our radio affiliate family to Freedom 104.7 in Washington DC. But for anybody who works on Capitol Hill or the federal government commutes in and out of DC proper, we're going to be able to keep you, well certainly, company during your lunchtime and thereafter every day. So definitely tune in and check us out there. We're really excited about that. So Clay and I have lived in. We've both been DC residents. Yeah, it's a big market, big addition. So if you are in Northern Virginia, if you are in Southern Maryland, Buck, you know, because you live there one of the worst traffic cities in America. And for anybody who has to commute, I know you probably if you're in the DC area have been listening to us. If you're listening to us now, you've been on the iHeartRadio app, which we love, or you've been downloading the podcast. But it is a big deal to be on in DC market from 12 to 3 FM 104.7 Freedom radio there. It's going to be awesome. So go ahead and add us to the dials if you are in that marketplace. And we got a lot of new market additions that we're going to be rolling out in the days and weeks and months ahead. We talked about, I think Monday of this week, Green Bay, Wisconsin and in South Dakota. Was it Piers South Dakota? I think it was that we had added and certainly a bunch more coming. That's a credit to you guys, the growth of the show as we now embark on just third year. Added Sioux Falls. Is that what we're talking about? Sioux Falls, my bad. I hope we're on in Piers South Dakota. It's where my grandfather was allegedly born. I've never, this is like family lore. You know, it's tough to sometimes track this stuff down for sure. But we believe he was born in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. I got to be careful here because this is where I always, I've had an ongoing inability to distinguish between North and South Dakota. And I know right now in the Dakotas, people are losing their minds. But yes, Piers South Dakota. Do you know, I always had pronounced it Pier. Did you know that book? It's pronounced Pier. Well, why not just say yes? Because, you know, I'm on the spot here. No, I did not know that. I had South Dakota furious because I was like, when I was doing sports talker radio, we added an affiliate. And what I thought was Pier South Dakota. I was talking about how excited I was to add it. And the good people of Piers South Dakota let me know. I had no idea. I memorized state capitals back in the day. I've been saying it wrong. I'm just moving regionally. You know, for out in Long Island, there are some stops on the LIRR, some towns that I've spent time in in the past. And, you know, you can read it and you'll say, Oh, wrong konkama. But actually, it's wrong konkama. That's how you got to say it. Or patch on, you know. So it's, it's a local. There's local flavor to some of these things. One that I know is absolutely the case. The variations and we're, we're number one in this city. I should make sure that I get it as right as I can. The variations on the town that I grew up in New York hearing up as Louisville is fascinating. There's a lot of a lot of different ways. There's, you know, Louisville and, you know, I can't even do the ball. There's a lot of different stuff. I'm a, yeah, I'm a Louisville person is the way that I always pronounce it. Obviously, Southern accents factor in. You're talking about the great state of Kentucky right now. One of my favorites is when it's a city that is named after. A city. So there is outside of Lexington, Kentucky, where we're also on a great town called Versailles. Contucki. If you're sitting out there, you're like, Oh, I wonder how that spelled. It's named after the French palace Versailles. But if you pronounce Versailles, Kentucky, you will be absolutely ridiculed to the height of, and now I have no idea what you're talking about. It's Versailles, Kentucky, Versailles is the palace, even though it was named after the palace Versailles. No, Tridam is the cathedral Notre Dame. That's right. That's a good one. Big 10. Is that right? Big 10. No. No. Damn it. I actually thought I had that one. That's a, to be fair to you, that's a tough one on sports because Notre Dame should be in the Big 10. They're independent. They're not a member of any company. Oh, that's a trick. That's a, that's I agree. That's what I'm saying. It's a, it's kind of like going out to South Bend this fall. So I'm putting in my South Bend. It's a little bit of a buck like what I always thought was really unfair when you took a test back in the day. And one of the answer choices was none of the above. You're like, and you know how much confidence you have to be to have in the answer to go none of the above. I always felt like that was an unfair teaching move to really kind of taught you to go with the none of the above as the multiple choice answer question. Absolutely. Oh, I'd mentioned the view and, and we were talking with Heather McDonald a few moments ago last hour about affirmative action and where it stands now. I thought this was very illuminating soundbite from the view where they do very astute constitutional and legal analysis on a daily basis. And Joey Behar could practically sit on the Supreme Court herself. But here we go. Here is the sense you get from Sonny Hostin of the view about affirmative action. The lived experience of a white kid in Appalachia or perhaps on a potato farm in Idaho or Brooklyn is different in this country for a black student. Whether that black student be wealthy or not because this country was founded on slavery. Ah, now this is very interesting because you've been hearing this adversity scores. Let's talk about adversity scores. Once you start to dig into the real numbers and look at what's really going on, what you find is that a lot of these schools. You know, there's been all this talk about legacies. There have been multiple generations now of affirmative action school attendees at the most elite schools. Their children get legacy to obviously, right? And the benefit of affirmative action on top of legacy admission. So if you attack legacy admissions, it's not as clear as some people want to think it is that it's just going to go after like the upper class or upper middle class white and Asian students. But even beyond that, so we are to believe that to be wealthy and black in America is still a this is what she is saying. She's arguing that that is still such a disadvantage so that a wealthy black student applicant to Harvard should get to go. You know, say if the, you know, father or mother works in the media or makes millions and millions of dollars should get to go to Harvard over a kid who is not going to go. A kid who grew up in a single parent household who has been trying to help raises three or four siblings who is white from a low income household. That is the belief of the elites as you just heard from Sonny Hostin. Yeah, and this is where I think all of you out there would agree. If I gave you an option, okay, this is a binary choice. You can either be the son or daughter of a white family growing up in Appalachia, right? Kentucky, West Virginia, Tennessee, an area where there is not a lot of opportunity and your parents make a combined income of $30,000 a year. Okay, you have that option, but you can be white or you can be the son or daughter of multi millionaire black parents. Is there anyone who's saying from a pure advantage perspective, being a white poor kid cancels out being a black rich kid? I don't think there's anybody out there in America who is being honest buck that would say, yes, being white is worth me being not a multi millionaire. That's the test, right? That's what Sonny's really arguing. And if she were on here and if she actually had to answer honest questions because that's the challenge that we have in media today, people like Sonny Hostin get to talk to an audience of stupid people and say things that are profoundly dishonest, that they wouldn't even be able to make the case for it. Like you or I, if we went on the view, would say the exact same thing that we say on this show, and people could agree or disagree with it and they could quiz us on it and we would defend our position. Sonny Hostin won't come on this show. And if she did, if I just asked her that question, so wait, you're telling me that a poor white kid in West Virginia whose parents make a combined $30,000 a year is more advantaged than your kids are who are now the son and daughter of multi millionaires. I think we can even be more blatant. The poor kid in, let's say, Harlan County, Kentucky, which is one of the per capita poorest counties in the entire United States and overwhelmingly white, a poor kid from Harlan County, Kentucky, his white privilege is so magical. I mean, so powerful, powerful, so profound that it is more advantageous for him in life in America than let's say a black, you know, young man who's black, who grows up in New York City and has an investment banker father and, you know, a school president mother or something. And you know, with a combined household income of, you know, $2 million a year. Yeah, that Harvard should take the latter candidate over the former because his white privilege is that powerful. That is delusional. And I'll give you an example from my own life book. You mentioned Harlan County, Kentucky, all of the Travis family. I'm not even sure if we're on here. If we are blowing me up and let me know on Twitter. All of the Travis families from Muhlenburg County, Kentucky. That is southern Kentucky still not a super wealthy community to this day. My grandfather, who I was named after had an eighth grade education, dropped out of school, went to work in the mines in this area of Kentucky where there's lots of white people decided that he didn't want to work the rest of his life in the mines because his father died of black lung disease and came down to Nashville and spent the rest of his life working in the DuPont factory in Old Hickory, Tennessee. I don't think that he had a massive amount of white privilege. That's not even speaking today, Buck. That's speaking 100 years ago. He was born in 1905. He, his dad died of black lung disease. He tried to avoid dying of black lung disease and worked in a factory his whole life. I'm not pretty confident that there wasn't a great deal of white privilege in Muhlenburg County, Kentucky for his entire life. That's a hundred years ago. Not even today. You think about the way these schools also have been doing admissions up to this point. They will, for all intents and purposes, treat the, you know, and there are, I went to school with some of these kids when we were kids were younger. So I know I've seen this, a multimillionaire black student from Africa, you know, the son of a senior official for a Nigerian oil, you know, oil company, for example, or the son of a, you know, someone who owns like some of the biggest malls in Kenya or, you know, some of these. That student who arrives at Harvard is treated as a student that goes in the diversity category of look at how diverse we are because we have a black student. Now you could say, okay, that is the racial diversity you're talking about. What is the adversity there? If we're now going to do adversity score, someone explained that to me. And beyond that, Buck, beyond the adversity score, also the point of affirmative action is to deal with a legacy of slavery. No, but it applies as you know that you never were a slave in the, you know, you have no ancestors who were slaves in the United States. In fact, you might have actually been a part of the African slave trade in that your ancestors might have sold slaves to America because everybody doesn't even want to talk about the fact that the first time people were captives and became slaves was actually from one African tribe to another. They were selling their enemies into slavery in the United States, pocketing the money. There's no legacy of slavery for someone who has arrived from Nigeria or from Kenya and is now profiting off of affirmative action. It is a the admissions and also it's true in hiring. It is a racial spoil system. And now we're also seeing increasingly. It is a, you know, victimized category spoil system as in if you are transgender or non binary or cisgender or whatever. That's also taken into account here. There is a Latino advantage in admission based on what? Based on lack of representation, they would say, well, you'd say, hold on a second. That's a quota. And we've all agreed from the very beginning of this going all the way back to the Supreme Court case, Becky, that quotas are wrong. Well, you know what we've just had all along here, everyone. This is what we've seen. You've had decades of stealth quotas of these institutions having quotas in place and just lying about it. That's all it is saying that they were dealing with racism by committing more racism. That's all it is. That's what they've done. Yes. And, you know, now we'll see if because the whole adversity score thing I find fascinating clay. If you've overcome the adversity in terms of getting into Harvard, you know, your your your applications before the admissions committee, this person because of their overcoming of adversity, we should bring them in. Did they overcome if they overcame the adversity? Why do they need a leg up on everybody else on the other, you know, 80,000 students were applying? You know, overcome adversity and why? Okay, you say, the first in their family to go to college or something. You sit there and say, all right. Not I don't want to say NC stating and but we all know, you know, what about an excellent state school? Oh, that's not that's not good enough for a student whose grades reflect.

I remember this when I was in high school. I was like, because I saw I saw kids who were first generation, particularly was the first generation Asian immigrants, parents speaking, no English, and they were just doing phenomenally well in class and getting a lot of SATs and they were looking at schools that were substantially ranked below the black and Latino students in my class whom I knew and I knew they're great. Then I even knew some of their SATs. It was unjust. It was unjust. People can say whatever they want about it. It wasn't right. All right.

She is an author and a journalist. Her new sub stack, which I'm going to subscribe to. I highly recommend you do the same, is declassified with Julie Kelly. Julie, I look forward to reading it. Thanks for being with us. Thank you so much, Buck, for mentioning my new sub stack and I look forward to having you as a subscriber. Thanks a lot. So tell me about the focus on criminal justice from the powers that be in Washington, D.C. I mentioned the just gut wrenching story of this interpreter and there's people can see the photos and this guy was outside the watch. Outside the wire with US military for over a decade and then was brought to America as was the promise made to people who did that. And he's killed by a group of teenagers in the video and then you've got that happening, but also the prosecution is very, very strict on anybody involved in January 6. They need to be locked up forever. Exactly. So the main prosecutor in Washington, D.C. is a man named Matthew Graves. He was a Biden campaign advisor and then appointed to service D.C. with attorney by Joe Biden in the fall of 2021. Now Matthew Graves is in the unusual position of prosecuting both federal and local crimes in Washington, D.C. However, to your point, his fixation on the four hour disturbance now two and a half years ago as he continues to round up capital site seers. Most of the new charges have nothing to do with the Salty police or vandalizing the building. This is back to obstruction and civil disorder, trespassing charges, etc. At the same time, Matthew Graves is allowing Washington, D.C. to descend into the Wild West, violent chaos every month. Many of the crimes, including carjackings, are at all time high. They had 10 fatal shootings the first five days of July, including this Afghani interpreter, also a high school wrestling coach who is in Washington, D.C. for professional development conference, killed at eight o'clock in the morning. So in meantime, as he has close to 100% prosecution rate, D.C. 7% of the cases brought to him by D.C. police. So Matthew Graves is not just under fire and should be on this side of the aisle for his selective political prosecution of Trump supporters, but also is taking heat for the rising violent crime weight in Washington, D.C. Isn't it the case that in D.C. they were the D.C. City Council tried to pass a bill that would have made a lot of very serious crimes, even less strongly punished and less aggressively prosecuted. And then Biden basically didn't, or the Senate Democrats didn't stand in the way of the Senate, I believe it was shooting it down. Or was it the House? I can't remember now. I believe it was the Biden Biden came out under pressure, you know, to not allow the D.C. Council to minimize and basically decriminalize the violent offenses. It was the Senate, by the way, just remember, it was the Senate voted to overturn a D.C. law enacted that the Democrats say to improve police accountability. Julie, it would have done things like send people to prison for less time for carjacking, which has like tripled in the last five years in D.C. Right. So, I mean, Matthew Graves is not solely to blame, of course. This is what we're seeing in major cities across the country. And it's not only are the political leaders decriminalizing violent offenses, their police forces are bleeding officers, and that's certainly the case in Washington, D.C. There was a report out today that even by Metropolitan Police Department is moving officers from violent areas to safer areas. And this is probably to keep their officers in the ranks because they've had such attrition over the past few years, especially since 2020, like a lot of major cities. So, of course, it's this mixed message, but the bottom line is that Matthew Graves is responsible for enforcing the laws in Washington, D.C. And not trespassing laws, not parading in the Capitol, which he's charged his office is charged over 900 Americans with. But for gun crimes and carjacking, to your point, which is out of control in Washington, D.C. and of course, spilling out into the suburbs. So, he needs to be held accountable for what's happening in Washington, D.C. and his selective prosecution of January 6th. And of course, according to the IRS whistleblower, Matthew Graves, declining to consider any charges against Hunter Biden for his income tax crimes committed in 2014 and 2016 in Washington, D.C. You know, I just got this breaking news alert from CNN, Julie speaking of January 6th and the 2020 election. A disciplinary committee has officially recommended Rudy Giuliani be disbarred in Washington, D.C. for his efforts on behalf of Donald Trump. I think it's important for people to see that they're using the criminal justice system to go after people involved in January 6, but they're also using the legal system and legal circles, if you will, professionally to punish lawyers who were taking up the Trump side of things in 2020. That's right. It's what California Bar Association is also attempting to do with John Eastman, who of course prepared the memo suggesting that Mike Pence could halt the certification of the Electoral College calendar on January 6th. So they are also, there's actually a well-funded organization who are targeting any of the lawyers. Of course, we've seen them target Sidney Powell, Jenna Alice Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, any of the attorneys who were lawfully performing their job as counsel to the president and filing lawsuits to uncover election fraud in the swing states. So that's just one part of the, I mean, just this egregious and very well-funded, well-coordinated apparatus to punish anyone, whether it's Donald Trump, his attorneys or a voter of his who walked into a public building on a Wednesday afternoon, took selfies in the Rotunda and left ten minutes later. This is set, and of course this will, is not anywhere close to concluding, and Buck, as you know, we've talked about numerous times, will reach its apex when special counsel, Jack Smith, invites Donald Trump, probably some of his attorneys, possibly some White House aides, and even maybe a few Republican Congressmen for the events of January 6th. Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to ask you. So that's, I was going to say, we know you believe that they're going to, the special counsel is going to have a January 6-related charge against Donald Trump, Julie, but now you're telling me that it may be a whole, really Trump inner circle, prosecution, bonanza of sorts. I just, how does that play out? Because they're also making it harder for all these individuals to get lawyers to defend them. Yes. Well, look at, well, now, who is the so-called valet? He really struggled to find a local Florida attorney, of course, since it's being prosecuted in Southern Florida. He has an attorney's family Woodward, who's defended other January 6 defendants, but he also needed a Florida lawyer and finally got some of the other things that he's been doing. And so, he's been there and finally got someone to sign on this week. But look, Buck, it has to be more people than Donald Trump for the criminal indictment of January 6th because I believe that they will charge him with at least one conspiracy charge, which is also what they did in the class by documents case. They brought conspiracy to obstruct, and that's how they roped in this poor, well, not, not, so they're going to have to have co-conspirators, conspirators with Donald Trump for January 6th. And it very well could be people like Rudy Giuliani or John Eastman. It could be White House aides. There's been rumblings about what Mark Meadows has been up to, the Chief of Staff, if he's cooperating in some capacity or he will be charged. You had Representative Scott Perry from Pennsylvania, who the FBI snatched his cell phone right out of his hand the day after the Mar-a-Lago raid took an imprint of the data from his cell phone and now has that in the case. And there's court wrangling about access to what he had on his phone. So this could be even more major than just another criminal indictment of Donald Trump, but it could involve half a dozen up to a dozen people.

I'm going to talk about any shark attacks or any crazy stuff that's going on out there. And this is reported on by the Daily Mail. So this guy, Sean Warner, is a first-time fantasy author. He's written as debut fantasy novel. This guy was in Arlington, Texas for this video. I'm trying to find the name of the book here so I could say it. But he was sitting there and, wait, wait, do we have it? Let me see. Lee Howard and the ghosts of, wait, what is it called? Lee Howard and the ghosts of Simmons Pierce Manor. Okay, that's this guy's debut fantasy novel. I have not read it. I do not know if it is any good, but this is a nice story, I thought. So this guy is sitting there doing a book signing at a little store in Arlington, Texas, and a TikTok creator and YouTube creator, and some of these TikTok and YouTube creators have millions and millions and millions of fans. It took a video of this guy because he was doing his book signing and it was empty. There was no one there asking for his book to be signed or buying his book. So he's sitting at a table at a bookstore alone with his debut fantasy novel that no one is coming by to sign or to see. Well, apparently this TikTok star read shared this clip of Sean Warner, 58 years old, who seemed like a very nice guy, very enthusiastic about his first ever fantasy genre novel. He put it on and now it has been viewed. What was what did I see here? 15 million times, something like that. And with that 15 or 17.4 million times, actually, with that 17.4 million views, first time author Sean Warner and his Lee Howard and the ghost of Simmons Pierce Manor now has a little best seller on his hands because so many people went and bought his book because they fell for the guy, you know, he's that first time author. He's almost 60 years old. He's put his hardeners soul into this and he's sitting there alone and seemed like a nice guy. And so they bought his books. I just thought that was a very nice story. I have to say, I also think back to the days, man, I like fantasy genre novels generally. I feel like I don't have the time to read them because I'm reading so many other things these days. I'm working on a book, you know, Clay's got a book coming out next month. I'll have a book that will be coming out next summer. But I'm hard at work on that book all the time. And a lot of it is reading about 25, 20, 25 other books in research for the book that I'm writing. I'm spending a lot of time writing it too. So that means that I don't get to dive into things. But man, I think if you can't, I think fantasy is important. I think that fiction, fantasy, same, same basic thing. It's important for your mind. And I think back to some of my favorite fiction slash fantasy novels. I mean, doing is an amazing, I would say amazing literary work. And the recent movie was actually pretty good too. I know the second part of it's coming out soon. Clearly the Lord of the Rings is one of the most important for a lot of us and my and other generations to literary works, I think, in terms of just getting you excited about reading as a kid. But I really do think that making the time, even for those of us who feel like there's never enough time to read all the history and all the nonfiction you want to, because there's always so much more to learn. I would just say it's worth it to spend some time to get into reading some things that are just meant to let your mind wander and be a little free in terms of the creativity and the storylines. I wish, I don't know what his book is like, but I wish Mr. Sean Warner all the best of luck with his first debut novel out there. And it's a nonfiction. You have a better shot as a first time author of selling some copies. No matter who you are, whether you're in the media or just, if we call them a civilian, but you know, a person has a normal day job, you have better chance of selling nonfiction. Fiction is really hard. It is really hard. I started recently, the darkness that comes before, I think it is, which is kind of an older one. And man, it is, it is dark. So I started that one and try to think of some of the other fantasy genre. I read a, oh man, it's so good. It's like a Viking fantasy genre. I read this one pretty recently. Oh, we have a book recommendation page. So where have people should go to clayanbuck.com? Where do they go? Do they go to clayanbuck.com? Books team? Where do they go to get to the book recommendation? Every book that we're telling, you know, Carrie started reading shadow divers recently. She loves it. So if I tell you that something's really good, it means that I am shocked if anyone tries to read it and does not recognize it, at least for being really good. There's there's, I'm trying to remember the name. Oh yes, shadow of the gods by John Gwyn. I think I read this. I read it during the pandemic actually when I was locked down in New York City. Man, that was a, if you like that Viking stuff, you know, it's not historical fiction. It's fantasy Viking genre, which is getting my sounding too much like a nerd here is getting down into it. It was really well written, really good stuff. Guys, he does Viking reenactments. I mean, he's really into it. You know, it's very talented. Play and Buck.com and then go under recommendation play and Buck.com and go to rec. That's the way to do it. We've got some great stuff there. Highly highly recommended. I would like to tell them books for some people in a tournament too. We're getting a lot of people that are signing up play and Buck.com slash recommendations. There we go. We should do slash reco. Make it easier for people. So I'm throwing some out there to you. I don't know if you want to buy the strong water, but go for it. I've haven't read that. Can't recommend that one specifically, but a put a smile on the guy's face. First time author, he's selling thousands of books now. But if you're into Viking fantasy genre, Shadow of the Gods by John Gwyn, I think you'll really enjoy that one. And if you haven't read Dune, that's a good place to start with anything fantasy.
