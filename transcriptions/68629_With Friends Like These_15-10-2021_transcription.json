    "text": " Hi, I'm Autumn Marie Cox and welcome to With Friends Like These. This week I am talking to British comedy actress Daisy Hagard. Among other things, she's the creator, co-writer and star of Showtime's Back to Life, now in its second season. It has a hundred percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, where reviewers have called it near perfect, exceptional, and both extremely funny and tragically sad. Also season two improves on season one in every way. Now these reviews aren't that surprising, given that the show comes from the same producing team as Fleabag, and it somehow combines elements of almost every hit prestige series over the last few years. It's a true crime-ish seaside town mystery with trenchant social commentary and dark comedy. It is a show about Mary, a 40-year-old woman returning to her hometown in the UK after serving an 18-year prison sentence. But that's not what the show is really about. It's about forgiveness and memory, sex and getting old, and specifically, what it's like to re-enter this fast-moving world after you've paid your debt to society. What does it take to start over, and is starting over even possible? I'll discuss all that and more with actress Daisy Hagard. Daisy, welcome to the show. Thank you for having me. Right off the top, my first question is, what inspired this show? It's a really specific plot line. So a lot of things inspired this show. On a very basic level, I was living at home with my parents. So I had to, you know, in my mid-30s, staying with my mom and dad, being kind of made to feel like a teenager again, and being told how to load a dishwasher. So that was one aspect. And then another aspect of it was that I've always been really interested in how we vilify women who commit crimes, compared to how we perceive all the youth towards men. I just think there's a sort of expectation for women to be an angel or the devil. And so I've always been really fascinated by that. Not to say that people don't do terrible things, but we have an interesting attitude towards that. And so it all came out really with me thinking, what would it be like if you were women in your 30s with no job, no partner, when everyone expects you to have all those things, but then also you had done something really terrible. How hard would that make your life? And so that sort of inspired something that doesn't really sound like a comedy book kind of is. I have questions about what kind of show it is, actually. On some level, it actually matches up all of the most favorite genres from Prestige TV these days. It's kind of like a true crime mystery. It's a seaside mystery. It's a female centered comedy that has a lot of, let's say, honest sex in it. Yeah. And it has a lot of social commentary. And it is both, I say this with love, uncomfortable to watch. And yes, occasionally, hysterically funny, but you're really writing a lot of different tones there. Yeah. I mean, so it's definitely his own tone, I think. And it was never a cynical move that that's just because I believe that's what life's like. You know, I've been around the bed of somebody dying and live all something very funny is happened. And I've been in situ, you know, I believe that the reality is that you move through with the tones in life, don't you? You suddenly slip on a banana skin after breaking up with a boyfriend or, you know, like, everything can happen. And so I really love, I really, you know, was desperate to write something that just was bold and confidently all the different things, if that's what it, if that was truthful and right for the story, then that was what we would do. Is there a specific case you were thinking about when you thought about Mary's life story? No, there wasn't actually, I think I just noticed, I just noticed a few different things, whether it was, well, I suppose, you know, I suppose I saw the headline saying foxy noxy about Amanda Knox and thought, gosh, they wouldn't do that about a guy, you know, whatever, you know, regardless of the thing, it was just like, why are we saying foxy noxy? So I suppose things like that inspired the fact that the photograph in the season one of me that we chose for the newspaper photograph was a sort of posing with your teenage friends looking, trying to be sexy photo because I thought that's what the media would do in that situation. But yeah, so that was really it. And then it was also those stories you hear when you're growing up. I don't know if you had that, but I feel like there's always those stories, the sort of terrible stories that happened about somebody who's 18 or 19 and something happens, somebody gets in a car with somebody's drinking or something awful. And these people, you know, everybody, there's always somebody at your school or somebody's friend of a friend, sort of tragic stories that kind of haunt you through your life. So that's something I've always thought about because there was somebody we knew when we were young who had a terrible accident that was due to somebody else making a mistake. So those things are sort of part of you, aren't they, that you know, this day in your head, something sort of quite formative. So it was more that. And yeah, it's a big old mishmash of things. I don't know if you specifically chose 18 for Mary's age, but I've been thinking about it and it's a real specific marker in our culture, right? Like 18 is supposedly when you become an adult. Yeah, there's a big difference when we think about 17 and we think about 18. So to have her commit this crime at 18, it's this place where she's almost a child, right? Yeah. And we might offer more forgiveness to someone who just happened to be a few days younger. Yeah. And also it's the point where I think for me, where I feel like my life began, really, like I wasn't happy at school. So when I left school, I went, Oh, this is life. You know, this is, oh, this is so much easier than that school thing. So I think that was probably a significant part of that decision. Was it's just just as you're about to launch into this chapter. This thing happens and then you have to, you don't get to do that or live that. And you talked about how you were living at home and that's one of the things we're thinking about as a grown, grown person living at home, what the experiences of having to kind of renegotiate your boundaries with your parents. I'm curious if there was anything that you could bring to the other part of Mary's experience, which is this intense boundary that she has with the world at large, right? Like having to cross into society and re relate to everything. Now, I know you didn't spend 18 years in prison. But what are things that you drew from to kind of get to that? Well, I mean, beyond just sort of as a writer, having fun with some of that thinking, you know, what would be really strange now? You know, what is weird? So closing your eyes and thinking back to when you were 19 and, you know, and now everyone's just walking along the road staring at their phone. One of the things that you would be like, God, that's just not like, you know, it's completely different. So those things always just really sort of fun to sort of close your eyes and think about. You know what I mean? Whether it be that your tea or idol, although she would have known her idols have died, it's not like she's been in a time capsule, she's been in prison. It's, you know, enjoying those moments and things that you would miss out on as much as you making a comment on the world. Like the fact that, you know, she says, why is everyone so obsessed with their phones? And, you know, she's slightly attached to some of her teenage memorabilia. So yeah, those things were just like me and Laura Solon had a lovely, enjoyed just sort of discussing and thinking about that. And obviously there's a bit of creative license with that because people in prison do not, you know, as I said, they are in the world. There's not entirely removed from the world. But you can have a bit of fun with finding your quimper again on the other side. And we spoke to women who'd been in prison and people who've been in prison and and actually asked sort of simple and simple questions like, you know, what was it? What did it feel like? What did you? What was the hardest thing or the strangest thing? And one woman was really interesting about clothes. She said that she was so thrown off by clothes for about a year after coming back because she was so used to the few items that she wore. That the choice really threw her. And also she, like Mary, had the choice that she left that was 10 years ago. You know, that was her choice. She'd have any money. So the clothes she had with the clothes she'd had when she'd gone to prison. So things like that. We enjoyed bringing into the show to make it feel more real, I think. And I guess I have to ask about another thing you might have drawn from or had personal experience with, which is, have you ever cut your own bangs? Yes. And if so, what was the result? Exactly. I did the show. I very, very stupidly decided to cut my own bangs, but not look at my mirror was offset from my sink for my basin. So I basically then over the basin cut and then looked at the mirror, screamed and then went back and did it again. I don't know why I didn't know I was so kind of cleanly, but I did that. And then every time I look back, it was it was horrendous. And I basically did exactly what Mary did. And did you actually cut your bangs for the show? I'm curious. Did you have to walk around with like the micro micro fringe? I had we had a wig in the first season and in the second season, I just couldn't. I couldn't be bothered to be in makeup for that long because I wanted to put my kids put my kids to bed and let everyone go home early. So I said, come on, guys, let's do it. Just make me look ridiculous. I'll look ridiculous for six weeks and at the school gates, I got some brilliant looks. So yeah. I kind of want to go back to the emotional kind of reentry that Mary has because that's, I think the the texture of the show for me. And I I feel like it's relatable for all of us, even though obviously very few of us have had Mary's experience. Yeah, I think that I think that she's I think that it is relatable, isn't it? Because Mary's sort of the she's the underdog, right? And she's she's she's an innocent in the sense. And I think that's what's relatable, maybe with her. She's an optimist and an innocent and she's she's trying her best in a world that doesn't really, you know, that's not making it easy for her. So anyone who's not a winner winner, you know, kind of pass relates to Mary, I relate to Mary. She's someone who's just like, I'm going to have a go. I'm going to stick my toe in and then she gets hurt, but she pulls it. But she gets, but she gets back up again and she goes in and, you know, she's a fighter, really, but she's definitely. You know, it is a fundamentally a show about hope, I think, and forgiveness. And she's an adult beginner, which I think we can all feel like, right? We don't all, you know, unless you're some kind of amazing machine person, which I'm definitely not, you know, you constantly feel like, Oh, hello, Maria, you know, and Mary's like that. But she's got this sort of energy and optimism, which I think hopefully makes her relatable. And it makes you want her to succeed. Oh, you definitely want her to succeed. And I think the other thing, I think this is what you're saying, which is we've all had the experience of trying to enter into just even a small society. That's new. Like a new job. Mm hmm. And it can feel just as alienating or just as scary. Yeah. You don't know the rules, you know. Um, I wonder, are you like that? Like Mary, are you an optimist? Do you dip your toe in and then keep going? Yeah, I have a big cry though. You know, I'm not like, I'm not like, um, I'm an optimist who can go, Oh, that didn't work out. And then I, but then I seem to come. I seem, it seems to, I seem to come back again. If that makes sense. So I'm not an optimist, but I'm not an emotional or sort of brazenly strong or anything. I'm an emotional optimist. With friends like these is brought to you by Magic Spoon.

I do want to talk about some other characters on the show that kind of round out our experience of this town and help, you know, illuminate what Mary's experiences. Um, her parents are now, I don't know if there's a stereotype about what parents would be like for someone that has just been released from incarceration, but they're not that whatever I thought. Whatever I thought they would be. Um, you know, Oscar is a righteous environmentalist. Um, kind of passionate even slight spoiler alert for passion. Um, and a little in his own head, right? Yeah. And Caroline is her mother. And I think I'm not spoiling anything to say she's having an affair with Mary's high school boyfriend. Yeah. In the first season. Yeah. That's what she's doing with the. Yeah. So some unusual circumstance, right? Yeah. And I wonder like the pieces that are in play there. Um, I think Caroline is the most interesting one to me. Mm. Because how do I say this? It's not that she's not sympathetic. I care about everyone on the show. But she's a tough love. Let's say for sure, for sure. Yeah. She's very selfish, isn't she? She behaves in the selfish, I mean, extremely selfish way. Um, what, I mean, I guess part of me wonders, you know, you're a woman in this show is largely created by women and to put kind of an unsympathetic female character in there. Like, I always appreciate it when women do that because I think it's a subtlety there. I mean, I love Caroline and I loved it. She's the sexual character of the show. You know, she's the one who's going to bring that up to. She's got the racist appetite. You know, everyone would expect it to be me, you know, but actually Mary's really sort of a total innocent and her mum, no, once, once sexual satisfaction in her life. And she's, you know, disconnected emotionally, I think. And she's just, she hasn't got a purpose. And so she's her purpose has been about her sexual identity, really, and how to feel, you know, her way of dealing with everything has been to sort of seek pleasure elsewhere. And so the whole over the span of two seasons, we see her kind of grow up. I think we see her find her own identity and sort of figure out who she is and what she wants because she doesn't really know what she's doing. And it's only when Mary's back that she can actually has to confront really all the things that she's done wrong and who she really is. But yeah, I felt really, that really good. Me and Laura felt really excited to write the character that's the very gracious, the sexual one to be the older woman and not the older man and not the younger woman. It felt right and it felt important. And she is very sexy. I will say that. She's like, she just, yes, she carries it off. Like totally, you're, I'm believing that 30 something, you know, 40 something guy would find her hot. Sure. Like it's completely wrong. I mean, not the ages, but you know, like, yeah. It's not great morally. I mean, it's not, it's very funny because my, my dad gets is compared a lot to Oscar. And my mom said, somebody asked me if I was like, Carolina. Well, I wasn't going to go there about your mom. I am curious about Oscar. I actually feel like I ask her maybe a kind of type. I mean, my, oh, yes, it's interesting to me. He's sort of emotionally distant, but he's also kind of the one of the two of them that seems to have more empathy for Mary's experience. Yeah, I think Caroline's really angry with Mary for what it took from her life. And that's what comes out in season one. She finally explodes. And that's a brilliant moment, really, because then they can sort of start again, because she actually goes, you know what? Yes. You know, I hated you for what you did kind of thing. And I think that's really important because then once that said, they can sort of, she kind of Mary's grateful because it's like, well, now you finally, there's no, there's less repression in this house. You just shouted and cried and told me, you hate me. That's much, much more constructive than, um, then bottling everything up. But Oscar is, um, you know, Oscar is quite, I think he's able to switch off his emotions. Uh, but yeah, he's, uh, he's, he puts it all into the environment, doesn't he? All of it. Yeah. All of it. You know, I could ask about each individual character because I am curious and I care about all of them, but I want to know more about the creation of the show. Cause this is your baby. Like you created it. You write it, you're in it. What has that experience been like for you to carry something all that way? It's been amazing actually. It's, you know, I look back at the beginning and I think, gosh, it was so, you know, you're trying to find the tone and the shape and all the things. Um, but it's been an amazing experience. And I've been, you know, there's a million people involved in the creation of a show. You know, I'd like to take all the credit, but that would be complete lie. I'm very selfish and wrong because the truth of it is there's so many people go into making a show and you really learn that when you're, when you're doing what I've been doing, you really sort of go, Oh my goodness, if it wasn't for Chris Sweeney at the beginning, when we shot the first taste of tape who sat there patiently with me deciphering my visual, you know, can we try to explain what I wanted it to be? And, you know, and then made that happen with that, with the taste of tape that got the commission and then the first season. And then, you know, you have Sarah Hammond and two brothers and Harry Williams and all these people who are kind of sitting there, like helping you get this, this idea out. And then when we got the commission, I am, I was eight months pregnant and just phoned Laura and said, I need you someone else on this because I wanted to do it all myself. And then it became obvious that wasn't going to be beneficial really, like the more clever people you can get in a room. The better. So then Laura stepped in and was just amazing. So from the beginning, it's been this kind of, um, mad and excellent journey of lots of people, really so too many to name who are just, who just step in, tune in to what you're doing and then help you get this thing out of your head. And so it's an incredible experience. And like, yeah, I never thought I didn't think I was going to have that experience either. I kind of almost given up. So, um, yeah, it's been amazing. I want to talk about the almost giving up part. Well, I just thought, Oh, because I had my first kid and I sort of tried, I tried to write loads of things and no one had wanted anything. And I thought, Oh, well, you know, Oh, here I go. Really. I was pushing a pram around the park going, well, that's right. I might have missed that moment, you know, and then, um, and then just plugged on. And also, you know, two brothers amazingly kind of stuck, stuck with me and kept saying, you know, just keep come back with, keep, keep pitching us ideas. And then one day, you know, I did pitch this idea, which I pitched quite a few strange things to them that they weren't that sure about. And they were like, Oh, now this is interesting. And we all had a very aligned, we sat and discussed the tone and how we'd want it to look. And, and then suddenly that, you know, that's from that little seed. It took six years or something from there, but it did then it did start to be, it started to happen. But yeah, I know there were loads of points where I thought, Oh, oh, well, I had my shot. So yeah, so just just the fact that it's even happened is really like, Oh, my goodness. I can't believe it. Um, but yeah, and as a woman in film and, you know, really enjoying it with the last season, we sort of sunny turned around one day and we're like, there's all these amazing women. This is so much. There's all this kind women in charge. This is brilliant. So it's been cool. Did this idea feel different than others? Cause you said you, you would try it others. You'd pitched a lot of, I think you said weird or strange things. Yeah. But did this feel to you? Like this is the thing that's going to get made. Yeah. When I felt like, I felt like when we were talking, um, because Harry and Sarah, we talked so much about the kind of show we want to make. So we knew our inspiration, you know, we were on the same page tonally, you know, visually tonally, the kind of things that we've many lights. So we talked a lot about that. And this one fitted that in a really lovely way because it had the, it just had this darkness. Um, but what was, I think as a writer, I'm fundamentally a character writer. I'm not, you know, I'm not a plot writer, particularly. I write sort of details and the things I'm obsessed with a little character for moments and human things and people, whether they're kind or, you know, like, there's just the detail that I think I get really caught up in. And the great thing about this idea was that you could actually, you've got the dramatic premise is there and then you can just write relationships, you know. So it did feel right. And, and then we all talked and developed it, you know, and talked about it for ages together and it just started to kind of take off, but it took years and these things take so long, you know, at one point, Marie had a brother and then she didn't have a brother. I was going to ask about what kind of significant changes happened along the way. You, she had a brother and then I realized that the relationship I was trying to write for the brother was this really like, Pali relationship. And it was like, everyone kept gently saying, she wouldn't have that if she'd been in prison training. So that, so we had to get rid of the brother, which was sad. But then it was right because actually the, that was a crucial thing because he was one of the big parts, really. But then it was this funny and then then all the focuses on this only child and actually just weren't much better for the show. Are you an only child? No, I'm one of six. Oh, wow. Wow. And you come from like a showbiz family, right? Well, my dad's a director. Um, but it's funny. It feels like such an unshowbiz family because the rest of my family, and when you've got such a big family, and if there's only one of you, it doesn't feel like a showbiz family. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, I'm sure I'm not a mathematics family. My dad's a mathematician. So, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's my family. Yeah. No, exactly. Yeah. My dad's a director for my mom's like an Aussie Australian painter, like sort of an Stencklass artist and artist and then everyone else did completely different things. So yeah. Well, the one thing though, but having a family member in any profession, let's say, actually, just have being close to a profession, it's maybe a little outside. Most people's experience. Like, I know more about math and like university life than most people, probably, right? Yeah. Like, and you were exposed to, you know, acting in the arts and scripts in a way that most people aren't. Absolutely. And my, and my question is, did you always want to do that? Yeah, I wanted to write and also, you know, I did all my drawings on the back of scripts. That's what I drew on, you know, so I, we, we, we're at our tea house. My parents were like, don't watch Telly and, you know, just make your own fun, basically. So here's the, here's the paper. Here's the pens. See you later. So I would do all my drawings on the back of scripts. So I was always reading these pages of scripts. So I kind of grew up with that, I suppose. And I loved writing. So I always write short stories and poems and do terrible plays for my family and make them watch them and gym routine. So I think, yeah, I wanted to perform and I wanted to write. But I never got into any school plays or anything. OK, can you tell me anything about these plays that you performed as a child? Oh, they were so bad. They were just, they were just, they were just, they were fully improvised. No planning. I think I said this the other day in the interview. So, but, but I did this, I did this play one day because my dad did a film called The Mystery of Sorry, No, that's my play. My dad did a film called The Bl- My dad did a film called The Blood on Satan's Claw. And it was a bit of a sort of cult kind of hammer horror film. And we had the claw in the dressing up, you know, big pile of dressing up, second hand clothes and I used to do plays with the claw. And one of them was called The Mystery of the Scratched Boob. And it was just me going, oh, there's a scratch on my boob. And it went on and on and on. And then one day my dad just stood up and was like, this is rubbish. It's not going anywhere. You haven't got a good story. You're just talking about scratches on boob, sign out. Work on your stories. With friends like these is brought to you by Monk Pack.

As I have mentioned before, I bought a house this year in the Austin, Texas real estate market where houses sell in hours and not days.

I was on an eggshell high wire, which is why I highly recommend listening to the How to Buy a Home podcast.

How did you come to craft in terms of writing? I mean, I wrote really silly things as a child as well. And there comes a point when you realize that writing isn't just about expressing yourself. Totally. It's really hard. It is. It is. Yeah. I mean, I wrote loads of things that didn't have any structure. That was my thing. I couldn't do structure at all. And I tell you what, Laura Solon has taught me so much because she was amazing with back to life. She totally understood it was my baby and that I was going to be a bit annoying and a bit precious about stuff. So she's got no ego about it. And she, but she is so clever. And she was such a sister and such a genius. And she slowly I feel like by working with her, I've really sort of learnt so much about she'd be like, well, that's not moving forward. And I'd be like, why didn't I understand? And then I'd be like, Oh, and now I, you know, I really feel like she taught me so much because she had an understanding of some fundamentals with writing that I just didn't have, you know, I could write a scene, but I couldn't really, you know, and then that, you know, then I started to find myself thinking in a story and I was like, oh, this is so much so much better. So it's really hard writing. It is writing well. Yeah. It's really hard. Yeah. Writing badly is like awesome. But it's great. Totally. Yeah. I wonder if you can give an example of that, the shaping of something from, you know, an idea, a good idea, a creative idea to something that is moving a platform forward. I know that maybe. Well, I'm trying to think of an example from the show. I'm trying to think, like, for instance, she figured out quite early that if we planned it too much, I would not do what we planned. So I, I seem to want to, I seem to, you know, I seem to basically want it to surprise me as much as it was surprised someone else. So there was a moment where we planned something and then my phone joins, I've just killed the neighbor. She's just died. And Laura was like, I sometimes saw Laura as like the person, like the forensic, the person coming in to clean up after you've done a murder. She'd be like, all right, Daisy, hand over. I'm going in, but on her gloves. And then she'd help me make that make, you know, she'd help. She'd go, well, you know what? It's funny. It's good. It's surprising. Let's make it work, you know. That's so interesting because that's one of my favorite scenes, actually. That was my favorite to write. Because suddenly I was like, oh, she's dead. She was like, can we do this? Can we get away with it? How are you? I'm good, thanks. Fresh start, new beginnings. Well, it's a lovely day, so. Isn't it? Crisp. Ah, it's nothing quite like winter sun, is that? How are you? Oh, I feel fabulous. Thank you for asking. Oh, I'm so glad. Light as a feather, clean as a whistle, inside and out. Oh, I do wonder, though. Sometimes. Oh, what do you wonder? I wonder what it's like being a harlot. It's a slut, killer, a man's dealer. All right, you're obviously having a bad day, so I'm not going to take offence. Oh, I'm very well. Right now, never being better. Just a woman in her prime taking a good, hard look at a psycho husband's stealing fuck biscuit, casually bathing her sin in the sun. Well, she should be rotting to death in her prison cell. Sorry, can you just stop it now? Stop it. Rot, rot, rot dirty little prison killer. You don't know anything about me, just leave me alone. Stop me for a mean. You will always be alone. Oh, fuck off and die. Anna? Anna? It because it manages to combine a lot of the elements of the show, right? Yeah, the themes of the show, although, Mary doesn't talk much during it. Although that is kind of fitting too. That's fine. She gets talked at a lot. Yeah. And it is a surprise. And it also it's a scene that evokes a lot of like discomfort, right? Yeah. And because the care, I don't want to say too much about it, I guess. Well, we already, I think it's OK. We are in a neighbor dies. Spoiler alert for people having to. OK, you don't know which neighbor, you don't know which side. That's right. That's right. But there's the discomfort of feeling empathy for Mary and all the hatred that she's subjected to, right? Yeah. And then there's just like she's an annoying neighbor, like almost a sitcom trope, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then she dies. And then she just dies dead, which is funny when it happens. Shocking. But also we go circle around to like Mary's plight, right? Yeah. Like it can't be funny for a long time because. Because it's her. She's in all this. It's her. Yeah. And if she's near anybody or anything like that, I mean, I don't know if you've seen the second season, but we make it as hard for Mary as we can possibly be. You know, we think you give her a hard time in the first one. Oh my gosh. We really do put her through it. But yeah, because there are things that you know that just can't happen near somebody who's been in prison for a murder. There's just things that they can't be near to or be part of because if they are, they're going back in for life and no one's going to believe them. I think. So yeah, that's what that scene does as well as it's going to be. I think so. Yeah, that's what that scene does as well, isn't it? Yeah. You mentioned that the show is about redemption and it's about redemption and forgiveness and trust. I think. Well, people tell me that and I suppose it's pretty pretty much is, isn't it? Oh, well, then you tell me what it is. No, no, no. I mean, I think it is. No, no, I didn't mean it like that. I mean, I'm not very, when I'm writing, I don't really think I don't write down themes, if you know what I mean. And then it becomes really apparent that I really care about forgiveness. You know, people are like, God, you really care. And I was like, Oh, is it that obvious? Oh, yeah, I suppose I do. I'm just not very analytical. But yeah, I think it is. And I think it's about, you know, second chances and everyone actually in it at some point needs to be forgiven for their behavior. Don't they? I suppose it does really. It really is about that. It's pretty much quite heavily about that, whether it's her mother or the ex-boyfriend or whoever. Have you ever done something unforgivable? Well, do you have to say what it is? Yeah, I don't, I feel like, I feel like I really care about not doing something un-sigivable, probably to like a crazy degree, if that makes sense. Like I'm obsessed with loyalty. I'm obsessed with all those things. I'm sure I have to somebody, but I can't think of anything. I think if you betray a confidence, I find that, I've, you know, I've done that before and then felt terrible, you know, because that's not something I do. Do you know what I mean? But I don't, I haven't, not in the way that Mary has to do it. Yeah, I'm sure I have, but I can't, I think I'm probably quite obsessed with not doing unforgivable things. I try and lift my eyes as, as forgivable as possible. How about you? Oh, I have, for sure. Well, there's things that I've done that I haven't forgiven myself for. Oh, yeah, that's tough. That one. Yeah. I think that's a lot harder. Yeah. That kind of gets me back to another question about Mary and, and maybe something that you might want to say something about as well, which is that I think one of the reasons we love her so much is that is in that optimism, in that I'm going to give it a go, she's actually really forgiving. Yes. She is very gracious. She's a very gracious person. I think that's true. She's very accepting of people's flaws. And I think the thing about whether you've not done something unforgivable, that would also relate to how hard you are in yourself, right? So you may be really hard on yourself. So you think what you've done is unforgivable. I may not be. That's why I may be like, yeah, forgive myself. Everything is no, do you know what I mean? It depends on how hard people are on themselves. Well, you know, I was going to say is that sometimes, you know, the hardest thing is actually forgiving, right? Yeah. Have you ever forgiven someone something that was hard? Yeah, I have. But then I couldn't, you know, I'm ever trying to forgive somebody for cheating on me and then finding it and then realizing that although I had sort of forgiven them, I couldn't forget and forget it. I couldn't forget, you know, and so I remember feeling kind of sad because I was like, I've really tried, but I just did something's gone now. You know, I've had those moments in life where I've tried to forgive. And then also sometimes someone just does something and I think, oh, no, I don't think you're very nice. And then I've forgotten, oh, I'm tougher than I thought, you know. But yeah, it depends on the day. So you said you go into this show not really like with huge ideas you want to explore, which I think is a great way to approach storytelling, by the way, like you're not like, I want to write about forgiveness, right? Yes. You're writing about a character. I wonder if there's anything that you surprised yourself with as far as the thoughts about forgiveness or about the ways that people hurt each other, the ways that people help each other. Have you learned anything from writing the show besides the nuts and bolts of storytelling, which is super important? I think that, I think I learned this going to sound so cheesy, but I think I learned how much I care about kindness. Like I was like, I really want, you know, and I like, and things happening. Because even when you're writing something is you're crafting it, you're like, oh, no, that's a bit cruel. I want this to feel warm in the heart of it. And I didn't know how much I cared about that until I write, until we were writing it. Does that make any sense? So I didn't want it to be clever and shiny. I was like, I know I would choose, I would choose this being lower key, but with a big, like in the end, people feeling warmth. And like I didn't realize how much I, I cared about that. I would choose that ever being cool any second of the day. I think that's something I felt. And then I think there's probably other things that after a few years, if I watch it again, because I was too close to it still, that I'll go, oh gosh, that's interesting. I didn't know that, you know. I was sort of saying that, we were saying that. Why would we say, you know what I mean? I think that will probably happen. Do you think you're a kinder person coming out of the other end of two seasons? I don't know. Or maybe, yeah, maybe it combined with like having kind of, I don't know, with my kids and something like things. And like it's the things for me in my head shifting and sort of my personal priorities shifting, you know, maybe. But I don't know, but it definitely made me feel like, oh, I want this show to be really human. I want people to feel, you know, because it's a tough subject, it's lots of things. I want them to feel like, that I did feel like, I want them to feel warmth at the end. Well, thank you so much for coming on this show. Thank you for having me. Thanks. A big thanks to Daisy Haggard for talking to me and for putting a face on a story of redemption. Again, the show is back to life on Showtime and the season finale for season two. For season two is airing on Monday, October 18th. Andy Gardner Bernstein is our producer, Patrick Antonetti is our audio editor. And please, take care of yourselves."
