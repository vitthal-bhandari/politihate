    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast. Welcome in Wednesday edition. Clay Travis Buck Sexton show. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us as we roll into the program as we are speaking to you unless it has ended in the last few minutes. They are finally the FBI is getting around to searching Joe Biden's Delaware Beach House to see whether or not there are any classified documents there. This now is essentially three months after the first classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center. We know that the FBI has searched there. We know that the FBI has searched now in the Wilmington Delaware home. Primary residents of Joe Biden. They are now at the Rojoba Beach House searching. Here is a news update on that search, which is, as we said, currently going on. This is NBC's Kristen Welker discussing the consensual consensual search. We are told and this is an important point that there is no search warrant that the White House Counsel's Office is investigating and that this was planned. But such an important point and I just want to underscore that according to a source familiar with the matter, the White House Counsel's Office is cooperating fully with this search. There was no search warrant that was issued. This was pre plans. This was not a surprise search. This is something that they've been doing in coordination with the White House Council's office. Can I just say that? Just rock. Just real quick. Remember, remember Frank the tank in old school? What he starts swinging the chair on, as we've said, she's basically screaming at everybody. It's a planned search. You got to keep your composure. You got to keep your composure. I don't think people are feeling so good. The Democrat party right now. Look, we said on this program, as soon as this story broke, that there had to be a search of Joe Biden's Beach House and there had to be a search to Joe Biden's primary residence. It took months for this actually to occur. And I saw Miranda divine, a friend of ours who posted on Twitter, but it kind of tied into a lot of what we have discussed. I will be stunned if they find any classified documents in Joe Biden's Beach House, because they have now had three months on top of the screw up at the Wilmington residence where they also found classified documents. Surely they have done away with whatever classified documents might be in the beach house. Joe Biden has traveled there multiple times since the since the initial discovery of the documents took place in the Penn Biden Center. I just I would be flabbergasted if even if there were classified documents there, Buck, if they're still recoverable. So I think that part of this is that they're trying to move through the special counsel and divide in as quickly as they can. And so that's why they're now they're reporting on how Oh, it's a planned search. And you could tell the reporters like, Yeah, don't everybody freak out. Okay, it's not a it's not a moral logo right here. We're not freaking out. You're a little bit nervous. But I think that their plan is to get this done before the reelection season really is underway in a meaningful way. And that and so they hope by by talking about how they're planning the searches and then they're making sure there's nothing left there. They can essentially put this aside. I increasingly view this and look, it's really tough to see this clay right? I mean, tough to see this in advance. I think that there is the a lot of the anxiety of this isn't even so much. Oh my gosh, the sitting president is a moron, which they knew all along when they voted for this guy. That's actually not new. Right. But it's the recognition that it does have to be Biden. And he is making this a lot harder. And he's not going to be able to run from the basement. He's not going to be able to have COVID to sort of, you know, remember, the whole thing about Trump was, oh, he mishandled COVID and we're in all people were miserable. And they voted some of them. And let's not get into how many voted we'll talk about that another day for change from the misery. Right. As you've said a million times, is Donald Trump, if the elections held in 2019, does Donald Trump lose? No, he does not lose even if they're trying to do everything they can to beat him and rig the game in every way they could Trump would have won comfortably in 2019. And so I think right now with the document situation, what they see playing out is we have no choice but this guy and this guy, because remember originally people thought, oh, they're trying to push him aside. He's a bridge. And maybe there were a few people involved in this process who did see that. I'm not saying that that theory was entirely off or that. I mean, look, I thought for a second there, maybe it was true. But now given the way this process is playing out that the fat clay at some level that they have put this special counsel on and I think means they're trying to cross the T's dot the I's and get past this before the election. And I think they're also having some Hillary email trauma come up in their minds because they thought they were going to be able to put that one to bed and they weren't. And this one, it's not clear, you know, to your point, if they find stuff in Raghobith at this stage, you've got to think that Joe Biden was pampering his walls with classified and just didn't care. I mean, it was totally reckless. Yeah. And remember, he's speaking for the state of the union on Tuesday. So, so six days from now, February 7th, I believe, and you think the state of the union before all this classified document scandal blew up, you do the state of the union, maybe you wait a couple of weeks, and then sometime late February, early March, the official rollout of Joe Biden's running for president again in 2024 happens has the classified document scandal created a challenge to that schedule in some way, I would say probably yes. By the way, we should mention Nikki Haley is scheduled to announce according to multiple reports on February 15th, the day after Valentine's Day, just a couple of weeks from now that she will be officially contending in the 2024 Republican primary, joining and I didn't even know he was in there, John Bolton, who evidently announced at some point, and Donald Trump with the expectation of Pompeo Pence, maybe Tim Scott. Certainly, I think that Ron DeSantis is going to run all of those figures stepping into the fray. And that ties me into this book. I saw this quote come out from Donald Trump and I'm curious how you would analyze this, but Trump on Truth Social is stepping up his battle with Ron DeSantis. We played you the audio yesterday where DeSantis, I think, took a pretty like kind of a little bit under the radar shot at Trump by saying the people render a judgment on re-election. In my case, meaning DeSantis saying, in my case, I won by 19 points. Trump obviously did not win in 2020. And Trump has just posted on Truth Social. The real Ron is a all caps rhino globalist who closed quickly down Florida and even its beaches, loved the vaccines and wasted big money on testing how quickly people forget. Okay, so this is going to be an issue. We're going to always look to what we know, right? I mean, with Trump says, you know, Ron doesn't have the persona, the skills, the expertise to run the country, people can argue that one way or the other. But when Trump says that Ron is guilty of shutting down super early and not doing a good job on COVID and loving the vaccines, he is going directly into the strength of Ron DeSantis. I think it's the strongest single area. I was fleeing to Florida in the summer of 2020, personally, because of what Ron DeSantis did in the state. Okay. So, you know, we can't get into this. Who do you believe? You know, me or your lying eyes situation with Trump on this stuff. It's not going to go well. There are other areas where he can make it. You know, he can say, Trump saying, I'm the only one who can win. I'm the only one who can govern. I'm the only one who can. Those are all areas where I think, you know, he's got he's got the upper hand. He does. Yeah. Trump saying Ron DeSantis was bad on COVID and liked the vaccine. So, but Trump said that the vaccine saved 100 million lives a week ago. Yeah. So, he's got a he's got to pick his lane here because we are paying attention. We are seeing what's going on. I think it's the worst single avenue of attack Donald Trump could have on Ron DeSantis. I mean, this is like saying Glenn Youngkin is too short. Glenn Youngkin is like 69. Okay. He's not too short. Say what you want to buy. Yeah. It is. And to me, what it does is reinforce, frankly, Trump's failures on COVID because you can criticize Ron DeSantis for a lot, right? That's what politics is. You get criticized on a variety of different fronts. If you told the DeSantis people, where do you want Trump to fight the battle of the 2024 presidential nominating fight on whether DeSantis treated COVID too seriously and locked down too aggressively? That's the lane. Why have 350,000 people moved to Florida in the last two and a half years? We all know why because of what Florida did during COVID. This is the single weakest and it's, you know, dude, you and I, we voted for Trump. We like Trump. Yeah. I like Donald Trump as a person. You like Donald Trump. He did a great job in office as president. He's got to go after the things that are going to make sense and going to resonate. I don't know. I don't know who's advising him right now, but whoever's advising him in the way he's going after a DeSantis is not, is not serving him well. Honestly, DeSantis insisted that every single school in Florida be open and that no one be required to wear masks in July and August of 2020. That that isn't. I mean, the kids in Philadelphia and parts of California are still wearing masks to this day. This is the single worst avenue we can attack him. I also think it elevates DeSantis because right now Trump's in the lead in in many states, certainly in national polling. But I think when Trump is attacking a guy who hasn't even announced for the office yet, one, it looks like he's afraid of them, in my opinion. Now, I don't think Trump's afraid of anybody, but I think that's how it comes off. And two, I think he's choosing to attack him in the worst possible space. Yeah. Look, you and I both know this from just being a, a public person who gets attacked. They're the people who attack you, even who are public people themselves. And you ignore because it's just not, you know, when Keith Olverman, you know, attacks, you know, what you like to do all star. Yes. He's sad. I feel I feel badly. He's a sad old man. No one cares. You know, he there's nothing. So it's not worth getting into with him. But occasionally somebody will throw, you know, somebody will throw a jab or a right cross at you. And you know, it's go time, right? You're kind of saying, you know, Trump is kind of saying that, you know, he thinks that Ron is the guy that he has to throw shots at first, which is indicative of a concern over the dynamic right now and the momentum. And I just think that, you know, to attack Ron on COVID is very, I mean, look, does anyone, I don't know what how lines I mean, is anyone think that that's actually a valid because Trump was, Trump was angry at Georgia for opening too early. Yes. I spoke to the president in the oval in May of 2020 about COVID. And I was begging him, sir, you got to stop with these. He let Fauci take over. I hate to say it. Fauci and Birx were calling the shots. And early on, you could say that's not his fault because, you know, they're the experts, etc. By May, June 2020, it had to be, you know, he should have ousted them. They should have been sidelined. So if we're going to, if this is going to be a fight over who handled COVID better, it's got to be a fight over who handled for Trump, China trade, the economy, the border. Those are areas where Trump can can do some victory laps. COVID not so much. 800 in 282, 282, maybe some of you disagree and think that the Santas is vulnerable there. But my general position is it's hard to judge anybody on March of 2020 because it was such a total and complete cluster. You know what? And there was some time there where the Santas shut down beaches and that was happening everywhere in the nation. But by April and May, the Santas was leading one of the freest states in the country. And that is just, I think, the single worst area where Trump could be attacking it. There were people before Trump, before DeSantis's reelection, there were governors in far more red states, meaning just, you know, they totally Republican top to bottom who refused to protect people from vaccine mandates in the private sector. Yeah, Ron DeSantis said, nah, not in my state. You're not doing that. You're not forcing shots people don't need into their arms on pain of firing them from their job. Their anti discrimination laws. There are a lot of employment laws in the books. Some governors wanted to take big money from big pharma. Some governors had other things in mind. Ron was good on this one. Yeah, and Buck, I'll just say from my personal experience, I moved my whole family to Florida in May of 2020 and lived down there for that month. Kids were out of school. We spend a lot of time in Florida. And DeSantis was really good in May of 2020. All the restaurants were opening up. You know, by May of 2020, Florida was basically 100% hotels were open, basically 100% back to normal. How many places in America can you say that about? I think it's hard to attack him. You know, if you're going to criticize Tom Brady, probably best not to say he doesn't know how to throw a football, right? Or he didn't win enough Super Bowls. He lost three Super Bowls. That's true. He won seven. But what Trump's doing is like going after Brady because he lost too many Super Bowls. 800-282-282. If we're missing something, folks, on this, we always want to hear from this. Give me ongoing conversation. I just want to point this out to you. You know, it matters the most. We don't have four more years of a Democrat running this country. How much more damage do you think Joe Biden can do with four more years? I really think about that one for a second. We got to get this one right. This next election is critical and you can already feel these dynamics and this battle playing out right now. If your cell phone service is with AT&T, Verizon, or T-Mobile, guess what? You're paying too much. Switch to PureTalk. That's my cell phone company, a choice, and save more than 50 or 60 bucks a month for the same quality of service. That's because PureTalk uses the same towers and network as the big companies. It's great nationwide 5G service at a better price. What makes switching to PureTalk even better is the company itself. It's veteran-owned U.S. Space Customer Service team. Just to give you a sense of them, they don't put up with anything woke. So you don't see them advertising on all the fake news networks and doing that nonsense. And plus with PureTalk, you'll get blazing fast data talk and text for just 30 bucks a month.

If you're not completely happy, say, Clay and Buck, PureTalk is simply smarter, wireless. Clay Travis and Buck Sexton, voices of sanity in an insane world. Welcome back to Clay and Buck. We're talking about the back and forth. Well, really, it's actually just a back and not a forth or forth and not a back. It's just kind of one way so far. A little bit of a pushback from Ron DeSantis to some of the Trump criticisms of him specifically on COVID. Just note though, the Trump is actually putting out some really good videos. For example, play clip 10 here. He's talking about Title IX, no parent having their child forced to assume a new gender, play clip 10. The bill will also make clear the Title IX prohibits men from participating in women's sports, and we will protect the rights of parents from being forced to allow their minor child to assume a gender which is new and an identity without the parent's consent. The identity will not be new and it will not be without parental consent. No serious country should be telling its children that they were born with the wrong gender, a concept that was never heard of in all of human history. Nobody's ever heard of this. What's happening today. It was all when the radical left invented it just a few years ago. Under my leadership, this madness will end. Clay, to me, the short policy videos he's putting out have been right on target. Yeah. You know, the, the, the attacks on DeSantis, I think are just objectively not landing the way that he would want them to, but the video seemed to be on point. His, his video policies are 100% right. What he is saying there, no men should be competing against women. Overwhelming majorities the public agree with. You shouldn't be able to suddenly flip your gender and certainly parents of kids that are trying to do that are entitled to know it. He's right on all that, which is why I think there's a miscalculation on the DeSantis. You guys are loading up the phone lines 800-282-2882.

We're going to take some of your calls talking about Trump DeSantis. Is Trump attacking DeSantis and landing blows? Buck, you put up a poll. All of you out there listening to us right now can go vote in it. Lay out the poll and what the results are showing so far. Well, this is just based on folks who are using Twitter and wise enough for Twitter users to follow me. You got to be following Clay and Buck. Well, Clay Travis and Buck Sexton, we have two separate accounts. You should be following us. We also have a Clay and Buck account, which is fun. But we have almost 7,000 votes in. 88% say that the attacks on DeSantis are flailing 12% say they are landing. So again, in each Twitter poll, we're not claiming is representative sample of the entire nation. But if 88% of people and you just put this poll up about five minutes ago, are all reacting and saying that he is flailing, that gives you some snapshot of what the Twitter audience following us is saying. Now, we opened up phone lines 800-282-2882, Mary in Ohio. What do you think about Trump going after DeSantis? So I love Trump as a president. He outworked everybody. He had great policies. But the fact is that he has been smeared so bad by the media. I don't think he's reelectable, honestly. So who would you vote for? I mean, obviously, we're just now starting to find out who the nominees are going to be. Who do you like in 24? DeSantis. I vote for DeSantis a thousand times. Thank you for the call, Mary. And look, I just want to get people's reactions here. Jordan in North Carolina. Jordan, what do you think? What's up, guys? Amazon driver Jordan. My thing is the big issue with Trump is loving, greatest president of my lifetime. But the problem is that they've decided to run and beat Trump and get the nomination. I do not think for a second that Trump will back DeSantis almost kind of like a Teddy Roosevelt thing. And correct me if I'm wrong historically, but almost like what to run is like a third party, which would completely guarantee the Democrats win like no unification. You know what I'm saying? That's the fear, Buck. Thank you for the call, Jordan. Be safe out on the road. Amazon driver. We know how you guys are everywhere. I can't say, you know, that's the fear. The Amazon drivers. We often say truck drivers. Thank you so much. Amazon drivers. Thank you so much. Just as a side note, I think I have probably had hundreds of hours of my life, if not thousands, saved by the fact that you could have so many things delivered. It's a remarkable age. We live it. I'm just saying. So thank you to all the folks who deliver the packages because I hate shopping. I shop on my phone for everything. Anyway, there is a, there's a story out. I need to find it where Politico basically pulled and said how many Trump supporters would vote for him third party. And it would be enough as Jordan in North Carolina, Amazon truck driver just said to potentially hand whichever Democrat we're running for the office, the presidency. I see here's why I don't think Trump would do that. Yeah, I don't believe Trump would do that because I think, look, Trump is a man of, of healthy ego. I think we could say, as a man of healthy ego, maybe a tremendous understatement. He did something in 2016 that set the Republican party in a new direction, changed the way the right does politics, how we fight, how we think about the use of power on our side. There is a lot of legacy there. No matter what happens here in this primary, as far as I'm concerned, if I'm trying to look at how this will go down in history, Donald Trump has that legacy intact, that he did something that he had a great first term as president, COVID basically, you know, and all the shenanigans the Democrats stole it. I mean, it was a lightning strike, meteor comet hitting the you know, hitting the earth kind of situation. And he won. Or you know, and he lost Biden won. If he were to run third party and hand four more years to Democrats in the process, he destroys his legacy. And I think he knows that. So I don't believe, and I think he love, I honestly think he loves this country too much for that. I do believe that. So while it is, you know, we're going to talk about it as a possibility. I think at the end of the day, Donald Trump knows that his legacy, his name, his brand are bigger than running a third party spoiler candidacy to just let the Democrats, you know, push transgender surgery for kids for four more years. You know what I mean? I don't think he'll do it. I get it. That's a fear that's lingering out there. Heather in North Carolina weighing in as well. Heather, what do you think? I agree with you guys. I think that Donald Trump does have a legacy. And I think that he did a lot of great things as president. And I think that he did wake up the American people by not being politically correct and by calling out the lift. However, I do think if he's going to be successful in the future, he needs to stop the personal attacks, attack the policy and leave the person alone. You know, I think, by the way, I think that's various student analysis. Thank you very much for calling in. I would say clay, you know, would play to Trump's strengths here, even even running against the scientists and I know we're going to be doing a lot of a lot of on the fly strategy here for all kinds of candidates and just be honest with everybody about what we're seeing and how it seems to be playing out. Trump saying Ron is a great governor. Ron has done a phenomenal job on COVID. Ron can't win at the national level against the democrat machine. I can Ron will have his time and you know, and I'll work with Ron when the time comes in my that to me is Trump's smartest approach, right? To be the big because you're inherently the bigger man, right? Trump basically saying I'm Obi Wan Kenobi and I still have some things I got to teach young Skywalker that I think people could say, you know, maybe, but Trump saying, yes, Skywalker sucks. That guy can't swing a lightsaber to save his life. That's not going to fly. That's not that's not a bad angle at all. And if you think about it, Trump, I think's best pitches. I've been president before. I will hit the ground running on day one. And if you think they're going to attack me, so what I can only serve for more years now, DeSantis can stay till 2026. Guys, I'll endorse who I think the best candidate is for 2028. And I think it may well be Ron DeSantis. But guess what? I'm the best by far in 2024. That is a pitch that I think a lot of people would respond to him. Trump co-opting DeSantis into the broader movement. Make gives him far less place to run saying Ron DeSantis did a bad job on COVID is just he's just going to get laughed at. Trump is going to get laughed at if he does that. People are not because there are too many of us who experienced firsthand what was actually going on in Florida during COVID, which was, you know, it was like I said, it was leaving East Germany and arriving in West Germany circa 1965. I mean, it was just remarkable. And so that's the worst possible. The worst possible attack is one that everyone knows is false. Yes. And that also ties in with Trump still is bragging about the vaccine himself. So how can you attack like that's a bad, that's a bad battle. I think I'm honestly, I don't know if Trump's people are listening right now, they should be, you know, the template if he wants to win this, this primary is to be big, to show that he's the elder statesman bigger than the petty. All of his ire goes against, you know, it's the same thing with you and me. We don't, we never sit here and trash people on the right. Some people on the right annoy me politicians, we criticize, but other people that are doing what we do in this business, we support them. We're friends with other people on the right. We try to help them sell their books because we're about the movement, right? We want the movement to succeed. Trump takes that approach to the Republican Party and to the right and shows himself to be above the petty nonsense, but still the right guy for the job that I think is compelling to enough voters that he could get it done. The, the, you know, the shots in the, in the kidneys when DeSantis isn't looking, that's not gonna, that's not gonna work. JB in Texas. What do you think? For carrying the torch, man. Uh, yeah, uh, the one thing, yeah, I'm gonna vote for DeSantis or Trump, whoever, whomever, but yeah, the nominee is, but I, I, something that hasn't been said is Trump's already fought the fault. He can afford to fight the left. I'm afraid if DeSantis gets in there too early, I don't think he can fight the left economically. I mean, the litigations and the, you know, politically, he's fine, but economically, I think, I think, stronger and that may not, would you do me in my personal finances or? Yeah, that your argument is that if he's getting sued that Trump's, you know, a billionaire and he has the resources and DeSantis wouldn't. That may, that may not be a valid point, but it's something to think about, I think. Well, look, this is an interesting angle. I think Trump going back to his 2016 campaign and to a certain extent in 2020, the billionaire status for Trump matters in this way, Buck, and I'm curious if you would agree. It basically means Trump doesn't have to do anything to curry favor with anyone. He's already super rich. And so this idea of, oh, he's gonna be like the Clintons or the Obamas or other people who were not wealthy and then got very wealthy in politics. Trump is already wealthy. More money to him is not significant. DeSantis doesn't really have any assets. I mean, I think, you know, that he published, I think he still has loan debt from going to get his law degree. I think he's only worth a couple of hundred thousand dollars. I'm not concerned about all the frivolous lawsuits that will rain down. He'll have enough resources to be able to defend himself there. But what DeSantis doesn't have that Trump has is that independent wealth to say, hey, I'm doing what's best for the country, which I think is a strong argument for Trump, because DeSantis is like a normal guy. But I think that also cuts in his favor, right? Like, you can see how both they're very different in terms of their personalities and personal life. DeSantis is married to one woman still in his 40s, three young kids. Trump has got a fully grown family's grandpa. I'm not worried about the financial, but I do think that helps Trump a little bit in terms of establishing independence. Look, the fact that we're even talking about, and when I say we, I don't just mean you and me and everyone listening to this, but everybody in the right across the country right now is having this discussion. And whenever you talk about Trump and the election, you're talking about DeSantis as well. He hasn't even said he's running. He's the governor of Florida. So there's something obviously going on here, right? I mean, we're all aware. And that's why I think, you know, criticism has to be rooted in truth or else, or else the base eventually is just going to say, wait, hold on, what's going on here? Because DeSantis is a phenomenal governor. As not just a, not just my opinion, in your opinion, look what just happened in the election, you know, scoreboard results. Look at the reality. So there are other ways to make the case, but saying he's, you know, done a bad job on COVID is not going to fly. My friends, the tunnel, the tower found tunnel, the towers foundation delivers on its promise to do good and never forget the sacrifices America's heroes have made for us. Heroes like Air Force senior master sergeant Israel del Toro Jr. He promised his father, he'd take care of his family, and he promised his son he wouldn't grow up without a father. When his humby exploded in Afghanistan, he suffered severe burns over more than 80% of his body, with only a 15% chance of survival del Toro focus on the promises he made. Later, he became the first fully disabled airman permitted to reenlist and a gold matter winner in the Invictus games. Now he shares his story to help others. Thanks to the Tunnel to Towers foundation and your generosity, del Toro received a mortgage free smart home. The home has a range of features to help him live his life more independently. Help heroes like del Toro when they need it most donate $11 a month to tunnel the towers at t2t.org. That's t the number two t t from the front lines of truth clay Travis and Buck Sexton. He's barring public high schools from teaching AP African American studies. He's taking aim at drag performances even suggesting that he would urge the state's child protective services to investigate parents who take their old kids to one. He's actively trying to ban COVID vaccine mandates and restricting mask rules while at the same time calling for probes into supposed wrongdoing linked to the vaccine. I'm using all of this while making sure that anyone can walk around with a gun no permit or fire. It's a right wing fantasy land like Disney World but in hell come to Florida. The meanest place on earth. Right wing fantasy land Florida. I gotta say, sounds pretty awesome to me in terms of walking around with constitutional carry which is supposed to get done here. No COVID. The fact that they still think COVID mandates for vaccines were masks or anything other than something to be ashamed of pushing is truly mind blowing clay. Also, yeah, keep pushing the parents who or people who have a problem with adult men gyrating their butts in thongs in front of small children. Keep pushing it somehow. That's not weird. Yeah, good good luck with that Democrats with the whole drag store drag queen thing in front of the little kids. That's all it's the sandest. Desantis doesn't think that adult men should be shaking their their behinds and whatever in front of small children. Yes, because Ron Desantis is a normal person who has not been brainwashed by the left. I gotta say, you know, it's it's amazing branding when you have MSNBC calling your state a right wing fantasy land because in all the best ways it actually is Florida is kind of right wing fantasy land now. Well, what ties in with that bucket, I'm looking at they just released the latest data on voter registration edge in the state of Florida. And this is the legacy as you've got Trump at Mar-a-Lago and you've got Desantis and Tallahassee and the governor's mansion right now. In 2018, when Ron Desantis came into the office, Democrats had a statewide edge in voter registration of 257,175 voters. But this is pretty crazy. In January of 2023, which just basically has been completed. Republicans now have an edge of just shy 5,000 people shy of 400,000 voters. So in the space of effectively four years, you have seen Florida go from a blue state and registration to not only not only just a red state in registration, it's flipped by 650,000 voters. Now we know Desantis won by 19 points in the state of Florida. But the legacy to me going forward is you're going to have to really screw up as Republicans to lose the state of Florida in the presidential election or to lose one of the statewide political offices, whether it's one of the two senatorships or the governorship. That's a pretty stellar resume to have to be able to leave behind going forward. Let's take a couple of more of your calls. We're going to be joined by Heather McDonald. If you heard us yesterday talking about police and the dangers and the continuing fallout of what happened with Tyree Nichols, Heather McDonald's got some incredible data that I think you'll all want to hear. Ed in Louisiana, what do you got for us? Hi. Hey, what's up, man? I was calling to give my take on the on the Trump Desantis. What do you think? Well, I've been working on looking at the big picture. See, Trump knows he's got his base and his voters. He's working to get nationwide votes. So he did that to activate the just like the sound bites you just played. He did that to activate votes from other people. As far as to say, look, I handled the fires. That's why he's playing both fields on it. Cause he wants to activate the people. You think Trump is making a play for Democrats and independents by attacking the Santas on COVID. Yes, sir. He's seeing the big picture. He's, uh, he's he's trying to win. He's playing ball. What he might throw things out there doesn't necessarily meaning he's not necessarily attacking the Santas. He's just throwing things out there to get mask mandate people and vaccine people active active in the conversation to say, Oh, the Santas is totally against all of this stuff. But see, I appreciate your call. I think that helps DeSantis in the Republican primary. Yes. If mask people are like, Oh, DeSantis hates masks, then people like you and me, Buck are like, yeah, God bless him. He's not running a general election strategy right now. And by the way, honestly, if someone's still, I don't want someone voting for my candidate, they still think we should have mask mandates because they're out of their minds. Yeah, the data on that is so clear that again, that's our point is that the way Trump is attacking the Santas actually is helping the Santas more than it's helping Trump. Head of a Donald next."
