    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Hello, welcome. Happy Thursday, happy day before Friday. Here I am Jason Whitlock and you are watching Fearless with Jason Whitlock. Thank you for joining me. We have an awesome, a fantastic, a terrific, and enormous gargantuan spectacular show. Playing for you today. TJ Mo and Shamika Michelle are still here in studio with me here in Nashville. That is always nice. We're going to talk today quite a bit about transgender athletes and Leah Thomas and TJ and Shamika will join me for that a little later in the show. Royce White and Steve Kim will also join us. Steve Kim is going to help us talk about Leah Thomas and what's going on with the transgender athletes. Outkick has come out with an article with some new perspective from Leah Thomas, the University of Penn transgender swimmer, their perspective of what's going on. And then Royce White, the former NBA player, first round draft pick, will be here to talk about the Golden State Warriors partial owner, minority owner, who finally told the truth about what the NBA actually thinks about China and human rights abuses in China as it relates to the Uighurs. Royce White is going to have some interesting things to say about that as will I. But we're going to start the show actually with an interview with a Christopher Tramolie, or Tramolie who writes for the Washington Examiner among other places, Christopher went to the University of Penn and last week wrote a story about some of the University of Penn female swimmers and their reaction to Leah Thomas' involvement in women swimming. Leah Thomas, I think, was born William Thomas before transitioning and was an original member of the Penn's men's swim team. And now is a threat to break all kinds of records in women's swimming. And the Washington Examiner and Outkick have kind of been all over this story and giving a voice to the female athletes on that swim team who have been impacted by Leah Thomas arrival on the team and arrival in Ivy League sports. And so I wanted to kind of start there with a foundation and then we're going to open it up to a conversation and some analysis and opinions from myself, TJ Mo and Shamika Michelle. But let's first bring in Christopher Tramolie from the Washington Examiner. Chris, welcome to the show. And I guess now understanding that you went to the University of Penn, I guess that explains why you've been able to get some of these young ladies to talk to you about what's going on with the swim team. Yeah, actually I graduated at the University of Pennsylvania in December 2020. And believe it or not, I actually sat next to William Thomas in one of my classes in fall 2018. So I know William, well, I wouldn't say I know William, I was a classmate with William, but I do never have not had to did not know any of that was going all with the whole transgender transition to Leah at all. But yes, I know some of the reach out to some of the swimmers to get their perspective as you've covered and as you can imagine, they're not very happy themselves that what's going on. And who can blame them? It's fascinating that you had a class with William Thomas. And so at that time, there was no discussion about him potentially transitioning to being a woman and competing against female athletes. And again, I know you said you didn't know him well, but was there anything that raised an eyebrow to you looking back in retro spread? Nothing at all. I mean, I didn't know him all that well. We were in a Russian class together. So we did basically like group exercises and dialogue exercises in that area. But as far as knowing him outside the classroom, I didn't at all, but nothing that would have ever given me an insight or a thing. I thought that this was going to be a current or in the process of a current post. As I cover in my article, the whole announcement that he was William was going to become Lea and swim on the female team started a couple years prior. It just didn't happen now this year. And that's what one of the swimmers told me. So I guess that time sort of would have overlapped in which we were in class together, but nothing that I would have ever presumed that this was going to happen or he wasn't, he never spoke of anything of, you know, that sexual orientation, gender identity, any old agenda, flu, whatever it's called nowadays and that stuff. So that was never on an idea that I ever thought was going to possibly happen. So there's a bunch of questions that run through my mind with you being this close to the program in the school. But I just kind of want to start here because I think I've read that Lea, formerly William, is six foot three. And is he significantly bigger, taller, longer than the other femur, other swimmers on the pin women's team? Well, he's significantly taller than me. I'm six feet tall. And I know that he, I didn't know he was six feet three. I figured he was between six two and six four. So it makes sense. The swimmer I know was like five, eight, five, nine. She was a little shorter to me. So definitely there is a height advance there as well for William. And I looked the statistics up myself. And as far as the male swimmers, the average height is six feet two inches tall for men. And for women, the height is average as out to be five feet nine inches. So you're talking about a five inch different in height between male and female. That's a huge difference in huge competitive edge. If you're just swimming and you need as much height and distance as you can, or I guess wingspan or reach, I guess you'd say for probably for swimmers that you could possibly get. Which is why all this nonsense about, you know, hormone suppression and treatments and that NCAA has backed just doesn't make any logical sense at all. It doesn't seem to fit with the whole like trusting the sciences that's been like the mantra in this country for the past couple years. So none of that really seems to hold any water to it, no pun intended. When it comes to the fact that there's just a biological advantage that women cannot compete with in so far as that their height, you know, in this particular instance, their height. And then there's also the, you know, the bone structure, lung capacity I read, bigger hands just overall in general. So if it was as simple as the NCAA, the Ivy League, and every world person has tried to make it be, then why just real from the root of everything, why are there men in women's sports, why are they separated to begin with? Totally agree. Listen, pins in Ivy League school, it's probably I'm speculating pretty progressive, pretty left. Are you taking a lot of flat for being a pin graduate, part of the club, part of the elite group, and taking on this issue and taking the other side of this issue, then the university, a very progressive university, are you taking flak from your peers, you know, former students, faculty, are people upset with you? Actually, I've gotten a fair amount of hate mail, I would say, but nothing related to hate mail as far as University of Pennsylvania, just different like trolls or random comments of people leaving messages on my Facebook page and Twitter. Nothing like nothing as bad as some of the articles I have in the past. Believe it or not, I've actually gotten a lot of praise and thanks for actually speaking up and doing this issue for women's sports. I have a lot of my female friends who I would even, some who I would even identify as left wing and liberal, have come out and spoke and thank me and have said that, like, we appreciate you doing this. I mean, as much as I appreciate the accolades, all the credit goes to the female swimmer who's having the courage to speak out. So I'm just described here writing everything down. She's the one that's there's all the credit. But as far as comments in general, like, believe it or not, I was kind of, I literally thought I was going to get attacked. I know media matters did a story, bashing Fox News and pretty much every right wing. I think your show might have been on there listed as far as like spending too much time covering this story. And they referenced my article in it as well. But as far as that, I mean, I was, it was kind of a little bit surprised as to how much like hate I have not received on it. And it's been mostly positive as far as like bringing awareness to the situation, which, like I said, I can't emphasize enough. The credit belongs to the swimmer speaking out here. All right, your stories and stories I've seen on out kick are creating the impression with me that all the girls on the swim team are pretty either upset, irate, or at least frustrated by what's going on with Leah Thomas. But are there some ladies on this team that are in full support and feel like you, me, and others are the bad guys? To my knowledge, everything I've done as far as interviewing the overwhelming majority are not in favor of and kind of resented and are frustrated and angry. I believe I was told she might have one or two female friends on the team. But I mean, there's also one thing that the swimmer emphasized is that they have to train together. Penn came to them and said that Leah swimming with them was going to be a non-negotiable. So it was going to happen regardless. And they had, you know, they could, they were provided with counselors that they could possibly talk to if they were upset. But in even with that, the counselors weren't going to be able to do anything. And from what I also understand, the coaches hands were tied as well. So as far as the environment in the atmosphere, it's the, to my knowledge, a lot of the women are upset. I know that they said that some of them, I was speaking to about my source and she said that had she known this was going to happen during her time here, she isn't exactly sure that she would have gone through and committed to going to University of Pennsylvania. She said she loves the school, loves her teammates, loves her coach, praise her coach for making her better swimmer. But she also said that in hindsight, had she known this was going to go on, she's not sure that she would have actually committed. So I think that's indicative of pretty much the sentiment of the female swimmer. So what's going on? Because now athletes in college, you know, they're recruited in their high school years to go to the school. And I think if I recall correctly, it's usually our junior year when they kind of do most of the linking up between, you know, applying for school and getting into it. So I just put putting yourself in that position, and putting myself in that position. I just can't imagine it's basically a bait and switch. You're told you can have free and fair competition among fellow women and then boom, out of nowhere, you're stuck competing against a man. And so obviously there's not a lot of happiness and there is tension. The problem is there's not really they can say much about it because there is an atmosphere as you well covered as far as being on the Ivy League and the leftist campus that is pretty much if you speak out about it in my source cover this as well, she said if you speak out about it, you're pretty much just going to be called the transfer or whatever the transfer, transfer of the comments, transphobia and all those negative comments. But in reality, it has nothing to do with that. It just basically has to do with like this is not their promise. This is the opportunities that are being taken away from them. And it's just they feel very like, you know, it's just not fair and I can't blame it because it's not fair. Outkick wrote a story I believe yesterday that there's a belief among some of the teammates that Leah colluded with a transgender female that went to mail or bored. Yes, in the process of going to. Yeah, that's a clue. I'm sorry, I didn't cut you up yet. No, no, that there was collusion and that Leah allowed Isaac or and I can't think of Isaac's name now because I think it's a female name, but colluded and allowed him to win. Do you believe that? Have you heard that speculation from your sources? I actually asked my source that as well because it just seemed too coincidental that just as you know, the male to female lee at Thomas was going against the female to male Isaac how that would happen in and a lot of the times people were making the argument when the story about Leah first broke that oh, it makes no difference. You know, there's a whole lot of suppression clears everything. There's no difference. So when I posed that to her, she she said basically with Alkyd reported. I didn't put that and published that in my story because it just I didn't wanted to take away from what was going on with the females in the female environment of how they were being kind of oppressed and repressed for being females in the swimmers. So and plus it's also kind of one of those you can't really prove it happened. So I didn't want to dive into that and then this would be kind of the whole narrative shift away from these women are losing opportunities to hear you just have bitter people making things up that they can't prove. So I didn't put that in any of my information, but I did cover it and there is a prevailing thought that that is indeed what happened. I said, who knows? She did say that they were friends that I think she said that if I recall correctly, they lay it as to swim so she could compete or so Leah could compete against Isaac again. But the thing I just didn't like is like you'll really can't know for sure unless you you know talk to them and they confirmed it. There were substantially time differences in this particular meet. So there would be a lot of evidence to back up those claims. Again, I don't know enough about swimming or being a male go train this into a female advice versus myself to make those comparisons. So but you know that was definitely coverage and in our discussions as well. So do we have any idea what her former male swimming teammates think about her decision to compete against women? You know what? No. I didn't know actually the only male swimmer I knew when I was at Penn was William Thomas and like I said, I don't want to say I knew him that we were in a friendly way. I just knew he was at next to me and had I think like a swim shirt or a swim bag. So that's how I knew and we like briefly talked about swimming because we were I remember we were learning incidentally the verb to swim in Russian and we kind of had like a brief conversation about that at the time. So but yeah, no, that's I don't know any unfortunately any male swimmer what they feel about that. The only thing that I kind of have well this next night really related but I know that I covered this in my article the female swimmer that my source she said that a year or so ago or before Leah actually became Lee and performed on the women's team there was a like a dinner they go to and they're training they go to like Florida for training over winter break and my source told me that this and this this I'm sorry my preface this was somewhere this dinner is like funded by alumni supposed to be like a really big deal it's not just like you know you're going to like you know Chick-fil-A or anything it's like a big kid or deal for you fund the by-law nine. So and they have separate dinners for the men's team and then the women's team and and my source told me that Leah went and had dinner with the men's team but then also had dinner with the women's team and there was kind of resentment as like well hold on if you're claiming that you're you're so much trying to find yourself and being you know in tune with yourself and you're really a woman then why are you having dinner with the men's team and if you just want to have you know dinner with your friends who you know for the three years that's understandable but then why come back and have dinner with the swim team so there seems to be like I don't know if it's entitlement or just like weird bad poor decision making or self-centeredness that that kind of like draw also things like that have also drawn on um ire and made people angry and frustrated as well so it would be interesting that she though with the men's what feel as well is is this her only year of competing or she have remaining eligibility it is he have remaining eligibility will he be back next year I believe this is Leah's last year William swam for three years on the men's team I don't know if this is like college football when you can rest shirt and then get in a couple years NCO double eligibility or maybe they give extra years of NCAA eligibility because William is now Lee I have no idea but I am pretty certain um that this is Leah's final year swimming well she calls herself the Jackie Robison of swimming I'm not sure if I agree with that I call it I hardly disagree the William Thomas of William of swimming I think is what I would call her but hey Chris thank you so much for the time please keep reporting on this story I hope more women have the courage to speak out you know Caitlyn Jenner has even gone on the record that she thinks this is inappropriate and and and I really that's where I kind of stand on this like hey Bruce Jenner went out went out and won the decathlon as a man and then later transition she should go ahead and finish out her athletic career as a man and she wants to live the rest of her life as a woman no have at it but don't take this unfair advantage in the female sports and and really just like you've been pointing out make it unfair for everybody else in the pool just so you can have your little personal happiness go over there and compete against men that's what God gave me the equipment to do you were doing it at a relatively high level Ivy League you know swimming I certainly couldn't have done it uh so anyway thank you Chris I

invite the Korean co-sell Steve Kim Shamika Michelle and TJ Moul into the conversation next that is Michael Sohler who's in that I'm back to feed you that's what you want people welcome back let's continue the conversation about Leah Thomas we're going to be joined by Steve Kim out in Los Angeles Shamika Michelle TJ Moul in studio here with me uh Steve I want to congratulate ESPN they finally joined the conversation I don't know if you saw this but they published a story yesterday about transgender athletes and how the NCA NCAA basically is going to let the individual sports make up their own minds on how to handle this and so that gave ESPN the excuse to write about it and to mention what was going on with Leah Thomas I don't know if you say it's an ESPNW writer by the name of Katie Baker who is also a transgender person I'm not sure what her name was previously but uh I'm I'm gonna stay between the white lines and I say anything uh but her name now is Katie Baker and I just want to start here Steve with you just because you know you're my resident ESPN critic you're my I'm Bonnie your Clyde or your Clyde I'm Bonnie it wasn't Bonnie was a girl your Bonnie I'm Clyde uh anyway uh I want to start here do you think a transgender person is perhaps too invested in the topic to be the lead news reporter on a story like this well first of all what a beautiful panel on the four boxes we got the rainbow coalition going on here this now this is diversity and inclusion on the fearless I feel this is a look at all the demographics oh my we're checking every box well okay so I saw the thing and this young lady did a fine job of cutting and pasting it seemed like the press release you know you can make an argument that she has the most knowledge of this and perhaps being invested into the story gives you greater knowledge because let's be honest about this case and we've talked about this for a couple of months that no one wanted to touch this hot potato because maybe it's out of ignorance maybe they didn't want the blowback they didn't want any of the heat and my question to her would be what took you so long and were you kept from writing about the story if you wanted to what I find really interesting is that Michael Eaves was doing some I he was doing some world-class grandstanding and virtue signaling talking about how women need more opportunity and sports and people are like Leah Thomas and he kept going and going and people are like Leah Thomas and I'm like Michael talk about that because that plays right into the issue that you're trying to white knight yourself so I guess the floodgates are open if you will but I just wonder though if this announcement and basically saying hey for every sports now this has become states right you make up your own mind if this is now an open and shut case in terms of a story for most of the mainstream news networks I'm going to answer the question I asked you I just if if Katie Baker a transgender person is going to be the lead person on this topic how likely is it going to be that we're going to hear dissenting voices how aggressively is she trying to track down University of Pennsylvania women swimmers who are objecting to this or other swimmers in Ivy League who are objecting to this or let's say I start spreading to other sports which it likely will it can Katie Baker and again the same question could be asked about uh black me covering Colin Kaepernick or some racial issue in sports and my two invested in it to be objective and go report out the other side these are all fair questions and I guess Katie Baker would argue like you know if if Maria Taylor's her loan qualification to uh old pine about race is that she's black then you know I'm qualified to I'm the most qualified person perhaps to talk about this transgender issue because I'm transgender and everybody else must bow and and and bow to my wisdom and perspective and opinion uh so I'm throwing that hot potato back at you one more time well is it fair is it the right thing to do I look I would let her give her a shot to say can you cover this fairly but I know something from being at the worldwide leader they let you cover as a writer or a journalist what they allow you to there are many times I wanted to cover certain things certain subjects certain topics as either the editor or the deputy editor will either give you the green light or they will kibosh it and I always got the sense and perhaps it's more than just my natural base instinct is that if this story fits our approved agenda will let you if it doesn't we simply won't because here's what I thought what the problem was with the leat Thomas story was is that for so many years you kept saying that women and men are equal athletically that we're going to champion the cause of Megan Rapinoe and the u.s. world cup soccer team even though they couldn't beat a teenage club soccer team and come within five or six goals the problem was that as you saw lea thomas just dominate and become the modern day mark spits it just like it blew away that narrative and we talked about this couple of months ago Jason as he first burst onto the scene or excuse me she burst onto the scene you're thinking okay this has to be some sort of story when you're talking about transgender rights female sports and overall competition espnw they did not cover that story with one single word and so I think it became very problematic as this athlete this particular athlete became simply too dominant and really hurt the cause of anyone that says that women and men are actually equal when it comes to athletics all right so there is another expert on this topic Caitlyn Jenner I believe we have a sound bite from Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner Olympic athlete as Bruce Jenner now living a life is Caitlyn Jenner I don't think Caitlyn Jenner is in support of transitioning females or male to females competing against women let's hear from Caitlyn Jenner well first of all number one biological boys I've said from the beginning should not be playing in women's sports we need to protect women's sports obviously this is about lea thomas who has brought a lot of attention to to this issue first of all I respect her decision to live her life authentically 100% and but it also comes with responsibility and some integrity I don't know why she's doing this she's for two reasons one it's not good for the trans community I mean we have a lot of issues in the trans community that are very difficult and very challenging we have a suicide rate that's nine times higher than the general public we but it's also not good for women's sports it's unfortunate that this is happening I don't know why she's doing it she knows when she's swimming she's beating the competition by two laps she was born a biological boy she was raised as a biological boy her cardiovascular system is bigger her respiratory system is bigger her hands are bigger she can swim faster that's a known all of this woke world that we're living in right now is not working I feel sorry for the other athletes that are out there especially a pen or anybody she's competing against because in the woke world you got to say oh my gosh this is great and on and on and on no it's not we need to protect women's sports yes uh Caitlyn Jenner just answered my question if a transgender person could be objective about this because she she certainly sounds very objective your false tj on Caitlyn Jenner's thoughts Caitlyn is a um is a I think registered republican in uh in California and tried to run in the gubernatorial uh recall there so with her stance his stance has been the same on this and and I've actually heard this for a few years where uh Caitlyn came out and said look there are differences so I want to go look up some of those differences between men and women because we have this discussion and I hate but being put in the place where it makes guys like you and me feel like we are just telling women they're terrible at everything because they are telling us we're just as good as you and we're like you're really not but so I would like something to back that up so on average women have 25% body fat men are 15 so we start there I mean it's like if you're trying to run out liar and have a go ahead oh there you go men are five inches dollar men are five inches dollar according to scott fairgrave you wrote a book forensic osteolurgical analysis you can determine the biological sex of an adult skeleton by measuring their hips with 95 accuracy women in their hips are built for childbirth they're wider they're shorter you and I while I don't know that either one of us are great at this are built for locomotion truly we are hunter always telling us the motion the ocean there you go the size of the boat obviously in that for years our hips are longer and and they are built specifically for us to run fast because that's what we have have been doing right so we have uh 66% more upper body strength muscle mass than women 50% more lower body muscle mass and then the atlantic which I don't know if you've spent much time reading the atlantic I have not but I know they lean pretty heavy to the left they set out and did some research to say hey women are catching up to men right and they went and looked up all the world records they were very disappointed in 2012 and they discovered that women the world record of women are 90% only 90% of what men are men with at their top go 10% lower than that and that's where the world record of women are across the board and this was running skating swimming cycling kayaking rowing it's across the board and nearly everything they were stunned guys like you and I were not stunned because we've been paying attention so the last thing Delano Delano said this to you a few weeks ago when he was talking about because he said you know high school kid every year will beat the women's world record in in the 100 meter dash so Florence Griffith Joyner 1988 10.49 100 meter dash that that is the world record I looked it up worldathletics.org 6,063 men have beaten that time so it's like that there are a ton of men across the world who have beaten the best woman to ever live who set a record that is now 35 years old so it's like I'm just naming stats here you don't need to listen to me knock down women and say they're not good they're not I'm telling you men there are 6,000 men who can run faster than the fastest woman that has ever existed let's not put them in the same race totally I mean makes totally sense to me but last but not least let's hear from a lady although I guess we did hear from Caitlyn Jenner but let's see let's hear from an attractive lady I don't know why it's so hard for us to draw the line in the sand on this because at first glance there are obvious differences between men and women secondly when TJ was running down these biological differences I think you forgot to say that William has an extra fan when it comes to swimming it's really not fair and the NCAA board of governors chairs said that the athlete should compete in an inclusive fair safe and respectful environment as a parent of a child who played organized basketball from nine years old to through 12th grade you cannot say inclusive and fair and safe when you're talking about putting females and males in the same competition I watched boys basketball I watched my daughter play basketball they are not the same so if you would have put her in a game with boys even at the same age it would not have been a safe environment for her so I don't know why everyone is tip toeing around this men and women are different and it's okay but you can't say that it's inclusive and fair safe and respectful that's just disrespectful to even put young girls or girls period women period in the same type of arena with a man it's not going to be safe is there any way to get this toothpaste back in the bottle I mean we're having the discussion I think most people agree with our point of view but is there any way will we ever go back to normal or is this just a lost cause and we're just arguing about something that's irrelevant men who feel like women and take a few supplements and perhaps go through some surgery are going to be allowed to compete against girls and women there was a uh gal pole go ahead go ahead go ahead go ahead go ahead gim why is this I spoke to go ahead gim make up your mind gim tj it's you take the ball take the ball I'm waiting okay okay Delano I spoke to Delano on Tuesday about this there was a gal pole it was done in December of this past year we're just a month and a half out from this thing it turns out most people agree with us 62 percent of people believe trans athletes should play on the teams that match their birth gender so there's a ton of people that agree with us turns out way more men think this than women though 72 percent of men only 53 percent of women so our problem here is cowardly went cowardly men and over empathetic women and this this is an issue in general and we talk about women in leadership if you're always looking to be empathetic towards the outlier how can you ever make good policy for the for the whole I don't think you can't can't make it for the majority to uh uh Steve I'm gonna get to you next but I'm gonna go to shimika again because I want overly empathetic women and just oh let's make everybody happy and and now I think we see men joint thinking that that there's an advantage to that and that's the superior person leans into empathy and uh tries to make everything satisfying for everybody how come you're not how come you don't have that mindset because I'm one of the special women it's only a few of us but I totally agree and I've been saying that I feel like women are ruining society because they want to make everybody sissis what's you know just they want everybody to be sweet and loving and kind and you cannot do that and have a well or machine as a society you just can't do it and when we talk about the men when they say they want to test the testosterone of the athletes we need to test the testosterone of these men making decisions because it really seems as if they are little little boys little baby boys whose balls haven't dropped because how can you just not put your foot down and put these women in their place these beta males in their place and these confused in betweens you could get them a whole different circle if you want to but somebody needs to tell them this is foolishness and we cannot continue to go on like this so I totally agree women women are ruining it Steve now the floor is ruined yeah a couple things about the toothpaste being put back into the tube I think the ruling is a small step but as you said it's going to take strong leadership to actually say hey this is not right and to make a point here it is about the hardware what you're born with is what you are for instance if you take a bcr and look at my background trust me I know a lot about the bcr I could add a few parts on it it doesn't make it a smartphone and so it's really that simple and to go to TJ's point about the disparate numbers at the world class level or even the recreational level between males and females there's no doubt that there's a difference but what I point that I want to make is and you made this earlier Jason about how Caitlin Jenner made the decision to become a world class athlete as a male then decided the rest of her life hey I want to live my particular truth I want to transition into being Caitlin that is certainly something that I respect not a big deal doesn't bother me but here's the issue to me and no one's ever brought this up in my view is that transitioning into a different sex is your right isn't playing sports just really a harder and privileged and when you start getting into sports it is about fair play and letting and having equal boundaries and a level playing field I think we should be allowed to set the line in a certain period of time and sports and to say hey listen you're allowed to transition but if you do as a male athlete you're simply not going to be allowed to play a female sport I don't understand why that is such a hard decision to actually come down on I don't understand why people other than we've just gone overboard and maybe maybe it's what I'd like about women as well in terms because and I'm on a cracker joke but I'm actually trying to somewhat be serious and serious I feel like Idris Elba or Denzel Washington most days I feel like that most people don't treat me like that and I accept that and deal with it however I have been able to convince a few women that I am Idris Elba or Denzel Washington and and they fall for the gimmick at least for a time period a year or two maybe three or five I had one fall for four for five years and so I guess I like that about women that they can be convinced of almost anything that I'm Denzel Washington and that I guess you know if someone feels like they're a woman that they they're using women to get the rest of society to go along with that charade but but in a on a more serious serious note and I am being somewhat serious even with those jokes we just can't have a society based on feelings it just it will not work because most of us feel a lot of dumb inaccurate things I'm sure there were times on the football field TJ where you felt like Randy Moss for a brief moment but that defensive coordinator would say Randy Moss he didn't change the coverage because you felt like Randy Moss it's like no this is five foot eleven white guy that runs pretty well but he ain't ran from the house no the only time I was ever three yards ahead of anybody's if they blew a coverage that's the truth to that you can make an argument here and I think a strong one if we if we are to believe our opponent has any uh IQ that attacking the patriarchy was in order to get women in charge because they knew that they would be easier to manipulate with empathy and so they could then give what they want by trying to play the victim get men out of the way because they don't care too much about our feelings they they are gonna look at the facts and they say I don't feel bad for you I got a I got a show to run or I've got a military to run I don't feel bad for you we got stuff to do women do feel bad for you which is why they're unbelievable mothers you know I didn't go to my dad when I needed somebody to feel bad for me I went to my mom and mom was able to to nurse me back to life and we got there and when I needed somebody to say hey son suck it up I went to my dad and so there's there's a place for both but you could make I think a pretty strong argument that you attacked the patriarchy specifically to manipulate women who then you have just put placed in power to get what you want I think if we continue down this road there will not be a single record in the next 10 years that will be held on the women's side by a biological woman I agree with TJ because actually Jason with your height and being over six feet you're real swagalicious you got the trip in your ears you know let me tell you what let me tell you so you say my height keep it real Jason when you're standing on your W-2's in your bank account when I'm sitting behind the wheel of your AMG you might be six five six six how you know I was right through town like oh my god all right let me tell you about another one of our

And we're going to talk about that Golden State Warriors owner that said he doesn't care about the Uighurs. I can't say the owner's name. I think the first name is Shama. This last name is really hard. Paula Hapatea. Might be right. Paula Hapatea. That's Shama Thalwa-Papatea. That's what we're going to talk about. Royce White. Next. All right. Welcome back. Time to roll out to Minneapolis and bring in former NBA first round draft pick Royce White, friend of the show, FEAR OF THE SOLDIER on a topic that Royce loves to talk about. The human rights abuses in China as it relates to the Uighurs and Golden State Warriors minority owner owns about 10-15% of the Warriors. Chama Thalwa-Papatea, I believe is his name. Made some very interesting, transparent comments about the NBA's position on the Uighurs and why the NBA is so silent on China. Let's take a look at what Chama said. Then we'll bring Royce in and TJ and I'll have a discussion with Royce about it. That was me. Nobody cares about what's happening to the Uighurs. Okay. You bring it up because you really care. And I think that's nice that you care. What do you mean, nobody cares? The rest of us don't care. I'm just very hard. You're saying you very very don't care? I'm telling you a very hard, ugly truth. Okay. Of all the things that I care about, yes, it is below my line. He articulated what the NBA had been saying very loudly with its silence, with his treatment of Darryl Moray when he was the general manager of the Houston Rockets. Royce, I'm going to let you get us rolling here. Are you surprised? And I do want to add that Chama did, after catching a bunch of heat, did issue a weak apology. But Royce, are you surprised that he was this comfortable stating that opinion? It's not surprising at all. Some of the other things that he said during the conversation, I think, indicate where his worldview is in terms of social responsibility, if you want to call it. One of the glaring comments was, human rights are a luxury belief. And there's just a crisis of leadership worldwide. And we have to be ever mindful of these 40 year old Cosmopolitan, omnisectual, atheist billionaires. These people are the corporatocracy. These people are the oligarchs that want to bring about an authoritarian society. And yeah, I'm sure the Uighurs don't matter to him. The question is, how big are the implications of a statement like that, especially as it pertains to the NBA, which is a representative of a global corporate community. Go ahead and expound on what the implications are. Well, I think the implications become, you know, the implications from that comment are one thing, but there are other implications from some of the other things he said that I feel are even more important. You know, one of them was, we only are concerned about China for their economic weight and climate change. Well, that's just an affirmation of China, really. He's just affirming the CCP and what he's doing is justifying the continued quid pro quo between the New World Order and the CCP. But the really sneaky one, the triple cross here, that, you know, that's the double cross, the triple cross here is, well, we are concerned about Taiwan. Well, you're not concerned about Taiwan for the human rights of the Taiwanese people because that's what's already happened to the Uighurs. They're concerned about the microchips and, you know, the computer chips there in Taiwan, which explicitly has to do with his industry, his little sliver of this New World Order agenda. So all of it is a double cross and a triple cross. But what is clear is that human rights is an afterthought and what we see is promoted as a human rights agenda from a neoliberal globalist machine. Well, it's one of the things you said that I think is so accurate. It's a reflection and it's a mindset of a person who, to me, is an atheist. And once you start, once you don't believe in God, eventually you're going to believe that you are God. And he gets to decide based on his taste who's worthy of human rights, who's not worthy of human rights. And since he's a billionaire, he feels like, you know, I got enough money to buy my human rights. And human rights are a luxury for everyone else. And we get to decide who gets those luxuries. I'm a billionaire out in Northern California. And so we've decided that the LGBTQ community is worthy of human rights. And so he said, no one cares about the Uighurs. If the Uighurs, if something in China was happening in mass to a group of LGBTQ people, he would have an opinion on it. He would think they're worthy of human rights because those are the values reflected in his atheist worldview, in his secular worldview, from Northern California. And what I find comical, sad, and dangerous are there's a lot of people, LeBron James, but take LeBron out of just normal people that will hear his comments and agree and say, you know what, who doesn't really care about the Uighurs, and they really agree. They have no idea that Chamath, Halahe, Patir, whatever his name is, one day he will be talking about them and that they not being worthy of human rights. That same bazooka he fired at the Uighurs, he'll one day turn it just a little bit. And these same people that are agreeing with him, they're going to be facing that bazooka. And again, that's, I just go back to why faith is important and why this country having a Christian culture was important, is important, and we've lost that. And to me, what's really frightening is that someone with that much wealth, that much influence felt that comfortable sitting in America, expressing those values, that, we used to have a quote where people felt like that, but they would be too afraid to say that out loud. Him saying that out loud lets you know where he thinks the culture is, that it's now okay to feel this way and believe this way, that's what scares me. Well, and I think, you know, you're 100% right. You know, actually, for me, when I heard it, you know, saying that nobody cares about what's happening to the Uighurs is the equivalent of saying nobody cares what happened to Jews, or nobody cares what happened to Negroes. And all three of those comments are despicable. They're disgusting. And he said it in front of the right people, and often these people do say those type of comments in front of the right people, because if he had said he'd nobody cares about the Uighurs genocide in front of me out of slap the taste out of his mouth, because it is like saying nobody cares what happened to the Jews or the Negroes. And you know, there's a lot of geopolitical posture in what he said, right? He says, well, you know, we need to be more concerned about what's taking place inside our own borders. That movement doesn't believe in borders, and they certainly don't believe in American borders. You know, that he's saying it has a pure deflection to be able to justify their look away from China, because China is the ultimate engine that this new world order sees to usher in a complacency with authoritarianism. And you know, people like LeBron James and many of these fake woke public figures or athletes really don't have a good sense of the geopolitical situation in the general sense, which is why everybody, which is part of the reason why people have bent the knee to this pro China wave in the first place. But as I always say, part of them been to the knee also is they're not looking either. The responsibility is on each one of us to understand what we've involved ourselves and what deals we've done, which what hands we've shaken on behalf of the person next to her and my my brother's keeper, and make no mistake about it. You know, we can talk about all these minority groups, whether it's LGBTQ, whether it's women, whether it's black people, Latinos, whoever you want to talk about, the people who are in the firing line right now in our society is Christians. So yeah, that seems clear to me. The next roundup is going to be Christians. 1000% agree. I want to go another cut, get your reaction to this. If he had taken the we off and placed it with me, because that's really what he was saying. He, he, Uighurs, but he really meant to start with a knee. He don't care about those Uighurs over there in China. His comments stated publicly for public consumption are 10,000 times worse than what Donald Sterling said to his mistress in private. They ran Donald Sterling out of the league over some inappropriate comments to his mistress in private related to Magic Johnson and whether or not she had ever tasted the chocolate thunder or whatever. They ran Donald Sterling out of the league over some private comments that weren't nearly in my opinion as reprehensible as what this man just said. And there will not be one NBA player who matters, one NBA player who beat his chest. If we ran Donald Sterling out of the league, at our league, is this an Adam Silver's not going to make a move against this guy? And it lets you know what they really think and how they really feel. Donald Sterling was a convenient little target that they wanted to move out. He was an embarrassment to the league for many, many years. And they used that excuse to run him out and make themselves look good. But here's a man standing out in front of the world on a podcast wanting everybody. This is how human rights are a luxury and the niegers and the Uighurs over in China, they ain't worthy. And tomorrow I'm going to decide on the next group that's not worthy. I just I'm just sitting here the NBA they'll run commercials for the rest of the year about how woke and they're on the right side of history and they're for social justice. But when something real actually happens in their league, crickets. Well, I got to give you a little bit of pushback here about Donald Sterling. I agree with you and I understand what you're saying about the fact that there will be a deafening silence from the establishment when it comes to these comments, especially in terms of any any real substantive action against this this minority owner or any call for the majority owners to take a position as well or the NBA take a position now that the now that the situation there in Xi Xiong has been brought right to their doorstep, which you know, they've been silent this whole time in large part. But I think under normal circumstances, this type of comment would force them to at least take some type of public position, which I think they'll be slow to do. However, people have to go back and read what Donald Sterling said in those transcripts. I think what Donald Sterling said might have been the most disgusting comment made in the color television era, right? And it wasn't about whether or not he liked Magic Johnson because he was black or not. The most damning comments from Donald Sterling were in Israel. The black Jews are treated like dogs. Okay, that was the buried lead in the transcripts. And when she went to ask him further about his comments and she tried to equate slavery and what black people have been through with what Jewish people have been through in that dialogue between them, he scoffed at her. He said, are you kidding me? There's no comparison for what Jewish people have been through and what black people have been through. And she goes, well, you know, like black people had faced oppression too. And you know, what about the black people in Israel? Are they less than the white people in Israel? And he said, yeah, 50% less. That's all in the transcripts. And that's that's 100% documented. And I think what's telling about that situation is that it was a buried lead that a mainstream media establishment did not want to bring or shed any light on comments that that asked a bigger question about Jewish supremacy. And we talked about it a week back. And they did bury that lead and they manipulated the lead and they made the lead be well, he doesn't like Magic Johnson or he has a problem with black people being at his game. But that's not what Donald Sterling was saying. What Donald Sterling was doing was telling his side piece that he had a network that was calling him and giving him flack about who she chose to associate with in public. And ultimately, when they got in the fight about that conversation, you know, about those things, he came right out and said, even in Israel, black is black, white is white, and even in Israel, monks Jews, the black Jews are treated like dogs. Now, they got him out as a quid pro quo with the players such as Chris Paul. So they didn't have to do a full scope investigation, independent investigation into what his comments implicated or wrapped through the rest of the ownership. That's why they got rid of Donald Sterling. That was a cover for themselves. Then being quiet about Chamez is a quid pro quo with China. So it's different, but both part of the same shady, chameleonic politics for sure. Don't disagree with your take. The only thing I would say is, I can only talk about me, only talk about my father, people I know, in private, some really stupid things get said. And most human beings are willing to distinguish between, yeah, I may have said some dumb stuff and I may, because I've been crystal clear with everybody. When I was in college, I used to get that fair con final call and cassette tape of his latest speech shipment. I got it once a month, you know, I was a subscriber. And so, you know, I had some private conversations and a gout went to the million man march and blah, blah, a lot of things I'm saying, there's a lot of things that people think that they don't believe. And people have a lot of inappropriate thoughts. And again, I'm not, I don't want to micro, I can only imagine what an old wealthy person like Donald Sterling thought and those private comments probably are an indication of what he believed and he was sharing an observation. But we all in my view, I know me said a lot of things in private that, you know, sound good in the moment in reality. I knew they were stupid and inappropriate and luckily by the grace of God, I've been allowed to evolve and mature. But to me, for this guy to be in a public setting, knowing his word to being recorded, knowing they're going to be disseminated to the public, it's a disgrace. TJ, I want you to hop in here and I'm going to circle back to you, boys. Well, I love how everybody, these types especially who want to call it human rights. And then as soon as you get outside of our own borders, they're not humans anymore. I mean, last we checked, the Uighurs were still humans. And the, in the UK, there was an, the Independent Tribunal came out and they labeled this a deliberate systemic and concerted policy to bring about long-term reduction of Uighurs and other minority populations. The French Parliament came out today and called it genocide. So we're getting to the place where people are acknowledging this. This was obviously a big part of history when this type of thing were happening with the Holocaust and such. You know, it's, I actually, his general premise, I don't have a huge problem with his follow-up. I do because I think he's a huge hypocrite. But the general idea that you should get your house together before you try to go fix somebody else's house, I think is a good idea. The problem is, why are you, if you're going to only pick a single issue and tell everybody else they need to care about it and then ignore the issues that other people bring to you, there's not a bigger hypocrite. You could, you're riding Black Lives Matter on your court. You're taking t-shirts and giving them out to everybody. I can't breathe t-shirts, right? That is his issue, the issue that he cares most about. There's a lot of terrible things happening in America. Nobody discusses child trafficking at all. And it happened, you go out to Arizona. The Super Bowl every year is like the biggest child trafficking weekend period. They had Super Bowl in Arizona a few years ago and they were like, look out, do not bring your kids because someone's going to try to steal them and sell them into sex slavery. There's a lot of terrible things going on. And even within our own walls. So my biggest issue with him is that he has decided that his issue matters and it should matter to you, but other people's issues shouldn't matter to him. They're below his line. I totally agree with that. That's a bit, you can't dictate what some people are passionate about. People are passionate about issues that impact them personally. I'm passionate about weight loss. TJ is not as passionate about it. It's not his issue. And one of the reasons why I'm not as passionate about George Floyd as others are, is because I don't do drugs when the police pull me over. I'm as respectful as if I'm talking to a minister. I don't anticipate me having the problem George Floyd had with Derek Chauvin because of I don't do drugs and I comply with what the police say. So I'm just, and so when I hear people that are maybe Thomas, maybe he doesn't comply with police. Maybe he does, I don't know, but he's passionate about that issue probably because it does him serve him well over social media and it's part of NBA branding. But yeah, this whole thing about, hey, the things I'm passionate about to be a good person, you must be passionate about. And TJ, I think makes an excellent point. Child trafficking, it's worse than what happened to George Floyd. And I know people would disagree with it. Well, if you may disagree with it, but I don't see George Floyd as an innocent victim. I see him as a victim, but not an innocent one. And I see kids caught up in child trafficking. Those are innocent victims. So anyway, once I'm going to give you the final word, have at it. Well, yeah, I would agree that child trafficking is a worse situation than George Floyd number one. But to TJ's point, and obviously, I've been public in saying that I'm very in support of a populist movement of an America first movement going forward, at least until we do get our house in order. But here's the sleight of hand with what Chomet was saying. They don't believe in America first. So his get your own house in order is not a call for us to be America first. What he's trying to do it. And this is what maybe frustrates me the most with that type of comment. See, we of course, we have a military industrial complex that has indulged in war profiteering in forever wars for a long time. But that isn't to say that America shouldn't be involved in any geopolitical conflicts, or that we should involve ourselves around the world. It's to say that we should involve ourselves around the world for the right reasons at the right times. And so maybe the freedom of the Uyghurs doesn't rely on us going into China forcibly to remove them. But there's certainly the possibility that we bring down economic stipulations on China to show them that we disagree with the way they have treated the Uyghurs. And Chomet isn't for that at all. His premise, Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, the rest of the five eyes, the entire West premise is that we have to deal with China. And the excuse that they're making right now is climate change. So he's not worried about America first in any regard when he says we need to take care of our own house, because our own house is in shambles. And he's a, he's a pro, a promulgator of that. He is a part of this pro, church, the church of LGBTQ, atheist, low moral standard, moral relativism movement. So I completely reject his notion that we should be America first, because I know he doesn't really believe in it, just like he doesn't believe in America. Royce, I want you to expound, because I think you just said something interesting that I want you to clarify for me and the audience, because I don't think I've heard that before. And it sounds like it's kind of common knowledge the way you just threw it out there. But you just insinuated they're using climate change as an excuse to play nice with China. And it's real. And that's part of a shale game that's going on. Oh, because of climate change, we got to put up with China's bullshit, basically. Oh, of course. Well, look, the three headed Cerberus of the neoliberal agenda was one race and race identity, right? Those are the one the first game played, then second game was COVID, and the third game is going to be climbing, right? It's one that they got started on 10, 20 years ago. But but the real push forward is going to come to fruition. And the whole excuse with China is it's just it's absurd in its premise. Number one, we all know that China is the biggest polluter in the entire world, okay, but by an order of magnitude, more than many other countries combined, okay, and there's no way that these bodies that chamat is saying should be alerting us about the Uyghur genocide are going to be able to bring any real pressure down on China. Nor do we nor do it doesn't seem that they really want to. They just have a wink and nod that in order for us to maintain our position in the West with this moral virtue signal, we have to tell the people of the West that we're concerned about the climate. And if we're going to do that, we have to say publicly that we're working with China to bring their emissions down. But in reality, in reality, the wink and nod is we know China's going to continue to do what they want because we don't have the backbone to really try and stop them. And we want to ride the economic tidal wave, that is the new East India trading company, which is what China has become. So the climate change thing is actually is going to, it's going to be the next hatchet to get buried on the American people in terms of tyranny. Watch when the carbon tax comes, they want to do it. They're saying it. They're not this, this isn't hidden. This is right out in the open. You are going to become the next danger to the world because your carbon-based life form and everything that we do needs a certain, the lifestyle, the side we built, is built on certain energy sources. And it's going to be the way for them to tax you. And it's going to be the way to make the working class in the middle class and the poor people pay for the elitist pipe dream. It's a scam. This guy's a scumbag. And the scam is absolutely right out in the open. They're going to keep finding ways to pull to tax poor middle class people for all of their authoritarian pipe dreams where they want to build a new society and pick who gets to come. Royce, good job again. Anytime you make me lean my head back and think, you've done a good job. I may not leave this position for the rest of the day. So I'm going to let you go. We're going to go to break. Uncle Jimmy's going to be here next and he'll give us approval rating on Chaima with whatever his last name is.

All right, let's transition into my favorite, say one of the show, where Jimmy tries to convince me that I didn't do an awesome, fabulous, spectacular job to be, Jimmy's works cut out for me today. I was tremendous. I'm sure you agree. Jason, that was the most wonderful and insightful monologue you have ever done today. I said, you got my notes I see. I've scripted this segment now. Continue to read. Don't say nothing else. You know what I got to say? I'm gonna be rarely am I overshadowed. But that's the truth. Shemae could try to overshadow me today. Do you know how? Yeah, I don't think you know how. Yeah, Jason, I don't think you saw what Shemae can do to you today. I did see it. You saw that Sharon Stone thing she did. I saw you as professional about. Absolutely. You know who saved your show? Oh, you'll produce them back there, Chris. Well, did you see what Chris did? Can we roll that tape real quick? Can we see what Shemae can do there? Look at it. Look at it. Look at it. You see Chris Stone that up there right there. You see Chris Stone that up right there? Good looking Chris. I still got Charles in poor pain was good looking. Shemae. Oh my goodness. See, I honestly, I think Shemaeka is a Russian plant. Well, okay, I'm thinking about the Russian on the Sopranos. Yeah, I think she's a Russian plant to get this show overthrown. And so that's when she's on set in Nashville, I just go into a zone. I go into where nothing matters. Doesn't matter what she does, what she wears, what she looks like. I'm all good. Jason, Shemaeka adds a completely new meaning to the term working the room. Honestly, man, I have a newfound respect for and she made me a little nervous. But she was talking about the transition and swim. She said, that's because he got an extra and then she said, fiend. I didn't know, You know, Shemaeka scared you when she get going. I then I thought about him like, that's probably why he transitioned because his fiend was probably smaller than everybody else's. That's all it's take. I want the transition. Okay, stop, man. You know, I love being the punchline of my own joke, but there you go. Anybody else you got? I like you got Chris. What was his name? The first guy? Apollo. Yeah, Chris. I loved him, man. What do you say? Bitter people making up things that they can't prove? Yeah. I love that. Now, I will say this, and I don't know if it was depression or what, but you couldn't see how bad he was sweating, good you. I could not see that. And I wish I had because I would have offered him some sweat block. Exactly. God, I'm gonna tell you, he just knew we're sweating like one of my baby's mamas on Sunday school, man. One of your baby mamas had a child support here. Well, we know who that was. Hey, man, Steve Kim. Can we clear the air real quick? What's up? Is it safe to say Steve Kim is the teacher's pet? You just say this, Steve, I'm just asking straight up. Let's clear the air, Jaydah. Hey, Jay. Steve Kim, the teacher's pet. Yeah. How can you say that? DJ, how come Steve Kim ain't here? Huh? Shameka here. Delana, welcome Steve Kim didn't have to get it. Tickets from Korea can't be that much. He's not the, if there's a teacher's pet, it's Shameka that, you know, blew up my plan. Like, you know, I like to be in bed by 5 p.m. And Shameka's like, where are you taking us to dinner? I got to take three or four people to dinner, cost me a arm of the leg, and then I don't get to bed until the right side. What? Didn't cost you a fin. That's true. Hey, man, TJ Mo. TJ Mo is the dude that comes in here, man. He's far better. He looks far better in person than he does in TV. Oh, you think so? Oh, yeah. And I have come to the conclusion after these couple of days. TJ Mo is the voice of reason for this show. That's what he does. I can't wait for you to start doing your TJ Mo impersonation because I know you got to be working online. Well, I, oh, I do because I'm gonna tell you something about TJ Mo, you don't know what I'll tell you later. Oh, Hadley said TJ Mo got childbearing hips. That's why he didn't make it in the NFL. And he taking pot shots behind the scenes. He said, I'll tell you about TJ. Yeah, he is way couldn't make it. He like, I've never said, I didn't think people smoked in 2021. You know what kills me about him smoking? You do realize he smokes cools unfiltered, right? Yes. No, he would have, he would have been in at the masterpiece lounge. No, he bites the filter off. Hey, Jim, how you doing today? I'm fine, Mr. Adley. Yeah. Uh, Royce. Oh, yeah, Royce. Oh, you think I'm elite? I mean, can I honest the goodness? And I'm sick. Hey, me Royce scared me, man. Royce is Royce is intense. And do do to his intensity. He actually scared me because if he's in the studio like everybody up, I'm sorry, Jay. I got to call this sick. What you do, I'm gonna say, you know, I would say this, I haven't said this in front of Royce. I haven't started cracking jokes on Royce yet, but you know Royce lost his first MMA fight and why I ain't brought it up to him yet. I bet you're gonna bring it up when he in studio. Remember when he said he's gonna be the heavyweight champion? I didn't say that. Come here, we almost said something. Do you hear that new sponsor? We got Keeps. Yeah, I think Royce may need. Actually, I'm glad you brought that up. Hey, Corey, and Jason always swore that that was his real hair and he wasn't using nothing else on it. Yeah. Yeah. So I guess you say it to Keeps Work. You gonna keep sitting on. Come on, bud. Let's get going. All right. Let's do. Yeah, let's get out of here. Chamath, can you say the last name, Jim? Paula. Paula. I'm here. Uh, Chamavapalops. Yeah. The partial owner of the Golden State Warriors. He's our approval rating today. Job performance. I'm gonna go high on job performance. He's a woke warrior living out in the Bay Area and he's right on message being woke and fitting in with the Bay Area and the whole Golden State. Steve Kerr, I'm sure loves him. Uh, so I'll give him a 22 in job performance. The man is worth 1.2 billion dollars. He's on the Forbes list. Okay, I don't know. He ain't up there. I gave him a 25. I'm sorry, man. That kind of money you gotta give him the 25. Yeah. Character, I think he's low character to no character. He did issue an apology. That's why I gave him a two as a relates to character. When you, the man's worth 2 billion dollars and he apologized. You don't find too many billionaires to issue out apologies. I'm gonna give him credit for apologizing. And plus the third is to apologize on Gilligan's Island. Yeah, God. Look, man. Jesus. I was more of a Mary Ampers. Actually, I just always got that dude. I don't know. I kind of get him. This is how I could have got that work. This is Corey. Do we keep note Gilligan's Island? Oh, I'm sorry. Corey Corey's barely 18. Yeah, I don't got it. I still remember when Eddie Haskell used to come over there. Come on, man. Authenticity. I think he's pretty authentic. I mean, he's stuck it out there. So I'll give Chama a 23 in authenticity. I'm gonna give him a 25. Well, Chama's chama, he gives a whole new meaning to the term a he's what we call an authentic asshole. He's a rich jerk. Okay, that is true. It factor. I got him, you know, 21. He's worth a billion buck. I haven't got him at 12. He's worth a billion bucks. So I gotta give him some it factor. I give him a 21. Yeah. Okay. I mean, whatever that is, he got a whole lot of they put to you like this. Jason, that man is worth 2.1 billion. How did you say 1.2 billion? Well, 1.2 billion. Yeah. Your worth 1.2 million. And you don't care. So why the hell should he care? I hope I'm worth more than that. I better go check. You know what I mean? That's dude. Wait a minute. What did you say? I forgot. Oh, I forgot when I'm standing on my W two people think I'm a porn star. Jason Jeremy, that's Jason Jeremy and Jimmy Wadd coming to the studio near you. All right. Overall 50. Did we put up the overall score? Is Jimmy's got even blazing hot? I got him candle lit. That's good. You know, tomorrow texted me last night. I was very pleased about that. We texted back and forth. I think she's back speaking to me again. Oh, so the restraining order is off now? Yeah. It's only 30 days. It was only 30. It wasn't forever. It was just 30 days. Well, now I'm going to the what's that? What's that chicken coat? Chicken for the soul. Truffle chicken for everybody. Oh, truffle chicken. Yeah. All right. We'll see you tomorrow.
