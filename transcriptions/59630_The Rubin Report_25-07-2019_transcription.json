    "text": " Hey, I'm Dave Rubin and joining me on the Rubin Report this week is the host of Outkick the Coverage on Fox Sports Radio and the author of Republicans Wear Sneakers to End, one of the breast guests we've ever had on. Clay Travis, welcome back to the Rubin Report. I appreciate it's been, we were just talking before we started here, I came in October of 2017, so it's been almost two years since we hung out last time and I got great feedback when I was hanging out with you last time, I appreciate you're going to come on my new podcast as well during the same kind of time frame and the world may have just gone crazier, you know, we were hoping that maybe the world would go less crazy when we talked back in October of 2017 and it seems like things have just continued to spin wildly. That does fit well with my notes because the world has gotten crazier since then, yeah, it's been about a year and a half that I've been waiting to say that stupid breast joke that I've done on Twitter about a thousand times. But the thing that kind of put you on the map outside of the sports world, let's just recap that little nonsense because it does kind of capture sort of everything related to the media and outrage and all that, you dared to say that you like breasts on CNN. And the First Amendment, and I'm still banned by CNN, like you think about all the people that they've had on who've done all the crazy things that they have done. Yes, like, I mean, all of Michael Avenatti, who's been on, you know, and now is, you know, he's on hundreds of times and now he's, you know, under siege with all the different charges against him. But yeah, they banned me for that for saying the only two things in the world that, you know, I can believe did completely the First Amendment and boobs. And, well, look, it was good for me. The book, Republicans by Sneakers Two came out and it did really well bestseller and got a lot of attention back in September. I think the paperback's coming out. I know you're working on your own book right now. But I think it galvanized for many people. What I think typically happens, which is the absurdity of false outrage and what is and what cannot be said and what should and shouldn't be said, I think a lot of people are like you and I just kind of coming around on the idea that so much of, frankly, what goes on in this country today is total bullshit. It's just endless nonsense. Yes. And I'm glad you said something there about the what's happened to you since then. Yeah. Because I think a lot of people that care about what you do, that watch this show, that are paying attention to the culture war and all that, they still fear that the mob will destroy it. Yes. And what I've been trying to show people just through my own life every week that the New York Times calls me all right or just the next. Right, right, right, right, right. I'm like, you know, if you actually take a breath and don't lose your shit in the middle of it. Yes. You will most likely thrive after and I think you're an example of that. I think so. And I think you're right. There is this rush to apologize anytime someone criticizes you. Even if you're sticking to things that you have long said in your career, my radio show is thriving nationwide. We went over 300 affiliates. And one of the wild things I think that would surprise people is my show is dominating in a lot of different markets, right? Like our ratings in Los Angeles are up something like 400% in the past couple of years, right. And our numbers in Kansas City are up insanely on the East Coast. We have done insanely well in the South where I'm from in Nashville. We continue to do outstanding. The podcast numbers are booming. I started a television show daily on FS one called Lock it In, which is a focused on sports gambling, but we have a lot of fun on there. And I've continued to be as outspoken as I ever have. And what I have seen, I don't know about you, but is people get frustrated because they want to take you down. And when you stick to what you believe in, the benefit is a lot of people have your back. And they may not have your back in the same way publicly that you can, but I am a big and have long been in law school. I kind of have come to this as I got an older, a big believer in the marketplace of ideas. And if we're artificially constraining what people feel comfortable talking about, I think it leads to a lot of the angst that exists in our country today. And so particularly in the world of sports, there are so many guys and girls out there who regularly slide into my DMs and say, I 100% agree with everything that you say, but because of how I'm employed or who employs me, I don't feel comfortable getting out on the battlefield like you do, but keep doing exactly what you're doing.

Does that type of person, though, drive you crazier than the person that doesn't contact you, that just remains quiet? Because it's like, you're not Jesus. You're just doing your thing, right? Like I'm just a guy doing my thing. And then when I get these messages from often people that are more popular than I am more famous than I am, have more money than I am, and they're subtly like, yeah, keep doing it. Well, I'm doing what I think is right, but like, you know, what do you get in this, too? Like get some skin in the game. It's an interesting question. I think what protected me early on was I started my own site Outkick and Outkick the coverage initially is just writing. Now we do a lot of videos now. Obviously, it's a lot of audio as well. In fact, we do more video and audio than we do writing almost now. And once I started to produce a revenue and realize, and I think you probably have gotten there, too, you can take a breath and be like, okay, I'm never going to go hungry, right? I think anybody who tries to get into media and especially early on when I left the practice of law, my first question was, oh my God, is my family going to start to death, right? Am I going to have to abandon my media career to go back to practicing law? And it's hard to get over that, right? Because I still have those worries sometimes. That fear is always in the back of your mind because we live in this cancel culture that somebody wants to believe they're going to cancel you. So it's, I guess I wish that there were more people who wanted to speak out. But if you're employed solely by a major corporation today, I totally understand the fear of I got kids, you know, I got a mortgage payment. I got my kids college funds that I'm worried about and everything else. And frankly, the way I think about it, too, is that leaves me a huge area to own, right? Where there are a lot of people who may agree with me, which proves the audience responds to it. But others are afraid to say what I'm saying, even if they agree with it, which to me, you know, from a pure business perspective, I'm like, well, I'll just keep rolling, right? I mean, what do you think it is about some people that are willing to kind of walk into that thing? Yeah. Because people will say that to me all the time, though. They always say that I'm brave. Yeah. I'm always like, it's not saying I think about it. I'm just doing what I think is right. That's it. That's a great line because when I was a kid growing up, my favorite quote was from Davy Crockett and Davy Crockett's most famous quote, and I think still is, although who knows, be sure you're right. It's got some new stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so by the time I come out with an opinion, I have worked through every permutation of that opinion. You know, like if I give an opinion and somebody immediately responds on Twitter, well, did you think about X, which always happens? Yeah. Yeah. And in fact, we do on the radio show sometimes we'll do a segment where I will flip and start arguing the other side. And I think that's the lawyer training in me. But by the time I go out with an opinion, I'm not just shooting off at the lip. Like I have kind of in my head worked through every different angle of an argument. And once I'm convinced that my opinion is right, I'm comfortable putting it out there. Now, here's the other thing. If you think I'm wrong, it doesn't bother me. Yeah. Right? Like I almost think, I remember when there was the argument over Bush of Igor and the two sides of that argument, I think David Boyce had Al Gore and the other side, I'm forgetting the guy that Ted Olson, I believe was the other side. And they argued as hard as they could in front of the Supreme Court. And then I think they shook hands afterwards and may have gone out for a beer because they knew that it wasn't then in their hands. The Supreme Court had the decision to make. Each of them had made the argument for their side as good as they possibly can. And that's kind of the era that I wish we could go back to where we could disagree in the old school Senate, but you could have a situation where Orrin Hatch and Ted Kennedy are really good friends. And that's kind of what drove me crazy about this whole Joe Biden flare up, right? The segregationist comment. Just because you work with someone doesn't mean you agree with everything that they've ever said. And this idea that you have to be a constant war with someone is just something that I repudiate and reject. Is it even worse than that in that it's really a war with the past? Yeah. When they get up there and they say, well Biden, you talk to these people because he's actually got a 40-year record. Yeah. Doesn't mean he loved everybody. And we don't even have to get into the minutiae of what he said or the people's hands. He shook or any of that. But it's actually in a ratio of the past. Yes. And magically, go like that and hope, oh, okay, everything's great. We're in 2019. We're all evolved and perfect, which is so ridiculous. Yeah. I always like to say because I'm a big history guy, right? And the Confederate statue debate and everything else. We live in an era where we believe that we are everything that's perfect in the world. And I was having this conversation. It's just a conversation. Yeah, yeah, right. They're all idiots. How do they ever make mistakes? The reality is that 200 years from now, we are going to be advocating and embracing even the most woke members of our society for things that others will find later to be abhorrent. That's just how history works, right? And so the idea that we've reached the end of history is kind of fascinating to me because I think 200 years from now might well be, and I'm just tossing one out, then anybody who eats meat is an infidel, right? Like the idea that you could have ever eaten meat is will be crazy. It's going to happen, right? And so our people 200 years from now are going to be like, oh, we got to tear down this Martin Luther King statue because he ate meat. We got to tear down the statue of John F. Kennedy because can you believe he liked the steak? Obama wasn't for gay marriage. The first time he ran for president. In fact, you're going to tear that library down? Why are we building it right now? In 2008, Obama's entire platform would be the most moderate platform of any Democrat running for president right now. And people would say, is this guy electable? So what does that tell you about internet culture? It is exactly where we started here, which is you were on the show a year and a half ago. We were talking about this. You were right in the midst of your own little mob situation. And it's like we've thrived since then that many other people have. The institutions have continued to crumble. I mean, we've watched the way trust in mainstream media. We've crumbled, watched the way trust in sports media has crumbled, while the little guy now doing their own thing is doing great. But what does that tell you about just the speed that we're getting the information at and where people are going to trust things? We're in a disruptive cycle. I don't think there's any doubt at all. And what I say all the time is the only thing I can do, and I love what you do about this as well, is try to be as honest as possible with my audience. Right. And so the things that I often get attacked for by people who don't like me, and I'm sure you see this all the time too, you're like, I address that all the time. Right. Like, come on, people. Yeah. And so I think trying to be as authentic as possible is ultimately the connection. And I think large institutions do not seem authentic because they got their fingers up in the air and they're paying attention to the vagaries of day to day responses on social media. I also think listening to social media isn't sane. Right. Yeah. I mean, it's a tiny segment of the population that's often very, very active. And so we live in an age of abundant criticism, but I don't think we live in an age of abundant reflection. And I think reflection is more important oftentimes than criticism. It is the problem though that social media is becoming our only way of reflecting. So because the institutions are crumbling and we don't have these, the nightly news show or whatever that we can all basically trust that social media has become the mirror, but now we're all coordinating off into our own mirrors. It would be a good example. Like Nancy Pelosi said this thing recently about AOC and Alana Omar. It's like, yeah, she's like, yeah, they're big on Twitter, but they only have four votes. But then they all go after her on Twitter and destroy her. And then the media loves that. And it's like, the whole thing is so out of whack with reality. Yeah. Or it's the new reality, which is just out of whack with. I think in general, there are a lot of people who aren't very confident. And this is what I always talk about from a perspective of, you know, let's say in my world of sports media. If you are an executive and you have gotten to the point where you are high up in making decisions at a sports network, let's say, I think the idea that you would make a choice on who you think is good based on your 30, 40, 50 years of expertise rising up to that level. And then because when it goes out publicly, a bunch of people on Twitter say, I don't like that guy or whatever, that you would allow that to be a reflection of the real world. I mean, there's a great stat that's out right now that I saw where it's something like 20 percent of people are on Twitter. Let's use as an example. And of that 20 percent, 80 percent of all tweets are sent by like 10 percent of the overall population, right? And we know that Twitter leans far left. We know that you've been in your own battles over this. The social media companies, as if they don't lean far left enough already, they're also magnifying those voices, right, that reflect the culture by which they wish were more popular. And so you're allowing ultimately, you know, something like 2 or 3 percent of the population that isn't at all reflective of the universe to dictate decisions that you make. And I'll give you an example. And this is in the book. I remember talking with ESPN execs and they said, Twitter hates Lou Holtz and Chris Berman, right? Old school guys at NBA, at ESPN, Lou Holtz, former Notre Dame football coach, college football guy, Chris Berman, maybe the most iconic voice in ESPN history, right? Point ESPN on the mat. And they said, if you read the mentions reflecting what they say on social media, everybody hates them. But if we are out in public, those guys get swarmed with positivity such that we have to have security to protect them. And the question was, do we listen to social media or do we listen to the real world? And to me, you got to listen to the real world, right? Because social media is not reflective of real life. It's funny because after this past year where I was on tour with Peterson and with 100 plus stops around 15 countries, and I'd be looking at mentions all day, and you know, actually 95 percent of them are positive. Yeah. But you know, it's always that 5 percent. And, you know, if 5 percent is several hundred, it can feel like a lot of big things. But then I'd meet people on the street and meet people all over the world at airports and restaurants and everyone's great. Yeah. Everyone's great. Actually, I was at IKEA this weekend and a guy kind of gave me side eye like clearly didn't like me. But I was like, that's as bad as it gets. Right. But if you're on social media all day, you feel like, holy shit, the world's coming to me. What I say is I've never had a person say a bad word to me face to face. Yeah. I mean, it's wild. And in fact, the opposite of that, people will come up and, you know, ask for a picture. You know, people say, if I ever see you, I'm going to punch you, right? That's really common on social media. Yeah. Well, they got to punch you. Yeah, yeah. Exactly. And then what happens is they show up and they want a picture or it's even happened a couple of times. Like, I'll block people, right, on social media if they're sending me obsessive, you know, 20 in a row tweets or something. Because I do try to go through and check every now and then. I don't spend as much time in it as I used to. But when I do that, I've had people come up to me and be like, man, you blocked me. Here's my Twitter handle. I'm a big fan. I'm sorry I was drunk that night and I just got carried away. And you please block me. I've blocked me. I mean, and that's always, I think, interesting because, you know, people are just not accurate representations of themselves on social media. Yeah. And as someone who tries to be as authentic and honest as I possibly can on a day to day basis, because I think, you know, one of my buddies said somehow by being the most reasonable person in sports, you've made a career. And I think that just kind of speaks to the polarity of the universe that we live in now that just being a guy who's fairly middle of the road seems radical. I know the feeling rather. I know. You and I have many of the same similar beliefs and kind of a career plan. It's a lot funny though that so the two of us that come from wildly different places, we're in different spheres that these worlds have kind of collided. Yes. That as we talked about last time, that sports has become ridiculously political. Which in many ways is why the institutions are crumbling. And the fact that a guy like you who mostly cares about sports, you end up talking about a whole bunch of stuff that really is just a sidebar. But that is where the energy is. And saying something like, Hey, the US women are great. But I kind of wish Megan Rapinoe had shut up and just gone to the White House, right? Or, or, you know, the US women deserve whatever money they can get in a market based economy. But the men produce a lot more revenue and people are like, Oh my God, how dare you say that? This is the most rational, you know, reasonable perspective. Or, you know, the NBA shouldn't ban the word owners because it's not racially insensitive like the owners of the team. Do you think you on those? Yeah. And I think, erratically, although this might be owned by Fox, but they dress me when I'm out here for television. But it's crazy like, you know, like, we're only going to define words by thing and they replaced it with governors, which doesn't even mean the same thing. And by the way, if you're worried about negative racial connotations, there've been a lot more racist governors, you know, in the last 30 or 40 years than there have been a racist team owners.

I want to get back to some of the gender stuff related to soccer and all that. But on the owner front, the people that push these ideas. So I remember it was a couple of weeks ago we start hearing this. They're not going to call the owners owners anymore. And you see it start spreading across social media and people start saying this is a good thing and there's a connotation to slavery and all those things. And yet every part of you as a functioning person knows this is nonsense. They own a team. They own a business. I own the production company that produces this show. You do not own the people who are here working on you. Like if they decide that they don't want to work for you anymore, they can even go work somewhere else. I'm renting them. That's all right. Like you know it. Lyingly you know it. It's obvious. But what I think social justice has done is it's created a situation where even basic words now have become triggers for some other thing. And it's like do these guys actually think they've done anything good? That's what I'm always trying to figure out. The guys that believe this. Okay. We're calling them governors now. Do they walk home and they go honey you know you're not going to believe this. I did something. I think it's all motivated by fear. So let's take a step back. Adam Silver is a white guy who runs the NBA right. Ultimately he's afraid if he doesn't listen to a few Looney Tunes black players and make this decision that ultimately they could decide oh wait Adam Silver is a white guy who runs the NBA. He's like a plantation master right. Like that's the analogy that they could continue to build out. Why is he making tens of millions of dollars a year when he's primarily making money off the labor of black men in the NBA right. And so I think what happens is anybody who's managing that world widely it must be super easy. Yeah right. Yeah. What happens is it's an element of self-preservation. So I don't think Adam Silver. I think if you gave him truth serum and he was sitting here with you right now he'd say that's an utterly ludicrous idea. But I think the problem is people in positions of power are so afraid that they're going to end up the target that they go as far left as they possibly can because that way they can be like my hand. What are you talking about? I'm super woke like we replace the word owners with governors. I'm sensitive to your feelings. And that's a big problem is there's a difference between hearing somebody's argument and at least contemplating it and being sensitive to an argument right. There are lots of dumb arguments. Calling an argument dumb is not insensitive. It actually honors the argument to be discussing it. But I think that they're like I did a poll. I think that 95% of sports fans do not think remotely that the word owner is racist. But people like Adam Silver in positions of power are afraid that the platform that a guy like Dremon Green has who wants to say by the way, Dremon Green said he was an owner in his Twitter bio. Right. Right. It's like these guys are not even able to avoid hypocritical behavior for a short segment of time right like Dremon Green says the word owner is offensive and yet in his own bio he's an owner. And look ownership is an aspirable goal in the United States in capitalism right. You want to own your home. You want to own a business. You want to own your education like owning something is a powerful thing for an individual. So and then you replace it like you said with a word that doesn't even mean the same thing and arguably. So first of all they are now governors of teams right. That doesn't make any sense because a governor is primarily an elected official. These guys bought the team and the failure for somebody like Adam Silver to be like, Hey, I heard that argument but here's the truth. They own the franchise not the individuals. If people don't want to play in our league they can go elsewhere and make a living somewhere doing something else. That's a pretty good argument and he's a reasonable guy and he's afraid to say the reasonable thing because then he ends up at target. Is the irony though that the destructive force that you're talking about actually transcends race because so I got you that Adam Silver he's yeah when I'm a white guy so I better you know offer some penance here but the simple truth is that most likely one day even though he's doing a pretty damn good job in terms of economics he'll be replaced and he'll be replaced most likely. I would guess if I had to guess it's probably going to be by a black woman. Yeah actually if you were just putting odds out I think there's a good chance. So but let's just say it's a black man or a black woman. Well the second that black man or woman does anything that those guys don't like they'll say that they're an Uncle Tom and a seller. So it's like you actually have no protection in the world of social justice no matter. You know what I mean the second thing you want to use your minority status against you I mean everyone watching this knows that. Like those guys will even be treated worse. They'll be looking at Adam Silver going oh those were the good old days. And that's why you need to have somebody who's willing to stand up and just respond. And I think the fear is in getting engaged in that fight but ultimately we need to be having more battles. Ironically enough we need to have more reasonable people who are willing to step into the fray because I do think there is a huge I don't think I'm almost a 1 billion percent certain there's a because they respond to my show and I'm one of the only people who's making these arguments. There's a huge silent majority out there that thinks that these arguments are ludicrous and I think it kind of translates into the democratic presidential debates. I think everybody is so afraid of being attacked. My thing is being attacked is a good thing right. Like it means that it means that you are having an influence and that they're afraid of the influence that you're having. So you know I don't run away from attack I kind of enjoy you know like what was the old argument you know like a pig in the mud likes enjoys being there. I kind of like being down in the mud rolling around getting in a fight good fight every now and then. It's weird though when it happens to you and you're just trying to do something decent. That's the thing for me that I had to adjust because I actually don't mind the hate now because I agree it's like well they're all talking about me people are waking up in the morning going what are Ruben do this time. It's like really you're doing that but there's still a part of me that's like well I'm trying to be so freakin decent. I try not to attack people. I try to talk about ideas all that stuff and it's like that still is what they're going for which really tell it says more about them than it says about you. Totally and I think the other thing I would say for everybody out there is these stories last 24 hours. So initially you know early on in Twitter I understand that feeling where suddenly 100 people decide you're the most awful human being on the planet because of something you said that really is pretty innocuous right. I didn't know who you were an hour before. Yeah and now you're like an awful human being. Used to I'd look at it and I'd be bothered by it. Now you know like I just say okay like I've got three kids at home like let's go down to the park. You know like you know 24 hours there's going to be something new that they decide to get offended by and it's not going to change the way that I talk about my opinions and ultimately I also don't think it's going to have an impact on my career. Now maybe I'm wrong. Maybe at some point I am going to totally get canceled but in this cancel culture that we live in because somebody decides I said something that they don't like but I think. I've been working on some things. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. I think that we've entered the world where the art once you get and that's where I think you and I both are now. My audience is not suddenly going to say I hate Clay Travis and completely abandon me. Right. And so I think the fear out there is that there's not people who are going to have your back. I feel like we've reached the point where we have a lot of people who have our back and it's just basically a perpetual war. Yeah. God there's so much there. We could do five hours. Yeah yeah just unpacking. And it's important because I do, I sense it especially at colleges with these young kids that are just afraid to get in the fight a little bit more. Oh I see that all the time. It's like you're seeding a lot of ground to people that will gladly silence you you know. Yeah and that's to me the scariest thing about our culture today is and I wrote about this the other day and I certainly wrote in my book. There's a difference between I disagree with you and here's why and I disagree with you and you shouldn't be allowed to make the argument that you're making right. The cancel culture to me is really scary in our country because there are a lot of people out there who want to cease the debate in general and just cancel you out of the debate. And that's fundamentally anti-democratic. It's anti-first amendment. It's anti-American values and the few, the fact that there's not more people standing up to fight against that and in favor of that like again I think back to Howard Stern for instance who's now evidently gone woke too right in many of the ways that he's. Oh no it's alright I've heard a little bit but he's started to go a little bit woke. But I think it's because he fears all the things that he's done in the past that if he continues in this era they'll go back and they'll track through all these different tapes and everything that he's said over the years. But I think that you know what they found was in his early days people wanted to silence him right. And what's wild about that is it's a big circle because it used to be conservative people who were like in that position. And now I think conservatives have realized wait a minute we need to have a robust battlefield of ideas and the fact that you know in my life liberals could be the people on a campus saying I'm upset because of an idea or I'm upset like they are in San Francisco right now because of this old mural of George Washington that's on the wall in that school or I'm upset because of this statue that's out there or I'm upset because of a word that somebody used or a phrase or a sentence or a paragraph that somebody wrote. It's like how sensitive have we become as a society it honestly is I think the most scary thing that's going on in the country today. Yeah you know there's that great moment in private parts in the Howard Street movie where the executive comes out and he says you know the people that love you watch listen to you for seven minutes a day he's like the people that hate you listen to you for an hour and a half and it's like yeah they listen they hate it but they listen. And now that culture is on social media dominating the hate culture. And I remember talking with a politician a while back when I was working in politics and we were talking about yes no votes. And you know a lot of times you no matter who you are what political persuasion you have you'll stand in front of that yes no question and you'll be like it's a really complex you know you're like I don't even know what this means right I'm a lawyer and I'm standing there like I don't know whether I should be yes no. They're like 30% of people vote no no matter what right like it doesn't matter what the question could be because you always look at those yes no ballots and it's never something never wins like 95 to 5 right it's always 70% roughly yes 70 to 30 is a wipeout right in a voting booth and there is a certain segment of the population that is titillated by being offended by things right like that's their thing. The problem is we have allowed those people to be voices that we give way too much legitimacy to because one it's a minority of voices and two it's not actually reflective of life there's that Pew study recently that came out that said people hate political correctness right whether you're white, black, brown, Asian whatever you are you hate it and yet we've allowed that culture to predominate. Yeah we're seeding it basically 8% a hysterical 8% yeah so then it leads to the question which is what everyone asks me and I don't know what the answer is and I've thought about it a lot and I can only come up with some things that I wouldn't even want to say but how horrible does this thing have to get before it implodes like what do you think would actually cause it to lose its energy. So I think that first of all there are a lot of people I think who have been funny and smart about ridiculing you know for instance the Chicago Cubs we had the okay sign right and the Cubs are like oh my god this fan is banned from life the O.F. Steen is like I was literally shivering when I was seeing it and I don't know about you but the vast majority of people like when I was growing up if you look down when somebody did that you got punched in the arm right I think that is a vast majority of the perspective. Here for me in purpose. Yeah right yeah yeah yeah yeah so the argument that is out there that common things which are used by white supremacist groups somehow render them unusable is a so utterly absurd argument right because I'm like well you know white supremacist drive cars right white supremacist fly on airplanes white supremacist shake hands right like the idea that you're going to identify a symbol with a particular group and try to ban it to me proves the hysteria that we're currently living in like we saw with Nike saying oh Colin Kaepernick's offended by the Betsy freaking Ross flag right and so we're not going to allow that shoe to be released and so I think reasonable people look at this and start to recognize the hysteria so I had a you know somebody sent me this but I think it's a funny question what if white supremacist just went all in on Nike gear like flip the script right and they're like we're only like every event that we do we're only going to where Nike does Nike cancel the name of Nike right imagine how funny that would be if the next the next KKK rally you know like if everybody in the KKK rally yes right and everybody's like a million people stand around the year the autumn but what if the KKK I just like had a sense of humor and irony which they probably don't right because they're ideal logs who are absolutist which are always the people who are craziest right but what if they showed up in all Nike gear and they're like Nike is now a white supremacist endorsed company we only wear Nike head to toe right would Nike be like we're gonna ban like the way that you follow the logic down its absurd path and you I think that there are almost like you got to smuggle a little logic into their ridiculous right and and that's like that's like my argument Martin Luther King was opposed to like said that like in gave an interview where I think it was in Ebony magazine back in the day and he was asked a question about gay rights basically like how do I'm afraid my I'm gay like what should I do he's like well it's probably a medical condition you should go talk to a doctor and like if an if a political candidate gave that answer today they would be canceled right like particularly if they're a Democrat God forbid so I was like if you immediately respond I went to Martin Luther King high school like do we have to take Martin Luther King's name off my high school do we have to tear down the Martin Luther King Memorial I think when you start to put people like well no I mean like that was in the 1950s I'm like yeah well George Washington was around in the 1790s right like Thomas Jefferson was around in the in the in the 18th century like what do you want to do there like in terms of analyzing it so I think you need to flip it on people and make them realize oh wait the people that we believe are icons of our universe are actually flawed human beings as well and maybe we shouldn't judge every single act they did predicated on whatever the rules are now but yeah that one I love like if if white supremacist are just like we're head to toe Nike now instead of burning it right if you're like it and then what does Nike do Nike's like oh what do we change the name of the company right do we like like how do we how do we retake our brand like this idea that because somebody you disagree with likes something you have to not be touched by it like when I saw with the mayor Pete like he was gonna come on your program and I'd have a legitimate conversation and the same way I treat everybody be and and then people are like oh my god if you sit down and talk to that guy you are somehow like you're canceled to us like it's crazy right I mean like I would put the most right wing person like if whoever the Democrats nominate for president I'd love to have him on my Fox Sports radio show whoever the Republicans at Donald Trump I'd love to have him on when we enter this culture where somehow if you talk to someone it means that you agree with everything that they represent like I said you know what was on this crazy way we framed things yeah so Andy know who got attacked by what was crazy and who I know him and he was on the show last week and he's a good decent guy yeah five foot five soft spoken little gay Vietnamese guy and I only mentioned those qualifiers right to use their idea you know ridiculous identity yeah against themselves but it's like he's a decent guy in the way that everyone was framing it was either that the journalists yeah check journals we're all saying he's either not a journalist they take right he's not a journalist or he's a fascist as if either one of those would excuse my no I would I would just say compare the response to the woman who got killed in Charlottesville yeah right by the by the you know crazy deranged dude who I think has got life in prison deservedly so right and people were like oh my god this is what happens in Trump's America totally innocent people get attacked for their political beliefs and there was a mass uproar you know it still is impacting things I think I saw in Charlottesville where they are no longer celebrating Thomas Jefferson's birthday as part of the file fallout from that they now have you know another day that they've replaced it with or whatever else again because people are afraid I think to have a legitimate argument ironically enough in a place like Charlottesville which is founded on the idea of intellectual freedom and the the response to that attack on by by a group that is I mean it's it's wild or the cubbing team in the way that they just you go narrative first and then you figure it out after yes like where where all the tweets guys where all the tweets about what erased his homophobic nation and this one doesn't work for you and I think part of the problem is in a large sense you can find evidence for whatever you want in the world or in the country on a day to day basis and what we've lost the ability to do and I wrote about this a lot of my book is comprehend probability right like are there still racist in this country certainly are there still homophobes in this country certainly but they represent particularly for acts of violence a tiny tiny percentage of the overall population yet in the same way let's say there are 40,000 people a year who die in car accidents if the media decided to cover car accident deaths in the same way that they cover police shootings or in the same way that they cover you know a mass shooting or whatever else people will be terrified to get in their car right they'll be like oh my god we got another you know what's 40,000 divided by 365 I mean there are hundreds if not thousands of people dying on a week to week basis a day to day basis and yet we kind of get used to that right but also what is it that they ultimately want to happen yeah I don't know that's what I was thinking about because it's like if I found out that the guy who lives across street from me was a homophobe yeah right meaning he had an irrational fear of gay people right well as long as he didn't come to my lawn and stand across my house in law you know yeah well to have cock yeah yeah it's like you want to be having your rationally fear of gay people in your own home yes you're allowed to do it like would it be would it be worthy of my time or sensible for a for a greater society for me to you know pick up his problems yes confront him try to get him fired you think at the end now I accomplish all those things now he's the movie lost his job he's destitute his wife divorced him you think he's gonna be like you know I kind of like gay people you know I mean I think that speaks to a larger context a handshakes always more powerful than a fist right ultimately because and I think you've reached the point way long ago beyond the point of you know diminishing returns right where if you look did I wish that nobody was racist I wish that nobody was homophobic in this country but I think in trying to drive it down to zero first of all you end up in this strange world where you have to define what is gay homophobia and what is racism and oftentimes you're coming around nowadays to owner you know the world right like there is a there is a more demand for racism in this country than there is supply which is why the Wall Street Journal had a big editorial recently you mentioned Josie Smollett there is a huge desire to use this as an example of the larger societal issue and I think that's a failure of journalism right if you think about it journalism starts with story right and the story will oftentimes be used to illuminate a larger issue I'll give you an example a lot of people are dying from opioids in order to draw somebody into the opioid crisis it makes sense I think to go talk about the impact on a family in Ohio as a larger representative for the tens of thousands of people who might be dying or afflicted by opioid addiction but that's a massive issue in the country today which has tangible results dead people that otherwise wouldn't exist because of the opioid crisis if you take something that is not necessarily a major issue today let's say that Josie Smollett did happen it was still a minuscule you know number of people that was going to be involved in this attack and it's not necessarily representative of the larger society yet that's the argument that they try to make oh this is a stand-in for something larger well no it's not it doesn't happen very often at all it's a barren much like this is the argument I'm making my book a shark attack right every shark attack gets news right because ultimately we're all terrified summer Jaws season is going on I'm sure when you go in the ocean at some point when I do two most influential movie ever made is Jaws because I think I might get killed by a shark I had that problem in pools for the first one right yeah that's right you know statistically it's totally improbable yet every shark attack gets covered so we think that it happens more frequently than it does I feel like we've lost you were talking earlier about like the nightly news the Walter Cronkites of the world there aren't people saying you know this is this is a reasonable reaction LeBron for instance said every day my son leaves the house I worry that he might not come back home and everybody was like oh it's so brave of LeBron James to say that more young black kids are getting killed by bees wasp and hornets leaving the house every day then by police if LeBron had come out and said I worry every day that when my kid leaves the front door of his house he's going to get killed by a bee a wasp or a hornet people have been like man well LeBron needs to chill out right like but it's more likely or hit by a train right like it's more likely and so some of this is just the way we're wired like certain people's brains are wired for that type of hysteria you may have seen this video when I was at University of New Hampshire and all these kids were screaming at me and yelling blah blah blah and then this woman this middle-aged woman gets up and she screaming at me and she goes these kids could be killed when they walked out of here and I don't even remember what I said to her but what I was thinking was what do you what planet are you yeah these are kids at the University of New Hampshire right in the middle of nowhere there's no violence here no one's getting killed and yet you're an adult yes telling these kids that they should be fearful there if anyone should have been fearful for their life at that moment yes but but that sort of thing it just goes to a certain part of the brain that then just gets fed fed fed fed I think politicians have become a student motivating base audiences by fear right and I think certainly the left wing has become more more likely to do this but I think historically the right wing has done it as well right and the problem is you need somebody this is where I think Obama failed as a as a politician he is a very logical guy whether you agree or disagree with him I think he looks at data and he makes arguments he should have as some of this hysteria started actually I think he could have made it a tremendous impact if he had come out and said look are there bad police yes look I wish that there were no bad police in this country some of them can't be trusted but let's just walk through the statistics you know the number one help to entire inner city America is police officers right look here's the data on murders as they pertain to over the last 30 or 40 years right this is a trend line that's regularly going down here's the number of police that we employ this is a trend line that's going up employing more police makes people safer it doesn't mean they're going to be flawless they have guns on their hips sometimes they make bad decisions when they do they should be prosecuted in a court of law like anybody else who makes those decisions and I wonder on some level whether Obama feels bad about the hysteria because I think the problem we had in 2016 was Hillary if you look at the numbers of voters right Hillary didn't get the same black voters that Obama did and I think ultimately she ran an identity politics of laden campaign because she thought if I make it seem like it's awful for black people in this country today and what Donald Trump will do to them is going to be awful then they will turn up and vote for me which will allow me to win the election and I think in 2020 we're going to see a reprisal of that now the people in the midwest were smart enough who flipped from Obama and Trump to see through that on some level but this is an election that's going to be decided in Pennsylvania Michigan in Ohio and Wisconsin I think those four states and so whoever the Democrats nominate I think they're going to look at the black turnout and say man if we got in the same black turnout that Obama got we would have won this election how do we get it no matter who the nominee is in 2020 we're going to try to sell fear to that audience you think the simple proof on that is that we once had dinner with Candace always with far right racist or whatever the hell they call her now but remember a couple months ago when the reparations talk started bubbling up and then Elizabeth Warren said you know a commission and then the rest of them started saying we're going to get into reparations yeah I texted Candace and I said I think you've done it I think you caused such a crack yeah in the foundation yeah in the foundation of that black people have to be Democrats yes that they literally now are saying what do we got left here's cold hard cash yeah that's all we got left and the fact that they're making that an issue shows that one person I mean it's a through line to what we're talking about here that one person that stakes out some brave position yes that they really believe in actually can cause immeasurable change because I really do believe it is directly related to what she has done yeah look and you can criticize her and people get angry right I defend her and blah blah blah no she's not perfect that I'm not perfect and all that stuff but I truly believe it is because of what she caused yeah look I think the foundation of identity politics collapsing is maybe the most important thing that could happen in our country right because I think the idea that you should be able to look at somebody and guess who they're going to vote for is the foundation of our politics today right and certainly fear if it's used to motivate a voter I think is often bad now look you can criticize the other side too right nobody's perfect I think that republicans in general have overemphasized the danger of terrorism right to make people think that they're in more danger than they are the reality is and maybe I'm going to get shot as soon as I walk out and that would certainly be an irony yeah I could be your homophobic neighbor who thinks I'm gay but the reality is we have never been safer right and I think about this a lot as a parent because you know in my city where I live Nashville Tennessee I try to consciously let my kids take risks like let them get on their bike let them ride down the street we are so suffused I think with fear as parents I think that kind of translates through to our kids who live in this incredibly anxious world where they feel like they're in danger and I'm like you know in the early 80s we were in much more danger than our kids are today the fact my parents let me climb trees and run out I'd be 100 feet in the air while we come in for lunch I'm like I'm I'm I don't know how I'm gonna get down but I always got down yeah I think about it now you know like I rode the school bus in fourth and fifth grade got home got off the school bus walked all the way you know down the street up to my house and totally empty house unlocked the door went inside stayed there for a couple of hours by myself right I mean and I was 10 right I mean and my I've got an 11 year old now and if we go to the swimming pool in our neighborhood across the street yeah my wife's like oh my god do you think we can leave him here I'm like he's all he's gonna be in sixth grade right like I mean but I think it's just you know we have sort of built this cocoon of protectionist protectiveness and that can be good but not when it's motivated by fear and I think that's where we are. Yeah Nashville so I performed you might have seen the picture in the in the green room bathroom over there is me at the Rhyme in which is incredible grand old opera he was one of the most memorable nights but what is going on in Nashville that everybody is so freakin happy I have never seen a happier nicer I don't know maybe there's something going on first of all I don't really look at the camera whichever camera don't move yeah don't move you know we got enough of you you know I'm born and raised in Nashville I think the culture of the place I've never seen a group but every single person that I walk by on the street offered to bring me to their house for dinner yeah me out to eat can I buy you a drink yeah what can I do for you you want to literally the people you want can I buy you a new jacket yeah yeah it was unbelievable it's a super nice community that I think I don't know what exactly it is I think one you get the southern element two I think the economy has been booming so people do feel really good about you know their overall status in life three I think the entertainment culture we kind of have a lot of the LA vibe of creativity and just freedom and individual you know sort of choices that that I think is so important in life and but without a lot of the negativity associated with it and I don't know whether it's because musicians don't have to be beautiful like a lot of actors and actresses do but it's uh you know uh I really love it I mean we don't want to move I mean I'm born and raised I think it was a great culture for me to grow up in and I think it's an even better one for my kids it's funny to me that you made a point of looking at the camera I just feel like well everybody else is out there saying like it's an awesome place to be like no we're full right like you know how I feel like as a parent kind of my kids are at perfect ages they're 11, 8, and 4 and I would be you know their potty train they still like to spend time with us like we we can enjoy them as a family I'd be fine hitting pause right now in my life and having them hang out here for a little while because I know you know my father-in-law was telling me this he's like you're in a good spot right now the kids still have lots of problems but they're almost all little problems as your kids get older they have fewer problems but they become a lot bigger right and and that makes sense right as you think about it from a parent perspective but the city of Nashville like you used to be able to get everywhere in 10 or 15 minutes now the traffic there's so many people moved in and that can bring a lot of good things and it's been a good audience growth a lot of college educated lots of bars restaurants awesome entertainment scene but we're full yeah you need to move to another city it's funny because every town that I visited last year whenever I saw something really great happening in that town like Salt Lake City I was like yeah people are phenomenal yeah it's clean it's nice and I did stand up there and I said something about how great it is there and literally people are coming up to me after going please don't tell anybody yeah yeah don't you guys are leaving and ruining everything it's funny when I started we're big on that when I started my career because I did local sports darker radio in Nashville as my profile kind of grew I would talk a lot about how awesome Nashville was and this is you know over the last 15 years and about two or three years ago I just stopped talking about how awesome the city is right because I'm like I think I've had too much of an influence on some way like you know when but people are just scrolling through and they're thinking about where to move I think it also helps by the way we've got no state income tax so if you're out in California 13% state income tax let's say you make a million dollars a year and you're an entertainer that's a hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year boom that you have in your pocket in Nashville that you didn't necessarily have if you lived in California or New York it's it's I sometimes wonder why we don't have more of our Fox Sports studios out there because I'm you know doing the show to finish the season here and and you know it's great to be able to do it out of Nashville all right let's back up yes to 20 minutes ago I want to talk about some of the gender stuff yeah yeah related sports because you mentioned the woman soccer team that's great they want okay fantastic everybody's happy but yes there are economic elements to this that less people happen to watch those things it's just reality it just is nobody saying they're not worthy nobody saying it shouldn't be on TV nobody saying they shouldn't be able to play but this constant then need it where it became about their victimhood yes as they were winning yes as you're winning but the whole idea is a we're you know we're not going to respect the flag and whatever they can just they can do whatever they want but then also just we don't get the TV time and it's like all these things like this is such a such a misguided space let's take it let's take a step back I said on my show and again this is something that's reasonable that some people consider to be controversial so you'll enjoy this I said if you look at the women's World Cup you can almost pick every winner solely by determining which country has better women's rights it's a fascinating way just look at the bracket you look at every women's World Cup game that was played almost every game without fail the winner was the country that provides more rights to women so it's fascinating to think about we are as a country so wealthy and so successful that we not only embrace men's sports which many countries do we also have so many parents out there who will spend thousands of dollars a year for their women to be able to their little girls to be able to play soccer and grow up potentially to be us women's soccer team member look at our the girls that were on the team the women that won the title this year they used to be little girls who grew up in pre-advantaged backgrounds right because by and large soccer in America unlike soccer in the rest of the world is a sport that elites play right suburban sport especially for women and so the argument that I made is if anything Megan Rapinoe instead of saying I'm not going to the effing White House and she said fucking I should I'm not going to the fucking White House which I think sounds different she should have in my opinion said you know I have this opportunity as a captain of the women's team to make that argument that I just made if we can be a shining light to the rest of the world this is what happens when you give little girls the freedom to pursue things that interest them they grow up into women who can dominate and so there's a lot of talk about the women versus the men right but the reason why our men struggle in soccer is because the rest of the world identifies great male athletes and they develop them and Iran last year was the first time they let women watch soccer in their country they require women to play in pants they require women to wear the hijab where you can just see their eyes on the football on the soccer field um I think about that is it a surprise that us women would dominate a country that doesn't let women wear shorts or attend soccer matches is it a surprise that we would dominate Saudi Arabia where they just started letting women drive cars you know so our women's success to me is actually a reflection of the ideals that they should be trying to shed and shine a bright light on for the rest of the world having said that the rest of the world doesn't care about women's soccer like the United States does so pure economics when you look at this and again this is pure rational economics the men's world cup produced most recently the most recent numbers I saw four billion dollars of revenue right b billion the women's world cup and I think it was the most recent by 2015 produced 73 million in revenue associated with it now that's continuing to grow but the men in America actually made a smaller percentage of the fee for revenue I think it was nine percent then the women did they got 13 percent so take a step back from everybody I think in general is in favor of equality right I mean there are very few people who are like oh I think because of your sex you should have less rights than someone else again tiny tiny percentage so to me when you look at this it's just a function of economics I wish I made the money that Howard Stern makes right we do the same thing we talk on the radio every morning why do I make less money than he does because my audience is smaller and the reason why the US women and the revenue that my audience produces is lower right it's basic economics so I understand the argument of oh the US women deserve more certainly I hope they get as much as they possibly can I'm a capitalist I want every individual to make as much money as they can but the money's not there right and so the reason why the money's not there is because the world not the United States the world doesn't value women's soccer as much as they do men's soccer you think trump every time rapinoe or one of these athletes says they're not going to go to the White House or fuck the White House or whatever yeah you think he's just like hallelujah hallelujah this is just going to make me more popular because to me it's the ultimate virtue signal yeah why not instead of saying that why not you honored your country you you want yeah for your country why not show up the White House and then do what an adult might do which when he walks by and shakes all your hands say mr president I'd love to have five minutes with you or to discuss some of the things that he's been eating which he's shown that he's willing to do like this is what's so crazy to this about me and I don't know about you but this is what really bothers me in general about the discussion about the White House visit I would go to the White House if I were invited by Bill Clinton Barack Obama George W Bush George Bush Donald Trump the idea that that is somehow an endorsement of whoever is president is crazy to me to me it's just a respect for the office itself and the location and that's why when Megan Rapinoe said the fucking White House it's like the White House is a symbol that represents everything that's good and great about America including the rights that allowed you to become such a dominant women's soccer player to begin with and by the way and you know this better than me I believe on election to enter the White House for the first term Trump is the most gay LGBT friendly president ever literally well first off he was basically pro-game average yes remember Barack Obama again was not in 2008 he was on stage with the freaking gay pride flag before the election Peter Thiel at the at the at the RNC yeah proud gay man gets a standing ovation yeah I even knew what to do so yeah it's all it's all just bananas and so that is what is so problematic and disappointing to me in many respects is what does she actually disagree with and that's the question where I think the sports media often does not go the next level they they cover the surface level virtually signaling right okay the next question for Megan Rapinoe is okay what do you specifically disagree with Donald Trump that he has done not just like a mean tweet that he sent or something like a tangible a decision and why would you not take the opportunity to sit with the most powerful man in the world and talk to him about it because if anything Trump has proven to actually listen to some of these arguments right like is the catch 22 though for not for you yeah you can do what you want and you can control the content you're creating but for ESPN I get it they can do it at sort of the base level but then the more they were to do of that it's the more that a guy like me who I'm not a I don't really care about soccer yeah that though it's I was telling you right before we started I think that I just now flick through like I see yeah and it's so I used to you know even five years ago I would always stop on what's going on and now it's just like I know that whatever it's on right now I could not care less about I think what would happen is the athlete will get exposed by and large because you would find out that's not the business ESPN one right but that what you would find out is there's no depth to their actual political opinions because they're doing other things full-time right like I think if LeBron James who is obviously super woke right now because I think he gets positive feedback on social media and everything else if you set him down and said okay LeBron like you called the president a bum explain why specifically you think the president is a bum and what you would change differently if you were in the White House you would realize wait a minute like he would just him and Hawan he wouldn't have any answers like you or I or any number of people and maybe that athlete does have some depth to them and that's why I've always offered you know like I offered Colin Kaepernick I offered LeBron James I offer Megan Rapinoe like come on my show and actually make your arguments that you believe you have this platform to make we never see that happen right we hear people say oh I've got to use my platform well how are you using your platform to advocate for like an actual change or some sort of detail I never see that actually happen it's interesting your point about how Trump would be happy to take these meetings because you're right he does take these meetings all the time especially with famous people when it's good television ops right like Trump sitting with Megan Rapinoe on the other side of the desk in the Oval Office he'd let all the meat like he did with Kanye and Kim Kardashian right like Trump is a very cognizant of the amount of attention that he can get and the more famous a person he meets with the more attention he's going to get particularly in the world of sports whether it's Jim Brown whether it's he just announced that the logo Jerry West he's bringing in Tiger Woods Trump's a sports fan right and I think he enjoys Tom Brady obviously that all of the talk about the Brady and Belichick relationship and everything else and so I think he enjoys being able to interact with him as president and yeah I think he would always have that meeting if you wanted to have that meeting do you get any feedback from women in the sports broadcasting that are sick of the wokeness when it comes to all the different stuff yeah that's got that to me is the most obvious one like we can argue about some of the the racial stuff and numbers and things like that but this one now where we're seeing you know trans wrestlers beating the crap basically out of you know genetically female women and it's like now the feminists are full or that yeah I think that are we doing yeah I think that's you talked about how do you blow it up I think you have to follow the logical collapse of the argument right and to me choosing your gender is it's wild to me that we're okay with choosing your gender but choosing your race is wildly offensive right like so Rachel Dolezal is a like is like a social pariah yeah but if Rachel Dolezal was a woman who decided to be a man we would all have to respect that decision and my thing is it seems easier to choose to align yourself with a racial group than it does to change your gender right but the next step for the world soul man yeah yeah can you imagine that coming out today that would be amazing but to me the next step that you take that is that is that is fascinating here is Kaitlyn Jenner is a great example ESPN gives Kaitlyn Jenner and SB what would have happened if in the 1970s when Kaitlyn Jenner is dominating Bruce Jenner is dominating in the Olympics he had then decided I'm going to become a woman and I'm going to come back and I'm going to you know compete against all the women he would have dominated even more right like this is the greatest athlete in the world as a man if he flips over and becomes a woman he's going to dominate even more so this idea that you can choose your gender and that you should then be allowed to compete as that gender it's like they made a joke movie about this do you remember like Juana man yeah back in the day but but but that is that's the logical fallacy of the argument I cannot wait till some 42 year old wash up washed up NBA guy who played like seven seasons yeah scored three points a game becomes the the best player in the WNBA and you guys are gonna have to take it yeah look I mean and I think that's honestly what you need to have happened in order for the logical fallacy of the argument to fall apart right like and I think that's ultimately what spells the end of woke them in the world of sports is what you're just talking about there are going to be a lot of dads and moms who have watched their daughters train their entire life to be able to win the sprint state championship and then there suddenly is a 17 year old who is a male that has decided to identify as female and wins the competition by 20 yards right because this is again men are better athletes than women like I've got people right now my Twitter mentions talking about the US women the US men debate and they're like oh if the US women played the men they'd win and I'm like the the US women lost to a 15 and under boys all-star team from Dallas right like men are better at all sports than women are that's not sexist that's biology right so therefore men who are bigger stronger and faster than women who suddenly decide to identify as women are going to be better and even if they get all the complicated hormones stuff like you're still built physically in a way that most women are not right like you're still you got all the height advantages of testosterone all the shoulder you know strength everything else it's it's just it's not it's not offensive to say that when a woman dunks in the WNBA which has only happened a handful of times yeah it's like a miracle yes it's every NBA player yeah I'm pretty sure John Stockton dumped one what was like I and this is again in my book Republicans by sneakers too John McEnroe got criticized for saying Serena Williams be like the 700th best men's player in the world I talked to a bunch of men's tennis players pros and they're like she couldn't make a men's college tennis team it doesn't mean she's not an outstanding women's tennis player but her talent doesn't translate into the arena with men and that doesn't mean that women are inferior to men in life right it means that athletically men are superior to women well you saw the way they were going after Martina and never to lower oh yeah for her when she wrote that piece and that speaks to I think that the danger of actually interjecting yourself into the conversation because Martina and over at Alova could have just set out of it I think she wrote an op-ed piece for a British newspaper yeah I remember there was one season right maybe the first or second season in the WNBA you remember Cynthia Cooper who was on the Houston Comet and she was like running circles around every year she had great handles she had all these sick moves I remember watching her and I was like could this girl possibly make it in the NBA and in my mind I thought that maybe she could yeah but that's just crazy ludicrous it's just crazy it's it's like the argument and this goes into title nine that I've always found would be fascinating from a legal perspective you talk about extending the logical uh the logical fallacy of the argument football is not a men's sport like if you really think about it every scholarship that you get in college to play football is open to women like softball is a women's sport baseball is a men's sport men's basketball men's sport men's uh you know basketball I mean women's basketball women's right they're defined by their gender football is open to everyone if Tom if Bill Belichick could find a you know five foot four woman who could be the takeover or six foot four woman or whatever it is for Tom Brady he would sign that person to play in the NFL and so would every college coach those women don't exist so is that the sickest twist to this whole thing yeah that sports really because of rules yes is the great equalizer one million percent played to the ultimate meritocracy you know I think I maybe told you this last time you were here but uh Sue Bird went to the same high school yeah she was younger than me but every now and again she would come out to the courts where I was playing right and she run circles around everybody yeah it's awesome yeah I have no problem saying that she was freaking awesome yes and it's like that doesn't mean she's gonna go to the NBA right but we can acknowledge that within the the skill set playing against all of us yeah yeah she freaking killed us to me it's like uh looking at the the scatter plot or the bell curve right like uh most people are somewhere in the the range of the top right and then there's outliers if you put male and female athletic ability on that same chart it doesn't mean that some women are not substantially better even than most men when it comes to athleticism but when you look at the extremes which are the people who end up making a living the men athletically are on a totally different stratosphere than the most athletic women so when you say Sue Bird's a great example Sue Bird can be a lot better than most men at basketball and nowhere near the extreme of the most talented men's basketball players all right let's uh we only got a couple of minutes left so let's just hit a couple of things so there's also been a little through line here that sort of as people like you are doing their own thing out of the institutions and as the institutions are crumbling I've come to the belief that sort of the platforms that all of this is going to crumble that one of these things are sustainable and it'll be on creators yes and innovators to figure out how to reach their communities um do you kind of view the future of the internet that way because we're also in the middle of that game right now which is just what is all of this going to become yeah I think a lot about that because what am I ultimately in the business of words right I produce and that's why the money that I've made I've tended to roll into buildings right because everything that I do is so ephemeral but I think we're in an era when and I don't know when it's going to be I think it's going to happen soon you will get into your car which you may not be driving at all but would be transporting you somewhere and you will hopefully say play me the most recent clay Travis right and and boom it's ready to go now podcasts kind of have that but I think that all audio is going to converge right I think radio I think podcast I think you know shows like this which can exist in both audio and video format everything converges and it becomes an opportunity to distribute your content in a way where there's almost no top down right everything sort of becomes bottom up and what can eventually happen is bottom up can become massive and I think the ability of companies to create stars is going to be diminished and almost everything is going to be rising from a bottom up and then big companies will say oh I see this person they're successful and they'll try to attach to them but I think all the time about for instance on television I think you'll come in and you'll sit down and you will click on the latest app uploads from you know maybe it'll be people like you and me all coming together and like we'll have our own brand and it'll be under this brand umbrella right you can go kind of check because you know if people like you they might like me and you kind of get a affinity that way everything is so competitive and to me read Hastings has said it so brilliantly our competition is not HBO it's sleep and I think we're all competing against sleep I think there's so many you know I was talking about this with a buddy the other day sports used to be in the summer I'd sit around and watch the Braves on TBS I'd watch the the the Cubs on WGN whatever other game because everything else was a rerun on television yeah in the summer right now nowadays I think baseball struggles because stranger things three's coming out right like my kids watching stranger things right now yeah my oldest is my two younger be terrified I think if they got to watch it so we're all competing everywhere simultaneously I think the amount of audience will diminish but I think the intensity of that audience will grow such that people really really love the things that they love yeah it's interesting how when you're in these things even though we're in sort of different worlds that obviously have a lot of overlap that you start thinking about the same things because I've been getting offers left and right and what I keep coming back to is for the first time now just because of the craziness with YouTube and everything else I'll consider distribution offers yes just I just want my stuff to get out there I don't care whether you hopped in your automatic car and you can just say play room before it or it's some other way but that appeals to me rather than the reverse of the top down thing yeah I don't want to be associated with these big things that will ultimately one day come and get me so it's interesting how we all sort of end up hovering around the same ideas yeah and look I mean the reason why I love doing your show is I do think there's cross-pollination right I think people like we're gonna have you on my podcast I think some people will hear you on my show and they'll be like I never knew that guy existed oh I like him right and so I think it's it's going to be incumbent upon creators to find other creators that they like and sort of allow those two audiences to intermingle in some way to create bigger audiences for people of like minds let's just wrap with one other thing we talked about it right before we started just the way money is completely out of control yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I kept asking well who's the guy that just signed that crazy deal it's a denny green and this guy he's won a couple championships good three-point shooter decent player I don't think he's ever maybe made an old-school Lakers game of 30 million dollars 30 million for 15 15 million that these numbers are getting so out of control that at some point people are going to go to these games I mean I haven't been to I didn't go to one NBA game for the season for the first time in my life right I was just more because I was busy but it's like at some point these things will just price themselves out and everyone's just going to be like I'm not buying these eighty-dollar jerseys anymore I'm not buying twelve dollars so it is yeah I think what athletes are going to have to recognize is who pays their salary and I think this is I think an important lesson for anybody employed by anyone who pays your salary where does the money come from right following that thread to knowing how you get paid I think a lot of athletes have become comfortable alienating the fan bases that define their paychecks because they don't see that direct connection right because the television contracts are signed for 10 years because their contracts are guaranteed for multiple years but ultimately it's the fan pulling money out of his or her pocket that is justifying what you are allowed to make and I think whether it's Colin Kaepernick whether it's LeBron James alienating fans Megan Rapinoe for any reason is just bad business right and that's kind of the essence of my argument is that Michael Jordan had it right when he was asked how come you don't get intensely political because Republicans buy sneakers too he's not in the business of needing for everybody to know what he thinks about pull politics from one day to the next and I think as as athletes are trying to turn into repositories for political ideas good you know left right and different whatever they are it's bad for their brands and it's bad for the leagues overall all right follow Clay Travis's brand at Clay Travis on the Twitter."
