    "text": " For a year now, many women, including friends and family members of mine, probably friends and family members of yours too, have refused to get the COVID vaccine out of fear that it would disrupt their menstrual cycle. The experts called these women idiots conspiracy theorists anti-science rubes. The public health establishment spoke with one voice through the largest media channels in America to fact check and debunk these claims. The science we were told was clear. The COVID vaccines do not affect women's menstrual cycles. We're going to turn now to our doctor Jen Ashton, who has some answers to some of your more pressing medical questions. We'll start with the first one, Dr. Jen, is there a relationship between the vaccines and menstrual cycles? We've definitely talked about this. Oh, we sure have you guys and this is really spreading like wildfire on social media with zero scientific or medical basis for this. Remember in medicine every time we talk about a study of finding what is the first thing we say? Big difference between association and causation. So yes, women can get the vaccine and then experience changes in their menstrual cycle. That does not mean that one causes the other. And in fact, if you look at the biology of how these vaccines work, there is zero hormonal interaction. So please let's put that to rest. Yes, there's got a lot of attention because a school actually in Florida was telling teachers they use sight at this as a reason for not being vaccinated. Defy science. So always good to repeat. Thank you. Can you believe that a school was using this kind of rumor, this this thing spreading like wildfire? We put it to rest please. Okay, there's no evidence that the vaccines affect women's menstrual cycles. It's not even possible for the vaccines to affect women's menstrual cycles. It defies science except whoopsie Daisy turns out the vaccines change women's menstrual cycles. According to a new study published on Thursday in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology, just revealed that many women vaccinated against COVID-19 saw a delay in the onset of their menstrual periods compared to unvaccinated women. The National Institutes of Health have now admitted the possibility that the vaccines affect women's menstrual cycles and the establishment media, including ABC, which ran that segment that we just heard are admitting it to here's the ABC headline. COVID-19 vaccine linked to small temporary changes in menstrual cycles study finds. You see, it's just a small change. It's just a temporary change. The public health experts and media propagandists who told us for the better part of a year that this vaccine side effect was not only non-existent, but impossible are now telling us not to worry when it happens. If you still believe a word that comes out of these people's mouths, then I fear you are suffering from a side effect, not of the vaccines, but of the mass psychosis that our rulers have inflicted on society. I'm Michael Knowles. This is the Michael Knowles Show. Welcome back to the show. My favorite comment yesterday from Keith Shaw, who says the only comparison between December 7th, September 11th and January 6th is the amount of news coverage that they have received. That's true. That's true. Despite Kamala Harris saying that terrorists flying airplanes into buildings and killing 3,000 Americans is the same thing, very similar to a horn hat guy dancing around the Capitol Rotunda. Those events have nothing to do with one another, except the media coverage that they've gotten. And if the media succeed at mythologizing January 6th, they'll be thought of in much the same way in American history. That's a real downside of our propaganda machine that we have in this country. Now, if you want some upside, I would recommend you check out Get Upside. I'm thrilled to introduce an incredible app that everyone who buys gas needs to know about Get Upside.

Actually, I should go a little further. They're making 25 cents for every gallon, except for those first gallons. On your first fill up, you can actually get up to 50 cents cashback. All right.

You get the cashback very easily directly to your bank account or if you prefer through an Amazon gift card or through PayPal or a few other ways to. There's no cash, whatever, just cashback. Download the Get Upside app right now from Google Play or the app store. Use my promo code NOLS, K-N-O-W-L-E-S. You will get back up to 50 cents per gallon cashback on your first tank. That is code NOLS. I have no reason to believe that the relationship between the COVID vaccine and the menstrual cycle is anything more than a small and temporary change. It might very well be, just according to the study, it only delayed women's period by 15 hours, 17 hours. It might be a small change. The issue is the experts and the public health gurus and the officials and the media journalists, communicators, told us that this could not happen, that it was not possible, that not only was there no evidence for it, but it defied the science, which means that these people, the public health experts, the gurus, the journalists, are either idiots. They have no idea what's going on. They just don't know what they're talking about, in which case we shouldn't believe a word they say, or they're liars. They know that they're very likely as a link, but they think that it's better to downplay it or to deny it altogether because they don't want to discourage people from getting the vaccine. They're deceivers, in which case there's no reason to believe a word they say, or as I suspect is the case, they're both. I think they're actually idiots and liars, regardless, if you are still believing these people, the Fauci's and the, bringing on now, our network medical analyst is coming on to debunk all these, if you believe these people, I can't help you. After two years of this, of them getting caught in error after error and lie after willful, intentional lie after lie, I don't know how to help you. Then you're lost. You have been hypnotized because it's not just about this study or that study. It's not just about, well, do the masks really protect against this kind of particle or do they, or did Dr. Fetchy really think they didn't work or they really did work? It's not, well, does the vaccine really change the matter? How much? It's not about the details. It's about the fact that these people either have no idea what they're talking about or are lying to you or both. Some people still don't get it. Whoopi Goldberg, host of The View, just got the Ronan and she couldn't believe that she got the Ronan because she did everything that the public health experts told her to do. I left a couple weeks ago just before the break because somebody I had been around tested positive for coronavirus, so I left. So I've been going a long time, I feel. I was all excited and they have to test us. So they sent people to test me. They tested me and it was like, oh, no, you're not coming back. If we got somebody anybody to your house, you have corona. It was like, wait, what? It was a shock because I'm triple vax. I haven't been anywhere. I haven't done anything. But that's the thing about the Omicron. You just don't know where it is. You don't know where it is, who's got it, who's passing it. So it's one of those things where you think I've done everything I was supposed to do. Yeah, it doesn't stop on the crime. And that's the problem with a variant because it gets stronger and does different stuff to you. So unless everybody gets vaccinated, this is what we're going to be facing for the next little while. She's so close, but she still doesn't get it. Because did you hear what she said? She said, look, that's why we just all need to get vaccinated. Because right now what's happening is the unvaccinated or getting infected and the unvaccinated or allowing the virus to mutate and the unvaccinated or transmitting the virus. And so that's what we just all need to. We just need to more closely follow what these idiots are telling us to do. And then there won't be any more coronavirus except despite the fact that our rulers and the public health experts told us that the vaccines would stop us from being infected and transmitting the virus. They then reversed course and they admitted that the vaccines actually don't prevent you from contracting or transmitting the virus. What they can't do anymore is prevent transmission. You know, we didn't have vaccines that block transmission. We got vaccines that helped you with your health, but they only slightly reduced the transmission. We need a new way of doing the vaccine. The level of virus in the nasal farings of a person who's vaccinated and infected is the same level as the level of virus in the nasal farings of an unvaccinated person. Reports from our international colleagues, including Israel, suggest increased risk of severe disease amongst those vaccinated early. And if you look at Israel, which has always been a month to a month and a half ahead of us, they are seeing a waning of immunity, not only against infection, but against hospitalizations. And to some extent, death, the booster might actually be an essential part of the primary regimen that people should have. Everything we told you before isn't true, but do what we say now. That's what they're saying. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. And that's what whoopi Goldberg saying. She's saying, I did everything they told me to do and they told me I was going to be okay, but then I wasn't. And I got the vaccine and I got the booster and I, but I still got COVID. And I was around people with the vaccines and the booster and I still got, it doesn't make sense. Oh, I guess I better just keep doing what they tell me to do. I, it's so strange. I was told that the vaccines could not possibly change my menstrual cycle, but then they did. Guess I better listen to the experts more. No, no, I don't. I don't think that's true. I think that if you have two brain cells to rub together, I need to be so harsh. But if you have two brain cells to rub together, you must conclude at this point that whatever the experts tell you about COVID, about the vaccines, about the masks, about what you should have for breakfast in the morning is not credible. They might be right, but they'll only accidentally be right. They've squandered all of their credibility. It is as though people have been hypnotized.

It feels as though we are living in a mass psychosis. When you walk up to a friend of yours or a family member and they've got three masks on and they've taken 57 jabs and they tell you they've done everything. Dr. Fauci told them to do and then they're still getting the virus and they're still transmitting it. They can't make sense of it and they don't understand it, but they just keep doing what Fauci tells them to do. It seems as though a man with a long pocket watch must have hypnotized them. And that is what Dr. Robert Malone, who is one of the pioneers of the mRNA vaccines, though he's now become a big skeptic of the COVID response and of those vaccines, he went on Joe Rogan's show and he said, we are living in a sort of mass psychosis. What the heck happened in Germany in the 20s and 30s? Very intelligent, highly educated population and they went barking mad. And how did that happen? The answer is mass formation psychosis. When you have a society that has become decoupled from each other and has free-floating anxiety in a sense that things don't make sense, we can't understand it. And then their attention gets focused by a leader or series of events on one small point, just like hypnosis. They literally become hypnotized and can be led anywhere. And one of the aspects of that phenomena is the people that they identify as their leaders, the ones typically that come in and say, you have this pain and I can solve it for you, I and I alone, okay, can fix this problem for you, okay, then they will lead, they will follow that person through how it doesn't matter whether they lie to them or whatever. The data are irrelevant and furthermore, anybody who questions that narrative is to be immediately attacked. They are the other. So what Robert Malone is describing here is he's saying, it seems like people have gone crazy. It seems like the people who are still following the rulers and the leaders who have gotten everything wrong, the fact that they're still following them seems crazy and the fact that they're wearing all these masks and taking all these jobs and cowering in fear from the cough really seems kind of crazy, doesn't it? When he uses this phrase mass formation psychosis, it's just a strange, unusual way of saying it seems like our whole society's gone nuts. And we're all under the spell of a ruling class that petals its propaganda constantly. So in response to this, the ruling class and their propagandists issued a fact check and they said Reuters, Reuters fact check, there is no evidence to suggest a mass formation psychosis has occurred during the pandemic. Experts told Reuters, oh yeah, that's going to convince me that that didn't happen. Yeah, the fact that the hypnotists are denying it. Yeah, that'll totally convince me. Do what you're getting very, very sleepy. Yeah, you're getting sleepy sheep and you need to give me all of your rights and your way of life. Hey, I think that guy's hypnotizing us. No, no, I'm not. Uh, Dr. Fauci is totally not hypnotizing you. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. That's not whether it's, it's true or not. That is not going to be persuasive when the people that you accuse of doing something wrong deny it and don't provide any evidence as to how they're not doing that. It does, it does seem to me that the people who have led us, who have been exposed, repeatedly as not knowing what they're talking about or deceiving us that maybe they're doing something wrong. And maybe that the fact that we continue to follow them is a sign that we're not totally in our right minds. Fact checks are the cheapest form of propaganda out there because what a, what a fact check is, it was this phenomenon that really only became popular maybe 10 or so years ago. It was a way for left wing news outlets to turn left wing opinion columns into an unassailable news story. So many of these fact checks are simply presenting a left wing perspective on, on certain facts, but they say this is a fact, you have five Pinocchio's. This is a fact, mostly true, mostly false pants on fire. And because it's a fact you're not, you're not permitted to disagree with it. The right wing opinion here is that people have lost their minds, the people have gone crazy by following Dr. Fauci, that it does, that it's not rational to follow Dr. Fauci. And then the left comes out and they say, no, it is rational fact check, seven Pinocchio's. So give you an example of a really egregious fact check. Reuters again came out and they are focusing on vaccine adverse events, the side effects, the vaccine injuries, of which there are many. Since 1990, the US vaccine adverse event reporting system, VAERS, has provided data on any adverse reactions that have been reported following a vaccination. Anyone can submit a report, which gives the system transparency, but is also a limitation. You see what the fact check is, though, you know, you might be seeing a lot of events reported in VAERS, the vaccine injury system. You got to remember these aren't verified vaccine injuries. Okay. Anyone can submit a report. So there's a lot of problems here. You probably shouldn't believe all those vaccine injuries you see in VAERS. Okay. So from that quote unquote fact check, you would infer that vaccine injuries are over reported in the vaccine adverse event reporting system. Right. They're saying it's not verified. So presumably a lot of these are just not real ignore them. Forget about it. Except that not only are vaccine injuries not over reported in VAERS, they're significantly underreported. They're underreported by 99% actually. There's a 2010 HHS review that came out of the VAERS system, the vaccine adverse event reporting system, showed quote adverse events from drugs and vaccines are common, but underreported. Although 25% of ambulatory patients experience an adverse drug event, less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events and 1 to 13% of serious events are reported to the FDA. Likewise, there's the money line. Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported. This is from the Department of Health and Human Services. You can get this on the government website right now. Less than 1%. So if you just read the fact check, you would you would conclude the opposite of the facts. The fact is that there are a lot of vaccine injuries and they are drastically underreported. Almost none of them are reported relative to the total number of vaccine injuries. But wait a second. I thought we were told by the propagandists that vaccine injuries if either never happen or barely ever happen or look the other way or don't look at the man behind the curtain. Incredibly dishonest stuff. You're not just getting it out of Reuters in the propagandists. You're getting it from the Supreme Court. Sonia Sotomayor, the self-styled wise Latina woman on the Supreme Court. That's how she pitched herself to join the court. She was hearing oral arguments over the Biden administration's vaccine mandate. And she pulled a fact of of COVID hospitalizations at a thin air. We have hospitals that are almost at full capacity with people is severely ill on ventilators. We have over 100,000 children, which we've never had before in serious condition and many on ventilators. 100,000 children in very serious condition hospitalized. Many of that 100,000 on ventilators. That's just completely made up. There are right now, and this is the most wild, outlandish, generous liberal estimate. There were fewer than 3,500 pediatric hospitalizations from COVID. How many of those are really serious? Totally unclear. Because a lot of people are pretty trigger happy now. If they get the cough, they'll run to the hospital. Fewer than 3,500 hospitalizations. Very different than 100,000. I'm beginning to conclude that Justice Sotomayor may not be the wise,est Latina woman out there. I'm beginning to, but she went to very fancy schools. I think she went to Yale Law School. She's on the Supreme Court, and she seems to believe this stuff. If a United States Supreme Court Justice believes a completely outlandish delusion about the scope of the coronavirus epidemic, I suspect a lot of other people do too. I suspect that the fantasy is driving our discourse much more than the facts. And I suspect that we are living our lives and ordering our society and making our laws and rules much more based on fantasy than on fact. I think if people knew the facts about the risk to children, we would have reopened the schools much, much sooner. I think if people knew the facts about the COVID risk to relatively young, relatively healthy people, we would have gone back to work a long, long time ago. I just had COVID. I just recovered about a week ago. It wasn't pleasant, but it's fine. My whole family had. It wasn't pleasant. It's fine. People get sick. That's what happens. I think if women knew the facts about the now accepted reality that the vaccines can alter a woman's menstrual cycle, at least somewhat, then maybe they would be more reluctant to get it or they would have some justification for refusing to get it. If people knew the facts about the moral compromise involved in creating the vaccines, if people knew the risk, if people knew the realities here, and if people knew that the public health experts, quote unquote, and the officials and their propagandists in the media, if they knew that they were freaking lying to us and just getting stuff wrong constantly from the very beginning, they might look on this biomedical terror regime with a little more skepticism. But the liberal establishment has done basically a pretty good job at controlling the narrative with fact check after fact check after fact check that if you contradict it, you could be ostracized, censored, kicked out of society and no one will hear from you again. You know, when everyone else was kneeling, some men had the courage to stand alone. One of those men is NBA star Jonathan Isaac, who despite facing heavy criticism from the media for his views on social issues and vaccines over the past few years, still stood strong, which is why I'm extraordinarily excited to announce that he has decided to write a book with the Daily Wire called Why I Stand Jonathan's book will be about the rise of his basketball career, his journey into faith, and his strength to stand alone in the face of immense pressure. Check out this teaser. Your Lando magic's 23 year old starting forward is deeply religious and proudly unvaccinated on Friday Isaac got attention for choosing not to kneel in unison with his teammates or to wear a Black Lives Matter shirt. My name is Jonathan Isaac. I play for the Lando magic and I'm writing a book with the Daily Wire. Coverage does not mean the absence of fear. And in today's day, there are so many things that you can be afraid of facing because of believing what you believe or deciding to stand for what you believe in. And I believe this book gives you a blueprint of my story of how Christ has made the difference in my life from a young kid who struggled with fear, anxiety, self insecurity to a man willing to stand for what he believes in. I can't wait. It looks terrific. Jonathan is a great guy and I love the guts to stand firm. So his book will be one of the first under Daily Wire's new publishing arm, D.W. Books. We could not be happier to have him on board. The book is available for preorder now at Amazon. So reserve your copy today. We will be right back with a lot more. If you believe what Justice Sonia Sotomayor said during oral arguments on the vaccine mandate case, if you believe that there are a hundred thousand kids right now on death store in the hospital from COVID, you would probably be pretty freaked out. The fact that there aren't that she completely made that up is beside the point. If that were true, you would probably be pretty scared, which brings up the craziest tweet thread I think I've ever read. This was a tweet thread from Bob Walker. Bob Walker has a 28 year old son who got COVID. He writes, quote, I've been tweeting about COVID for nearly two years, but this week it became personal when my 28 year old younger son got it. With his permission, I'll describe his experience and how I approached the situation given the realities of life and the rapidly changing evidence. My son who lives in San Francisco is generally healthy but overweight, placing him in a moderately high risk group. Real nice to call your son fat and public, whatever. He's been quite careful since March 2020 and has received three Moderna's. He used to wear a two-ply cloth mask since Ami, I guess that's the nickname for Ami crumb, he switched to a KN95 with my encouragement in quotes. He works in downtown San Francisco in customer service, so he has a lot of people contact. I've worried that he'd get it from work or from the bus, but that's not how it happened. Instead, one of the few friends he sometimes sees in person, another fully-vax young person who has also been quite careful, came over Monday night to watch a movie. She felt fine as did he. Wednesday a.m. 36 hours later, he woke up and felt awful. Sore throat, dry cough, muscle aches, chills, no taste or smell abnormalities. I told him to stay home, drink fluids, and take Tylenol or Advil. Local pharmacies were all out of rapid tests, but I had one stashed away. He came outside, I wore a KN95 and we ran it with a nasal swab. It was negative. I was a little reassured, though he was not. Dad, it just feels like I felt after my vaccine, he said, he seemed sick enough to be infectious. I wondered if he'd be an example of the newly reported problems with false negative rapid tests in the first days of an ami-chron infection. He called the UC San Francisco hospital's COVID hotline. He's a patient to get a PCR or a color PC. This is, we're now six tweets in. We're six tweets and talks about the test that he got. It says, the next day I called him at 9 a.m. No answer. My brain knows the odds of a fully-vax young person dying or near zero. Still, I wondered briefly if he'd survived the night. Survived the night because he had a cough. Survived the night because he had the symptoms of a cold. Goes on and on and on and on. We now get to the 24th tweet in this thread. Should he have watched movies with his friend? I think so. It seemed like a fairly safe encounter, but while Ami is surging, even low risk stuff, things that were safe last month may now be risky. Given how quickly this storm may pass, it seems wise to hunker down a bit, just a few more years. Just hunker down a few more years, my son should be okay, but the illness and the anxiety it causes are miserable. Resigning ourselves to getting Ami-Kron doesn't seem right, especially since the surge may be short-lived. I still think it's an experience best avoided for you and your loved ones if you can. So I got to the end. I got to the end. I read the whole thing. I thought, oh, God, I hope his son doesn't die. That must be. That's the only reason you write a 25. No, his son is just fine. His son got the equivalent of a cold, his 28-year-old son, and is fine. That's the point. I could have done that in two sentences. He did it in 25 tweets. This is not just some random cooke. That wouldn't be news if it were some random cooke neurotic writing this 25 tweet thread. This man is the chairman of the medicine department at UC San Francisco. This man is one of the experts. He's one of the gurus leading us through this epidemic, and he has clearly lost his marbles. He is out of his mind, absolutely ravaged by fear and neurosis. I am older than this man's son by a few years. I have been smoking cigars since I was 15. I have not exercised since the Obama administration. When I got COVID, I didn't really tell anyone. I think I took a couple Advil once. I changed absolutely nothing about my behavior or life. Now I feel just fine. I hope that's reassuring. This man is saying that we shouldn't watch movies with our friends just a few more years to slow this spread. This is the evidence of the mass psychosis. Remember when Reuters said there's no evidence of mass, no evidence of hypnotism. This is the evidence. This is a psychosis. We need to stop this. How do you stop it? Because as anyone who's ever gotten into an argument with his wife can attest, saying calm down is not an effective strategy to get someone to calm down is saying, well, how do I stop being so nervous? Well, just don't be nervous. Well, easier said than done. So how do you do it? How do you get society to stop being so neurotic and terrified and on a hair trigger all the time? This is going to sound a little unorthodox. We need to stop testing for coronavirus. We just need to stop testing. We are all taking way to almost never take a test for coronavirus, but only when I absolutely am forced to it, basically at gunpoint, will I do it? But a lot of people are taking a lot of tests for the coronavirus. Stop it. You should stop doing it. The consensus view, as you heard from the Washington Post, Paul Kane on CNN, is that we just need more tests in America. He's actually criticizing Joe Biden because Biden is not sending out enough tests. Which is it right now that is the biggest problem given the Omicron surge and what we're looking at right now? It's the worst kind of problem. They have a policy problem and a messaging problem. The policy side is they went with a vaccine-only approach practically, not entirely, but very close. They thought they could vaccinate their way out of this problem. Phil, how many times in 2020, when you were back up on the hill, how many times did Nancy Pelosi start press conferences by saying testing, testing, testing every single time? Every single time, she said, testing, testing, testing. This administration, with all the money in the world from the bipartisan deals of 2020 and the unilateral Democratic $1.9 trillion bill in March, they had all the money in the world for testing, and they just didn't focus on it. That was a huge mistake. It's a huge mistake. They were always going to need testing to get out of the school issue. Now the messaging in terms of what comes out of the CDC is just as confusing as it ever was. Why do we need more testing? Why did we always need more testing to get out of the school issue? Here's how I would get out of the school issue. Go back to school. I, Governor of whatever state, I, President of the United States, I, Mayor of Palucaville, I say go back to school, shut up teacher unions, go back to school. You'll be fine. People have gone to school during flus during colds, during epidemics. It's fine. Just go back to school and shut your mouths. That's how you do it. But no, you need the testing. Why do you need the testing? On the contrary, testing will not allow us to get back to normal. It will stop us from ever getting back to normal because when you test, when you test everyone in the country all the time for a mild illness, you're going to get some positive results. And when everyone is constantly on a hair trigger about locking down and, and, and terrified, deathly terrified of this virus, then every time you get a positive test, you're going to shut down the schools again. This is what's happening for my friends and relatives. They send their kids to these schools or preschools and then one kid test positive and they shut this place down for a week. But if you test everyone all the time for an extraordinarily contagious virus that isn't really that dangerous to the vast, vast, vast majority of people, you're always going to get a positive test and you're always going to lock down. The reason that the liberal establishment is now clamoring for more tests is because they don't want the epidemic to go away. They always want these emergency powers. They always want to be able to rule you with whim and caprice. And they never want you to question what they're saying, even when what they're saying is contradicting what they said the day before. This is a power play. This has been a power play from day one. They've done everything they can in terms of the vaccines. They've done everything that they said was going to work in terms of locking down and making everyone wear masks and that didn't really work. They haven't done everything they can in terms of getting therapeutics out there. They've actually suppressed a number of therapeutics that that would have helped some people to recover from the virus more quickly. They have said, no, forget about that because they've taken as that Washington Post correspondent says a vaccine only approach and they didn't want therapeutics to get into the way of the narrative that everyone needs to take the vaccine. So that was one big mistake. But they've done what they are going to do. And just testing everyone and freaking everyone out all the time over what is effectively for the vast majority of people a mild cold is only going to prolong this. Do you know who gets this? Maybe one man in America who is in elected office gets this. That would be Rhonda Santas down in Florida who says we've got to stop the testing. Now think about it before COVID. Did anyone go out and seek testing to determine if they were sick? It's usually you feel like you're sick and then you get tested to determine what you're what you may be have come down with. And so this is kind of a new thing where they've been saying just go out and test all the time. And again, you're free to do it. But I think what the DOH guidance from Florida is saying is that is unlikely to yield very much clinical value for you. And it's also creates a lot of prop second order follow up problems. It's essentially a lockdown by stealth in the sense of if you test positive but you're not sick or have symptoms, you may have to isolate. They don't even know the test can't tell you if you're even infectious or not. And these PCR tests, you can test positive for weeks after you've been infected months even in some cases. And so what happens is blanket testing of healthy people, it leads to some kids being not not in school, at least the people not being able to go to work in some doing some of these isolation, which is may not even be justified. Absolutely right. 100%. This guy gets it. This guy gets it. All that more testing is going to lead to is more lockdowns. When did we start taking tests to find out if we were going to get sick? Now, what the libs are saying in response is you idiot Rhonda Santis. What about cancer screenings? Because Rhonda Santis his wife is struggling with cancer and she's fighting against cancer right now. They're saying you idiot, you, you, you don't even know that people get cancer screenings to make sure that they, they aren't sick. That's true. For certain very, very deadly illnesses, we will every year or two years or five years or 10 years get certain tests done to make sure that everything's looking good. Because in some cases, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. We don't do that for the flu. We don't do that for the common cold. We shouldn't do that for COVID, which let's say is stronger and more dangerous than the flu to some degree. I don't think we would do that for double flu, super flu, super duper mecca cold. We wouldn't, we wouldn't do that sort of thing. You, you wait until you get sick. If, if there were 100,000 kids right now dying on ventilators and hospitals from COVID, that would be a different story. If the narrative we were told about COVID by the public health experts were true, that might be a different story, but it's not. It's been proven wrong time and time again. And so when you look at what the facts actually are, you should calibrate your policy to the facts. And that's very inconvenient for the liberal establishment, which is trying to use this cough to completely reorder society. And to a large degree has succeeded at doing that. Speaking of reordering society, I'm sure everyone was glued to their screens this weekend, watching the sports event of the year, the hotly contested women's Ivy League 100 meter race. Right? Of course we, we, we, we watch that. We set our alarms. We say how, and this is very important now, especially because it's a matter of social justice, because now in women's college sports, men are competing men who say that they're women so that they can set new records and break new ground for men taking stuff from women. Okay. The headline from the women's Ivy League 100 meter race is that the Yale transgender swimmer beat the feet, beat the pen transgender swimmer in the women's competition. Bullabula, hooray for justice. Now, when most people read this, they assumed it was a dude who's pretending to be a woman beat another dude who's pretending to be a woman at the women's sport. And this just shows you how awful it is and transgenderism destroying women's sports. But there's a twist to this story, which is that the Yale transgender swimmer is a woman who wants to become a man, but she allegedly hasn't started taking hormones or chemicals yet. So she's still allowed to compete on the women's team. And the pen transgender swimmer is a man who is pretending to be a woman, but he is obviously physically much bigger and stronger than all the other women. So he keeps winning all the races, but he lost to the girl who's pretending to be a man. This actually throws a wrench into the transgenderism narrative of a lot of people on the right. But it doesn't throw a wrench into my theory on transgenderism. I can't believe it. We talked about this. I think on the very last episode of the show on Friday, Thursday or Friday of last week, I mentioned that, and I've said this before as well, that it's a mistake for conservatives to stake their argument against transgenderism on fairness in women's sports or some other disingenuous point that no one really cares about. I don't really care who gets the metal at the women's track meet. What's wrong with transgenderism is not that it takes some accolades away from 11th grade girls. What's wrong with transgenderism is that it contradicts reality. If you stake your argument against transgenderism on women not being able to compete in women's sports anymore, then this story about the Yale trans swimmer beating the pen trans swimmer completely destroys your argument, because in this case, the woman beat the man. And that's going to happen sometimes. I don't really know the details here. It's being reported that the woman is not on any steroids. It's being reported that the man tried his hardest and he didn't throw the race. And I don't know, but maybe, maybe one in a million, the woman beats the man. It could be the case. So then that's not a big deal. Okay, good. That's fine. Then the men can compete in women's sports and the women have a fighting chance. If fairness in women's sports is the standard, conservatives just lost. If reality is the standard, conservatives still have an argument. When we stake our arguments on statistics, we're going to lose because there are lies, damned lies and statistics. When when the Rhonda Santas was talking about this too, if you're staking your argument as to why we shouldn't completely reorder society and take away all of people's rights and close all the churches and shut down business and have a massive transfer of wealth, largest in human history from the poorer classes to the upper classes. If you're basing that on testing statistics or even hospitalization statistics, you're going to lose because everyone's got their own statistics. If you base it on justice, you're going to have a much better argument. It is unjust to take away all people's rights and give it all to Dr. Fauci, the schmuck who lies out of both sides of his mouth every single day. That would be unjust regardless of the statistics. Then you've got a strong argument. It's unjust. It's just simply wrong for men to pretend to be women in our society. It's just not right. They're not women and we shouldn't indulge delusion and the truth will set you free. If you make that argument, then transgenderism is still preposterous. But if you try to make the squishy, we're all individuals, kind of libertarian, you do you, I'll do me, but don't infringe on my right to win the trophy. If you make that argument, you're not going to win. The Yale trans swimmer just destroyed your argument. Speaking of weird sex stuff, Britney Spears is celebrating her release from her conservatorship, the hashtag free Britney campaign by tweeting out a fully nude photo of herself, or I suppose posting it to Instagram. The caption reads, quote, free woman energy has never felt better. And I'm beginning to think maybe this free Britney campaign was not such a great idea after all. 12 year old Michael, I'm sure is furious right now with 31 year old Michael for complaining about a naked photo of Britney Spears. That's probably that's probably true. But I have to complain about it because this is not a great idea. It actually does undermine the free Britney argument because this is pretty strange, wacky, self destructive behavior. Now, Britney Spears is a pop star and pop stars do these sorts of things. So it's not completely out of the ordinary. But the purpose of a conservatorship is to put some constraints on people's autonomy and individual choices, because they are not capable of handling their freedom. Right? And maybe it's because you've got some mental problem. Maybe it's because you've got a drug problem. But the idea behind a conservatorship is not to take away your freedom, but actually to protect your freedom from your own basis desires and your own basis inclinations, which will destroy your freedom. It gets down to this argument that we're having on the right right now about what freedom really is. And the libertarians are saying that I'm painting with something of a broad brush, but generally, the libertarians are saying freedom is the ability to do whatever you want whenever you want to do it. If I want to do drugs and and sleep around and have all sorts of self destructive behaviors, that's my freedom. And the conservatives are saying, no, freedom isn't the ability to just do whatever you want whenever you want to do it. Freedom is the right to do what you ought to do. So for the libertarian point of view, the modern liberal point of view, freedom is the heroin addict shooting up heroin. But the conservative knows that the heroin addict is not free. He's actually a slave to his own basis desires. If a society treats its freedom as an excuse to just get naked and dance around and do a bunch of drugs and sleep around and abuse liberty to licentiousness in the words of our founding fathers, then we're not going to stay free for very long. That kind of people is not capable of freedom. And so some guardrails are going to have to be put on their individual choice. And that's what you're seeing happen in your government. I don't really care that much about the Britney Spears story in and of itself, but I care about the political significance of it. What we have done as a people in recent decades is strip naked and post a bunch of pictures of ourselves on Instagram, literally in many cases, but figuratively as well. We have abused our freedom to licentiousness. We have proven ourselves incapable of freedom in many instances. We can't even really conduct elections anymore. No one trusts the result of our national elections anymore. Democrats didn't trust 2016, Republicans don't trust 2020. Democrats don't trust 2000. We can't we we've torched our cities over the past year. And by we, I mean, leftists have torched the cities over the past year. We don't we can't defend our national borders. We can't educate ourselves. We're not. And so what's going to happen inevitably is someone is going to impose order from without. If we are not capable of freedom, then someone else is going to impose order from outside. That's the way it goes here. Before we go, I need to get to one point from Justice Neil Gorsuch, because this is to talk about fake news going around about COVID. Justice Gorsuch was hearing the oral arguments in the case over the Biden vaccine mandate. Gorsuch said that every year, a lot of people die from the flu. This was misreported as Gorsuch saying that every year, hundreds of thousands of people die from the flu. Flu kills, I believe hundreds of thousands of people every year. So this was reported as him saying flu kills hundreds of thousands of people a year. But what you heard right there, it was a transcription error, what he said was it kills hundreds, thousands of people a year. Now, that's true in the United States. In the United States, flu kills tens of thousands of people a year. And there were all the fact checkers saying Gorsuch got this wrong. It's actually only tens of thousands of people. But worldwide, flu does kill hundreds of thousands of people every year. And it's a lesson for all of us. Okay. He didn't say that. But if you look at flu worldwide, even the thing that the fact checkers were debunking actually is true. And it puts a lot in perspective here, folks. We used to live with illness. We used to live with risk. We used to live with some degree of personal responsibility. And now we're not willing to do that. We're all cowering in the corner and writing 25 tweet threads about how scared we are of getting the cough. That kind of a people is not going to be capable of freedom and the way of life that we once cherished. So which is it? Which way American man? I'm Michael Knolls. It's the Michael Knolls Show.
