    "text": " Hey, this is Box Sexton and you're listening to the Tudor Dickson Podcast, part of the Clay Travers and Box Sexton Podcast Network. Welcome to the Tudor Dickson Podcast. I'm Tudor Dickson and today is going to be a great conversation with a dear friend of mine, Yaku Boyens. Yaku has been fighting sex trafficking for years and it's a subject that's incredibly important to him. It actually led him down a documentary film path to expose what is really happening with the sexualization of our kids in America. His latest documentary Sex Nation was released on March 23rd. Yaku Boyens, the founder and CEO of After Eden Pictures. Thank you for joining me today. Thank you, Tudor. It's always an honor to be with you. Thank you for your amazing work. Appreciate you. Well, thank you for your amazing work. So for people who have not met you or not heard the wonderful things that you have to say, can you explain a little bit about how you got into this? I think sometimes people hear this and they're like, well, why would this be the career path? But you have a pretty interesting background with this. Yeah, thanks. In 1994, I was 18 and that year my sister was 12, Ilanka, and that's the year my sister Ilanka was trafficked. And it led us on a path of six years of getting Ilanka back and not knowing anything of human trafficking is an 18 year old boy back in 94 human trafficking or child sexual exploitation. They were not even terms people were using Tudor, you know, so they would just think runaway, right? But you learn a lot in that process as a family we raised by a single mom, so me and my brother, looking for a sister and then as God would have it, he protected Ilanka and she was rescued in 2001. And then we moved to the United States. We immigrated to the US right after. And at that moment, I literally heard God say not another one and we've been fighting. So that's 28 years ago, 28 years of combating the sexual exploitation of children around the globe, 53 countries around the world we've worked in. In 2012, I really grew a heart just for the 50 states of the United States. I became a citizen and just said, we're going to fight here. We're going to defend the American child. This is 2012 when we made that focus decision and now we've been fighting it since 01 in the US, but we worked in so many other countries. But it became clear to me that America, the light on the shining light on the heel, if we do not back then even turn the rudder back towards the heart of God and the nuclear family and defend the innocent that we were going to potentially lose our nation. And here we are in 2023 dealing with unthinkable things. I've seen you recently talking about exactly what you're saying that we're headed toward losing the country, but you've taken, I mean, obviously this is your life's work, but you've kind of peeled back the layers of the onion and looked at TikTok. Look at the sexualization of our kids. Do you believe that? I mean, we've talked a lot about the influence of TikTok, the influence of social media. Do you believe that there is a bad actor in one of these other nations that is foisting this upon our kids? Yes, and then some tutor just without question and none of this is conspiracy. We've got actual empirical data to show. We've intercepted communications. For instance, people don't know about Pornhub is not an American owned company. It's housed in Canada, but it's really owned by man wind. It's on an island. And so the foreign entities have absolutely targeted America and are infusing a sexual narrative into our culture proactively and in this film in Sex Nation. And thank you for talking about it. We go back to the Garden of Eden and then we jump to the Roman Empire, the Persian Empire, and then we take a leap to 1933. And there's a particular day in 1933 where I argue and we have data to prove it, I argue where we started to lose the battle for our children in 1933. Wow, wow. And that is John Dewey and Joseph Stalin. And Joseph Stalin has a tremendous influence on the American public education system. And nobody talks about it. We've dug so deep tutor because I wanted to know I was praying saying, God, show me the route. Where did America? I went back to the notes on the Constitution. I was meeting with David and Tim Barton saying, what happened right after the Mayflower? When did we lose our way for where we were willing to defend the child? In 1933, it's the marker that we found. This, that's where America became a nation that started to point towards a new modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah. And so it's been coming a long time. And we walked through the 60s, you know, of course, Afrikaans, he walked through the 50s, the 70s, the 90s, all the way to today. And then in this film, there's a massive trumpet call at the end of the film, in the third act of the film, with real tactical solutions of what we can do to turn this nation back to the heart of God, back to morality. So we're talking about the world. That's something that parents don't, I don't know how to say this, because I think even me coming into this, I learned a lot from you over the past few years. But as a parent growing up in this new age of technology, because we didn't have this growing up, I've learned a lot about how careful you have to be to prevent this from happening to your kids, because they are bombarded with this over-sexualization. And we're seeing this even in politics now, where if you don't accept it, then you are not inclusive. You're a bad person. You are morally wrong if you don't accept this. So how do you get past that and say, I'm going to put up those barriers for my children? Yeah. And look, it's always, we now have, look, tomorrow, next week, we have a Trans Day of Vengeance. Yeah. Vengeance, right? And Trans Day of Vengeance in DC. And it is, except us, basically, except demonic forces, except the agreement of abandoning God or else. And, Twitter, you're asking me a question. The only answer I have here is, you stand. You stand. You stand on the rock. You stand on the Word of God. You stand on absolute truth. Sexuality is not fluid. Truth is not fluid. The history of our nation is not fluid. You teach the good, the bad, the ugly, the indifferent. If we don't, the second you embrace and engage in a conversation of even discussing, I refuse to engage in a conversation of what is a woman other than one who was born with a womb end of conversation. Done. I will not even pander or even give credibility or credit to the conversation because the second you do, they chip away at the iceberg. And unfortunately, this attack on our nation, children are always the one suffering. The biggest price, as we saw in Nashville, in sexualization of children in classrooms, you ran such an incredible campaign. And I'm not just saying that. I watched and if I could be, I was so excited to see what you stood for because I felt like, yes, Kerry Lake ran an incredible campaign of saying, can we get back to the nuclear family? Can we get back to the heart of America? Who we're really supposed to be the call from God on our nation? And now we've got Putin, Vladimir Putin, a very bad guy, accurately portraying America saying, look at them. They sexualize their children. Look at them. Well, and that's what I mean when I say our, our enemy is taking advantage of this. Have they caused this or are they taking advantage of it? Because we have a lot of confusion going on. But you actually, I saw you talking the other day about how this imagery and these concepts that are pushed on kids, the over sexualization, pushline kids is actually changing their brain chemistry. It's changing their desires. But how is it affecting them mentally? Because I think one of the things that young people are really told, not openly, but the it's the indication is that sex is emotionless. You can go from partner to partner. And it's just a thing that happens. But it actually is something that changes who you are. And those partners are part of you the rest of your life. And it's very emotion. It's very emotional and it affects you permanently. Three parts to sex. And this is, and you cannot get away from this. There's data, there's this physiological data on this. Sex is emotion, body and spirit. It's spiritual. It's spiritual. There's a connection. There's a soul tie that forms. This is why every culture on society, I can take you to African tribes in the middle of the bush. There's never even heard of the gospel of Jesus Christ that consummate marriage with sex. Every human group, people group on the planet, understand the power when a man and a woman come together. Or for that sake, in a gay relationship, there's power, there's a spiritual soul tie that is formed. If it's not healthy, it breaks people. There's physical engagement and emotional engagement. But we call it imprinting. Any human behavioral scientist worth this salt will tell you. It's like memory foam. When you press your hand into a memory foam mattress and you lift it, it rebounds as it recoils. Sex does not. Every partner, every partner you've ever had and will have leaves a permanent imprint in your trajectory as a sexual being. And you are a sexual being. So if you predispose a child to sex, prepubility, even just in conversation, do you know to our test have shown this? And Kinsley did this. Alfred Kinsley did this at the Kinsley Institute and he knew how effective this would be. If you mention a particular sexual act to a child, prepubility, a child that had not been exposed to it immediately by hearing the words, the brain starts producing a hormone. The brain starts firing neurons that were supposed to be dormant until puberty. The brain is now starting to create a demand for that particular dopamine effect. So they know what they're doing. They know in the classroom, if they talk to a five year old about masturbation, that the child is going to explore it. So think about what you're saying because you're talking about it triggers hormones. Hormones are triggering emotions, thoughts, growth, the different changes in your body. Hormones are so key. I think that people mistakenly believe that hormones are just, it's just because we say, oh, there's hormones flaring you that hormones are just something that happens in a relationship when you get older or it just it just moves puberty along. But hormones affect every part of your body for the rest of your life. And we're talking about putting these kids on puberty blockers that block their hormones. And I think that's something that people are not understanding what this is doing. It is permanently sterilizing kids. But think about this, how twisted is it that you would sexualize kids young and then chop up their body parts and put them on these puberty blockers so that they never actually understand the relationship and that power you said of the bond of sex because they never even experience it. You'll destroy it for them. They cannot tutor. They cannot. It is the ultimate. There is no, hear me today. There's no more powerful weapon on the face of the earth other than sex. Sex can ultimately destroy. If you weaponize it now, it was built for good. It was built so a man would leave the house of his father and his mother and cling to the woman become one. You actually become one. You lose a part of yourself with a partner. They know this. It alters brain chemistry. Do you know that you can research this? There's not been a mass murderer in history. Ted Bundy, they were all porn addicts, all of them with sex addicts, every single one of them, most of them abuse sexually as children. There's cognitive dissonance happening. There's brain chemistry. The women that just shot up children in Nashville. There's abuse in her history. There's trance. There's a complete abandonment of real identity. It's a desperate human being with major cyto-storms, brain storms going on. Chemical imbalance. What happens to a woman if she has an underperforming thyroid, overperforming thyroid, major drama, incredible complications. But we're now just going to super impose and play God by messing with hormones. Not just that. Let's talk about COVID. Spike proteins and DNA. It affects the human condition and the brain. So much today, we say mental illness. It's produced mental illness. We encourage, we encourage this function. Then we chemically treat it in this society. We over treat and we have a very vast majority of Americans that are mentally not stable because, harmonally, they're in a storm. Let's take a quick commercial break. We'll continue next on the Tutor Dixon podcast. No matter what we are trying to tell people we can fix, it's always with a drug. Whether it's mental illness, whether it's obesity, whether it is the fact that you are going through a tough time. It's always we're going to come to you with some drug or COVID and this will fix your problem. But ultimately, how many people are put on medications that don't actually solve that problem and cause new problems? I think that's a significant problem that is happening. But it also is leading to people to believe that you can do something like cut your body parts off and then be happy. And I think that there's a lot of mystery around this because people don't really understand when they say, well, we're going to alter you. You have the top surgery. You have the bottom surgery. Look, I will be totally open with you. I've obviously had the top surgery because I had breast cancer and going through that surgery, thinking about a 13 year old girl going through the surgery at 15, 18, whatever it is, before you walk into that OR and I was in a situation where what choice did I have? It was either that or cancer. And so when you go into that OR, they say to you, we don't know how much feeling you're going to have when you come out of this. This is the stuff that they don't tell you when they glorify changing your body. And I got to tell you, it's tough. You know, you don't have any feeling. You're lucky if you get some feeling back. But how are these kids when they're 18 years old, they have nothing? No. I mean, how do you even connect with your own body when you can't feel it? And in the bottom surgery, I've read the stories that are just horrendous where it's just totally numb. And I know this is like, this is pretty, I mean, we're getting into some pretty graphic details right now. But I think somebody needs to be honest about the fact that these are butchers. These doctors should be put in jail for what they're doing. If you don't have a medical emergency to have some type of surgery like this, the outcomes are not, this is not a good way to live. It's great if that's your only choice for living. But to do this to healthy body parts is criminal. Tudor, we cannot live in a world where we operate in silos, where we look at a certain thing like one size fits all. That was the disaster with COVID. This is one solution. That's not how life works. Even you as a grown woman, you go through top surgery. Think about the discussions you had with your doctor. Think about your time to research complications. Think about your time to weigh options. Think about your time to look at alternative medicine, etc, etc. Doctors swore an oath to disclose all the risk. They don't do that anymore. The 12 year old doesn't have the cognitive ability to even weigh options or decide, do I or don't I? It's a lifetime decision. But here's what happened. Your surgery happened most likely post your growth phase. When your growth hormones stopped firing, a girl basically stops at 18 men at 28 front to lobe 28. This is why women are smarter than men because it takes us a long time to develop. I love you for some reason. But think now, the 12 year old is just starting puberty. It's just starting growth phase. Now the body has what's called phantom limb syndrome, which our Marines have when they lose a limb. They wake up with nightmares in the night and they feel pain in their leg, but there's no leg. This is what's happening to these 12 year olds. You're not just mutilating them when they're an adult in certain hormones and the body has stopped firing. The growth is there. You didn't grow much after 18. Now she's 12. She's starting her womb, her uterus, her ovaries. It's starting. And we're saying now's the time. Come on, let's mutilate or at five. Let's give him luprin, which by the way, is a drug. It's a prostate cancer drug that sterilizes grown men. Talk to Rudy Giuliani. He had luprin. He'll tell you. I mean, this is serious, serious issues. And we're dealing with it in culture like, I would don't offend because the trans LGBTQ alphabet, they make it upset, get upset, I'm upset. That's exactly right. Because I'm not mutilating children. I recently had a friend who there are three young women transitioning at 13 in the school. And she said, you know, I just, I think this is really questionable whether or not this is the right thing for these kids to do. I'm not sure if they really get this. And the other parents were outraged and said, how could you possibly say, we have to do what's best for their health? And I mean, it is honestly like an old, an old movie where you're, it's like the Twilight zone, you know, you're like, am I the only one here that says, what are you doing to these kids? And I think that we need to really examine the puberty blockers are not changing your child from a girl to a boy. They're stopping them from growing, stopping them from those critical moments in life where their, their hormones are growing their brain, they're growing their bodies, they're growing their desires. There's all kinds of things that are happening. So they don't even know themselves at this point because they have not grown into who they will eventually be. And so now we're stopping that process from even happening. It's not that you're just not allowing them to become a girl, you're stopping any growth process from happening. We've seen, we've heard horror stories of kids that ended up having all of their estrogen blocked, went into early osteoporosis, ended up in wheelchairs. These are, this is experiment, this is experimenting, it's experimenting on children. And we are taking away a key part of their body, their hormones are a key part of their growth system with no idea how this works. No idea what the ultimate outcome is. And then you question why these kids end up going crazy, why these kids have so many hardships in life. Well, we don't know what we even did to their brains. And we won't know for decades. You know, a couple things I want to say, and if I go off track, just you just steer me back because I just wanted to be with you. The original sin in the Garden of Eden, for those who believe or don't believe, Satan, his sin was pride. What's the movement called? Pride, right? It's a pride movement. It's, we will mutilate children to get our agenda accomplished, to make it's a self-fulfilling prophecy for us to feel like we have value. You have to be okay with mutilating children. You have to be okay with pedophilia. As a matter of fact, they're not pedophiles, they're minor attracted persons, right? They're sick human beings that should not walk around freely. They should go to prison for the rest of their lives and I'll pray for them in prison that they may meet their maker in prison, but they shouldn't have access to children. No, we should not celebrate a Trans Day of Vengeance. Vengeance, can you imagine if we said that we want a day of vengeance against any other sector of society, unions, or minors, or what it's insanity in our culture, here's why. I've prayed about this so much to the white children. People ask me, always white kids, what leave the kids alone, why kids? Because I firmly believe the greatest pain you can inflict on God's heart is in fact to Robert Child of that child's virtue and innocence. And the enemy knows this. And it's a godless movement in our country and unfortunately tutor. The only thing needed for evil to exist is for good men to do nothing. So those who stand idly by and watch and don't want to engage because I don't want to get canceled. I don't want to ruffle the feathers. I don't want to, you're complicit. You're allowing it to happen. You are already in the game. You serve the prince of darkness or the prince of light. There's no other, there's no in between. We've come to that point in culture where people have to engage. This silent majority nonsense got to go. Let's take a quick commercial break. We'll continue next on the tutor Dixon podcast. So they would say that you are, you're the problem. You're attacking the kids. This is nasty. How can you do this? And that's why so many people step back. And I think that you made it really clear adults, it's a different situation. You want to do something like this as an adult. You make this decision once you're fully grown. That's a totally different story. But you as an adult push this on kids, you as an adult say you did this and you want other people to do this, you as an adult are performing the surgery, taking pictures to kids, exposing kids to this. That is not okay. But it is being told to people that it is not okay for you to come out and say, that's not okay. So how do you, you say that you have to stand up, you're so good at this. How do you get other people to do it though without fear of being told? Because yeah, I think it's the manipulation is they come to you and they say, if this is the way you feel, you will be the cause of children dying. And that's hard. That's a hard thing to hear. Yeah, that's the reverse because there's no data. And the truth will set you free. They throw things out like yesterday, they'll say things like, I'll give you an example. Comprehensive gun reform. Okay, what's comprehensive gun reform? They can't tell you. They cannot tell you comprehensive, you know, transgender health care or health care for children. It's these great grandiose words with no definition. They can't tell you what it is because they don't have a plan. There's no plan. There's no data. So there's what we do. We educate people. I go home to home at times, sometimes thousands of people. The other night I was in a house in Dallas Texas with 36 people in a home educating the parents on the truth. There's no data that says that if you stop puberty blocks as the kids that kids die, they haven't been dying because you don't give them puberty. They're dying because you're doing it. Go look at the suicide rate of the trans children. Go look at the suicide rate of trans individuals. Go look at the suicide rate of people who are fluid with their sexuality. Go look at those numbers. We've got data there for you all day long. Go look at the sexualization of children who have fallen into the trans movement. Trans people will say to me, well, trans kids get sexualized. Yeah, you did this to them. Pretty close to them and serving them on a platter to the predator. So when we bring truth, real data numbers don't lie. The truth to parents and we say, look, the thoughts you have quietly, the things that you think quietly will say them out loud so that you can feel permission to say them also. This is not an attack on anybody. This is a preservation and a protection of the innocent, the voiceless, the child, because we rescue sex trafficking victims. Do you know the disaster it is to restore that life? Oh, that's the thing. Once you've done this, and that's the reversible part of this where they say it's reversible. That's the part that makes me so mad because, you know, how do you rebuild? I mean, you see these detransitioners whose bodies are destroyed. They don't, they still don't feel like they've ever known who they are. But remember, when you're going through puberty, how many people are like, no, I completely know who I am. I'm perfect now. Everybody feels that way. And I think these groups are preying on that moment in life where things are confusing, where you're learning who you are, where you're discovering what life is and how little life you know at 12 years old. And so these folks are coming in and preying upon these kids, but you have these doctors that are knowing that they're doing it. So there's a doctor, I can't remember the university. I think it's a local Michigan university that was, she did a pod, well, not a podcast. She did, she taped her training for, for the students at the university medical center. And she was training on transgender surgeries. And she said, I go to the, the boys and I explained to them that you're going to have a low libido. And they don't really understand the technical term. Well, I don't think that's the technical term anyway. And she said, so I just tell them that your things aren't going to work like they used to. Well, guess what? That is then not telling them the truth. That is not sitting there and talking to them about what that genuinely means. You will have desire. You will never get there. You will never achieve that feeling with another person. I mean, I hate to say it, but we are lying about the fact that these kids are impotent. They want to have a relationship. They want to be able to experience sex and they never get to. Let's talk about the 80% globally, 80% of people who want to retransition, right? Who now in the 25 and 30 year olds, when your natural clock starts taking as a woman and you, you become eternal. You know, women walk and they see a baby, they smell a baby. And their hormones are firing. You know, this is going to happen. But now you can't. Now the body starts rejecting itself. The body starts fighting itself. Here's what happens. Fractioning happens. Personality split, the brain splits and trauma is formed in the brain to cope with the trauma. From the past, you have insane people. It's called fractioning. You've got literal personality disorder produced by chemical imbalance and trauma and hope deferred and a yearning to be who God called you to be, but you cannot. You can go get the breast back. But the hormonal damage, the emotional trauma and the damage, you don't fix that with surgery. It's not possible. I think the best way that you can explain this to someone, a woman who's gone through childbirth, it's so funny how your body, you're right, your body just experiences that and your body knows and your body expects because you can be a woman who gave birth, you had your breastfeeding, your baby, you've just breastfed your baby, you can hear another baby cry and you feel that melt come in and you're like, how does my body know that? You know, your body is so magical. It works in such amazing ways. And then you shut that off and you destroy that, you take that away from people and the body is so confused. I can't imagine where the mind is left. So because they'll tell you, well, what is a man? What is a woman? So bring me one person on planet Earth, just one tutor, not a thousand one. One person that was not born with a uterus that has ever experienced what you just spoke of. They haven't, they can't, I cannot, I can, I can never, I don't have the maternal instinct. I don't produce milk. I don't like, I don't just hear a baby cry and my body reacts. I also don't have the ability to deliver a baby from my womb and excruciating pain. And then God gave me a chemical in my brain to forget the pain. So I'm willing to do it again. Right. Yeah, that's true. Yes. It is true. I mean, I think about that. I think it is crazy to think that I got to have that blessing and go through that. And it is something, but I mean, it's so different. It is so different to go through that because I obviously went through that four times. And it is just so different. The mom, then the dad and for the dad, even the bonding is different. If we've gone through this, we know we're different and we're just robbing people of this. And it's very tough for me to not have these open conversations. And I think that this has been great for me to be able to come out of the campaign and have this ability to bring some of my favorite people together who are so willing to openly talk. And this is the best part of being able to have this platform is these hard conversations about robbing children of, I think, the very beginning of this conversation. You talked about that bond that is created in a sexual relationship. Imagine never being able to have that. When you when you're in the movie in Sex Nation, the film Sex Nation, which I really encourage people to watch, I break down the human sexual timeline. And what happens when you accelerate the timeline? I break it down literally in a whiteboard fashion. And I show why God ordained certain things. This for the same reason, the average age of sex trafficking victims in America are girls age 12 through 14. The predator knows she is confused. She is going to like boys older than her age. She's going to think boys or age are idiots. She doesn't understand herself. She is withdrawing from her father. She doesn't know what's happening to her body. How do we explain it? It's the perfect time to create chaos in that young woman's life. And so they do. And so now if they can catch her earlier and so we talk about chemically in the brain, what happens? That child will never understand unconditional love. Will not be able to love unconditionally. Will not be able to have a full heart or give a full heart. The boys now that are starting to watch pornography at age eight, another conversation, will never honor a woman because their entry into porn wasn't Pamela Anderson topless on a Harley Davidson motorcycle. Their hello to porn was gang rape three men, one women at age eight. And there you go. She likes it. So they immediately think it's imprinting. That's what women want. That's how I'll treat a woman. It's a disaster. Culture erodes when you do that. And then you should you add on top of that the emasculation of men. You add on top of it, you know, shaming Caucasian men or shaming Christians or telling Christians that you're homophobes. And it's a compound effect that then reinforces the dysfunction, society in the brain to where someone is willing to go slaughter children. Yeah. And that's what I mean. If you can continuously tell people you're wrong, you're not loving, you're not accepting, you're the one that hates this, you're the one that hates people, then ultimately those people are stopped from protecting the people that need protection the most protection protecting the innocent, protecting the vulnerable. And there is a reality that people have to step up and say, this should not be allowed. We should not be putting chemicals into our children's body bodies, sterilizing children. We should not be mutilating children. And those are just the facts. And I really can't believe that there are not more pediatricians standing up against it. And I love the people that are because there are several, but it's hard when it's the American Academy of Pediatrics, when it's these people that have power that are holding them back, it's hard because you can't lose your career and you take a chance of losing your career. And then where do you take care of your own kids? I mean, it's really twisted. It is really sick the way they play this. And they have it just they have complete control right now. And I'm so grateful for people like you who are standing up. But tell us a little bit more about sex nation, about how people can watch it. And where do they get it? Where do they find it? How do they follow you? Yeah, we launched our own streaming platform because we want to make sure that these messages can never be canceled. So they can go to sexnationfilm.com. And it will clearly say stream the film. It goes to a platform called after Eden, which is our own platform. And all the money goes into rescuing children from trafficking. But it will play. And it's eight dollars to watch the movie. All eight dollars goes to saving lives and encourage people to watch this. And then we launched with the film over 500 pieces of resources for parents. If you find out your son is watching pornography, how do I get him out of porn? How do I have a conversation with my pastor, my youth pastor, my principal, which book should not be in my kid's school, which should all those resources become available when they watch the film through the website so that we can arm the populace with, hey, here's information. Great. But here's what you physically can go do. And so we'll go through the nation hopefully to get our rudder back to restore this amazing, beautiful nation I immigrated to that should be the light on the hill. Well, thank you. And thank you for what you do. I could talk to you for three more hours. So I'm going to have to have you back because all of those things that you just said you have resources for. I want to talk about those two. I want people to know what's going on. I think we're all as parents in this digital age, a little confused as to how to protect our kids. So we'll definitely have you back. Yaku Boyens, the founder and CEO of After Eating Pictures, make sure you check out the movie Sex Nation. Go there, get it, check out the resources.
