    "text": " I'm Dave Rubin and joining me today is an award-winning California-based fifth-grade teacher who was suspended from his job for believing in two genders, Ray Shelton. Welcome to the Rubin Report. Well, thank you for having me. It's nice to be here. Ray, I have to say technically, I guess this isn't your first appearance on the Rubin Report because much of my audience will remember this clip that we're going to throw to right now. A couple weeks back, you were on Dr. Phil talking about gender, sexuality, what should and shouldn't be taught in schools, biological reality and all of that good stuff. Let's get right to it. Transgender boys who might not have their own money to go buy tampons. If they're provided free in the bathroom, it's a huge plus. Men do not menstruate. Only women menstruate. Now you can call yourself whatever you want. Don't menstruate, but trans men do menstruate. No, they don't. Say, listen, don't binary people. Mensrating is not exclusive to cis women. No, it's not. Yes, it is. So, explain to me as to why my boyfriend menstruated it. If your chromosomes are XX and you're young, you menstruate. If you're XY, you don't. Correct, but what about trans men? And non-brunds, muting a whole group of women. They're women dressed as men. You are not a man. You can pretend to be a man and that's okay. That's perfectly fine. Live your life and tell me what a man is. Well, what's a man to you? You define a man for me. You have chromosomes that are X and Y. That's what a man is. So, why are we just looking at the science of this as an example? The science. When we've learned sex and gender identity, a two very, the completely different thing. They're not completely different. They are completely different. Complete different words. And sex is what you're born with. The sexual reproductive organs you have. Gender is what you identify with. They're completely different things. Well, I don't accept that distinction. You have to argue for it. You're just giving a conclusion. You're just making it up. People, the people who hate the truth, people who hate the truth are because they see the truth is hateful. If you want to identify in any way you can, you're free to do so. But that does not mean that the rest of us have to join that illusion. Ray, tell me a little bit before we introduce the other fine gentlemen here. Tell me a little bit about what you were expecting when you accepted doing that show. Did they reach out to you and say, hey, you're going to be on the opposite side of some of these activists? I mean, how did this all come to pass? Well, getting on the Dr. Phil Show is actually somewhat of a complicated story. That particular episode that aired on Thursday, the 20th, I believe, of April was actually taped a year ago. Wow. Yeah, I was invited as a support member to a guest who was discussing the fact that her daughter had been lured into believing, her teenage daughter was lured into believing that she was actually a boy through social media. And the school hid that from the mother. And so this was the mother's story of getting her daughter back. And because I was a public school teacher, they invited me to sort of back her up. Because when you're a guest on the Phil Show, they let you bring three or four people so you don't feel so alone. So they take the first episode and I spoke for maybe 60 seconds. I just said, some something to the effect of these are not my children. These are I'm a caretaker as a teacher. And it's inappropriate for me to be discussing issues of human sexuality and gender at the elementary level, which is what I teach. So at the end of the taping, Dr. Phil decided, he said, this is good. This is good material. Let's tape a second episode right now, if we would agree to it. And I think he wanted something a little spicier because as soon as we started taping the second show, he immediately brought me in to speak up more because the other guests were ladies and they were very polite. And they weren't as direct as I had been previously. So the second part, the clip that you just showed, actually, he just kept it in the can for almost a year. That's interesting. I mean, welcome to show Biz, man. That's how it works, you know, that you do something decent. Next thing you know, they're throwing you back on and taping another show. Before we go any further, there is another box here. And this gentleman is either your cattle rancher or your lawyer. Help me out. Who is this guy? Let's let him say hello. This is a great guy. This is my lawyer. I'm going to let him introduce himself. He is fantastic and I'm glad he's taking the lead on this. Yeah, when I'm great, David, tell me how you got in the mix here. Yeah, I'm just here, you know, when I'm not representing Ray in his legal case, I just show the horse manure as ranch. But actually, yeah. So why does why does an elementary school teacher who's laying out some very obvious truths, things that we all knew to be true that nobody debated 10 years ago, why does he not only end up on Dr. Phil as a controversial figure, but then need a lawyer to talk to a guy like me? That's that's the unfortunate part is I actually came on to help Ray after he was removed from his classroom by his school district. You know, just came get dragged out of class and placed on administrative leave after he went to a school board meeting, you know, just as a private citizen, as a private person on his own time and decided to speak out against some of these policies that the school districts have where they are transing children behind their parents backs and implementing all these policies that really like violate people's right to their personal beliefs and their deeply health religious beliefs, such as, hey, a man is a man, a woman is a woman. There are only two sexes, right? Basic things like that. And because he came and spoke on his own time, he got removed from his classroom and I'm here having to help him out and represent him for his First Amendment case. Right. So Ray, a little known fact, by the way, so you were you were a teacher at and I have to say were because you are currently suspended. Is that correct? Well, currently I'm actually retired. The right from suspension to retirement. So they kind of helped you out a little bit. Well, the way the process works is they have an investigation into a complaint that was made and we can get into that if you want. I suspected they just wanted to run out the clock on the investigation into my retirement because once I'm retired, then any sort of complaint just becomes moot. Right. So you were multiple times twice Glendale school teacher of the year. This is the Glendale Unified School District, a little known fact. Actually my the Rubin report as an interview show started in Glendale. My original studio was in Glendale over there. So we've probably been to the same in and out many times. What was going on it? When did you first start seeing this stuff in the school? Let's let's put it that way. Well, the the trend the real issue here in terms of what disturbed me as a teacher and as someone who cares deeply about children. I've worked in the Glendale school district for 25 years and my classroom has been highlighted in local newspapers. I've been a master teacher instructing students from Pepperdine University from UCLA and I've served on curriculum review committees. So you know, I'm a known quantity in terms of district district resources. In the last several years, there's been a very slow, very quiet introduction of transgender ideology into the curriculum and into the training sessions with teachers. And there has been no outreach to the parents, no, no transparency. And this last year at our school site, we were K through five. Two in kindergarten, there is a young boy whose parents are sending him to school dressed as a girl. And there's also a girl whose parents are sending her to school dressed as a boy. And we were informed that we have to use the preferred pronouns that the family wants in addressing these students if for some reason we would need to as an upper grade teacher. I don't really have contact with younger kids. So so there's this issue of compelled speech, which is what exactly got Dr. Peterson in trouble in Canada. So if we do not comply, we will be disciplined and fired. Now we all know in the corporate world, you have to do certain things you don't particularly like and you just go along. But what disturbed me is the other children must comply with forced speech or they will be disciplined and expelled. And that really made me very angry. As a science teacher, obviously, boys can tell other children or boys or girls. And the other thing that troubled me deeply was that, you know, my students, they really love me. They come back, they volunteer, they get extra credit for their high school classes, their middle school classes. And some of my boys came back telling me that there were girls who were in the shower room at the middle school and looking at them. And so I inquired, are there girls in the parent came to me and asked me to inquire for them? Are there girls in the boy's bathroom? And the administration said no. And so the parents pushed on it and it turns out, of course, that there were girls in the boy's bathroom showering and undressing. It's just that they're not called girls. They're called boys because they say, I identify as a boy and if you don't enter that delusional world, again, you'll be disciplined. So I mean, it's absolutely amazing that a teenage girl can go into a boy's bathroom in restroom and shower room and say, I am male and the other children can do nothing. Right. We usually think about it from a high school perspective. I think we usually think about it the other way because the other way seems more threatening that it would be a biological boy in a girl's changing room or locker room or whatever. But it's interesting that it does go both ways. You know, there's also obviously the issue of just purely at a confusion level for a parent who is sending their kid to kindergarten five years old that they then have to deal with this issue that no five-year-old is thinking about. I mean, I have my kids aren't five yet, but I have nieces and nephews who've been five years old. The idea that a five-year-old is thinking about this stuff is crazy. David, I'm curious on a legal level. Obviously, Ray just mentioned the compelled speech part of this. So there's a legal issue around compelled speech. But is there a legal issue around biological reality as you were talking about before? Like, is there an ongoing case right now that you're involved in or you're just kind of making sure that as Ray is out there talking to people that he's not getting into any other trouble with the district or whatever else there might be? Yeah. So I think there are two parts to your question. One is, you know, what is the sort of ramification of denying biology in the law, right? And the second question is what exactly is going on with Ray? So I'll score right now since Ray's retired. We are going to be pursuing a First Amendment case, right? Because the fact that he got dragged out of his class, he didn't get to see his kids finish the school year, right? He didn't get to see his kids graduate, which is like, which is, you know, one of the biggest things for him as a fifth-grade teacher. That's one of the most rewarding parts of the school year is seeing his kids move on. So he got denied all of that. So that's the damage, right? Those were the First Amendment violations that caused him, you know, very serious harm, very serious emotional and personal harm. So we're raising legal funds right now for his First Amendment defense to bring that case against the school district and get him compensated for what they took away from him. The second part of your question is, you know, can they just deny biology like that? And right now, sadly, in California, that's what they're pushing through. You've probably seen the crazy bill that our infamous wiener in San Francisco introduced about taking away the children from their parents because they, you know, they try to uphold their biological sex. And so in California right now, there is that denial. And I think it's crucial to bring these types of cases and push back against the slow encroachment of these woke anti-science ideas in order not to protect people's religious beliefs, but this is a civilizational. This is an absolutely important existential threat that we have to fight in the courts. And of course, if the legislature helps us out, great, but we don't expect that in California. So we have to use the courts to maintain some level of sanity here. Yeah, it's just incredible. We did cover this story this week out of Cali. I mean, unbelievable. They literally want to be able to take your child away. If you do not quote unquote affirm their gender, although as I often say, the surgeries and the chemical castration, everything else is probably the least affirming thing that you could possibly do. David, as a teacher, can you just talk about the general state of confusion that's going on with the kids in terms of, I know you're not a kindergarten teacher, but you mentioned the kindergarten class. But even in fifth grade, that this stuff seems to be talked about all the time everywhere between the kids, teachers, et cetera. I have no recollection, certainly an elementary school of a teacher ever bringing up sex or anything like that. Yeah, I mean, I guess my friends and I joked about silly things or, you know, we saw Porky's or whatever movie was out there at the time, but I'm dating myself. But this stuff has infiltrated virtually everything culturally for these kids. Well, you're correct. You know, when I was in sixth grade, I actually thought that babies were made by French kissing. Only in France. Only in France. So that's going to date me. I cannot stress. I cannot stress how insidious this ideology is in destroying the minds of children and confusing them. And it's meant to do that. This is not an innocent, let's all accept each other and tolerate each other because I don't think anyone is bothered by someone like Caitlyn Jenner, excuse me, Caitlyn Jenner or Deirdre McCloskey or something like that. I don't think that's a particular issue. But this is actually the training and recruitment and sexualization of children. And I do have a visual aid. I do have show and tell. Just quick, just quick. So aside from lessons that we were supposed to do, which I did not do, there are lots and lots of books in our library, our school library, we're a K through five. Here is one book. And I hope the letters are facing the right way. Now it says I'm not a girl, but what's important is to look at the illustration and the text. This is a book which is meant for first and second graders. Unbelievable. So you can see that it's a picture book to be read. And at the end, of course, at the end, what happens is she gets a haircut and she says she's a boy. So this is integrated into all of the lessons. Here's an even, this one's meant for kindergarten, actually. This is called, let's see here, they she, he, me. And it's really is a very simple, it's quite beautiful too. The artwork is actually gorgeous. I mean, I like children's books. So but here is, here's some of the artwork that's inside. On the back, it says, pronoun serve as a familiar starting point for kids and grown-ups to expand ideas about gender and celebrate personal expression. But when you're teaching language to children, especially to immigrants, and Glendale, as you know, has many, many immigrants, language is a tool to be used for thought, to make conceptual distinctions, to understand the world, and later on, to engage in self-reflection and have personal relationships and find happiness and productivity in the world. This is sets out to destroy the human mind, to confuse the human mind. And as I'm sure you both know, in other languages, sometimes they do not have dual pronouns or they lack articles. I mean, in Korean, there's no articles, there's no A, there's no Duh. And in helping people learn to speak English correctly so that they can be successful in the economic world. I mean, it's just awful. It's just awful. It's a world of make-believe. It's a world, it's teaching children a very damaging form of narcissism. Can I just be here? Right, can I just- Yeah, please try to name a guy. Because, you know, the book where you just talked about the indoctrination and the fact that you have, you know, so many immigrant children in that district, well, you know, I was one of them. Back in the day, I was one of those immigrant children. I was born in Soviet Ukraine. I started school in the Soviet Union. When I was starting school, this is exactly the type of indoctrination that they introduced us to. All our children's books, all those things, it was all about, you know, glorifying communism, glorifying great, you know, great grandfather Lenin, all those things to hear over the revolution. And it was exactly those types of attractive, you know, drawings and really insightful and interesting things for kids that basically put that worm in our brains from the very beginning, you know, to be a member of the party, right? Like we had books about joining, you know, the Young Communist Party, right, the kum kum kum and all that. And you know, we had little pins that we used to wear. So this is using that same exact playbook to do this to our kids, to sexualize them and to really just extinguish everything we've built on in terms of Western civilization. So you know, all these parallels, that's why I think you have all these Armenian parents standing up and fighting against it because this is exactly what they saw when they were growing up. So you mentioned the Armenian parents, so Glendale has a huge Armenian population and I'm going to throw to some video we can talk over it, we'll just play it as B-roll of some of the protests that happened in the last couple of weeks where the parents basically were just out there saying don't sexualize our kids. And then the radical activists were out there demanding sort of all of the things we've been laying out here. It actually got violent at one point, a couple arrests, et cetera, et cetera. What I found interesting about it beyond the obvious stuff was that the way the media framed it was that these were pro-LGBT protesters versus anti-LGBT protesters except these parents are just parents who just don't want state educators or state employees talking to their kids about sex and gender identity and the rest of it. So actually David, let me go back to you quick on this. What can the parents do legally at this point? If California is as crazy as we all seem to think and as you guys probably know I fled California a year and a half ago, partly because I knew this stuff was coming, what can a parent who has a kid at a public school that is going through all of this that does not have a teacher like Ray who's doing the right thing but is in a class, third grade class, fourth grade class that's being indoctrinated, does that parent have any legal recourse? Absolutely. There's a long history precedent from our Supreme Court that parents have the right to dictate the values that their children are inculcated with. So I think we can use that as a weapon long term but on a day to day basis, the simple stuff is talk to your children, make sure you have a very strong relationship. Get copious notes of what's going on in their school, in their classroom. Do FOIA requests, right? Public records request and don't give up because the school districts are very sneaky and they're very evasive in terms of producing relevant documents. Keep at it. If you need to and this is important, you know, once you've collected enough information, talk to a lawyer because there are vulnerabilities, right? This is these laws in California, they're sort of like the death star but there is a vulnerability. There is that- There's always a way to blow up a death star. Exactly. So, you know, we have ways, I think I'm not ready to disclose them yet because the other side is obviously listening but they exist and we're working on it. So collect as much evidence as you can and find a lawyer. You know, if not me, they're- they're- I had full lawyers in California who are very good at this and who are dedicated to this fight. So that's what I would say is get the evidence, make sure you get on the school, tell them you're not okay with it and then talk to a lawyer. Right. What kind of support are you getting? I'm guessing mostly, unfortunately, on the DL from other teachers and staff members, you know, administrative staff, that sort of thing. And also from parents because we know one of the main issues here is that everyone's afraid of getting canceled these days so they're probably afraid of now being seen out at the local restaurant with you. Well, in terms of Glendale, as you know, it is fairly conservative as a community. And I can say that at my school site, or my former school site, at least two thirds of the staff completely reject this transgender ideology. The people that I work with, they were completely against it. They understood clearly what was going on and they just avoided it as much as possible. And fortunately, not a single one of them has said anything and I understand. I don't blame them because they have children, they have spouses. Now the same thing with the parents. Many of the parents at my school, my views are, my views about a lot of issues. I've never been quote unquote politically correct and my parents know that and parents often request me specifically for that. I mean, over the years. So the parents have been fantastic. The parents, I've always had a very good loving relationship with all my parents because my goal as a teacher is to help their student. To help their student learn, to develop their mind and to be a good teacher, you have to be able to reach a student's mind where they are, where their consciousness is and help them build a bridge. And my focus has always been the students. And so I have a fantastic rep. So the parents are behind me. But unfortunately, again, you know, they usually have businesses and they're terrified of being mobbed of big docks, which I was and losing their business. So everybody basically tries to stay under the radar. I'm going to let David finish with another promotion of the crowdfunding to help you guys out. But Ray, just one or two more for you. First off, do you want to be retired now? I mean, we do have a lot of great teaching places of teaching, also known as schools here in Florida where you would be welcomed, obviously. Well, you know, I would have continued working here for a few more years, except I knew I just couldn't stomach it. So no, my career as a teacher is not over. It's just a matter of where the next step is in terms of finding a position to be productive in the world. Okay, I have one more question for you then, which is when I was going through my notes this morning, one of my guys pointed out, you happen to be gay. I would say happen to be because I happen to be gay. It is what it is. It's not that interesting, actually. But people find it interesting when having this specific conversation. I didn't know that about you until 10 minutes before we started. But does that play a role in this somehow or change the optics of it somehow or give you insight somehow into what your feelings are around all this? Well, my first gay march was in 1980, you know, so over 40 years ago. And I've always been openly gay. My parents know that and my colleagues know that. And I think it does. I think it frightens the school district in particular because I know exactly what they're doing. Just like the left used gay Americans as a tool to try to divide Americans. They are now doing this with the transgender issue. The other thing is that the parents are not anti-gay at all. And that is how the left wants to keep painting them instead of taking them seriously. You know, at this riot that I was there, I was down there watching everything. The other side was Antifa and a few Proud Boys. They had helmets. They had their faces covered. One of the Antifa characters pulled out a knife and tried to stab one of the Armenian fathers. And he was arrested. It turns out, guess what? He's a child molester. He's been arrested for sexual activity with a 14 year old girl. So the real division was Antifa Proud Boys. And the alphabet suit people, the crazy people, the LGBT, there is no such people. There is no such community. I'm a gay man. I'm not a lesbian. I'm not transgender. It's made up. It's just made up in order to make a box to try to gain political votes. And the issue of homosexuality has nothing to do with transgenderism at all. And it's just a way of them trying to ride on her backs. So as a gay man, and I think this is part of the reason why I was removed from my classroom so quickly. Because it's one thing, you know, to have a straight guy, you know, they can easily just call him a bigot. But they can't do that with me. So I think it's more important that more and more gay Americans speak up in particular and go to the front of the line with this and saying, no, sexualizing children is wrong. So I do think it is important. And I do think it, you know, I actually haven't talked to my lawyer about this, but I do think that my district in removing me violated the anti-discrimination laws of California. I think it was targeted because I was gay. No, this thing about not fitting into the intersectional calculator in the way that they want probably does lend to something related to that, for sure. David, if you have any other final thoughts, and then I want you to promote the crowd funding so that we can raise some funds for you guys. Because obviously this is a worthwhile cause. And of course, we'll put the link down below. Thank you. Beautiful. Thanks Dave. Yeah. So we're on Gibson Go because GoFundMe is run by commies. So again, Gibson Go, you know, just go on the website. You just search for Ray Shelton, a search under Ray's name. And you'll find our First Amendment Legal Defense Fund. So please, yeah, anything you can do to contribute, both Ray and I really appreciate it. Yes, we really do. It's really, really important. So this isn't about me. It's about trying to help change our culture at least a little bit into the right direction and it's about protecting children. That's really what it's about. And Ray, if this was a Hollywood show, this is where I would say now stay. We're going to do another show that's going to be much more controversial and we get into a lot of trouble. But this is the internet. We do things a little bit differently. I thank you guys for your time. And if I can help out in any other way, please don't hesitate to ask. Thank you so much for having us. God bless you and thank you so much. Yeah, absolutely. Thanks Dave."
