    "text": " Bad government and bad policy can literally be deadly. Almost 100 people died in Hawaii's Lahaina fires. The most wildfire fatalities the country has seen in the century. But months on from the event, it seems like the media and local and federal governments would rather we all forget what happened. I'm Lauren Chen, and to uncover the truth about that day in the aftermath, including through exclusively obtained 911 calls, the Blaze and I travel to Maui for this first-ever Blaze original documentary. And this is just the start of Blaze Originals. A new docu series featuring your favorite Blaze TV hosts as we investigate the most important regions of our national theater covering groundbreaking issues and standing in the void left by the elimination of investigative journalism. Watch what really happened in Maui, a Blaze original streaming now on BlazeTV.com, and use the code Lauren plus to save $36 off your annual subscription. Today, bombshell evidence has dropped on the Biden crime family. What happens next? Adam Schiff is censured by the house for his lies on the Russian collusion hoax and Rachel Levine really, really wants to trans the kids. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez. And today, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith released five previously secret documents that revealed the shocking evidence from two IRS whistleblowers who accused the DOJ of interfering in the Hunter Biden IRS tax investigation. According to IRS supervisory agent Gary Shapley, the DOJ engaged in massive interference to cover for the president's criminal son, including tipping off Hunter Biden about a search of his storage unit, prohibiting investigators from executing a warrant on Joe Biden's guest house and repeatedly prohibiting charges from being brought against Hunter Biden. They also had evidence that then Vice President Joe Biden met with Hunter's Chinese business partners, something that Joe has denied repeatedly from the documents themselves. The investigation into Hunter Biden, code named Sportsman, was first opened in 2018 as an offshoot of an investigation the IRS was conducting into a foreign-based amateur online pornography platform. In October 2019, the FBI became aware that Hunter Biden's laptop was at a repair shop and might contain evidence of a crime. The FBI verified its authenticity in November of 2019 by matching the device number to Hunter's Apple iCloud ID. The FBI notified the IRS of the possibility of tax crimes and a search warrant was issued. I cannot stress this enough. The FBI verified the authenticity of Hunter Biden's laptop in November of 2019, but it didn't stop them from actively engaging in suppression of the story by going to social media companies like Facebook and Twitter and all the others and warning them about potential Russian disinformation because they knew the contents would leak before the 2020 presidential election. Now, in early 2020, numerous probable cause affidavits for Hunter Biden's search warrants were drafted in three states and Washington, D.C., but as soon as Joe Biden became the presumptive Democrat nominee, officials dragged their feet. In September of 2020, just months before the election, assistant U.S. attorney Leslie Wolf told IRS investigators that there was more than enough probable cause for a physical search warrant of Joe Biden's guest house where Hunter was residing, but warned of optics being a factor. Wolf told investigators, there is no way we will get that approved. On September 3rd of 2020, Wolf stated that the search warrant for blue star strategies, one of the firms the Biden's allegedly used to funnel in money, was being sat on. In other words, the DOJ had refused to authorize the subpoena rendering the investigation dead. On September 4th of 2020, the deputy attorney general issued a cease and desist of all investigative activities into Hunter Biden due to the upcoming election. Gosh, that sounds like meddling in interference in the United States presidential election to me. In October 2020, IRS investigators assigned to this investigation were obstructed from seeing all of the available evidence by the FBI who refused to provide them the full contents of the laptop. Shapley noted in his affidavit that the decision was unprecedented in his experience. In December of 2020, IRS criminal investigators prepared an affidavit for a search warrant on a storage unit Hunter Biden used to hide his business records. US attorney Wolf objected to the move and after she was overruled, she alerted Hunter Biden's defense counsel so they had enough time to destroy or move the evidence. Again in December of 2020, investigators interviewed Hunter's business partner Rob Walker. Prior to the interview, investigators discussed plans to ask Walker about the meaning of Hunter's infamous 10% for the big guy email. Wolf interjected that she did not want to ask questions about dad and perhaps the biggest bombshell of all tying the current president of the United States in a pay to play bribery scheme and influence peddling, the investigators were in possession of a WhatsApp message from 2017 between Hunter Biden and his Chinese business partner Henry Zao, where Hunter writes, I am sitting here with my father and we would like to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled. Tell the director that I would like to resolve this now before it gets out of hand and now means tonight and Z, if I get a call or text from anyone involved in this other than you, Zang or the chairman, I will make certain that between the man sitting next to me and every person he knows and my ability to forever hold a grudge that you will regret not following my direction, I am sitting here waiting for the call with my father. Record setting levels of deep state corruption, that is absolutely clear to see, but do enough congressional members have the balls to do something about it because of just a fraction of these allegations are true in Peach, all the bastards Biden, Merrick Garland, Chris Ray, all of them and then take a match, set the entire bureaucracy on fire and burn it all to the ground. Here to discuss this and more, we have Jason butrel chief researcher of the Glenbeck program and of course Blake Cresis. He is the co-host of the KGB show. He is of course the B. So true, so happy to be back. It's good to see you again as always. Glad to have you guys. Now Jason, I want to apologize first of all because Jason was on the show. He happened to already be on the show today and when all of this news dropped, I was like, read the whole thing. So 212 pages later, Jason is the only one I think at this table who has actually read through all of the documents. I read through a bunch of the testimony, but you read through all of it. Yeah, you covered a lot just now. I'm sure my producer is in the control room right now going, yeah, she did. She sent me a lot today in the morning. I mean, you pretty much laid out, I think the big stuff, but I mean, there were just other shocking things that we kind of knew about or heard like maybe unnamed sources had talked about certain of these things, but the whistleblower who is the main investigator on this IRS tax team, he goes into detail how Hunter Biden evaded taxes. He goes into detail how Burisma paid them money. It was like up to like a million dollars or whatever a year. How he would pay them an incremental payments to one of their LLCs or one of their random companies and then Hunter Biden would then turn around and say, oh, that's just alone. Oh, that's just alone. Oh, that payment's just alone. And he did that so they wouldn't have to pay taxes on them. Well, I don't know if you guys remember, but it came out that Hunter Biden's I think either his accountant or lawyer, I can't remember who it was said, Hey, this $400,000, you really needed to declare that so that we can, you know, put it on your taxes to this day. He has never declared it. We don't know what the substance of that $400,000 was, why it was paid, what he did with that money to this day we do not know. And he never paid taxes for it. What can we do something now? Well, no, because Biden's DOJ shut the investigation or stalled the investigation. So the statute of limitations is now out. So it was there was it was a US attorney in California, a US attorney in the District of Columbia. And this is a really good point. They shut those cases down so we can't do anything about them. Well, if you remember, attorney general Garland went in front of the Senate in testimony and he said, Hey, DOJ is completely unbiased. The attorney in Delaware has full authority. He can make these requests. He can do all of this stuff. That was a direct lie. I can't remember who it was. Maybe to grassy. I can't remember. It was a direct lie to the Senate. So yeah, there's grounds for impeachment on this. There's grounds for a whole lot of crap off of this. I'm going to hand it to you because I go all day. But I mean, there's just a ton of talk about I mean, the the most important thing to me that I witness is it's beyond just Biden's department of justice. I mean, the entrenched bureaucracy, as we saw as Sarah said, it goes back all the way to 2019 when they had confirmed the authenticity of Hunter Biden's laptop. But this stuff gets covered up in the FBI colludes with Twitter and Facebook to suppress this information into metal in the election and in turn sway the election. And thanks to YouTube's new CEO, I can say the election was entirely stolen. And this is the evidence for that now Trump's leading point. That was their new about to find out. They updated the YouTube terms of service of service. You can now say that the election the 2020 election at least was stolen. But and this is proven with this and the Hunter Biden laptop situation. But you know, Trump's leading talking point in 2016 was draining the swamp. Now, obviously, and look, I love my boy Trump, but you got to criticize him where it's due. He wasn't able to get this done clearly. And it shows in this exact situation, how little power the president of the United States actually has in regards to what's happening at the FBI and the Department of Justice. Now, hopefully, unfortunately, we as conservatives, we don't really control any mainstream media. Few people are going to hear about this story besides those who watch Blaze TV. But you know, CNN's not going to be covering this even Fox News probably not really going to be covering this. But hopefully when Trump's on that debate stage, he can use this to show because I think as opposed to 2016, we're in strain the shrub, drain the swamp. And now it's there's political persecution in all levels of government. I mean, we just saw in Pennsylvania, this Christian man getting arrested at a gay pride rally. So I think that's going to be his main talking point. And he can show how the two-tier justice system in America really exists, how there's essentially liberal privilege or democratic privilege when it comes to justice being served. You know what really pisses me off as I was reading through this? I'm just now remembering this because it's just a whirlwind of information. But all the things that we've been asking questions about for how many years have we been done Biden, Ukraine, chalkboards, tons of those things like 10 held by H for the big guy. They specifically had that as something they wanted to investigate. But again, this you mentioned that assistant US attorney Wolf. She's a weird cat in this entire thing because at some points it almost sounds like she's for the investigation. But then she would come right back around later and say, oh, no, we're not doing that. Oh, no, we can't do that. Multiple multiple times. I think she was listed because I did a like control F of her name. She's mentioned like over 50 times in this report. I mean, she's like real all through it. And usually it's to tell them what they can't do. And she specifically said, look, I do not want to ask any questions about quote unquote dad. They didn't want anything going towards Joe Biden. Do not ask questions about the big guy. She told them not to go there. And this is this is also really weird too because I'm a big, you know, criticizing of the FBI. It almost and there is parts like they are shady. But like when you pointed out back in 2019, they had already authenticated the laptop. We wouldn't hear about it until what 2020, October 2020, something like that. So that was everyone knew this. That was not misinformation. But where was I going with this? Oh, but the but the both the FBI and the members of the IRS, they were like, what are you talking about? Like there are significant national security concerns that that that text message, which I actually think was a WhatsApp message. They were like, Hey, they're these are Chinese Communist Party officials. They're affiliated with them. There's both the FBI and RS brought up Fera. They brought up quote other national security concerns. They were worried about this, but it got shut down. This is crazy. The Delaware attorney that Garland said had all the authority here, Weiss, he wanted to go multiple of them wanted to go after multiple felony charges. Well, as all of the statute of limitations started dropping off and they couldn't do certain things and they were just getting stonewalled, Weiss said, okay, well, now we need a special special counsel to go after some of these things that now we I don't have the authority to do Biden's dog turned him down for the special counsel. Of course, that right there's impeachable right there. There's conflict of interest all over the place. This is this is nuts. So I want to I want to read something else that I don't I don't have the graphic here. But when the FBI well, first of all, shapely, the whistleblower says that the FBI tipped off the transition team about the investigation, but also in an exchange between the FBI and an FBI agent who was interviewing and asking questions of Rob Walker, who is Hunter Biden's business associate. It says the FBI agent questioned any times when he was in office or did you hear Hunter Biden say that he was setting up a meeting with his dad with them, your associates, while dad was still in office. Walker answered, yes, it says, and inexplicably, the FBI agent changed the subject. They knew all of this the entire time. They just needed to cover for Joe Biden. So Jason, I want to clarify something that you said when you were talking about how because how far back does the does the tax stuff go like 2014? 2014. So when you say Biden's doj, you're talking about vice president Biden? Yeah, well, I mean, even then, for sure. But I mean, but the rot goes all the way through. Well, I know that I just meant it started when he was vice president was like, how long it's gone, it's gone back. Then somehow to Blake's point, somehow man for for Ukraine and this right exactly exactly right. And then somehow Trump goes through four years in office and has no idea that any of this is going on. I mean, and again, like that's not even necessarily a criticism of Trump as it is how bloated does your bureaucracy have to be if all of these high level corrupt things are happening within the FBI, within the DOJ, within like the highest, you know, law enforcement agencies in the country. And the president who you would think would be, I mean, he seemed to know that there were corrupt things going on. And he still, he still couldn't find this out. I mean, that is, that's why I say like, I don't see any other solution other than to burn it all to the freaking ground. How else are you going to how are you going to root out all of these bad actors? It sounds like there are more bad actors than not. I want to play Joe Biden leaving a press conference and being asked by reporters about, you know, all of these new revelations, he goes really quick for a 250 year old man watch. It's fascinating. Today, when he was being asked questions, he didn't want to answer. He wasn't, he wasn't unclear on where the exit was. Which is what he is. He's not. Huh? Huh? No, he knew exactly where he was going and he ducked and covered. When you said, when you mentioned that, that they tipped off the, the, not raid, but they tipped off that they were going to come and look through his stuff. Just that right there is insane. So what, what happened was the DOJ notified his Secret Service detail. So obviously the Secret Service detail immediately informed Hunter Biden. And so what Hunter Biden do, he just didn't show up and he had someone, I think it was his lawyer say, Hey, you can talk to us if you want to talk about any of this stuff with Hunter Biden. Now just compare that with how the deal with the DOJ did to Trump at Mar-a-Lago. This time it was ran straight from the DOJ. The DOJ got special permission from the Biden White White House to give the go ahead for the FBI to raid. Now they obviously did not inform the Secret Service. If they would have the Secret Service, what, what it said, excuse me, sir, you know, we're about to get raided by the FBI as per their job. And then who knows what Trump could have done at that point, but that's why they didn't tell them. Yeah. The reason it was foiled in the first place was so that Hunter would not have face-to-face conversations with these investigators. So Blake, try this on for size. Okay. Okay. This makes now two presidential elections that are being meddled with and interfered with by the Deep State because the last one, you had the Deep State running cover to get a certain nominee. This one, you have the Deep State being weaponized against a particular candidate in order for, you know, an outcome to be had. But it's very frightening that it seems to be that everything, like this, all of this is just an illusion. We're all being controlled by the higher-ups. For sure. You know, when this news first broke a couple of days ago about Hunter Biden finally seeing some form of justice for these little, these small little tax crimes when, of course, everybody saw what was on his computer, lots of more disgusting stuff going on there. But when I first heard about this, I initially thought, well, this is something I feel that they have to do. Okay. To sort of at least give the DOJ some semblance of non-bias, right? Because they're going after Trump, they're indicting him on 36 counts of everything they're trying to have him spend the rest of his life in jail. And it's pretty clear in most Americans understand that this is pure political weaponization. So when I first saw this, I thought, okay, they're trying to play coy. They're like, oh, look, we're investigating Hunter too. All right. Not it's not so bad. It's not so bad. But of course, thank the Lord for this whistleblower who's coming on revealing and exposing the full reality of this situation and just how deep Hunter Biden and Joe Biden's crimes really go. And by the way, and by the way, do you have something quick? That's my name. Okay. Well, I want to talk about it. Let's go ahead and take a work. We'll take a quick break. And I want to let you get your thought in here, Jason. But I do want to add to that particular issue, Blake, with Hunter Biden coming to this plea deal, the judge still does have the ability to reject the deal. If the judge sees all of this new information, perhaps thinks maybe this this should not be a deal that we accept because of all of the interference. So we'll see, Jason, I'll let you continue your point after the break. But we want to thank our sponsor, Jason Medical. So I want to tell you about a new product coming from Jason Medical. This is of course the same company that brings you the Jase case. It's called Jase Daily. And it is for any of you who have a, you know, you take a daily prescription, okay?

And they are going to give you a 12-month backup supply. This is the ultimate must-buy-in for family preparedness. Your order is reviewed by a certified health care professional, and they're going to deliver it directly to your door. Here's the thing. Not only is it going to be there in case of supply chain issues and things like that, which we found out the hard way during COVID. Here's the thing. It's also for all of you busy parents. Maybe you're a mom like me and you know you or your family member. You take a daily prescription and you're like, I don't have time to constantly be going to the pharmacy and picking these things up. Make sure you are prepared over at jacemetical.com. You can enter code news at checkout for a discount on your order that is jasemedical.com promo code news. Jason, your closing thoughts on that. Or I don't know, it might not be your closing thoughts. Well, this is, so you guys are talking about the deep state, and this is how screwed we are. This is how they attack us, right? They'll go after President Trump. They'll leak from the very top. They'll send leaks from the FBI, the CIA. They'll do back channels through the media. Make sure that you've convicted this person that they're trying to convict in the court of public opinion first. Then they'll go after using the deep state. They'll go through the DOJ, the FBI. Then they'll raid your home. They'll take all those measures based off of a bunch of bull and then that's how they come after us and shut us down. Now, our side, we don't even have that. We couldn't even, there's no way that we have those resources. We have to have someone come out and danger to his job. And the deep state knows this. They know that just on the threat of them getting fired or persecuted, which the whistleblowers did, they all got taken off the investigation. Who knows what happens to him now? Like, I would not be surprised later if they say, oh, well, he divulged this information. So now we're going to criminally go after him as well. But from the threat of their job, they're having to go through this process to be a whistleblower. That is nuts. And that is the only way we're getting answers to questions that we've been asking since 2016, something like that. It's just not to be a Debbie Downer and just, you know, depress anyone. But that's what we face. And that's what has to be torn down in 2024. I guess the question then, and I think the frustration of so many people is, how do we even know that we can do that? Because if you believe, like, say what Blake said earlier, which is if you believe that perhaps it wasn't the safest and most secure election of all time in 2020, how do you prevent that from happening the next time around, right? Like, how do we even know that we're going to get a fair shake in 2024 to be able to fix all of these things? Well, it's like then we won't. I mean, it was over in 2022 when we lost Arizona, Philadelphia, I mean, sorry, Pennsylvania and Georgia. I mean, well, actually, no, we got the governorship in Georgia. But yeah, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Arizona, those states, very integral, we lost the governorship there. So the voting laws are only going to get worse, and we really don't have a chance. I mean, not to be black-pilling or anything. You guys are really depressed. Look, it's the state of the country. You got to be honest about it. What can we do? Yeah, I mean, seriously, though, to take it one step further. I mean, there's no fixing it because we talk about the deep state and how it's operating. The only other option is escalation. So does the other side starts playing by the same tricks? You're already talking about mass, you know, ballot harvesting, stuff like that. We're not talking about writing laws or like taking that back. We're talking about doubling down on it. Yeah. Yeah. So where does this end up in 10 years from now? Right. How do our elections look? Right. Like Belarus or something like that? Right. So I want to switch gears here and cover Adam Schiff being censured in the house for his Russian collusion hoax. This is, of course, a measure that was brought forth by a friend of the program, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, who brought it up. Jason's a big fan. Big fan. Oh, yeah. And she brought it up previously and she tweaked the wording a little bit to satisfy Thomas Massey and some others. And the vote broke down along party lines yesterday with 212 Republicans in favor and 208 Democrats opposed four members of the GOP simply voted present. And I want to play the moment that Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced that Adam Schiff was being censored and how the Democrats reacted. Watch on this vote. The A's are 213 and the nays are 209 with six sensory present. The resolution adopted without objection. The motion to consider is laid on the table. I say they were saying shame for those of you who did. I guess that's the new Democrat thing to do is yell shame. I think it's shameful that they would be defending Adam Schiff for the clear lies that he promoted and the way that he used his office and his committee ranking to pretend as if he had access to information linking Donald Trump to a Russian collusion when he just completely made it up. I want to play one more clip here. This is Democrat Congressman Benny Thomas, who spoke before the House voted and told Republicans that he was like Adam Schiff is everything you want to be. Watch these attempts to censor Adam have been orchestrated to distract but no one is fooled. Extreme mega Republicans are targeting Adam because he's everything they wish they could be. He's tough. He's principled and he's affected. No, look, he's got a point. All right, not about tough and principle. Not tough. Everything we wish we could be. I mean, we wish we could make up complete lies about our opponents and actually be effective enough to get them impeached in the end. Yeah. I mean, look, I wish the Republican Party could work that hard, but we're principled. We're moral and all that stuff that loses us. I agree with you. I agree with you, Blake. In fact, we were talking on the program yesterday about Adam Schiff and he made a comment that he was effective. Yeah. And we said, yeah, you are effective. I do it. I do wish that our party could be as effective as you guys because you just literally lied to the American public and the mainstream media outlets cover it like it's true and you just get away with it. So like, actually, I do wish that we had that privilege. They're so smug and they're so cavalier about it. They can get away with anything. I mean, how much of a how much of a pain is this really towards Adam Schiff or to the Democratic Party in general? They did their job. You know, it worked. And now we're more divided than ever. We're more separated in our silos than ever. So they can say these things about Adam Schiff, even though every single person on that floor that was shouting shame, no, he lied through his butt. They all know that. But it doesn't matter when Adam Schiff made those comments. He was like, yeah, it was effective. You know, he's like sitting back like he was the OG, you know, a little smirk on his face. Yeah, you did your operation. You did it well. I mean, they all lied to all those Democrats lied along with them. A lot of Democrats, regular Democratic voters to this day still believe that Donald Trump is like a Russian spy or a Russian agent in all this nonsense. And they and they can. No one's gonna know mainstream media sources are gonna call them out or admit that they lied to the American people that three years of the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax was all false and a money grab and a power grab. And then and then what did you see on that count? Every single one of them was united behind that. There was no dissenters. Look at that. They're all in lockstep. But what do you see from the Republican side? Yep. Yep. That is pathetic GOP. Yep. Absolutely pathetic. You suck at this. I totally agree. Good gosh. All right. Let's go ahead and take a quick break.

Rachel Levine, who is the assistant secretary of health spoke yesterday at an event hosted by the US Department of Education. And she told educators once again, she I mean like, well, I keep saying she's not a she it's he he told educators once again that genital mutilation surgery, which he very beautifully says gender affirming care, right? That's what they call child mutilation gender affirming care. He says it's medically necessary, safe and effective for transgender and non binary youth. He also said that trans identity is a child's superpower I want I want to let that sink in for a second being trans is a child's superpower. I want to throw up here the website that detailed the event. And it says the convening is your opportunity to learn about federal resources and actionable ready to use strategies for creative creating inclusive educational environments and ensuring non discrimination to support LGBTQIA plus apostrophe squared students in your school or district. The convening will feature prominent experts from DOE, justice and health and human services who will share federal resources teachers and school leaders who will share concrete and practical tips for you to use in planning for the new school year and LGBTQIA plus students who will share firsthand what kinds of support enable them to thrive at school. Let's play. Levine giving a similar speech because again, like Rachel Levine really wants to trans your kids. I want to remind you of what he the beautiful Rachel Levine sounds like on this watch gender affirmative care is medically necessary, safe and effective for transgender and non binary youth and adults. Those who attack our LGBTQIA plus community are driven by an agenda that has nothing to do with science and medicine. Oh, these are politically and ideologically motivated attacks again on trans youth. And they are contrary to the overwhelming science and evidence. So we all have to stand up. We have to stand up and advocate and take a stand on the half of those who are being harmed in many states across the country. Yeah, so the only one harming the youth are the people who are advocating for them to chop off their body parts and, you know, promoting irreversible damage done by cross sex hormones and puberty blockers. That would be what I would call harming children. Also, gender affirming care would be reminding them that if you have a penis, you're a boy. And if you have a vagina, you're a girl, that would be gender affirming care. You know, to make statements like that from the highest health office, the land in the most powerful country in the world and say it's all about the science and medicine, you've got to be pretty sure about your science and medicine, right? Like you, I mean, there's just no question, right? It's just that that's the way it is. Well, then how come the United Kingdom, Finland, Sweden, Norway, France, just off top of my head, probably more in Europe, are all saying, we need to step back from this because this is getting out of hand. You know, those are usually the countries that Democrats point to and say we got them all in our health, the NHS. We got to do that. We got to do what Sweden does. Right. The science is clearly not clear on this at all. You know, this is the most abhorrent tactic used by the left and it's an observation I have, basically for any of their ideas for policy is that if we don't get this past, that's what they say. If we don't get this past, people will die and they use this with it comes to transgender health care, chopping dudes off and whatnot. If kids don't get these surgeries, it's a name. Once again, Dick is a name. If these kids don't get these surgeries, they will die. And again, you can extrapolate this to any policy. If we don't solve climate change, people will die. If we don't have police reform, people will die. If we don't take the guns, people will die. If you don't wear a mask, people will die. And it's most ironic when it comes to abortion. If women can't get abortions, they're going to die. But it's the most bizarre, but also emotionally effective tactics that they use is that vote for Democrats or people will die. And it sucks when they talk about the transgender children because you really think, I mean, we see all these pictures of what transgender procedures actually look like. Like the phalloplasty, where they take all the skin off your arm and they make a fake name or they put an axe wound inside of you. It's terrible. It's disgusting. And these kids and these young adults who go through this and then they look at their bodies, they just have immediate disgust. It would be a natural response to seeing your own body being mutilated in such a way, but they say, no, this is life-saving. This is absolutely necessary for these children. The tactic is disgusting for the fear porn, basically. But incredibly effective on the most vulnerable, on the kids. And that's who they're targeting right now. Whether they're targeting the kids right now because they're going to be the ones most freaked out. They're going to get the ones most emotional. They tell that crap. Basically, you got to be an incredibly gullible adult to fall for, oh my gosh, if we don't solve climate change the next two years, the world's going to end. Like, I hope believes that. Yeah. You guys have been telling us that for like 40 years now. And you keep changing it every single time. Like, at some point, wouldn't they go, okay, wait a minute. Shouldn't we take a step back? But if you indoctrinate people from a very young age on whatever the case, let's just say transgenderism, then you are more willing to accept their side, their political view for the rest of your life. That's what it's all about. You tell these kids that they become superheroes. We live in such a marvel, saturated land that you tell these kids, hey, you'll be a superhero. All you got to do is just do a little snip. That's clearly their talking point though because I think he actually took that from Karine Jean-Pierre. I think she was the first one to say that in a White House press conference. That's disgusting. Especially when the actual non-manipulated statistics show that you're not saving these kids from having mental illness problems, depression, suicidal ideations, going through with committing suicide. The stats are not with them. And yet, the science is whatever they want the science to be. And they just say it. And somehow it is. All right, we've got to take another quick break. We'll be back with more. But one of our minds, you guys, if you haven't checked out normal world, it has finally debuted on Blaze TV. You're going to catch really, really great comedic sketches. It's comedian Dave Landau and quarter black Garrett. And it's Tuesday through Thursday at 10 p.m. Eastern, 9 p.m. Central. They're trying to reinvent late night because everybody knows that SNL sucks now. Okay. So make sure that you check out normal world. It is Tuesday through Thursday, 10 p.m. Eastern on YouTube or Blaze TV. The Titan, of course, the Titanic bound submersible that went missing on Sunday with five people on board apparently suffered a catastrophic implosion. Killing everyone on board. This was confirmed by the United States Coast Guard Rear Admiral John Mauser. Apparently, a remotely operated vehicle found the tail cone of the Titan about 1600 feet away from the bow of the Titanic shipwreck. So obviously, thoughts and prayers going out to the families of these victims. Honestly, maybe this is morbid, but I feel like that's probably the better case scenario because oxygen would have run out and they would have suffered just a very like a very torturous process of suffocating to death. I can't imagine that they like felt much in this. Yeah. Yeah, it must have been. Catastrophic implosion at that depth. It would have been instant. Yeah. But you know, you have to wonder if there will be lawsuits that are filed against this company for all of the seemingly very neglectful, you know, business company policies that they had. We went through a few of them yesterday with that. You know, what was the front viewpoint? Yeah, Plexiglas, whatever it was, was only what was it for 1000 meters and they were going to 4000 meters? Yeah, I believe it was 1400. So it was only safety certified to go 1400 meters down and they were going 4000 meters down and they didn't want to yeah, they didn't want to spend the extra cost to like get the safety study done. Look, that's what happened. I mean, they fired one of their bet from what I read. They fired one of their best submarine operators because he was calling out what was going on and how it was an up to par with safety regulation and because he was a 50 year old white man, you know, they didn't want any of those operating. Right. There was a video going around Twitter, I think, today where it showed it was a game, one of their promotional videos or something like that, but it showed a guy just using a hand ratchet to tighten down some of the bolts on that vehicle. Just a hand ratchet. Yeah, I mean, I didn't maybe like maybe he pulled out the torque specs later and torque. I don't know. But I mean, yeah, that's probably not how it's usually done for something like that. I would imagine no. Again, I am not an expert. But I have to tell you, I would not want to ride in a submersible vehicle that was only hand ratcheted down. But I also would not be caught at all ever in one of like no interest ride one in general. No, no, I mean, I I'll I scuba dive. Oh, cool. We'll not get in a submarine or any sort of submersible vehicle, especially one where this one in particular, you're talking about the hand ratcheting and all of the so there were, I believe, 17 bolts that had to be like undone from the outside by their mothership for them to get out, which just that in itself. I'm like, nope, absolutely not. No. Well, there was that one scenario that we talked about yesterday. Like, yeah, generally I'm not doing this. But if the entire crew are the girls gone well, girls down there for like eight plus hours, I consider it. I'm just saying. Oh my gosh. Last moments before the implosion. It was a sad story. It's yeah. It is. Don't ride submarines. Well, again, I just I hope that these families will consider lawsuits because there's there's no, I understand they signed a waiver. I know people yesterday were yeah, people people yesterday were like they signed a waiver. Like, I get that. But what I'm saying is I don't find it to be reasonable that a company could be like, sign your whole life away. But we're not going to tell you that we didn't take like reasonable steps to ensure your safety. I just can't imagine that that would be legal. Yeah, there are waivers and then there's like criminal negligence. Exactly. So exactly. Yeah. Exactly. So quick update on Anthony Fauci. Apparently, Senator Rand Paul is demanding answers as to Dr. Fauci's employment status from HHS Secretary Javier Becerra. He is apparently not convinced that Fauci actually stepped down like he said he would in December. And he posed a couple of different questions for the Biden administration that he is asking for them to answer by June 30th. This says, is Dr. Fauci currently employed by or formally affiliated in any way with HHS, NIH or any other federal agency? If so, please describe the nature of his work. Does he currently have the ability to access non-public areas of HHS, NIH, and NIAID or any other federal agency building? Does Dr. Fauci currently maintain an office within HHS, NIH, NIAID or any other federal agency? Is he currently receiving any legal representation from any of those government agencies? And is he currently receiving a protective detail or security services funded by the United States? You got to wonder what Rand Paul knows here, what he's been tipped off to to ask these types of questions. Yeah, for sure. I don't know, man. All I know is Fauci needs to be arrested. Fauci needs to be not going to say put down, but Fauci needs to be locked in a hole and the key needs to be thrown away. Right. I mean, one of the most evil people who has ever held power over the American population. Yes, yes. I would say if he went to prison for the rest of his life, that would be a kind sentence for all of what he has done to the country. With our strong opinions on this, and I think we're all pretty much in agreement here, why, you would think that would be a consensus, right? You would think that a lot of people, even watching in the sea, D.C. would feel like this, why is Rand Paul the only one that's willing to take him to the mattresses like this? He's the only one. I mean, is he the only one that has the balls to try? I mean, like I said, this is consensus. So you would think that our senators would be doing the same thing. Paul, not John Cornyn. Yeah, definitely not him. Yeah, you don't count. But Ted Cruz, we're yet. Why don't you come with that much fire on that? Ted Cruz is busy dunking on Uganda for being homophobic. That's what he's focused on right now. That's a great point. All right, let's go ahead and take a quick break. We'll be right back. All right, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are apparently going to participate in a cage fight. I'm told it will not be to the death. But yes, but apparently UFC's Dana White has confirmed he spoke with both gentlemen. And this is a real thing that is going to happen. Twitter versus Facebook, well, Twitter versus meta, which is of course Facebook and Instagram in the cage match. And I just want to know who you guys have because Mark Zuckerberg does look very small. But he has apparently been engaging in MMA training for the last couple of years. He's only a white dog. Look, yeah. Oh, okay. Well, I didn't look. I mean, if you're rich, like Jake Paul, take Jake Paul, all right, he doesn't have to work. He just makes stupid videos. I mean, that's the first thing I would do. I would just train to become like the best fighter in the world if I had all the time in my hands. And if that's what Zuck is doing, I mean, look, if he's actually, if he gets good at jujitsu, it's not out of the question that he could easily take down someone like Elon Musk who's much bigger, much stronger than he is. But I mean, we'll see. I don't know what Elon's been up to. The size alone will not save him. I will say that there's no way they're insurance guys. We'll let them go in there with just I bet that they don't let them. Okay, if it's MMA style gloves, then I think Zuckerberg will probably win because he's got the jujitsu on him. But if it's how I think it'll be, they'll have these huge head coverings. They'll have big gloves. And then Elon Musk will win because he's six too. I think what Zuckerberg's like five, six. Yeah, he's huge. He's huge. He's a huge disparity. But like I said, you know, if it gets down to jujitsu, very possible that the zuck could come out on top. I don't want to see that happen. I don't want to win. It depends on the gear. It depends on the gear that they have to wear. Well, I'm rooting for Elon. I just don't, I don't get the appeal of watching guys beat the **** out. Oh, dude, it's the best thing in the world. It is the best. What are you talking about? What's he better? Is guys beat like actually being one of the guys who's beat the **** out of the ****? It's like a deal. Stream and subscribe to more Blaze Media content at theblaze.com slash podcasts."
