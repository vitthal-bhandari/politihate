    "text": " You're listening to Comedy Central. I want to fly the tide. Take me one of my first great. We're all together. MTV's official challenge podcast is back for another season. That's right, the challenge is back and so are we. I'm Devin Simone. And I'm Devon Rogers. Now, y'all know we had so much fun covering the Challenge USA one together that we thought, why not do it again? So we are joining forces to dive into this brand new season. Season 39, battle for a new champion. Yes! Yes, 24 contenders will compete to win their first championship. They know the battle, but not the victory. Oh, thank God. I am ready for a new champion, a new one. Okay, give us some fresh faces, people. Girl, I couldn't agree more. So every week after the episode airs, come hang with us as we break down all the challenges and eliminations and, of course, get the inside scoop on all the drama. And we got all the T.O.K. We will be joined by the cast members themselves every week, y'all. Listen to MTV's official challenge podcast on the iHeartRadio app, Apple Podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts. I have this for me. Ah, well, hello. Welcome to CP Time. The only show that's for the culture. Today, we'll be discussing blacks in horse racing. Usually when you think of horse racing, the only black thing that comes to mind is the horse itself. Turns out many of the people riding them have been black, too. Not to take anything away from those black horses, though. Stay strong, my horse brothers. Mm, right there. For many years in the early days of organized horse racing, black jockeys were extremely common in the sport. Partly because black people had a lot of experience taking care of horses during slavery, and partly because riding horses was the best way to prevent the police from stopping you for a broken tail light. Take the Kentucky Derby, the biggest event in the sport. It's so popular, you've probably heard of it, even if you're not a gambling addict that blew his kids, college money, and lost the house on weekend races. Sorry, baby, Whisper and Willow was supposed to be a sure thing. In the first Kentucky Derby in 1875, 13 out of 15 jockeys were black, and the winner of that race was Oliver Lewis. Oliver rode to victory on his horse, Aristides. Strange name, but it was the 1800. If you got a black jockey, you got to at least give the horse an extra white name to balance things out. Despite his success, Lewis retired from racing the very same year he won the Derby, which is understandable. With the prize money he won, he could finally achieve the dream of every black man in 1875, Kentucky, moving out of Kentucky. Not only were black people the first to do it, but they were some of the best, like Isaac Burns Murphy, seen here thinking about racism probably. Isaac was considered one of the greatest jockeys in history. He was the first person to win the Kentucky Derby three times, and his win record is still unmatched to this day at 44%. Murphy was the first rider ever to be inducted into the horse race in Hall of Fame, which is the highest honor a jockey can receive other than being told, Hmm, you're actually taller than I expected. But despite their success in the sport, black riders soon all but disappeared from horse racing, making it yet another thing that started out very black, but became very white, much like rock and roll, or Brooklyn. And that's because in the early 1900s, there was a concerted effort to push black jockeys out of the sport. White races engaged in harsh tactics, both on and off the track. They would hit black riders with riding crops or run them into the rails. Two time derby when a Jimmy Winkfield was even threatened by the Ku Klux Klan. The irony, he and the KKK both love riding horses. If equestrianism can't trump hate, then I don't know what can. The harassment got so bad that in 1904, Winkfield left the country to become a racing superstar in Russia. Do you know how bad it's got to get for a black man to move to Russia? They didn't even have black people over there back then, although maybe that's the secret. Got to get in early before they learn how to do racism. But soon enough, practically the only black jockeys you could find were those creepy little statues on rich white folks' lawns. Between 1921 and the year 2000, not a single black jockey even raced in the derby. They understand how long that is. It took all the wait until the Baja men released who let the dogs out for a black person to compete again. Not saying that the two are related. Unless... Nah, you're being crazy, Roy. Now, one black rider who did make waves during those years was Cheryl White. The first licensed black female jockey in America. Cheryl started her career racing straight out of high school, which means she was the most influential black teenager on a horse until Little Nausex came around. And she didn't need the help of Miley Cyrus' daddy. At just 17 years old, White was already winning races and gracing the cover of Jet Magazine, which is incredibly impressive. Nowadays, most 17 years old, I know, could only make the cover of Dumbass Up to No Good magazine. I see you boys doing the vaping before school. I will snitch on you. Watch me! So the next time you think of horse racing, think about the black jockeys that blazed the trail back in those early days. Don't just think of Seabiscuit. Or the guy who rode Seabiscuit. Or how much money you lost by not betting on Seabiscuit. Maybe I'm not coming home for a little while. I'm so sorry. Well, that's all the time we have for today. I'm Roy Wood Jr. and this has been CP Time. And remember, we're from the culture. Could somebody help me put on this fake mustache as a gentleman named Knuckles swinging body and get some money? And I don't have it for him. I've got to get the hell out of here. Okay, alright. This location has been compromised. Come on, Jennifer Lewis. The Daily Show with Trevor Noah Ears Edition. Subscribe to The Daily Show on YouTube for exclusive content and stream full episodes anytime on Paramount+. Hey everybody, Stephen Colbert here. I have my own, we have the show has a podcast, The Late Show Pod Show. And here I'm here with the producer Becca. Becca, what are we doing? What is this? So, the Late Show Pod Show, it's everything you love about the Late Show, the monologue, the lead guest. And here, am I correct about this? That you actually get things in the podcast often that aren't on the show because we had to cut things for time. And so you'll get more guests. You'll get some jokes or some more meanwiles or something like that. We didn't get a chance. Certainly conversations with Lewis and the band that you don't get. So you get more stuff. If you don't listen to the podcast, you're losing money. It's true. It's true. TV, you can only put so much. You got to get those commercial breaks in. But the podcast, we can keep going. That's the great thing about podcast is that the real estate is enormously cheap. And so, you can just shovel anything in there. People go, thank you. Listen to the Late Show Pod Show with Stephen Colbert wherever you get your podcasts. I use the internet."
