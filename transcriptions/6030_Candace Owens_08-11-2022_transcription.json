    "text": " All right, guys. Happy Tuesday. Happy Election Day. I hope you are wearing all red. Like I'm wearing all red. The question of the day today is What do I really think about Kanye West known as yay and the Jewish community? I feel like it has come to a point now where my silence is creating some violence in the air So I want to answer and I want to respond thoroughly plus dabbling in virtual reality can now kill you the founder of Oculus Better known now as a part of Facebook's meta created a VR headset that will actually kill the user if they die in the game All that and more today coming up on can of sounds All right guys where to begin I've been thinking about this for a long time and I think that the best place to begin is with a thank you from my heart yesterday, obviously I did a monologue and I covered the Kyrie Irving situation and There was a little trepidation and giving my opinion about the situation because there's a lot of tension in the air right now between the Jewish community and The black community obviously and I felt that by defending Kyrie Irving Which I felt was the right thing to do some people would say oh there she goes again There she goes again defending black people and saying nothing about the Jewish community saying nothing about people that are now sharing anti-Semitic remarks and I was overwhelmed and thankful for the response to that monologue I mean I looked through the comments and there was this outpouring of love and understanding And I think that out loving of love and understanding came perhaps because I did something yesterday that I rarely do I shared my heart, you know I'm never a person that says to you guys as a black person this or as a black woman this But I did feel yesterday that I needed to come to you as a black person in this society And I was hopeful that you would understand why I was touched by Kyrie Irving's remarks when he asked the press Where were you when I was growing up? I shared with you how it's a weird thing to be a black person in society and not really know where you come from I felt his pain and I think that you guys heard my pain and you responded to it accordingly Now obviously there's another subject that is getting snowballed into the Kyrie Irving situation In fact, I think this subject is part of the reason that the media has been so harsh Despite in my opinion Kyrie Irving really committing no crimes that are worthy of that harshness Worthy of that treatment worthy of the words by the way that the Brooklyn that's shared regarding him He's unfit to be associated with That is so dark and so twisted and so hurtful When all he did was share a link and then immediately offer apologies for what he deemed to be falsehoods within the documentary But the subject that a lot of us have been avoiding is regarding Kanye West and I say a lot of us I mean especially me yay is my friend I have been very very clear about that yay is still my friend and I don't Really like to talk about things and people that are personal to me I do I guess politics and culture A lot of times I sit back and I wonder why I have the platform that I have It's a weird thing to sort of look through the lens of your life and to say why am I here? Like what am I doing? All I've done as far as I'm concerned is I've stood up and I've said the truth a lot of times And I think because we let we now live in these times of tremendous To see that seems to a lot of people like a heroic act a lot of people depend on me and count on me To continue to tell the truth and to not quote unquote sellouts I know what that means. I know that there has been a lot of pressure on me people saying can this don't sell out to the daily wire Because I'm with them can't just don't sell out to pager you When I was with them people have this fear that the more success that people have They kind of have to say okay I need to stay with a certain boundary and a certain line to maintain that success Essentially a lot of people trade their souls for money. That is true I'm simply not one of those people There is no amount of money that is high enough that I would say something that I do not mean There there's nobody that can make me perform and I want to make that clear to everybody And I thought that I was making that clear When I remained silent regarding yay who is my actual friend behind the scenes But i'm going to do something rare today and i'm going to share with you some personal conversations that i've had Not just with yay, but with other people that are friends of mine behind the scenes With all of this going on and with adidas pulling out and saying we want nothing to do with yay and gap Pulling out and saying what nothing to do with him and the entire world condemning him A lot of people wonder what he is thinking. What is yay thinking? How does he respond to losing two billion dollars as it was estimated in one day? Right after a week of tweeting and saying things everyone wants nothing to do with him How do you think he's feeling about that? A lot of you guys have me thinking that he feels very sad about that I'm only going to tell you what he said to me last week Because I was feeling sad about it in a way, right? I was feeling sad about it because It's difficult for me to communicate to everybody what yay means to black america It's difficult for me to communicate what he as an artist meant for me His entire life he has made it possible For black americans to know that the world can be ours Right he he let us know that it was possible to do the impossible Before I ever knew him I shared my heart about him being my favorite artist because his music Let me know as a girl that came from nothing that I could break the barriers That I did not have to just be a victim. I didn't have to care what the media thought about me I actually felt empowered by his song power And so in that regard he has ranked up a lot of credit in the black community So when we are asked to debit him because of his recent actions, it's not easy for us to do that Because he's meant so much to us in our households and in our personal spaces Now as a friend to see what's happening to him as I said has been tremendously hurtful and I Called him and I spoke to him weeks ago and Expected that he would understand and also be feeling hurtful as well, but instead he said to me After all of the cancellations his first sentence to me was Now i'm finally free It almost made me cry Right, it almost made me cry because I realized that I was so Worried for him and I have felt so scared and so worried for him and yet for yay in this really bizarre way he intentionally blew himself up Because he has felt so pressured within the hollywood world To be somebody that he's not He has shared since then that what started all of this was text messages from one Jewish person harley pasternik. It's important to say one Jewish person not the Jewish community not all Jewish individuals Not the entire Jewish world, right? A text message from a guy basically saying that he would put yay back in the hospital again if he wanted to And that he would never see his kids again So he was feeling hurt and he hurt people he hurt a lot of people and he owned that Yay himself said on piers morgan that his remarks were anti-Semitic and they were racist And then he apologized for those remarks and said that hurt people hurt people And so I was a bit confused why despite him having said that and despite him taking ownership over his own words People were still coming to me and asking me to say something bad about him in public I just didn't want to take that bait because this is actually my friend, right? But I realized that a lot of people come to me because they see me as a leader And and I guess in that regard they hold me in a higher view than I hold myself again I'm just somebody who is saying the truth and calling things as I see it And what I realized is that why while I have been a very strong and vocal friend Of yay, and I'm going to continue to be that I haven't yet been a vocal friend to some people that have been tremendous friends to me Just one example is Dennis Prager. You guys know I worked for Prager University for two years And I want to tell you about that relationship At Prager University if we ever had anything that we need to discuss I ever went to Marissa Strait who is Jewish and she is the CEO and I said, you know, I think I should make more money for this They just would say here. We never want this relationship to be about money Yeah, we just want you to take take whatever you want We never want to have to go back to the contract I mean, I've said this publicly before and I will say it again The most productive working relationship that I've ever had in my entire conservative career was with Prager University Dennis Prager was a wonderful human being where so straight is a wonderful human being they are wonderful people who happen to be Jewish, right? and Dennis Prager when I called him and he wanted to discuss the situation with yay I didn't even let him get a word in. I just yelled at him. I honestly I was I was very harsh I'll tell you what I said to him. I said I'm not playing this game with the Jewish community again Because people were starting to say well if she can't it doesn't condemn yay, then she too is anti-Semitic It means that she's also anti-Semitic by association I said I'm not playing this game with you guys again is what I said to him I said you've wrongly smeared me and labeled me as anti-Semitic in the past You were there for that Dennis. You were one of the lone voices that stood up for me when they Buzzfeed intentionally pulled out a clip of me to make it sound like I was defending Adolf Hitler And I said despite that I was gracious and I was understanding and I made a mental people to help them understand What that conversation was actually about I said with the second time the second time you guys are kind of come at me with smears of anti-Semitism No, I'm not doing it. I'm not playing the game with you guys And do you want to know what Dennis did? Dennis did not push back at all He said he understood and he published an article in my defense So essentially what Dennis did was he heard how I felt hurt by the Jewish community And how I was feeling hurt again by the Jewish community And rather than argue with me on it or rather than say well, can this know it could kind of be seen as the He heard my hurt and he published an article in my defense It was incredible. It was an incredible act of friendship I want to be remembered not just as a formidable enemy to the left. I am that of course I do not just want to be remembered as a formidable enemy to any institution that seeks to harm my children I am that of course I also and I think this is the most important thing that I want to remember does is a formidable friend I because I am that I Am a good friend to yay And an understanding friend to yay And I am a good friend to Dennis Prager Marissa straight many other Jewish people that have been amazing to me But I haven't been vocal in that friendship And so I want to do that today. I want to say to those individuals who have been out there defending me All I have been silent. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. It has meant the world to me I don't want to make a habit by the way of defending myself against baseless mirrors. It's a bad game But I think right now there is a rare occasion where there are very high tensions Between the black community and the Jewish community And so I think it's important for me to stay the obvious. I of course am not anti-Semitic whatsoever I've never had an anti-Semitic bone in my body. I actually before I married my husband almost married a Jewish man Just it's not even a thing. I feel I feel stupid even saying that But I do think it's important to do that because I've made it abundantly clear publicly that I'm standing by yay as he weathers this tremendous storm But I also recognize that I need to make it abundantly clear that I'm standing by Dennis Prager as well And all of my other Jewish friends and supporters who are speaking out for me And who have endured what may have felt like a very heavy silence from me And so I want to again say thank you to all of you for understanding and knowing that The hurt that is coming from the black community which I can speak on Is this feeling that we have all been emotional slaves The spiritual slavery that kyrie urban talked about feeling like you have to choose between who you actually are and a paycheck, you know and Sometimes we push back on that in the wrong way, right? And I think Yay has been clear that he did that in the wrong way Sometimes we push back on that in a certain way that is determined to be wrong like kyrie And I hope that In coming to you guys with my heart in this monologue And I am pushing back on this in the right way And that's all I will say about that All right guys I want to take a moment to talk to you about the app hallow in a world that is currently so divided I truly believe that faith in god is the answer and truly our only hope That's why I want to encourage you to download the hallow app Hallow is a number one christian prayer app in the united states and the number one catholic app in the world It's rooted in the catholic tradition, but an amazing resource for any christian That's looking to dive deeper into their prayer life Hallow has prayers and meditations to guide you throughout your entire day morning tonight Some of the most popular prayers include the daily rosary the gospel reading and daily psalm with bishop baron The bible in a year with father mike schmitz minute meditations meditations for sleep kids prayers and meditations and more Hallow helps me sleep better lower my anxiety levels and find peace and calm throughout the day And I think that it will do the same for you get an exclusive three month free trial at hallow.com slash candace That's hallow.com slash candace Okay, now it's time for some topics to do So First up we have katie parry You know, I Have always registered her as somebody on the far left But I think that things are getting so crazy out there That even people that are on the left are starting to move and realize that if they want to be able to live and work and enjoy Most importantly the places that they love They are going to have to start voting republican and katie parry has done just that Not only is it shocking that she voted republican she voted for republican mayor rick koruso in los angeles But even more shocking is that she posted it to her many followers on instagram So she posted this on instagram with the caption I am voting for a myriad of reasons see the news but in particular because los angeles is a hot mess Hashtag let's go koruso hashtag yes to measure 28 hashtag yes to measure one Hashtag do you but just use your vote? Okay? Now I we do know that she's telling it true There are a myriad of reasons that you should vote for republican governor I mean or republican mayor Uh, if particularly if you love los angeles and you are seeing that it's becoming a drug den and that it is now Appealing to criminals and you're seeing that people are fleeing They're quite literally fleeing los angeles. No better example by the way than the daily wire the daily wire Used to be in los angeles and they uprooted all their employees and they came here to the great deeply red state of Tennessee and I think by the way katie parry it's very brave that you have done this actually make the name of one of your songs Maybe that's sera borallis. I know they sound the song sound like But uh, I think it's incredibly brave that you have posted this so I do want to just shout you out and remind everybody watching That you should be voting today if you've not yet voted then you can still vote go vote Make sure you stay in line Stay in line for the next month because obviously as we are learning Uh, it takes months to count the votes in a totally free and fair election I know I don't know why we were able to always count them someday same day for years until recently but yeah Stay in line for a month your vote will still be counted. All right guys moving on to the inevitable There is a norwegian man who now identifies as a disabled woman and he uses a wheelchair Almost all the time now I should be clear that this man who now identifies as a woman is also able-bodied He does not have anything wrong with his body at all That is not stopping him from getting himself around in a wheelchair and telling people that he self identifies Um as somebody who is paralyzed So on october 28th good morning norway erred an interview with yorand victoria alm\u00e9 53-year-old able-bodied male who now identifies as a disabled woman and in the interview He stated that he had always wished that he had been born a woman who was paralyzed from the waist down Despite having no physical handicaps. He currently utilizes a wheelchair almost all the time So in addition to having generative foria, which is a mental illness and should be characterized as such He also claims to have body integrity disorder, right? And he cites a dissonance between how he perceives himself and how his body functions This is a quote for him. He said I have struggled with this every day my whole life It is a cognitive dissonance in the same way that I experienced being a woman in a man's body I experienced that I should have been paralyzed from the waist down This is not a desire to be a burden on society It is about the wheel wheelchair being an aid for me to function every day life but privately and at work I just want to give a little applause here and say bravo because actually I like this story so much because this individual is telling the truth I like I personally like the sentence This is the same way that I experience being a woman in a man's body I experienced I should have been paralyzed from the waist down. It is the same way Both of these things are mental illnesses and they must be addressed as such Obviously, there is something happening in your brain where you're not thinking clearly and you need to get psychological help You don't need a society aiding you on you don't need a society that is telling you that yes, you are in fact paralyzed It's just I don't know Able-bodiedness is a gender construct able-bodiedness is a social construct whatever it is Um that these idiots are saying today And I think that I like this and I hope that more people Start to claim to have body integrity or and I'm going to tell you why Because it's going to take something like this right for people to understand the slippery slope of not acknowledging reality Right, so if we're going to say that man can say that he's a woman Okay, then we should also say that of course an able-bodied person can say that they're paralyzed and if they can say they're paralyzed Why aren't they getting? uh, wheelchair access Does that mean that they should be able to stand in the DMV and get things changed so that they can actually identify As somebody who's paralyzed that mean that they should be able to park in the handicap spaces Why can't they get a handicap sign for their car? These are very important questions And the only way that society is going to start asking them and trying to draw distinctions between one mental disorder and the other Is if people like this start becoming more extreme This might be the only answer to the crazy problem that we have right now in society Where we have a bunch of people that are trying to legitimatize Mental illness All right guys the holiday season is upon us and I am so excited It is my favorite time of year and I especially look forward to all of the cooking and the baking a few of my favorite dishes Are a baked macaroni and cheese dish that comes from my grandmother as well as a roast beef And this year when it comes to the meat, I'll be cooking with you guys already know Good ranchers good ranchers truly has the best quality meats and they deliver it right to your door making holiday prep so easy and stress free You all see meat prices rising every time you go to the grocery store to combat this and help you save as much as possible This holiday season good ranchers is bringing you their best offer yet But you order from good ranchers.com slash canis and use my code canis you'll get two black angus new york strip steaks free with your order These are two 12 ounce steakhouse quality cuts a $70 value Go to good ranchers.com slash canis and use code canis at checkout but hurry because this offer will end on november 30th Good ranchers american meat delivered Okay guys so life is pretty dark out there and I don't really know how to Present this story to you other than to read it to you directly Um, I'm laughing but I want you know that on the inside I am actually crying because there has been a killer virtual reality headset created and by killer I mean not like mmm colloquialism killer. I mean like no it will kill you imagine a br headset that will actually kill you so This is the article which appeared in the new york post The first ever killer virtual reality headset is here paul marlucky a leader in virtual reality and the founder of oculus better known now as a part of facebook's meta Created a vr headset that will actually kill the user if they die in the game vices motherboard reported players put on a neve gear virtual reality headset and open the new game which is called sword arts online Which is based on the japanese anime and novel of the same name the players must fight their way through a 100 floor dungeon to escape A mad scientist of virtual world the device is connected to three Explosive charge modules above the screen that are aimed at the players forehead Should the player die in the game the microwave emitter would go off obliterating the humans head Lucky who also founded anderol a weapons and defense contractor that has won large contracts with the government Said the explosive charges on the headset are ones he usually uses in different projects Although he did not specify which ones of course because those are going to be from with the government Quote when an appropriate game over screen is displayed the charges fire instantly destroying the brain of the user Lucky roe on his blog on monday according to lucky the devices creator was able to hide from his employees Regulators and contract manufacturing partners I'm a pretty smart guy, but I couldn't come up with any way to make anything like this work Not without attaching the headset to gigantic pieces of equipment But you guys don't worry this article also says because the headset is not available to buy Okay, you won't be worried that I guess if it's not available to buy I don't I don't know why but i'm still feeling pretty worried I don't know why this still feels very wrong and dystopian to me And I could just see kids and Teenagers and mentally ill adults that are chasing a never-ending high Wanting to engage in this. I don't know why this feels like an episode of black mirror Oh, I know because it is there has been Episodes of black mirror exploring virtual reality and people giving themselves the virtual reality and wanting to stay within a virtual reality forever So why not live and die with an virtual reality? The mind of the individual that created this concerns me the idea of this individual also has government contracts That they won't specify why certain technologies that are used have already been used concerns me So no, I'm not feeling like I should not worry at all I think that we need to keep an eye on the space I keep telling you guys the dangers of virtual reality as it returns to pornography Now we're talking about a defense system for your head not a defense and offense system on your head Which could actually kill you let's keep that conversation going The very very concerned especially if you are a parent And that's why I never want my child to play video games because I can see the direction in which video games are headed Moving on you guys and this story Actually kind of it's it's very funny. I'm going to tell you from the top It's a very funny skit that was done on s&l And I have some thoughts about it s&l has decided it's now okay to mock covid insanity And here is them doing an actually funny skit about that Are you feeling tired and worn down sick of the endless grind at work Exhausted by your family desperate for some peace and quiet Then ask your doctor about covid By simply getting covid you're guaranteed a five and sometimes even 10 day vacation from all of life's problems I needed a break just some time away from everyone So my doctor suggested I get covid and it was the greatest week of my life All I wanted was just sit on the good part of the couch and watch the netflix I want to watch and I was finally able to thanks to covid at first I was worried about getting covid, but my doctor assured me it's fine now. I'm triple vax Watch ruble if you count HPV. So it's my time to shine side effects of covid include having covid Which is still kind of bad, but doesn't it seem different now? I definitely got sick But I also got paid for 10 days to never leave a blanket plus I got a great story I could tell people it worked it was like I had a bad cold for three days And of course I had to isolate from my three kids Because I didn't want to get them sick, but uh, what do they eat? I gave it 14 days to be extra safe and for an extra fee will knock out the Wi-Fi near your house So you can't do any zooms. Oh well too bad covid is the perfect way to get out of jury duty cousin's wedding friends improv show neighbors adult baptism and husband's murder trial At this point covid is basically a 10 day cruise, which is also a great way to get covid covid covid isn't for everyone That's why there's also new covid always positive home test The only covid test that comes with two pink lines already drawn on again But you just had it a week ago Please don't do this to me Because sometimes the only way to get mentally healthy is to get physically sick and sure there might be long-term memory problems But that would honestly be amazing because there's so much I want to forget My brain's already really bad if it gets 10 percent worse, but I don't have to talk to a single person for a week I'll take that deal in a horse beat. I mean a heartbeat Either way Thanks covid. Thanks covid. Thanks vovid I think i'll get covid again today covid go ahead you deserve a break Okay objectively very very funny saturday live trying to go back to their old roots and actually be funny and offer political commentary My issue with this is that it's too late Right, it's almost like there is this button and I very much believe that there is a media mafia that exists And they suddenly say okay now you guys can make fun of covid the entire thing has been a joke the entire time and a bunch of spineless politicians a bunch of Spinalous doctors a bunch of spineless parents a bunch of spineless Spinalous political commentators have all gotten in line with this narrative right they've all gotten on there So if they want you to forget that they got in line with the narrative just like us and now got in line with it Right why don't you forget and so the way they're gonna do it now is they're gonna mock it Right now it's safe to come out ding dong the witch is dead and now they can all come out and be like oh my god Yeah, what's our party witch is dead? It's like no, but where were you when the witch was flying around? That's the question that I have because people like me had to take all of the arrows and all of the bullets Because we had the courage said this is wrong and we had the courage to Encourage people to think to think about whether or not they wanted to put a foreign substance in their body That was rushed right and whether or not that was going to be the right thing We had the courage to question the results initially We were told that the vaccine was going to make you immune then didn't do that right and we were mocked and ridiculed publicly For especially me saying I am not getting the vaccine I did that because I wanted other people to know that they didn't have to get the vaccine if they weren't comfortable with it But now all of those spineless people want a little bit of street cred and they're gonna start making fun of it and start pointing the finger and say oh Well, you know, it's not really my fault. No, it is your fault Right, you don't get to be right after the fact have the courage to speak up and say something while people are actually going through Harassment and traumas and dealing with their children being masked if we don't have the courage to do that Then we don't want to hear from you and that's all I have to say about that Okay, I want to take a moment to talk to you guys about express vpn You know, I love this company because they keep my internet data secure We all know big tech spies and our online activity, but have you ever heard of data brokers?

That's ex pr es s vpn Dot com slash candice express vpn dot com slash candice to learn more All right guys fun Time i'm gonna jump into the comments like brett cooper and I love doing this by the way. It's great one thing that I loved was yesterday on the show I dropped a little silent bomb, you know, I just I talked about the letter q And the comments were really funny listing to people grapple with this conversation I have my husband one commenter said can is definitely was high and we was not I don't smoke pot I don't smoke. I don't do drugs I was just on a walk with my husband with our two kids And I needed to share my heart with him and my heart told me that the letter q is redundant All I do guys is tell the truth like I I I had to bring you this because it's been bothering me I wasn't I felt encouraged to say it to him that day and I felt encouraged to tell you Yesterday that q is an unnecessary letter. There's no word that you cannot create That begins the letter q you don't need the q right quick You could just spell it kw i k somebody in the comment sent to me Oh, then you could say the same thing about c you don't need c You just need a k and I said no no no no no no no I want to answer that you do still need c You cannot spell a word like chat without a c You cannot spell a word like cheetah without a c a k is not going to cover that k doesn't make the Sound like a c does in a different way, right? It doesn't doesn't not going to get ch with a k So c is necessary letter k is necessary letter w is an x An necessary level and usually most times it's near is where you have a q You either just need the k or you need the kw It was somebody that was very dumb who helped create the alphabet to came up with the letter q So i'm saying and I do Believe as I told my husband on this walk That this may very well be my hill to die on This may very well be it's bury me here spread my ashes right here on this hill So this comment came from the cfo Uh, nasifo writes l o l I know this wasn't the topic of a day But the letter q may be redundant in the english language, but it's essential in my language It's pronounced to your language when try to say this right Isa kosa right One of the official languages of south africa. You cannot make certain clicks without the letter q So yeah, it's important. I don't disagree with that. I'm speaking particularly about the english language We do not need the q like I know that you need it in Spanish You might need other languages. You might need it in the south african language, but you don't need it in english It's a bad thing that's happened and I have to take a stand Another comment, uh regarding kyrie Irving came from paul eller It says if kyrie did not agree with everything in a documentary Why did he put that documentary out in the first place? Why did he not just not post it? Normally if you post something that means that you agree with everything of a documentary So now he is blamed for all the documentary content that is absolutely not true It's absolutely not true But if you post something it means that you agree with every single word of the content I mean you might post me having done a documentary the smash hit documentary The greatest lie ever sold and you may disagree with one portion of it You're just saying food for thought like sometimes when you watch something and it gets you thinking and I saw a lot of people in black america I'm grateful that had fallen for the blm narrative and then saw my documentary and were like This has given me a different version of events. You know, I think some of what can is the saying a shoe some of it's wrong It allows us to think it allows us to at least think about topics You know and I as I said yesterday I understand why certain people may have been upset and but the idea that kyrie Irving agrees with everything a documentary But we have to agree if we share a show I I mean I just In this episode shared something from s and l. I don't even like s and l Do I now have to cosign with every single thing s and l has ever said and done? No, I presented it to you because I wanted to talk about that as a topic And I told you I like what they're saying about kovid here But I disagree with their timing on it conversations happen when we share and when we communicate and when we debate certain topics And kyrie Irving is not exempt from being able to do that as well. Just because he plays basketball Next comment is from haley spurbeck. She writes the way they are going after kyrie and kanya is insane Thank you can't is for continuing to back them up and not letting it go This is crazy My daughter came home from school yesterday and said one of her teachers told her kyrie was anti-semitic And they were really mad. She's a child. She doesn't even know what is happening My husband and I are going up there, but it's time to figure out homeschooling Wow totally insane that this would ever make its way into a classroom And that just goes to show you that people are Rache and they are emotional and they enter judgment very quickly and they are in lockstep with whatever the media message is of the day I do not believe that kyrie Irving is anti-semitic and I will say that over and over and over again least of all because he shared a documentary link Uh, and he plainly said I am not anti-semitic when he gave a press conference And so the idea that a teacher was feeling so, you know fired up by what she read in the media that she offered that opinion to a child Is really wrong. You are right to be concerned about that. You are right to go into school and discuss that Um, and I just want to express that a thousand times that this is the reason why I do believe in homeschooling is because A lot of time what we have going on in these classrooms is that These teachers are immature. They're emotionally immature babies, right? They are impacted by the moment There are no different in terms of their emotional and spiritual growth as your child That's in the classroom with them And I know it can be hard to rise above the moment and to realize that it's just a moment But it's really important that all of us make an effort to do that Another comment regarding my interview with mia the rapper if you have not seen that by the way guys Please go find it in its entirety on youtube. It was incredible discussion What a beautiful soul and a beautiful spirit who it has gone through a lot and is going through a lot Um as somebody who has as I said earlier been told that hey, we will make you even richer But you just got to shut up we will make you even richer, but you just have to have this stance It's so encouraging when you come across an artist who doesn't do that In our set doesn't back down and who basically says that the money does not mean that to me Amaya is just that Um, she goes by mia and real life and raschini saw the interview and has this to say She says i'm a sherry lonkin person. It does paint me what happened here with regard to the civil war and politics Goes to show how conflict is a good thing for politicians and how the unwillingness to communicate and treat people as individuals Regardless of their race or culture can really escalate disputes. That is so true Um, again, mia talks about in our conversation What it was like for her when she just wanted to talk about her childhood Like she was actually she actually lived through that civil war and basically when she got to hollywood They said to her you got to shut up. You're not allowed to say that because the political Machine has decided that you're a terrorist sympathizer. I mean that is so horrific to imagine that you can't talk about your own life Um, so again go watch that Another comment from bc rat she writes If that's the hill she wants to die on cool Beyonce is a black american artist and she's going to advocate for things that impact her in the country She's from there's war everywhere. It's not bionc a job to use her platform for what mia thinks is important She was a big artist as well and could speak up for her people and whatever is important to her It's like they are both choosing to ignore the obvious who is she to speak on american politics or american racial issues Anyways, I love canada's dress and makeup Uh, okay, so she's uh talking about a moment in the interview where mia talks about how she was fined I think it was 15 million dollars from the super bowl for giving the middle finger which was a middle finger to american politics and But she what she was trying to draw attention to and I think it maybe misunderstood her Uh, was that beyond say was allowed to get on the super bowl stage and basically Become a banner for black lives matter and that was political and she didn't get fined And which is worse wire wire of these things not being treated the same you might disagree with that You might be pro bianc anti-nia, but it is worthy of discussion All right guys, that's it I'm going to continue reading some of your comments and i'm also going to answer your questions in the next portion of the show Which is going to available exclusively on daily wire plus if you're not a member yet Go ahead and click the link in the description and subscribe right now You"
