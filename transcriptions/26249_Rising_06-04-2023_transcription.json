    "text": " Hello and welcome to Rising. We're back with another jam-packed show for you today. And I'm so excited to be joined at the desk by Jason Nichols, senior lecturer of African-American Studies at UMD and host of the Working Class Podcast. Jason, we've had you on as a guest. It's so nice to have you here in the hosting chair. Yeah, no, it's great to be here. I feel like I'm moving on up or rising, as they say. There we go. Dude, hosting rising. That's what we have today. So let's get right into it with the former president officially indicted speculation over whether these charges will win Joe Biden re-election or backfire for Democrats. That continues to grow according to the Wall Street Journal. Democratic operatives want Trump to be the 2024 Republican nominee because they think he'll be the easiest to beat. I think I might have heard that one before. Now, Trump's main primary threat, Florida governor, Rhonda Santis, still has not announced that he is running. That did not stop, however, Representative Thomas Massey, Republican, from throwing his endorsement behind DeSantis just hours within Trump's arraignment. His statement reads, quote, America needs a leader who is decisive, respects the Constitution, understands policy, puts family first and leads by inspiring. That's why I'm endorsing Rhonda Santis for president. Meanwhile, on the other side of the aisle, controversial vaccine skeptic and activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has filed a run for president in 2024 as a Democrat. The son of Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of John F. Kennedy, R.F.K. Jr. has faced condemnation for his crusade against vaccine mandates for children. Kennedy has long espoused theories that routine childhood vaccines cause autism. A little bit of a single issue candidacy for R.F.K. He's widely known for the anti-vaccines, even before, totally pre-ating COVID. Marianne Williamson, obviously another person challenging Biden. I don't know. I think Biden is overwhelmingly likely. I don't think Biden is losing sleep over R.F.K. Jr., particularly in a Democratic primary. I don't think he's losing sleep over Marianne Williamson. I don't think that they're going to get much coverage. I think the liberal media is pretty much all in on Joe Biden. They're not going to get them any air. And I think Marianne Williamson in particular, she didn't necessarily do herself any favors from those debates in 2020. And R.F.K., I mean, he's rejected by his own family. So he's going to have a tough time getting over an incumbent president. Sure. And a more interesting battle is on the Republican side where it's so interesting. It's echoes of 2016 to hear the whole Democrats want to be up against Trump because they think he's the weakest candidate. Like, that's what Hillary Clinton thought. Hillary Clinton in 2016 absolutely wanted to run against Donald Trump, and then she lost. I think I agree probably that Trump would be a weaker GOP nominee than basically anyone else with an R next to his name. But I don't know. He still has a very rabid base of supporters. Maybe he still has an appeal to working class voters in the Rust Belt who gave him the election in 2016. Obviously, it wasn't enough in 2020. So you could say, I don't know who's going to vote for him in 2024, who didn't vote for him. Like our new people coming to Trump. Yeah, see, I think that's the calculation that Democrats are making. They're saying he underperformed in 2018 in the midterms. He underperformed, he lost in 2020. And we overperformed in 2022. Democrats did. Democrats when it really could have been a route. I mean, people were talking about 90 seats. And here, we're down what five seats or something like that. So when you're also trying to tie candidates to somebody that is in some of these states wide races and some of these congressional races, you want to tie them to Donald Trump? And we've seen that actually work for Democrats a few times. I mean, they donated to some of these pro-Trump candidates. And it actually worked out for them. I was somebody who criticized them for that. But it seemed to work out for them. Yeah, how can they Democrats and people in the media say that Trump is a unique and existential threat to democracy? But also we'd prefer he's a Republican nominee for president. That's a totally hypocritical... Again, I think they think he's vulnerable. He's beatable. I think that some of these culture war items that people like DeSantis are fighting are popular, actually. And DeSantis, though, I don't think that he's a very charismatic guy, he doesn't have what Trump has. He's not an entertainer like Trump. I think Trump will beat him in a primary. But when you're looking for that sliver of persuadable voters, DeSantis has a better chance of persuading the middle than Donald Trump. Donald Trump, and also I think Donald Trump does for the left what Hillary Clinton did for the right. They get fired up. They go out and vote. You can press all those ads and people get excited and angry and it stirs up emotion. And I think that that's what Hillary Clinton did in 2016 for the right. That's why they were screaming, lock her up and all of that. I think that's what Donald Trump does for the left. And that's what the Democratic establishment is banking on. Well, and that's why this entire indictment, prosecution of Trump, does feel, even if there is some thin, but existing underlying rationale for bringing the charges, it does feel political because it feels, in some sense, calculated to make Trump a martyr. And once again, a sympathetic figure of worship among his, fire them up to make sure he gets the nomination because Democrats want to be up against him. Perhaps. That's the calculus, right? I mean, perhaps. I think some of this is that these DAs think that they actually have a case against a powerful person. And I'm not necessarily totally opposed to it because I think billionaires who fly around in jets with their name on the side should face the same justice system that a shop lifter faces. I don't think there should be any tears to the justice system based on your class. I think a middle class person who makes a tax error could find themselves in front of a judge, but billionaires generally don't. So I'm not necessarily opposed to this from that angle, but I don't think they want to fire up because the entire Republican constituency has gotten fired up about this. It's not just Trump's base, even people, even his opponents, which I think is a mistake if I were advising any of them, but even his- It's universal. Yeah, they all coalesced around Trump, including DeSantis. Yeah. Well, I mean, to be fair, even some, even many, I think Democrats or liberal commentators are noting that the strength of the case is not quite what they necessarily thought. And we're going to talk about that more a little bit later in the show. Before we go, I want to comment again, going back to the RFK issue, what I think might be interesting is- And obviously, I don't, you know, I don't cosign everything he's ever said about vaccines. I probably disagree with him on a lot of that stuff. But if he criticizes some of the vaccine-related mandates that Democrats foisted on many of their cities, on schools, Joe Biden obviously had the federal order for thousands and thousands and thousands, millions of workers throughout- that got struck down by the Supreme Court. So it would be interesting to see if he can use that as kind of a wedge issue. It might hurt Biden. It might damage him in some way. Obviously, it's not going to result in RFK. It's the nomination. But it's going to be interesting to see someone running as a Democrat, but criticizing Biden for COVID-related overreach. Yeah, I think for mandates, I think that perhaps there are some people, particularly African Americans, who were not in favor of mandates. But I think when you're talking about vaccines for tetanus or vaccines for polio, which we know has saved millions upon millions of lives, I think people are going to say that's a bridge too far. And I don't think he's going to get much traction. And I think that if he were to get traction, they would just make it seem like he is a nut. You know, that's against vaccines altogether. And that's kind of where he stands. I mean, he's against vaccines. He's not just against vaccine mandates. I think you have a strong discussion there if you want to talk about vaccine mandates. But if you want to say that the polio vaccine was a negative thing, and you have no evidence, strong evidence that says that it causes autism, I think he's not going to really gain the traction. Well, some people draw a distinction between vaccines and the vaccines that specifically use mRNA technology. I'm not sure that I don't know that he draws that distinction. I'd have to learn more closely what he thinks about that, which we probably will do at a later date. But we'll have more rising right after this. Stay with us. ProPublica is out with new bombshell reporting, supposedly, that exposes the Supreme Court's corruption, according to them detailing Justice Clarence Thomas' 20-year-long relationship with billionaire Republican donor Harlan Crow. The report alleges that Thomas was treated to luxury vacations with the help of Crow, including traveling on his yacht, staying at his private resort, and using his private jet. The former former former Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is calling for Justice Thomas to be impeached, saying this is beyond party or partisanship. This degree of corruption is shocking. Almost cartoonish Thomas must be impeached, barring some dramatic change. This is what the Roberts Court will be known for, rank corruption, erosion of democracy, and the stripping of human rights. I read this story. I don't think it's a bombshell at all. I think it's actually a total nothing burger. He has a wealthy friend that they've gone on trips. Look, if you think Clarissa Thomas is his views come because he's influenced by his views or his views. You might think they're wrong, but he clearly deeply holds them. He is married to a woman, Jenny Thomas, who is a conservative activist. There's no way getting around the conflict of interest. His wife is a very influential conservative activist. The Supreme Court obviously doesn't have the same kind of rules about these kinds of things that other branches of government have. Maybe you think that's bad. I don't see any... If he violated some actual rule, then fine make that case. But I don't understand that they're making this out to be very nefarious. Just disagree with him if you disagree with him. He has sincerely held conservative views on these issues. It's not like, oh, he got taken on this yacht by this rich friend and he's changing his mind about a case. I don't believe that. Yeah, I tend to agree with you here. I mean, we know Clarence Thomas has been Clarence Thomas since the 80s. He's always had these views, these conservative views since his experience in law school, according to him, when he started researching Thomas' soul. So that's... I don't think that this is necessarily the bombshell that it's being made out to be. I do think there are other areas where Thomas should recuse himself from certain cases and perhaps there could be ethical violations. The other thing is I think we need to solidify what is allowed in the Supreme Court. I think that some of that is kind of a morphist and that's part of the problem and nebulous. But this particular thing, he has wealthy friends. I need to make some of those friends, for real. Like, sometimes you support me on a private jet and take me to a private resort. Sounds like some nice vacations. Yeah, I mean, I don't know how you just integral. Actually, Ginny Thomas, his wife, was a conservative activist. We've seen her text messages that were made public as a result of some January 6 related stuff that she was, I think, engaging. I don't remember exactly what she texted or said, but was exploring some of the stop the steel type rhetoric or ideas or theories. I understand, obviously, why people would be concerned about that behavior being so proximal to a Supreme Court justice. And I can understand why you would think he should recuse himself than specifically for election-related cases. So by comparison, the fact that he went on, he goes on trips with a long time family friend is not so... Obviously, if that guy specifically had a real estate case or something that came before the Supreme Court, and Thomas didn't recuse himself, that would be a huge scandal. Still, I mean, there's nothing you do. The justices get to decide which cases they recuse themselves from. There's no standard for this kind of... The Supreme Court kind of just operates under the rules that the nine of them come up with. Yeah, and I think that's probably... But that'd be bad. You know, I think that we need to iron out the rules for the Supreme Court and realize that it's just not, hey, you get to stay here for life and do what you want. Even with some of the things that we saw with Justice Alito and some of the information that he may or may not have been spreading at public events or even private events about upcoming cases, there needs to be some rules put on the Supreme Court that are clear that the American people are privy to. So we know that there are some constraints to the Supreme Court. And the AOC's one to talk. She's facing... She faced an ethics investigation relating to that dress she wore at the... What was it? The Met Gala. Last year, I think, they eat the rich dress. There was some... She faced some kind of... Whether that was a gift... Also, maybe not the dress itself, but the tickets for the event, I believe. We talked... Breon and I talked about it on the show. Maybe it was me and Bacha. She... There was a question of whether she paid back the people who helped do like her wardrobe, hair and makeup. There was a question of whether she was the guest of Anna Winter who is like with Vogue. She was a guest of Vogue, but could she do that? It was a whole kind of congressional ethics thing where she did admit some wrongdoing. And I don't think it's a big deal or whatever. I think if you have friends who happen to be wealthy and they take you on vacations and let you fly on their private jets, I don't think that that, like you said, unless there's some sort of even tangential connection there, I think you can certainly make a complaint. And he should definitely recuse himself if a case specifically involving this person's land or property or find it came up. But I think what ProPublica is saying here is that it's unethical or it's corrupt because this person is a supporter and a donor to conservative causes. They're just ideologically simpatico in that way. How long, I mean it says that they have this relationship for 20 years, but how long have they been friends? You can't tell people to abandon their friends just because they get a new position even though I'm abandoning a lot of my friends. Now that I'm in this seat, you're rising way too big for them. Now that you're making the big bucks. Exactly. I think that I generally, politically, generally I'm on the same side as AOC. I generally agree with her. This one, I don't think that this is the hill to die on if you want to get rid of Clarence Thomas. I think there are other issues, like you said with Ginny Thomas and her connection to January 6, that should be explored more and see if he's compromised. I remember one of those election related cases, it was eight to one. He was the one dissenting vote. It was even Gorsuch and ACB and Kavanaugh. They were like, yeah, this is flimsy. But he was the one that, you know- Well I think he said, if you're referring to the one I'm thinking, right, didn't he say, I think both him and Alito would have heard a case. Not necessarily that they would have, they didn't dismiss it out of hand the way most of the other justices, including, as you point out, the other conservative justices, which shows that there is, I think liberals treat the conservative justices and maybe conservative treat the liberal justices this way as well as some kind of monolith. But there are cases where Gorsuch and Kavanaugh disagree on a lot of stuff. Sometimes it's like, a lot of cases just 9-0, right? They all end up agreeing. I mean, you have to have a strong case. And if your legal rationale is flimsy, I mean, these guys have a judicial philosophy, but there are some things that just aren't good. You didn't bring a strong case and you're going to get wiped out in the Supreme Court. I remember there was a case with an African-American media mogul who owns the Greo and he brought a case and got beaten 9-0. And everybody said this is what's going to happen and it's exactly what happened. So he couldn't get some of the liberal justices on his side because it wasn't a strong case. My favorite is when that happens to the federal government when they lose the 9-0 case. Because I like when the federal government is humiliated. All right, that does it for us. More rising right after this. It's part of their continuing coverage of former President Trump's indictment this week. ABC News played a clip from Trump's first speech after his arraignment. But apparently they blurred out the text Trump to 88022 on the podium. Let's actually take a look at that. I never thought anything like this could happen in America. Never thought it could happen. Well, according to The Washington Post, by texting this number, one would receive exclusive updates and messages from Trump for president. Now one day after being charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, Trump took to truth social and demanded defunding the police. Republicans in Congress should defund the DOJ and FBI until they come to their senses. The Democrats have totally weaponized law enforcement in our country and are viciously using this abusive power to interfere with our already under siege elections. And just to briefly clarify, Donald Trump in fact lost the 2020 presidential election. Joe Biden won it. Disclaimer, have to make given social media's various policies. Trump also said almost every legal and political analyst has said the unfair and morally disgusting indictment filed against me yesterday has no merit. And it's not even a case. There was no crime in any way. The statute of limitations has been violated by many years. Joining us now to discuss is legal affairs reporter at the Hill, Rebecca Bich. Welcome Rebecca. How you doing? Hey guys, thanks so much for having me. It's great having you. Now, do you think Trump is correct about this, particularly when it comes to the statute of limitations? Has that passed? Does he actually have an argument? And is there a chance that we'll see these charges dismissed? So that's actually going to be one of the first things that's considered in court. So Trump's team has until August to kind of file motions asking to dismiss this case. Doing so will involve getting the judge to agree, you know, to a couple of different things, but essentially that either that Manhattan District Attorney Bragg didn't have enough evidence or that the statute of limitations has passed. In New York for felonies, that timeline is about five years, but you can do something that's called tolling, and that's essentially just the process of preference when a defendant has been consistently out of state, which in Trump's case, he largely has been either by living in Washington or in Florida. Rebecca, some people are saying that the aspect of this indictment, the raising it from misdemeanor to felony, rests on an untested legal theory. Can you elaborate on the creativity Bragg kind of deployed here in order to make it not just a misdemeanor, but a felony and why we're not sure that's going to pass muster in New York court? Yeah. So the elevation that you're talking about is actually pretty common. This is something that Bragg's office does all the time. Falsification of business records is a pretty common charge that they've brought, and it's very common to elevate that to a felony if that behavior was done to obscure another crime. What is a little novel here is that he's tying that to campaign violations, and what he's insinuated both in court documents and in his public statements is that he plans to pursue an elevation to a felony charge through both state and federal campaign laws. And so Trump's team has argued that as a state prosecutor, he Trump and Trump being a federal candidate that he cannot be charged for violating any state campaign laws. And he's also arguing that it would take federal authorities to prosecute him for a federal crime. Some legal observers think that Bragg does have a shot here that Trump can't magically either state or federal charges, but that's ultimately going to be up to the judge to decide. Well, according to the Hill, references to tax law violations are spread throughout the documents and public statements from Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg regarding Donald Trump, which could be assigned that New York prosecutors may be planning to bring a larger case against him. Experts say that even though Trump has been indicted, it is, quote, not guaranteed that the former president would serve jail time if he's convicted. Could you comment on whether there's going to be more charges or more to this case forthcoming? Obviously, I think a lot of commentators have been underwhelmed. Even Democrats, even people who think there could theoretically be some real justification to charges against Trump have been underwhelmed so far by what Bragg has presented. And he's kind of hinted at that there's more coming. Can you walk us through some of that? Yeah. So as we were talking about earlier, there are some complications in terms of elevating this to a felony through campaign through different campaign violation. So Bragg has pointed to tax statutes in a few different instances in court filings and also in his public statements. At one point, they note that Trump and his organization inflated a payment to his fixer, Michael Cohen, the one who made the original payment to Stormy Daniels to kind of compensate for the fact that he would lose a lot of that money for income taxes. And so that could potentially be a crime, another financial crime. And I think what we're seeing from observers is just that this is a way to bolster the case. At this juncture, Bragg does not have to completely lay out his entire strategy or even completely specify his charges. A lot of that is going to be hammered out in the next few months. And it's a little bit of a signal that if he does face issues on the campaign front, that he has the tax option on the back burner. So Rebecca, I have a question about the charges. Some people say that when this goes in front of a jury that because this is complicated, because this involves documents, that it could confuse a jury. Do you think that that's a chance? And also, my other question is kind of an opinion question, and that is, are you going to be able to find 12 Americans that would convict former President Trump? You know, I do think it's likely that Trump's team might ask for a change of venue, just given that New York, you know, maybe doesn't have as diverse of a population as other parts of the US. That's certainly a possibility. But I think it's always a challenge for prosecutors to kind of explain, you know, the charges they're bringing and what aspects of the law have to be met in order for someone to be guilty of a crime. And so I think in their case, what's going to be key here is demonstrating right the tie to the election, to the campaign. And in court filings, there is a synopsis of an exchange between Trump and Michael Cohen indicating that he wanted to, you know, delay the payment to Stormy Daniels for as long as possible, indicating something to the effect of, you know, if we can wait till after the election, this payment won't even matter anymore. So I think they do have some evidence that could help bolster that case. So I think until we see, you know, more of the evidence, more documents come out in court, it's just, it's too early to say how strong the case is or isn't. You know, just understand the weight of the evidence that they will be. Rebecca, thank you so much for joining us this morning. We really appreciate it. CNN host Don Lemon is under fire once again for accusations of a history of alleged misogyny, this time with a new expose from Variety. Sources told the outlet that Lemon displayed a pattern of hostile behavior toward his female coworkers, even going as far as threatening one in 2008, which is back a long while, but there it is. A spokesperson for Lemon has denied the new report calling it patently false. Here with us to discuss is Sabrina Salvati, host of the SaviSab podcast and co-host of Revolutionary Blackout Network podcast as well. Thank you so much for being with us, Sabrina. How you doing? I'm doing great. Thanks for having me on. So Sabrina, what can you tell us about this situation with Don Lemon? Because we've been hearing a lot of different things. There's been a lot of chatter about him not getting along with his female coworkers right now since he's been moved into a new spot from his old prime time spot to a morning show. What can you tell us about this, this whole situation? I think that Don Lemon has had a history of inappropriate behavior at work. In reference to this particular situation with a history of misogyny towards his female coworkers, there was also the incident in reference to Nikki Haley, where he said that she was not in her prime, so to speak, which was really interesting because because when we look at someone like Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton, both of them also ran for president and they are older than Nikki Haley. So I think this shows a type of partisan politics divide that we see between networks like CNN and Fox News, where there is this tendency to play to the Democratic Party audience. And that's what CNN chooses to represent. So I think a big part of the problem that we see with Don Lemon, though, it's not just about these claims about misogyny. There has also been incidents of unethical journalism. If we go back to the Jesse Smollett case, it was actually Don Lemon, who was the one who contacted Jesse Smollett to warn him, so to speak, that the Chicago PD did not believe his story. That's not ethical journalism, but it seems as though there was no accountability for that behavior either. So we really need to start asking ourselves, what is going on at CNN? What is the management doing? Why has Don Lemon not been held accountable? And why did it take this incident with Nikki Haley for them to finally say he needs to have some type of training, so to speak? I honestly say that if it were Tucker Carlson who made those comments about a woman not being in her prime, I think a lot of liberals would be really irate. So there seems to be a bit of inconsistency when we talk about who we're going to hold accountable, depending on what party they're a part of at that time. I actually didn't know that detail about his involvement in the Jesse Smollett incident. That is fascinating. Yeah, I've criticized him. Because it's not just how he treats really his co-hosts. I think he's not treated particularly well, not just on the whole past or prime remark, but there was an incident where Kaitlyn Collins, one of the co-hosts, was interviewing, I believe it was Representative James Comer about the efforts to hold various federal agencies accountable. And then it cuts, she's remote with the guests, and then it cuts back to Don Lemon. And he tried to sort of impune the entire, can you believe we've gotten to this place where we're interviewing Republicans saying things I disagree with? And it was such a weird, he was undercutting her, but he was undercutting the idea of the network doing journalism at all. So weird. Yeah, well, I think this is part of the problem that we have gone past the age of the Walter Cronkite style of journalism, so to speak. Now it's more about infotainment. That's what Rachel Maddow described it as when she was asked about talking about Russiagate. She said, well, technically I'm not news, I'm infotainment. So this is a big part of the problem. It seems like to me, Don Lemon doesn't want to have conversations with people that he disagrees with. But I also really believe that Don Lemon knows that CNN would receive a lot of backlash if they were to remove him or try to hold him accountable. And we can point to a network like MSNBC, for example, look at the backlash that they receive when they remove Tiffany Cross. So I think that CNN wants to be very careful because they know if they were to remove Don Lemon, there would be backlash from their liberal audience and they can use two claims. They could say, how dare you remove a black journalist? And they can also say, how dare you remove a black journalist who's a member of the LGBTQ community. Don Lemon knows that he does have those two identity factors that work in his favor. So well, when Tiffany Cross was removed, I mean, there was a ripple of backlash from African Americans, but it certainly didn't bring her back. And she's still not on the air. My question is kind of something that you've kind of talked about in alluded to, and that is about his claim to be a journalist. He's Don Lemon, a journalist. And should he be held to the same journalistic standard as hardcore journalists? I think even my friend Tucker Carlson would tell you that he's not a journalist. He's kind of an information entertainer, same with Sean Hannity, same with some of the people on MSNBC, you cited, Rachel Maddow. So can he certainly make the argument that he can make the call to Jesse Smollett because he's not a journalist. He's not held to those same standards. He could try to do that. But at the same time, CNN is a news network, and he is an employee at that news network, and he does have a responsibility to the American people to give them the facts. And it's not just him, that network and its entirety, they have had numerous claims where they have done this before, where they have said information on air and it turned out to not be completely true. And a lot of times they don't come back and try to, you know, retract those statements either. So I totally get where you're coming from, but at the same time, like if you are on a news show and you are a part of a news network, you are supposed to give people the news. So I think we need to ask ourselves, where is journalism this day and age and who and what are considered real news, so to speak? And if they're not considered real news, then maybe they shouldn't be called a news network. Well, and something Fox does that its rivals do not do as far as I can tell is Fox draws a clearer line between which of its hosts are opinion people and which are news people, like Bret Baer is a news person, so he's going to be held to the kind of, you know, from a newspaper standpoint, right? The news page, the op-ed page, they're different things are loud, they're different standards, and Fox says, right, yeah, Tucker Carlson is a commentator. Sean Hannity is a commentator. Bret Baer is a news host. A lot of people during the day, news host. CNN, actually an MSNBC, I don't really make that distinction in the same way, so then you have someone like Don Lemon, who is like ostensibly right in a news role on a news network, but is also playing by kind of like opinion and commentary rules. Anyway, the whole situation does not seem to devolve to CNN's benefit because their ratings are still terrible. They haven't been able to reverse any of those. Fewer and fewer people are watching. They lose out to Fox and a host of other programs every night, so why don't they change course? I think they tried to change course in a sense. They did have a new management come in, and I think that was an effort to help the ratings, so to speak, but it doesn't seem to be helping at all. But I think a big part of the fact is their message is very clear to people that we can see as an audience that there is a bias when it comes to CNN. There's a bias when it comes to Fox News as well, but I think the difference is CNN tries to pretend like it's not. When you see news networks like CNN or MSNBC cut from speeches that they don't think is as a narrative that they want their audience to hear, that's not ethical journalism. When you see these networks only interview certain people and keep their audience basically barred from another type of narrative, that's not ethical journalism. And I think it goes further than this. It's not just about talking about someone like Nikki Haley, who is running for president. It also goes into this issue of Russia and Ukraine. Look at the people that they bring on to the network to talk about this war. They do not bring on people who are anti-war voices. They bring on people that fit the narrative that CNN wants to push. And so I think more Americans are starting to see how biased some of these mainstream media networks are and people are starting to tune into other outlets, which is independent media, so to speak. Sabrina, thank you so much for joining us today. We really appreciate it. Thank you. White House Press Secretary Terrine Jampier had this to say about NPR's reporting after Twitter labeled the outlet as state-affiliated media on its site. Let's listen. A hard-hitting, independent nature of their coverage speaks for itself. Well, journalist Glenn Greenwald responded to the White House Press Secretary tweeting, the best way for a news outlet like NPR to show that they're not beholden to the US government and are unbiased is to have the White House Press Secretary rise to her feet in defense of NPR, and he prays on their great reporting. Yeah, it truly independent outlets anger the state. They often end up where Biden DOJ has put Assange not showered with praise by White House Press Secretary. When is the last time NPR did reporting that angered the Biden White House, FBI, CIA, NSA, et cetera? Greenwald also tweeted, amazing NPR in trying to argue it's not state-affiliated didn't only cite the praise of the White House Press Secretary for its journalism. It also cited this BS self-proclaimed disinformation expert who works in a program funded by the Pentagon. It's always red flags for me. This is obviously, look, OK. Yes, NPR is not compelled by the government to have a certain editorial voice. It is true that its editorial voice does happen to, I think, like obviously, align with the values of like kind of progressive Democrats who staff the Biden administration and would staff whatever administration is in charge if it's a Democrat. They're not, yes, they're not state-affiliated the same way an actual government-directed propaganda channel would be. They're actually not even state-affiliated to the same degree that like the BBC is. Right. So I appreciate the criticism I saw that if you're really going to go down this route of any government funding, the BBC would be more fitting of this designation than NPR. But like it is state-funded. It gets its budget from Congress. You can't say it doesn't. Some people have tried to draw this. Well, it's not government-funded. It's public-funded. Well, the public funds are picked by the government. Michael Tracy actually said this. Can we throw up this tweet? He was responding to, independent journalist Michael Tracy was responding to someone saying, like, it's disinformation to say it's government-funded. It's publicly-funded. It's the same thing. Yeah, no, I'm in agreement there. I think it is publicly-funded, which is essentially state-funded. It's definitely not. I think the characterization a little bit. I think Glenn Greenwald goes a little far there. I mean, for him to make it seem like it's Fox or MSNBC or one of these slanted towards the White House, whomever the White House is, I think that that's not what NPR is. I think a lot of the people there consider themselves to be nonpartisan journalists, but it is, in fact, state-funded. I mean, that's a reality that we can't get away from. And it is, like you said, less than the BBC, less than CBC, less than TRT, less than, of course, Russian state media. I don't think you can necessarily put it in that same category, but you can't deny that it is publicly-funded, which means that it's state-funded. Yeah, which is the thing I don't like. I actually like how we describe it on Twitter is not a very important issue. I would certainly, it gets 1% of it's funding from the government. We can just, it can, it can, it could get rid of this concern by just not taking government funding anymore, which is what I think it should do. But Brianna and I were talking about this yesterday, and she's like, oh, you want to drag Big Bird out behind the alley and shoot him on Sesame Street? And I was kind of like, yeah. You admit Romney. You admit Romney. Let me tell you, Robbie. You admit Romney have some sort of problem with Big Bird and Oscar the Grappler. What's going on with that? No, we just, I don't like, I mean, I don't like government funding of anything, but especially government funding of the media. It is interesting that, so this criticism of it as seat-affiliated is right, because the perspective aligns currently with the state. I appreciate that, like if there was a Republican administration and you'd have conservative new sites that would align with what, you know, President Trump would say, I don't think conservatives would say, well, this outlet is state-affiliated because it happens to, like, share the view of the Trump administration. So I would say it's a little unfair to go that route. Yeah, I mean, I think it's, it's just judging a media outlet by whether it has angered the White House is not a good, I don't think that's a real gauge, even of independence. I think, you know, media outlets are supposed to report the facts. And if they find, particularly nonpartisan media outlets are supposed to report the facts, if they find some facts on an issue that's important to the American people and it's damaging to the Biden administration, then, you know, I think that that's what they should report on. But the idea that, hey, they haven't angered the FBI or they haven't angered the NSA as a gauge of independence, I think that's a, that's a poor gauge. Well, meanwhile, according to a new report from Semaphore, Twitter is no longer policing Russian and Chinese state-backed media, violating the platform's own policies in 2020. Twitter began labeling official government and state-controlled media accounts, accounts and blocked the state-controlled ones from appearing in search results. Also, last year, Twitter announced it would be flagging tweets that contained links to government-controlled sites and would tell users to stay informed. But in tests conducted by Semaphore, the state-informed labels no longer show up. I'm not sure I would object to that. The handholding that the platforms try to do with users is, I think, often ill-advised. Twitter's one feature that I do like is the community notes thing. It's kind of a, you know, self-policing fact-checking because you can have a community note that's policing a tweet or fact-checking it. And then you can respond to the note as well. It's kind of like the way Wikipedia works or something, which tends to certainly not perfect but produces higher quality information than a lot of other, you know, very, I would say, ham-fisted attempts to police information on social media, on Facebook. It's just done by ideological activists. The platform tried to do it. You remember the ridiculousness of them like the selectivity of putting like COVID fact-checks and election fact-checks on everything. So then the information changes. Yeah, I mean, I don't have a problem with fact-checks if they're actually factual. I think sometimes we didn't have the facts. And you know, I think saying something needs context. There have been times where I've seen a video and it's gotten me all riled up and come to find out that there was context missing from that video. And I would have liked to have been informed, you know, by the outlet to say, hey, there's more you need to know before you, you know, you look at this video and maybe come to this conclusion or maybe you hear this statement or maybe this is a statement from 2015 and it's not from yesterday. So I think that, you know, those kinds of things are important for social media outlets to put in. But, you know, to say this is misinformation or, you know, to really police, you know, speech in some of these outlets, even if they are state-controlled media, I think is a dangerous path to go down. Mm-hmm. I agree. I think that's a big bird and Oscar the grouse survive for now, but we'll have more rising right after this. California Governor Gavin Newsom visited Florida yesterday because he was getting out of California just like everybody else, where he met with students from the new College of Florida campus who, according to the Sarasota Herald Tribune, are dealing with Florida Governor Rhonda Santis's quote, conservative higher education experiment. During his surprise visit to the Sunshine State, Newsom made a stab at DeSantis telling students, I'm crawling out of my skin for you. I want you to know you're not alone. You matter. He has one thing that is common with everything he's doing, bullying, and intimidating vulnerable communities. USA Today reports the visit to meet the students was a last-minute add-on to the trip Newsom was taking through Republican-controlled states in the South, where he was criticizing certain policies of Red State leaders, according to USA Today. According to the Sarasota Herald Tribune, New College, which is Florida's public honors college, has been known as a progressive institution and, as of late, has been the target of many of DeSantis's decisions, including firing the former president and removing the office in charge of quote, diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. So it's interesting to see Newsom coming to Florida. Obviously, there's been a lot of discussion of people fleeing the state of California. Newsom coming to Florida. People have been leaving California for places like Texas and Florida in part due to concerns about crime, I think, and also, I think. I think it's just cost of living. Cost of living to some of the frustration with the COVID mandates. Look, obviously, what DeSantis is specifically doing at New College, I don't really see the point or the necessity of it. My view would be like, if you want to make a conservative, there can be a conservative college and there can be an artsy liberal school and there can be as many schools and then everyone should go to the one that they want to go to, instead of imposing your values on each and every school is what I would like to get away from. Yeah, and I think that's the argument, at least I think, that Gavin Newsom is making. And I love the nickname, the Gavenator, that you created. I want to make sure that the world knows. I said that, and then we made a mistake. This guy is running over again. The Gavenator. The Gavenator. Now, me as someone who teaches in higher education, I am very concerned about constraints put on academic lessons. I think I was reading an article where a student was saying, they think we're reading the communist manifesto. And I'm like, and the kid was a political science major. I'm like, you should be reading the communist manifesto as a political science major. Not that you have to agree with it or accept it, but these are the texts, these are important texts for understanding the world. So the idea that we want to close people off to academic concepts and academic ideas, and the idea that even we were okay with making certain people uncomfortable in a college environment is troubling to me. Yeah, I think if the efforts are concentrated at the higher end level, and especially the K through 12 level, at replacing or getting rid of some of this, the kind of DEI, administrative side of things that I and many conservatives have argued can actually get in the way of academic freedom, if everyone feels like they have to follow these administrative dictates relating to all sorts of things that that can actually be bad, I separate that from an authority figure trying to come in and dictate to people what they're supposed to be teaching. I don't really think that's helpful. Yeah, I think even at the K-12 level, particularly for high school students, taking away some of the texts and books about Roberto Clemente and books about Rosa Parks, I think that is really troubling, taking books out of libraries. And even on the left, there were people who you have to have criticisms of because they wanted to take away books like Tequila Mockingbird. These are important texts to learn about literature and learn about American rights. It all is all in Agatha Christie are getting rewritten now by sensitivity readers. Yeah, I think that both sides need to understand that there are, if we want to have well-rounded students, well-rounded citizens and certainly in higher education to ban academic frameworks. Of course, everyone talks about critical race theory, not knowing what critical race theory really is and honestly, critical race theory is rarely even taught at the undergraduate level. It's generally graduate education where you start learning about critical race theory. But either way, banning academic concepts sets a dangerous precedent. We should have, and conservatives who are friends of mine and conservatives, particularly more libertarian conservatives, they were all freedom all the time. And I don't know what changed where all of a sudden now they want to take away academic concepts out of higher education. That doesn't make any sense to me. I think it's a situation where a conservative activist took a word, a term, critical race theory that already meant something very specific and broadly used that to define a whole host of things, some of which I don't think are great trends in education. Again, mostly on the DEI front, having administrative people, forcing people to go through trainings and struggle sessions, everything, not in an academic context, not in an educational context. But I think that's a dangerous thing to do as well, is to take something that means something specific and then make it a catch all. There are people, obviously, who are violent extremists in the MAGA movement. But I don't take Nazis and say white nationalists and all kinds of anti-government separatists and say, yeah, that's MAGA. We're just going to put it all under the MAGA. I mean, I very much appreciate that you don't. There are people, obviously, in the mainstream media, the Democratic coalition who do. And there are people on the right who do as well. There's a painting with a broad brush going on. Yeah, and I think that that's a mistake. And that's something that happens with this academic framework. It's not even necessarily a specific theory, but this academic framework and applying it to things that have nothing to do with it or applying it to books that have nothing to do with it. You ask people about critical race theory and they start bringing up the 1619 project, which has nothing to do with critical race theory. So I think we should not treat particularly adult students like children. This is one of the things, getting back to the whole COVID conversation. When we talk about COVID, a lot of conservatives always say, stop treating us like children. Fauci treated us like children. He wouldn't just tell us. And now, conservatives are doing that very thing with adult students by saying, no, we can't expose them to those academic concepts. So let me ask you this. So you're an educator. You teach at a college. What are things like now in the post-COVID landscape? Do you think your students were, in fact, really kind of ill-served by maybe they weren't necessarily, maybe they weren't, but the reality of trying to educate people during the pandemic? I think the quality of work hasn't dipped. I was expecting a huge drop-off with some of the new freshmen coming in because they lost a year of high school. And I haven't noticed that. I think for colleges, you can certainly make an argument that it was more necessary than for grade school. I'm a father of three. I have two kids who are in school, one that's too young. I really think that, and had we listened to the medical professionals, even the ones that the conservatives don't like, they were saying open schools. I understand the fear of the teachers union and I'm pro-union, even teachers unions. But I think we were ill-served by those school closures. The colleges are a little different. One of the things that we saw or that came out at my university is a third of our faculty is over 60. Now, that's another conversation we could have, but these are people that were vulnerable and they didn't want to be in the classroom because they were vulnerable, who knows what kind of health issues they had, and with the lack of knowledge that we had about COVID, I can understand closing higher education. But grade school education, those schools should have been open. And I can say, even I was probably wrong at that time, and I've seen my kids, and where I think they would be at academically, to where they are, I think they were hurt a little bit by that loss of a year. While we will have more rising right after this, please stay with us. News Nation has exclusively learned that Pennsylvania authorities are investigating Idaho murder suspect Brian Coburger for his potential connection to other unsolved killings. This revelation broke just last night, so here to fill us in is senior national correspondent at News Nation. Brian Enton, great to see you, Brian. Thanks for joining us. Thanks for having me. Please elaborate. What is this latest news that authorities are interested in Coburger, potentially having been involved in murders I would gather previous to what happened in Idaho? Yeah, previous to what happened in Idaho, we don't have a ton of detail, but we have confirmed that they are looking into Coburger for at least two murders that happened in Pennsylvania. We don't know if they've made significant headway in connecting him to those homicides, we just know that they were and are possibly still looking into a possible connection. And refresh our memories. He was in Pennsylvania at some point prior to coming to the campus in Idaho. He was a student there. Can you refresh us of the timeline? Yeah, so he grew up in Pennsylvania. He went to high school in Pennsylvania. He went to college and got his masters in Pennsylvania. So he lived most of his life in Pennsylvania. He had just moved out to Washington State, which right next to University of Idaho where the murders happened pretty recently. So most of his life was spent out in Pennsylvania. He got his masters at DeSales University. So he was there for quite a bit of time during his adult life. So Brian, I just wanted to ask a little bit about this individual. He's obviously an educated person. Is there anything in his profile that we know of that would lead people to believe that perhaps he would be a serial killer? Was there something strange about him in his upbringing that would lead people to potentially believe that he would be this guy? Well, you know, we've talked to a lot of people who knew him while he was growing up who say that he was quiet, that he was reserved, that he didn't have a lot of friends, that he never really had a girlfriend, and that he was kind of a loner. He was bullied at one point and overweight in terms of any evidence that would show that he's committed to serial killing before. We haven't come across any hard evidence. Of course, he's just accused at this point. But I mean, if he is responsible for these murders, and I know a lot of times it's not someone's first time. And he's been studying criminology for so long. You know, he got his master's in criminology. He was now getting his PhD in criminology. So he was very familiar with that field. I mean, that's just very disturbing because it raises the possibility, I guess, that he had gotten away with some other crime or murder for a very long period of time. Because obviously after what happened at Idaho, we were still kind of marveling at how long it took authorities to find and arrest a suspect. But still, that was a matter of a few weeks versus this. It could have been a much longer period of time at which he had eluded authorities. Yeah, it could have been. And I don't want to blow it out of proportion because it was not totally unusual for authorities to go back through cold cases and unsolved murders. If you have a situation like this and try to see, you know, is it possible that, you know, that someone we've now caught could be connected? So I think that's what's happening right now behind the scenes. And again, we don't know of any specific evidence at this point connecting him to certain murders. We just know that they are investigating and they are trying to see those connections exist. And a connection to, and I know it hasn't really been explained yet, but to multiple murders, not just one specific case, has that been explained yet? Yeah, it's our understanding at least to potential unsolved murders in Pennsylvania. Is there any reason that he would have made that trip or at least moved cross country from Pennsylvania to Washington? And is it possible that he was trying to elude authorities by making the move cross country? I don't think that's the reason. I mean, he moved out to Washington State to get his PhD in criminology, where he was currently enrolled and getting his PhD out there. He implied to the program out there and been accepted and he was starting the process. He was, you know, a TA. He was teaching classes out there. So, you know, I don't think he was necessarily trying to run away from anything. I think that's just where he got into school, you know, to get his PhD. Do we have any updates on how well he knew the victims in Idaho? I think last when I checked in on this, there was more evidence that he'd been, you know, contacting them on Instagram. Do we know more about, you know, whether he'd had interactions with them in person or, you know, more than just the one victim who he had, like, continuously kind of tried to contact on social media? What's the, what's the state of that understanding? Or, you know, why he picked them, that kind of thing? Yeah, it's a good question. We don't know a lot more. There's, there are the reports that he, that he messaged several of the victims and that they found those messages on his cell phone and that they went into sort of like the unread folder on the victim's cell phone. So, you know, like, if you get a message from someone you don't know, you're not friends with it, we'll go into this folder. You may not even see it. Beyond that, we don't know much more. The other new reporting that we just confirmed last night though, which is kind of interesting with Koch River is, is you may remember the, the University of Idaho was able to obtain the house where the murders happened. The homeowner gave the house up to the University of Idaho and that the University planned to tear it down and they were going to do that very, very soon just within the next couple of weeks. They are now not going to do that right away. There's been some concern from the families saying, hey, like, what if the jury wants to tour the house? We don't think it's a good idea to tear it down. So now the University is going out to the prosecution and the defense to see if they have any objections to the house being torn down. One side likely will. And then the University says they're going to go to the judge and let the judge make a ruling. So that's kind of interesting because we thought the house was going to be torn down very, very soon. And now that's not going to happen. That is very interesting. I also know that Co-Burger, you know, will be eligible for the death penalty, have the families given any indication how they feel about that kind of issue? So the Gonzalez family has alluded to the fact that they would be pro death penalty. The other families haven't commented on it at this point. It's tricky right now for the families because there's this gag order in place and it doesn't specifically say they can't talk, but it sort of does at the same time. It's kind of like a weird gray area. So they're not really commenting on a lot of those questions. But you know, in Idaho, they just, the governor just signed a new law that they'll now have a firing squad as an option for the death penalty in Idaho. You know, it's hard to get the drugs right now for lethal injection. And so they've had to put off some executions in the past. So now if the drugs aren't available, which oftentimes they aren't, they will actually have a firing squad in Idaho. So that could be a possibility for Co-Burger if it gets to that point. Which I know probably sounds grisly to a lot of people. There's, although I've heard arguments that a firing squad is a more immediate way to go out than the drug combination where people might be in a state of pain and they might actually survive it. And it's not nearly as humane as people have been led to believe. Brian, thank you so much for joining us. Yeah, I appreciate it. Thanks for having me on. And we'll have more rising right after this. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene had this to say to Fox News' Tucker Carlson about her visit to the Big Apple. Let's watch. Really quick since you were just there. But Mayor Adams described New York as quote, his home. How did his home look? Pretty neat and tidy? No, his home is disgusting. I compared it to what I called Gotham City. The streets are filthy. They're covered with people basically dying on drugs. They can't even stand up. They're falling over. There's so much crime in the city. I can't comprehend how people live there. It was repulsive. It smells bad. And I just, I think it's a terrible place. MSNBC host, Maddy Hassan, pointed out on Twitter on a serious note, no Democratic politician from the coast could ever go visit a Republican led city in the South and then go on a liberal media outlet and call it repulsive, smelling disgusting. It might be a way, it might be a double standard and a symmetry in our politics and our media. I mean, I think a Democrat could do that. They would just then go on to lose the president's election. The way Clinton did after she called half of Americans deplorables. I guess there's something, I'm not a huge fan of Maddy Hassan's commentary usually, but I guess there's probably something to what he's saying there. What do you think? Yeah, I think there's something to what he's saying. I mean, of course, we know that the rural bases is the Republican base and, you know, people in cities are Democrats. But I'll tell you, first of all, she said the streets have people on them. Well, that's New York City. That's the people dying. But yeah, I mean. Yeah, and by the way, New York City is the safest big city in America, by the way. That is true. New York City is actually doing a lot better than many of our other cities. It's the ninth safest city in the world, major city in the world. So all this idea, there's so much crime. You know, you can go to San Bernardino, California, run by Republicans. You can go to Jacksonville, Florida. You've got a way better chance of getting murdered, run by Republicans. We saw what was happening in Miami, run by Republicans. So this idea, you know, that this is- We saw the Alfie is very bad, Baltimore is very bad. Sure. Chicago is very bad. Sure. So this is an issue that we have in our cities, and it's not necessarily a partisan one, because some of the most violent cities, even if they are Democrat run, are in Republican states. And I think those people, I've interviewed some of those people before, and they argue that they're starved for resources from the Republican state government. So again, I think the issues calling New York, which many people around the world would love to live in New York City if they could afford to, saying that it's disgusting, it smells, you're making a comment about the people who live there. And those people are Americans. I think that's a sad thing when we talk about our own country and our own people that way. No, I get what you're saying. New York is not my favorite city. I like it here in D.C. I'm a big D.C. fan. Everybody talks down about this city because we're like not a real city because we don't have tall buildings, but it's nice here. I love D.C. I love New York too. You know? I hate how long it takes. Now it's just you sound like an old person complaining or something. When I go to New York City, I want to see people, I want to see friends I have. And it's so spread out. You end up commuting, if you're in Manhattan, and you have people who live in Brooklyn or Queens, it takes forever to get to get it. It's a big place. So I get that she shouldn't, obviously, MTG was making very hyperbolic claims about the state of the city. As you point out, it's not even strictly on a city-by-city basis. It's not doing as badly as some of our other cities. I do think some of the crime issue in particular, the state of homeless encampments, people having psychotic and drug episodes, even here in D.C. I see it. It's gotten worse over the years. It's gotten really bad in a lot of places in California. It seems to have gotten worse in a number of cities. And I think that's a source of frustration, honestly, not just for Republicans, but including for independents and for Democrats who live in the cities. But I think there's more empathy for people who are having trouble with drugs and housing in rural areas. I could take you an hour and a half away from here to places in West Virginia that I visited. And they have a lot of those issues. It's just rural. They have people walking around who are clearly on drugs, who are struggling. For some reason, we seem to have empathy for those people who are largely working-class, rural and white, than we do with the people of New York City. And I think we need to look at us as a whole, as Americans. And yes, New York City has problems. Yes, it has problems with drugs and fentanyl and all of the things that you would also find in some of those rural areas. For some reason, they don't get the same empathy from people like MTG. I guess that might be the case. I have empathy for both groups of those people. I also have empathy for in both situations their neighbors, commuters who have to walk passes. And it's not just a matter of unsightliness or something, but these can be dangerous and unsafe situations, including for the people who are struggling with the drug addiction and the psychotic behavior. They're sleeping in not great conditions. They're coming to conflict with each other when they're in states of drug addiction and mental illness, these closely correlating things. There are stabbings. There are beatings. There's that kind of thing going on. And I feel for them, I read, I don't want these people languishing in this condition. And we haven't really come up with a, I don't know, we're allowing it to happen to a great degree. And I'm troubled by it. I don't know what exactly what should be done. But something should be done. Yeah, no, I'm in agreement. You know, there are estimates that say that with $20 billion, we could end homelessness in this country. We're able to send $20 billion in a lot of different places. But I don't know if we could just, if it was just a matter of housing, but, well, this is an argument that I know exists, that people argue about this and how do we help this, we've had some of these debates on the show. Some people will say, yes, we need to make more housing available. Others will say, but unless the drug addiction and mental illness issue is confronted, people are not going to stay in the housing or they ruin the housing and then back on the street. They need to be in approximate location to their drug dealers, so they're not going to stay in the housing. So until there's, it's hard to force people to take drugs that help break their addiction and deal with there. If they're unwilling to do it, it takes confrontation with law enforcement or with, or even if it's mental health people, confrontation can be dicey, people don't want to do it. It just seems like a difficult problem to solve. And mentally old people also have rights. You can't grab them and take them somewhere, even if you think it's for their own good. That is the way we've gone with things, yes. I think there's a difference between homelessness and houselessness as well. There are people who, like literally are on the street and then you have people who are sleeping on somebody's couch. They don't have a home. I think that there are ways we can certainly help some of those people who are on people's couches or maybe in shelters. People who say that we don't have enough housing, I'd like to drive them through Baltimore where there's abandoned housing everywhere that could maybe be rehabbed and we could actually put human beings in those houses instead of them just sitting there as an eyesore. That's going to take money. Like I said, I think the government finds money when they need it, or when they think they need it. But with these kinds of problems, all of a sudden everybody's broke. How about that? Well that does it for us for today. Jason, it was so nice to have you in the hosting chair. Thank you so much for being here. Absolutely. Thank you. I loved it. I love it.
