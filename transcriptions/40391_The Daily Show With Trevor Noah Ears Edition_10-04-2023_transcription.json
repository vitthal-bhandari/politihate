It's Roy Wood Jr., correspondent for The Daily Show. You're about to hear an episode of one of our original Daily Show podcasts Beyond the Scenes. It's the show where we dive deeper into segments and topics that originally aired on The Daily Show and we chat with the show's writers, producers and experts. This week, we're talking about the history of drag and why conservatives are outraged by kids' exposure to drag shows. This episode features Bob the Drag Queen, Professor of Journalism, Channing Joseph, and author Frank D'Caro, which had about black and queer trailblazers, the legacy of drag activism, and Bob even gave me a drag queen name. Yes, me, Roy. I got a drag queen name now. Whenever I start my career in drag, we hope you enjoy it. And if you like the show, check out the Beyond the Scenes podcast, wherever you get your podcasts. Hey, welcome to Beyond the Scenes. The podcast that goes deeper into segments and topics that originally aired on The Daily Show. This is what you got to think of as podcast. If The Daily Show was tomato soup, then this podcast is all the toppings you add to make the soup even more warm and delicious with the croutons and the crackers and the grilled cheese you eat with the tomato soup. See, now you're all cozy and you got the perfect ratio of liquid and carbs. That's what this podcast is. I'm Roy Woodjinger. Today, we're crackers? I want to get a crackers. Bob the Drag Queen. We're wheat crackers. Can we be whole grain? Let me be one of them. Right. What's the dark brand? Let me be a let me be a pumpernickel cracker. I'm going to be a pumpernickel. That is the voice of, I guess, Bob the Drag Queen. And I'm Roy Woodjinger. And today, we're talking about a segment on the show, but correspondent Dulce Sloan, where she talked about the history of drag and the rise in protests and threats directed at drag events and the number of bills introduced by Republican lawmakers seeking to prevent children from attending drag shows. Let's get a quick clip. Hello, friends. If you know me, you know that I love me some drag. It's like sports, but for people who don't want to deal with any balls, if you know what I mean, but recently conservatives have been acting like drag at some brand new thing that liberals dreamed up to turn your kids into glitter demons. Now, while 18th century England gave us drag queens, 19th century America gave us drag balls. It's the only time queens colonized the country and made it better. One of the most famous drag performers at that time was a former enslaved African named William Dorsey, the queen swan. Dorsey slayed so hard he went on to become a pioneer of modern ballroom culture. America's drag balls brought the culture to the next level in Harlem. They became so popular that men and women would come from all over to present their looks to a panel of judges, patent style. And you know, there's something comforting and knowing that even hundreds of years ago, people were telling someone to their face that they were a messy bitch whose outfit is trash. The circle of life. Later on in the show, I'll be joined by some additional guests who are going to help me dive into the history of drag. But first, my fellow puppet nickel is on the microphone with me today. RuPaul is. A season eight winner hosted the podcast sibling rivalry and star of HBO's. We're here, which just launched his third season Bob, the drag queen. Welcome to beyond the scenes. How do you do? I'm well. Thank you so much for asking. Thank you for having me and I'm really proud to now. You know, yeah, we have our third season of we're here our Emmy award winning television show. We're here. I'm very, very proud of it. What I appreciate about that television program is that you don't just tell the story of this world strictly from liberal. Unclaves as they like to say I flip past one day and y'all was in Jackson, Mississippi. I got. Oh my God. We. Jackson pulling up in the south south. That's the south side as cheese grit south. Oh, yeah. In place where they call what they call a Mississippi. We was in Mississippi, honey, and Mississippi. That's like a drag queen. Don't know what was a Mississippi. Sip it. If you could as a layman as you can for our listeners who don't know, explain exactly what drag is. This is how I define drag drag is a blurring the gender line while creating art. Not all drag queens do numbers. Not all drag queens dance. Not all drag queens scenes. Some drag queens do comedy. I know a drag queen named Linda Simpson who takes photographs. You know what I mean? Like if you are people who their people do drag and their whole thing is just going to the club and just being pretty and sitting there. And hanging out and partying. There are people who go up there and they do. I'm a I'm a stand up comedian. So, you know, when I do it, me, Bianca Del Rio, we do stand up comedy when we do a flame on row when we do our drag and some drag artists. You know, are are women and some are men and some are non-binary, some are cis women, some are trans women, some are sismans, some are trans men, some are gay men. There are some straight men out there doing drag. I don't know if everyone actually they don't know that they never heard of a straight drag queen while watching all of the teleparry movies. I'm like, OK, sure. Sure. You never heard of a straight drag queen. OK, got it. Let's let's go back to the beginning for you just in terms of your introduction into the world of drag. Like what were some of your experiences like early on like early in the take me back Bob drag queen 1.0 with you and drag queen. You use his Bob potential drag queen to be. So what was it like on when I was. Young, my mom used to actually own a drag bar. My mom owned a drag bar in Columbus, Georgia called sensations. If you are a Gen X or a boomer who is gay in the Columbus, Georgia area in the 90s, you probably went to sensations and you probably went to my mom's drag club and that's why I first heard of and you know, encountered the species known as drag queens. When you first started drifting into the world of drag yourself, did you have representation that you have role models? Were there other examples? Were you navigating this world on your own in a complete fog? So when I started drag, it was 2008 2009 and I was in New York City. I was 22, 23 years old and you know, I was really kind of just basing it off of what I see because a repost drag race. It just started on TV and I knew drag from RuPaul and so on food and personally, we did the desert and and you know, movies like that. Ruby Ruby Hart. Is it was the Ving Raymond movie? Oh, Holiday Hart. Holiday Hart Holiday Hart. But then by this time it was something called repost drag race. It was less characters of drag and more like actual drag queen. And I thought it was just so interesting. I was like so impressed. So then I went out and I got myself some makeup and I went to the local club in my called lavish lounge used to be in Queens also doesn't exist. As we keep talking, most of the clubs I'm going to mention, especially after the pandemic, a lot of them just don't exist anymore. They they're only in the minds of of people who were in these spaces. But it was lavish lounge in a story of Queens. And I remember going and seeing these queens and meeting. I remember the queen I met for the first time ever. Her name was Blackie. Oh, was her name. Shout out to Blackie. Oh, I think it's still working in these streets like Jackie. Oh, NASA's. Yeah, I was her name was her name was Blackie. Oh, nasty was her name actually. And I started going out. So it was a little bit of like what I saw on the Internet. You know, there was no Instagram. Instagram hadn't even been there hadn't even been an Instagram yet. There was no Instagram. There was no there was those Facebook and the clubs and I would go to and what I saw in the applause drag race. So I was there was there was definitely some representation, but it was it was not as easy to find it today. Like it's so easy to find drag queens today. You can't throw a rock without hitting hitting a wig, you know, you come from the south. You come from Columbus, Georgia. Mm hmm. All the way up to New York. How much of a culture shift was that? Was it welcome? Cause it's like growing up in the south. Like how did the south shape your views on gender roles and like this drag help blur gender lines and challenge strict gender norms? Like, like, talk to me a little bit about the empowerment of it versus where you were what it was thought of where you were versus where you went as a 22 year old. It was way more open. So when I was a kid and I grew up in the south, so I did get a lot of, gender roles and gender norms, I tell me what it means to be a man. A lot of my raising is that instead of focusing on what it meant to be an adult, I was often told what it meant to be a man. Like as if there was this really specific, unique set of rules that men had to follow that women didn't have to follow and vice versa. Women have to do this and men can't do that. And I've, I kept bucking against it. I never wanted to go by those rules. I want it. I always wanted to like go against that and do something slightly different and challenge them. And that wasn't just like, I just didn't feel comfortable with the idea that I had to do certain things just because of what was between my legs and what I was born with. So now it's like, so now I literally have to do this, you know what I mean? And as a black man, I already have that societal expectation on me. You know, as a black person, you have to act a certain way. You can't do certain things. I was also given a lot of respectability politics as a young black person. You know, a lot of us were taught like you can't act certain ways in front of white people. That was like ingrained in me. So when I got to New York City, I was able to release all of that and just do what felt comfortable to me. I guess the cool thing about it is when you're in New York, you amongst your peers and you have this degree. You have a support network. If nothing else, talk just a little bit about that part of it. Like because it is not, it's not necessarily always the safest occupation. If we just going to be 100 about it. Talk to me a little bit about first learning that part of the game and you know, who were the people? Or just how was the ecosystem in New York at the time that you were coming up to start developing those types of, you know, protections? So when I started going out to the clubs, I met just some of the like, I mean, talk about like walking into a bar or a club or a place in general and meeting people. You're like, wow, these are really my people. Like I actually found my people. You know, I started doing drag with peppermint frosty. All these names are going to sound so funny to you all. But to me, they're like old friends peppermint, flossy for flossy frosty flakes, honey, LeBronks, Ray Scandalo de la Verga, Blackie O'Nasty, Chandelier, Shaquita. These are all the people that I, you know, Pixie, I've been thought of names are legendary. This is keep going. These are all the people that I was doing drag with and we even had like networks to help each other get to our gigs on time and safely, you know, there would be times where, you know, taking a car in New York City is very expensive. This is even before Uber's first of all, getting an Uber, getting a car as a drag queen. Sometimes it's impossible as a black drag queen. Forget about it. They're never going to stop for you. So you have to take the train down. So if I live in the Heights, I'll stop by Harlem on the way to pick up my friend, Keesha Carr. Because Keesha Carr doesn't want to ride the train by herself either. So I stop off at Keesha Carr's stop. I grab Keesha and we go down and then we stop at, you know, maybe frosty stop to grab her so we can get to the bar and Chelsea safely. So we're all like in a group together and not traveling alone. And you have to factor that into your travel time on a regular basis. Because of those goals. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, for sure. I mean, Uber really changed the game because we were able to just call cars. And if you had a good night, we made money. If you didn't have a lot of, if you didn't make any money that night, you can't afford the Uber and you have to take the train home anyway. But yeah, traveling in large groups is very, was a great way to keep safe. Going back to this idea that just to live your life, you all had to literally schedule what times you congregated on the train so you could travel in numbers. Talk a little bit about drag's history and activism and speaking out on a lot of the bullshit that's out there in the industry. Have you been able to use drag as a vehicle for political activism as well? Early in my drag, I was doing a lot of political activism. I started a group called drag queen weddings for equality with my friends. We would go to Times Square and we would do these, these weddings, these wedding demonstrations where two drag queens would get married by a drag queen pastor. And we would hand out wedding invites and the wedding invites would have all this information on the back about injustices to the queer community. And then we would do these, these demonstrations where we were shut out more things and give people calls to action and how they can, you know, who they can call, who they can talk to, how they can make a change. There was also some, some early arrest in my, in my drag career, getting a, getting arrested in full drag for my activism. I was one of those, one of those activists, you know, and, and, and that certainly did not start with me. I mean, even, even back to the Compton cafeteria riots, you know, drag queens, drag artists, gender benders have been buttoned against the system to create change for people, not just for gay men, but for, and not just for queer people, but for black people for reproductive rights, immigration rights, even environmental rhyme, I know Queens where her, you know, saving the wells, you know, like drag queens, if there is a, if there is a somewhere to put our nose in some bit, we will put our contoured nose in your business, honey. After the break, I want to talk a little bit more about how the added television exposure about the world of drag, what the pros and cons are from shows like RuPaul's Drag Race and your show we're here.

Bob, I want to ask you about the television shows that have stepped into the mainstream now. You know, you have a show like RuPaul's Drag Race, which I'll say this, and this is, and I speak as an alum of last comic standing, third place, 2010, checked it with PD. I feel like adding a competition element to anything makes people more likely to watch it. It makes people more open to immersing themselves in worlds that they don't necessarily care about simply because you're seeing people who are trying to be the best at it. So, like, I feel like RuPaul's Drag Race nailed that coming off the heels of top model, essentially, which I feel like was kind of a precursor. I'm not going to say that the two are necessarily connected, but there is some variation. RuPaul has acknowledged that Drag Race is inspired in part by a top model. And I think you're absolutely right. I mean, like, even if you're like Nailed it, you would never watch someone poorly because cake. But when you put, when they're competing and you have someone hilarious, like Nicole Byer doing, it's like, yeah, I'm going to watch people fuck up cakes. I would love to see that. Also, I want to quickly say to you, you reminded me, beyond the scenes is a great drag name. Oh, Miss Beyond the Scenes. Oh, I love her, honey. Give it up on this Beyond the Scenes, honey. Beyond the scenes. And then lift up the back skirt of some shit to see beyond the scenes. But no, a show like RuPaul's Drag Race. So, even we're here. Like, I feel like they've all helped push Drag into the mainstream. And you showcase a different lens of queer. Like, we're here as different from Drag Race in that it's about the nuance, it's about the emotion. I mean, these are reality shows. And we haven't even gotten into scripted stuff like polls or like, like, but it's like, what do you think that those shows help do? To change the perception of queerness in America. So, you know, the Drag Race fan base, you think it's just a bunch of gay people watching Drag Race. But it's actually not all gay people. A lot of straight people watch Drag Race. And then what ends up happening is you have a lot of allies watching Drag Race. And Drag Race has been on the air for at six to 15 seasons, 16 seasons now. So what happens is these kids who are watching Drag Race and they're young are now allies, adults who have children. You know what I mean? They're now full on adults who have children who will also be allies. It's not like when I told one of my friends, one of my friends, just like a white, uh, concert creator was like, who couldn't understand in 2020 why was so important to say Black Lives Matter as a white person? Like, why is it so important? Like, why can't I just do my thing and not say this? I was like, you don't have to say it. You don't have to say it, but I will say this. If you do say it, once you say Black Lives Matter, because you matter to so many little white girls, because you matter to them, then they hear you say Black Lives Matter and now Black Lives Matter to them. Now we have a Black Lives Matter supporter in the house of a Karen or a cop who might end up hurting a black person or doing something like that. So you're basically just spreading the word, you know what I mean? And I think that, um, and I think that's the, the situation that we're in right, we're in right now. That's how Drag Race has changed the, the world of understanding queer people, in my opinion. This also shows like Pose, for the straight guy, who follows Drag Race, legendary, um, transformation. There's so many shows like this that put queer people in front of people who are potential allies and let them see that we're not out in these streets doing something weird and nefarious stuff that they think we're trying to do. We're just living our lives. But then people touch it because then you turn into one of them and the Bible said that you don't go. You know, I would tell folks I was straight and then I took the vaccine and now look at me. And then I, then I got a booster and now I'm not binary. So watch out for that Pfizer. It'll get you good. I don't like the intersection of anti-vax and homophobia. I'm not even sure if I'm supposed to laugh. Am I allowed to laugh? I will laugh. You sure? I'm going to laugh later. You can get me a camera. So that's the positive benefits of the show. Let's flip it to the negative side because, you know, a lot of groups, a lot of organizations try to use these shows to springboard and justify their hatred and, like, as they exposure from these shows also opened it up more to hatred and discrimination for viewers. Oh, like, I know, like, just talk to me about where you're here. Like, what's that like just being out on set shooting? Because if I'm a Daily Show correspondent at something where, like, I was at a pro gun rally and they was not fucking with your boy. I can imagine. I can imagine. So what's that like when you're out in places like Jackson, Mississippi? Yeah. In full drag with cameras. Like, what type of pushback have you faced with this show? I think the real people don't appreciate. Appreciate is, um, the reason why Jordan Klepper can go into these spaces is because they don't know that he is not one of them until he exposes himself. But when you, but, you know, but when Roy walks into these boys, when Roy would you, they were like, we're not, we know, we know you ain't one of us. You need to win a camera? You have a camera and you black? No, absolutely not. But they'll go up to Jordan Klepper because he's white and he's tall and, and, and, and, and, and you women love a tall white man. They'll go up there. They'll go up there and tell them their whole life story. Do they realize that he's, and that's why you stand before it. Yeah. And I'm happy. Go do that shit, Klepper. We happily, every time they have a meet, we think Klepper should go do that one. Whenever I'm on the streets, like I just had an instance in Jackson, Mississippi that is on the, the second episode of season three of we're here where I'm, I'm just, I'm just walking down the street. Like I'm, I'm not even in drag. I'm just walking on the street looking, and then all of a sudden they're like, oh, there, well, there's one of them. They're queers. So they started yelling at me from across the street just for walking around like they're throwing completely basis accusations at me. And they go, what, like, this sounds like a long, it sounds like a, because it doesn't sound like these are just one or two syllable slurs. You're saying it was spitting whole phrases at you? Well, no, they were saying stuff like they, they didn't call me a faggot per se, but what they did do, they, they called me a, they called me a pedophile. They called me a pervert. They called me a creep. All, and by the way, all I was doing was just standing on the street corner. I mean, I was holding a purse. Something I was gay, but I was just standing on the street corner holding a purse. And from that, from that app, from seeing that they, they ascertained, they came to the conclusion. I was a pedophile, a pervert. I was up to no good. I wanted their kids. And I was like, I'm literally just on the show. I was actually at the time I was, we had just finished filming and they haven't put the cameras down yet because they all was just laying around a little bit. I was like, oh, I'm going to get some ice cream. We're on the street. I want to get an ice cream. I was literally just looking for ice cream. And then I got like, you know, verbally assaulted by these guys. So go up to them. I was like, I'm going to talk to them. I'm going to actually give these guys a little. I'm going to talk and see what's going on. And of course they didn't want to, they didn't really want to talk. They just wanted to sling their bitch roll at me and call me names. But, but I was interested. There was maybe like two or three of them, but the interesting about them is they actually weren't. It's not like they were being supported, even in Jackson, even the folks in Jackson were like, can you. What is wrong with y'all? Like we're not there. Like everybody in Jackson ain't doing this. This is them. We're good country folk. Why you like this? Has it gotten beyond that? Has it been any like type of death threats or threats of violence on any of the shoots? We have had, we've had, we've had threats of violence for sure on our show. And luckily we do have security detail everywhere we go. You'll find out in episode one, we were going to have a reading of this book. Chantula, my dragster is going to read some books of these kids and then they decided they didn't want that to happen. So they called and threatened to shoot, they didn't threaten to shoot the place up. But they said, if you allow this to happen, we will show up and we carry and we'll cause a scene. So it was like kind of like veiled like that. They were like, we're not saying we're, we're not saying we're going to kill you, but we're saying that we have guns. We carry and we'll be there. So basically they threatened to do what actually happened for real in Columbus, Ohio. When there was a drag show and a bunch of right winger showed up open carrying to intimidate people from ever coming to the show. And the show ultimately was canceled. Yeah. And it happened again recently, a couple of days ago, some people showed up to a drag event with guns and weapons, which is so, I never thought, like my adulthood is mostly New York City. So being around people who are like, because New Yorkers, like I've walked the streets in full drag for practically every hour of the day. I've done something at brunch. I've done something. I've gone home at three, six a.m. I've done the whole gamut and New Yorkers don't give a fuck. They don't care about you. They're not looking at you. They're not trying to find out which they just want to go to their place and get back. So these people are going out of their way. They're driving miles and miles and miles to do what I guess they think is right. So then to that point, let's talk about how politicians have been able to levy that vitriol and try and turn it into votes and legislation and all of this nonsense. Like we've seen a wave of anti-trans bills across the country. And now Republican lawmakers in several states are trying to propose legislation to ban minors from even showing up to the drag shows. Like all that reading to the kids, that would be you would literally go to jail for that. What do you think is the motivation behind those types of bills? And like, why now? Why now all of a sudden does there seem to be an uptick in this type of legislation from the right? Trying to get children banned from drag shows is it is just a sneaky ploy, in my opinion, from right wing conservatives to make it seem like all drag queens want kids at their shows. Most of us don't want your fucking kids at your show. Does your kid have a dollar? Does your kid have money to tip? We don't want your fucking kid at our fucking show. There are some people who want to read to kids, but most drag queens are not making it. I don't make any content for children. It's like stand up comedy. Most stand up comedians don't want kids at their shows. Now there are some comedians who make comedy that will be suitable for children. Yes, there are some comedians who make, and it is a very, it is a tiny group of comedians. Brian Regan. Yeah, there's like three niggas out there making, making how many for kids? You know what I mean? But the truth is most comedians don't want to look down and see if I can kid it at their show. And most directly the same way, but when you are, then we're in interviews. Now even even though I don't want kids at my show, I now have to defend why kids should be allowed at drag shows, even though I don't want, even though I don't want kids in my fucking show. This is crazy. This is, it is a sneaky little tactic that they use to, so now I'm defending something that I don't even want, but I think there are some drag artists who are completely appropriate for children. I'm not one of them. That's why I don't have kids at my shows. Okay, so then if the kid anglers the smokescreen, what do you think is the real reasons for the legislation? Transphobia, transphobia and misogyny and trans misogyny. It is all just thinly veiled homophobia, transphobia and attempts to push trans people into non-existence. First, they don't want trans people in the bathrooms. So now, now, you can't use bathroom unless you're at home. You have to wait till you go home to use the bathroom, which is bullshit. We've all had to rush to use the bathroom somewhere, run into somewhere, use the bathroom real quick. And then they say, well, you can't mention any of it at school. If you're trans at school, you better be hiding. So now, if you're a teacher, if you're a student, if you're a principal, if you're a janitor, you cannot mention that you're trans or even that you know trans people because of the thing like they don't say gay bill. And now they don't want you to be able to be, to work anywhere. They're trying to just push you back into hiding in a closet because they don't want to see you in public at all. And it starts with the bathroom. They push you out of the classroom. They push you out of this. They push you out of that. They push you out of that. And by the time they push you out of all these places and spaces, you are just existing in your home so they don't have to see you. The right also, now, this whole idea about the grooming part of it. A lot of these bills are around. Like, originally it was the bathroom. They're going to try and get you in the bathroom. Oh, that didn't work. Okay. Were they trying to turn your kids into one of them? Let me turn it down. The most dangerous thing that could happen at a drag show is a conservative might show up with a gun and kill someone. It's not the drag queens. It's not the people coming to see the drag queen. The dangerous, most dangerous thing at a gay bar is that a conservative might show up with a gun and fucking kill you. It's needless to say, this type of rhetoric from the politicians, from the right wing, incites a degree of violence against this community. Like even just this year, I think I got the stats, right? Over 120 protests and significant threats and 47 states so far this year, just against LGBTQ and drag events this year. What is the response to that from the drag community? Is it just security? Like, what can you do to continue to foster a safe environment where people can be themselves? Well, I think that, you know, when things happen, like what happened in this recent shooting in the gay club recently and in the Walmart Colorado Springs, the Colorado Springs and in that Walmart, they call them these shootings, but they don't call them terrorists. They never get, they never get labeled as terrorists. It is terror. It's domestic terror is an attempt to scare you out of, out of leaving your home. Again, remember, the whole goal is to get you to stay away so they never have to see you. You can't even go hang out in spots places that are just for you. Now, they want you to just hang out just in your home. I'm just so glad that he's not gay when I heard he was in a gay club. I was just mad that he, I thought he was going to be gay. He's like, you're not aware that your son killed five people allegedly. You're mad that he might have been gay in the process. Like, baby, get your, get your priorities together. And, you know, drag artists are not going anywhere. So I hate to break the news to you, Mary, but drag has been around for a very long time before anyone who's alive now has been breathing. Drag has been around for a very, very, very long time. Gender bending has been around for a very long time. Trans people have been around for a very, very long time. And, and, and, and we're not going anywhere anytime soon. You have given us more than enough of your time. The show is we are here. You can see that on HBO HBO Max Bob the drag queen. Thank you for going beyond the scenes with us. My pleasure. And please check out Roy and his new drag career and his new drag name beyond the scenes.

Welcome back to Beyond the Scenes. Now, I just chatted with Bob the Drag Queen about his personal journey and the importance of representation on screen and all of the attacks that conservatives have on drag and that entire culture. But now, let's talk about the long history of drag. I'm joined now by two guests who are going to help break this down for us. First, I'm joined by journalist and professor of journalism at Princeton University, Channing Joseph. Channing, welcome to the show. Great to be here, Roy. Thanks for having me. Might I add, Channing, your headphones are stunning. Thank you. I'm also joined by the author of drag, combing through the big wigs of show business. Frank DeCaro, Frank, how you doing? Thank you for joining us as well. Thank you for having me. It's such a pleasure to be here. Now, this question is for both of you, but Frank, I'll throw it to you first. Give us an overview of the origins of drag and just where the term drag comes from. Let's just start with the basics. Well, a lot of times they say that the word drag comes from a woman's clothes dragging on the ground. I don't know if I believe that and hopefully Channing has a better perspective on that. But I will say that as long as a guy has been on the stage and as long as being on a stage or being in public has been popular entertainment and drawn a crowd, somebody has been cross-dressing. I want to use the oldest possible term you can think of for that. Shakespearean tradition has men playing female roles. Kabuki tradition has that. The English pantomimes, which still exist today, every holiday season, has the pantomime day minute. There's always was someone dressing either a man dressing as a woman or a woman dressing as a man when we were thinking in the most binary of terms. But that's always been a part of entertainment. And the drag queen, let's say that the sort of multimedia drag queen has existed at least since the early 20th century. And perhaps even before there's evidence now that the first drag queen may have been a freed and slave person. And that's a whole other thing that we're all looking at now and wondering more about. But there was a guy in the early teens, about 1912, who got his own Broadway theater named after him. And he was one of the highest paid entertainers in show business named Julian Elton. And everyone kind of looks at Julian Elton, just sort of the grandmother of the mall because she was kind of the rude Paul of 1912. She had a magazine to give women tips on how to look beautiful. She was in movies playing, you know, a spy who goes behind enemy lines dressed as a woman. She was on Broadway doing the singing her own songs in drag and was hugely popular. And so the anyone that says drag is sort of a new phenomenon is really speaking it on truth. There's a popular meme going around now that says, you know, that you've always been entertained by drag. And then they show, of course, Tootsie and Busn buddies and some like an hot movie that we've ever seen in the 20th century with drag in it. And so like you can't say, Oh my God, these drag queens are so dangerous when you've been laughing at them for 100 years plus. Channing, feeling some of the gaps there, like in that old school sense because, you know, I know there was also a time where women weren't allowed to. Could you believe that women wasn't allowed at a time to do a thing? And men had to take on the roles of women in theater because we just, we don't know where to find women actors. I guess I'll put on some lipstick. Absolutely. So one of the things that most people don't realize is that the way we use the term drag today is very loose. And so we're thinking, as Frank pointed out in binary terms, a man dressing as a woman, woman dressing as a man. And it's sort of applied indiscriminately whether we're talking about, as Frank pointed out, Shakespearean theater or Kabuki. We're talking, we're calling it drag. When those are actually separate traditions. And it's important, I think, to specify the specific differences between those cultural traditions. There's actually an American tradition of drag, which does go back to the culture of African Americans, formerly enslaved African Americans in Washington, D.C. In the 1880s. And from that point to today, we can, we can trace the, the origin of the ballroom culture and voguing. And all the way to repulse drag race. It's sort of has maintained the same basic format in terms of basically a competition where, where black people meet and celebrate, celebrate each other and compete for the prize. But back then, the first drag queen was named William Dorsey Swan. And in the culture of D.C. after the Civil War, there was this, there was this tradition of celebrating freedom. Of course, you're now free, you're no longer enslaved. Celebrate your life. Turn up. Yeah, yeah. And I turned up. Absolutely. And in that, in that period of time, one of the big ways it celebrated was to, was to have a parade called Emancipation Day. The Emancipation Day in D.C. There were these beautiful women who would, who would essentially wear these usually flower covered dresses or, or crowns and they'd be part of the parade. They'd represent the embodiment, the personification of liberty for black people. And they were called queens. The first drag queen, William Dorsey Swan, actually dubs himself the first drag queen because the balls were already being called drag, drag balls or drag parties or drag dances, or just drags. But he decided to say, I am the queen of this ball. So actually adopting the term queen is a way of, of connecting. The sort of celebration of queerness with emancipation from enslavement. It's actually, there's always been this connection. This is in the United States context between African American emancipation and drag, which is not something that people talk about. So that's something that, that I like to point out because as we know, so this is a, there's, there's lots of discussion about drag queens misappropriating or, or, um, uh, arrogating to themselves, you know, various, uh, aspects of black culture or black women's expression. And actually, that's been, that's been, that's been dating back over a hundred years. You've cracked a can on something that I want to, that I want to go back to for a second because I want to talk about some of the common misconceptions and stereotypes about drag that you wish layman like myself were a little more informed on. And Frank, I want to get your answer in this as well. But first, let's go back to the distinction between cross dressing and drag. I'm from Alabama and I worked on a side of town that was the more free willing side of Birmingham called five points out. And that was my first introduction as a teenager and to every other culture from skate culture to gay culture to tattoos and nose. So everybody was just called a cross dresser. This is Birmingham in the eighties. There was not the level of specificity and understanding that we have now. So let's just start with cross dressing and drag and what the differences are there. And then what are some of the other misconceptions you think people get wrong about the culture. I think cross dressing. It has been a pejorative term. But it is a descriptive term and it describes the sort of conception of a man picking on a woman's appearance. And it actually applies to different kinds of cross dressing. It applies to African traditions and Kabuki and Shakespearean theater. All those really could be described as cross dressing. Whereas drag is more, at least now it's more of a celebration of gender and gender. Gender expression and I think breaking out of gender roles. Right. I think if you look at, for example, Shakespearean theater, for whatever reason they didn't hide women for girls, it wasn't about it wasn't a decision based on self expression or desire to explore, explore your gender, explore ways of how you want to see yourself, right? Or how you see yourself. It was more sort of, there were other reasons why men were dressing as wearing dresses and so on. Whereas drag is more of a celebration. Okay. So like Martin Lawrence dressing up as should nay nay was not Martin. And then a fine with his own gender and expression. It was just now I'm gonna put on a wig and some lipstick and crack some jokes. At least not as far as we know. Well, before that, there was someone like Flip Wilson. And while it was done, you know, in prime time, Flip Wilson for people who don't know, he was the first African American comedian performer to have his own variety of people. And then he showed that was a hit. I mean, there were others who had, who had done specials and who had done short things, but Flip was on for like four years. And his drag character of that era. Yeah. Yeah. He was friendly in a storyteller, but he was, he would do this character named Geraldine Jones, who had a boyfriend named killer. But that never stopped her from flirting with every man from and I'm not kidding. Bill Cosby to O.J. Simpson to Bing Crosby. Okay. He was hugely popular. But what he did that was so different from Shanae nay was he played a character who believed she was beautiful and kind of was sexy and was sort of a feminist character. And people flipped out over that in terms of they liked it, but also because it really was different. She wore poochie print dresses. She had great gams. She was kind of the person who influenced RuPaul in many ways and Ru admits that. Ru's my age. And so, you know, I mean, it was, you know, she was watching the same TV I was watching. And Flip kind of was the introduction to drag for a lot of people. What's different and what's important about him and it goes to the misconceptions about drag is he was not making fun of women at all. And I think that some people want to say that O drag is misogynist. And some of it when it's played like, look how ugly I am and every comedian is guilty of doing that at some point. But he, a lot of drag comes out of an appreciation for female tropes and for female characteristics. But then it exaggerates them to Jessica Rabbit proportions. You know, I mean, it's nobody really, no woman really looks like the Alcadilly Rio unless she's in drag. And she's like, oh, you know, I mean, it's like, and now, Channing is you know, you can be a cisgender woman. You can be a cisgender. You can be any, you can come out of the womb, whatever. But if you've got too much fabulous, you can be a drag queen now and it doesn't matter what your plumbing looks like. And thanks. As long as when that light goes on, you're funny and glamorous. It doesn't matter what your junk looks like. And that's kind of an exciting thing. I think that's fabulous. And I agree with Frank that, you know, performance, performers like Flip Bull said were really important. And I think, you know, looking at looking at that aspect of drag, like the performance of aspect. It hasn't always been performance for like a public audience. That's one point, which I'll get to. But the, the, the important point, I think, is performers, performers, like Geraldine Jones, they were important because I think they were part of, you know, at least for a couple of decades of beginning of the 20th century when drag balls sort of became more open to the public. They were a way of showing, I think, straight cisgender people how fabulous you could be. You know, how fabulous a man could be wearing heels and wearing a wig and so on. That it wasn't purely about comedy. It was also about showing confidence and showing sort of just bending a little bit the expectations of gender roles. And I think, you know, they're completely bent, which I think is a positive thing. But, but, but I think, you know, when, when, if you look back, for example, the 19th century balls of balls from the 1880s, those were secret events. Those were people getting together in each other's houses, putting on a show for each other. It was a community thing. It only really became sort of a thing that the general public was allowed into in the, in the 20s or so. And at that point, people were really, you know, people were interested to see that there were thousands of people would gather to see drag balls because there was such hunger for it. And I guess, you know, it's still the same way. People are hungry to see how gender can be reinterpreted and expressed in different ways that they have been taught were wrong or immoral and so on. I certainly was taught that. And I think that's what gets to why people love drag is through the artifice you get to this tremendous truth about humanity. And you all, but it's also incredibly entertaining. It's not like a lesson in gender studies. It's, it's, it's sort of already is, but it's sort of talk about the spoonful of sugar that makes the medicine go down. And it's really entertaining. And you're like, Oh, wait a minute. We're not all, you know, there is, it's showing you that the spectrum of gender in a way and, and you're, you know, but in a safe way. And not only was were drag balls a safe space, but you had people like Milton Burl, who was the thought, you know, he's Mr. Television. When they turned the TV's on, he was the guy that got people by TV and he did drag almost every week. And he said, Oh, yeah, you want as a kid, I'd sneak into the drag balls. And it's so you're sort of like, wait a minute. So you're 12 or 15 and you're, you know, you're sneaking into drag balls, you know, and typically stealing, you know, stealing, you know, as, as so much entertainment is that sort of like, Oh, good. I'll get the gig because I'm the white guy, but, but I'll go learn everything, you know, from the black performers as so many people do and did. So when you talk about researching for your book and Shannon, you low key being very humble because I know a lot of that swan research that we even know now in the zeitgeist is because you went to dig and all of it and all of it. And truth about that person. All of it was that about 10, 15 years ago, you went digging. So both of you are very versed in the history of drag, but in your research of the history of this culture, how does the black and LGBTQ plus community fit into that history? I know we talked a little bit about DC, but give me some other ways where they fit into that culture. And or if there's been erasure. Well, I think that one of the one important thing to point out is, you know, and just just to piggyback from off of what Frank was saying, drag balls have been a safe place for lots of people to express themselves and to be seen and to meet each other and to make connections and so on. But they've also been really dangerous for a lot of folks too. You know, over and over again throughout history, particularly certainly in the early 20th century and in the 19th century, drag balls were constantly surveilled and raided by the police and people were thrown in jail, oftentimes on really trumped up charges or just no charges. We just thought we just think you're a suspicious person. We're going to throw it in jail because you're you're a man wearing a dress. So it's the the safety part is also the other side of it is that it's been a really dangerous thing. People have people have felt a need to express themselves in this particular way. And the authorities have always looked at it as a sort of dangerous thing. And in the in Swans era, one time he was arrested and thrown in jail and the prosecutor, you know, sort of admitted in the prosecution documents of the prosecutor admitted. Well, typically we wouldn't we wouldn't send send some send so on to prison for what we what we charged him with, which was keeping at the sort early house, which is something that usually something to do with prostitution sex work. But he said we're we're trying to keep him off the streets because of his quote evil example to the community. And and it essentially says, you know, because because he is involved with with sex with other men. So the authorities looked at swan drag balls. This is swan the queen drag swan strike balls as as as something that people found so alluring that they want to copy because that's why he was an evil example to the community. You're going to put the community with you're going to put the community. And that is exactly what we're seeing today with with with many many politicians and other and other folks, you know protesting drag drag drag branches and drag story time and protesting, you know, discussions of of being trans in schools. And it's it's a similar kind of it's, you know, it's it's it is the same kind of, you know, policing literally policing and also culturally policing the the ways that we express ourselves and who we are. If you don't fit into those roles, it's considered dangerous and and and the straight cis people are still really scared that that their kids are going to be queer like us. So then when we talk about that activism and that resistance culture within this community Frank, let's go back 50 years ago to Stonewall in New York City and talk a little bit about that as being a bit of a pivot point in terms of drag becoming a little more mainstream or a little more in the face of people because it merged perfectly with the emergence of disco music as well. So yeah, exactly. Well, it's interesting to me because I think I'm going all disco game. I'm just saying that you can do that shit no matter what your orientation is. So good. Keep going. No, I was you can say my next book is about the history of disco so yes it was. Wow. But it's it'll be my take on it, you know, and then and then chatting you do the actual study of the stuff I'll do the here's the buffet of the glitter and then you serve the entree of the meat potatoes and show them what they know. I just make the dessert. Yeah, you can do anything you want. I was going to say that Stonewall for people don't I mean more people know now than you still got a lot of people who still go what is that Stonewall was the turning point were in the beginning of the gay rights movement in America. And there were things before that the black cat and and Compton's cafeteria out in California, but show was the moment in 1969 where gays fought back. And despite what some mainstream movies will tell you it was not the cute little white kid from the Midwest who was throwing bricks. It was trans people who didn't even call themselves that that they call themselves transvestites and activists, not even trans people really, but it was people like Marsha P Johnson, Sylvia Rivera and that stormy delivery that was the day I was like, Channing helped me the drag king who was the woman of all. So I'm going to elaborate. They were the ones who were doing it. And honestly, with any movement, the people who have the least and most to lose at the same time are the ones who are the bravest, the ones who don't fit in the closet. And also are like, I'm not going in there. I've seen with how dark it is in the closet. It stinks. I'm not going to be in there. But the ones who really, you know, who can't hide often tend to be the people who wouldn't hide even if they could. They tend to that personality type of, oh, no, I'm not taking, I'm not a second class. Look at me. I'm fabulous. You know, and they're wearing their look on the street. Those are the ones who often are the bravest and the toughest. And that's why when some of, you know, with what's going on now, you're sort of like, I will pick on the drag queen if I were you. You know, that's like, you know, it's like, if you're going to go, you know, I wouldn't heckle the insult comic, you know, it's sort of, they'll shish go Bob you, you know, it's sort of, it's like you think you're picking on the weak one, but it's like they could outrun you, they could outrun you in platform meals, you know, and then take one off and beat the crap out of you with it. You know, they, they, these are tough people. And yet they look so glamorous and so beautiful while they're doing it. But I think that that was what happened at Stonewall was the ones throwing the bricks at first were and then forming a kick line is that, and I'm going to use the word gay the way I like to use it as if it's a great thing, the greatest thing you could say. What's the gaze? They formed a kick line in the street. So they're doing a rock, hit number against the police. That is the gayest thing you can possibly do. And yet it's sort of like the number, it's not only gorgeous legs, that's like 20 middle fingers, you know, I mean, it's just, it is the ultimate. It's like, oh, you want us to be gay? They would rather than throw in a brick. The police would have rather to brick be thrown at the, because how do you react to that? If you're sort of like, oh yeah, you're going to, we're going to get arrested. But well, if I go, I'm going to at least look good doing it. And then you start a kick line. That, that to me is the gayest, most powerful thing. It's sort of like, oh, I'll show you. And that's why, I mean, drag today is leading the cultural conversation. But I honestly, the Republicans want to shut it down. And the proud, like, you know who you're taking on. It's like these, these people, these are not mincing F words. You know, I mean, you know, they're, they're, these queens up kick your out. They'll clean your clock. You know, I mean, they know how to do it because they've been threatened from the moment they, they came out of the closet or emerged from the womb. Perhaps. So when we talk about the middle fingers to the authorities then versus the middle fingers to politicians now and a lot of the policies that have starting to be passed to suppress this type of culture. I don't think you're going to be able to legislate out anything that has real influence on society. Talk to me a little bit. And Channing, I'll start with you. Talk to me a little bit about the influence that Drag has had on beauty and fashion. I already talked to Bob about television, but let's talk about pop culture and just general beauty and fashion and the way Drag has influenced that even music hill. You know, the first stop that I had when you asked the question is Beyonce, of course, you know, in her latest album Renaissance. There are many references to balls and to, you know, the category is and tends across the board. And if you're listening to the lyrics of the songs, like what alien superstar and like heated. And so it sort of shows that like an artist at that level is engaging with drag culture, history of drag culture. And as well as, I think, I think drag as a influence on beauty has just made it more okay to experiment with, you know, makeup with different forms of attire. For all people. Right. It's made it okay for men to be a little more femme and more fabulous. And it's made it okay for women to be much more fabulous. If they want. And is drag the reason why I have like, you wear an avocado mask at night, some nights for my is that the reason the word exfoliate. You could probably probably do a thesis drawing the line between those. When RuPaul got the Mac cosmetics gig in the in the early 90s. And I was talking to a lot of people a lot of the stuff was shocking back and now you take a lot to shock anybody. But back in the day when RuPaul is suddenly like, Oh wait, look, you know what I'm going to be the the spokesmodel for Viva glam. And she looked gorgeous, you know, the drag boss has left, you just got to get on it to stand in the way or try to fight it will ultimately be unsuccessful. And it's also short sighted because it's sort of you really the upsetting thing to me when people protest drag me story hours like so that those little kids that feel different for whatever reason. And like sparkle whether whatever their gender. They don't get the same treat. They don't get to be happy. They don't get to see someone in a book. They don't, you know, it's very upsetting to me that to see lives being threatened. Drag lives and gay lives queer lives being threatened. When it's preposter, you know, if drag means are groomers, it's like, well, they're not groomers. They're hairstylists. They're makeup artists. They're not. They're not rumors in the pedophile sense. They're groomers and that's it. Your nails look fabulous by the end of it. You know, I mean, get it's just a dumb argument to say they're groomers. It's like, yeah, that's that's why people do drag. It's like, no, that's why clowns become clowns. Or eat you or whatever clowns do. Those are different people. I think queer folks are still a minority, but we're just a powerful, influential minority because of because of how bad ass we are. You know, I always say in 1969, it was so won't happen. It was sort of a surprise to people that suddenly the queer folks could fight back. And the reality is there was all kinds of unseen invisible work that had to get done to build a community that felt confident enough to fight back. So there were decades of work behind that decision to fight back on that day. And now we've had another 50 years of organizing just where we're like, there's no way we're not. We're not going back in the closet. We're not going to go backwards. So yes, they're protesting, but we're not only a cultural force. We're just too, I think too powerful to organize a community now. It doesn't make sense. It's irrational to go against us. What do you all think the future of drag looks like? Where does this go? Because if this small ball, this pebble was rolling down the hill and now it's a big boulder. Where does this go next? How soon to the drag president is when I'm asking? Oh, that's a great one. No, we have to give Rudy. Do we have to give Rudy Giuliani credit for dressing in drag as root? Yeah, I hope not. I don't. Because he was an ugly drag queen. That was ugly drag queen. His father be running that boy. From everywhere. Yeah, it's hard to get mascara out of here, but he managed to do it. I think it's going to look like just this amazing buffet of talent. I think that it's going to come down to how good are you at it, not what, you know, whether you're dressed as a man or a woman or a horror icon where you're covered in blood or you're covered in sequence. I think it can be anything. I think it's drag kids who are so cool with themselves at eight or ten that they're dressing in drag. And performing not just, oh, mommy, I feel different, but they're really like, oh, I'm going to be fierce and go do this. And, you know, the thing that the moment in my life when I realized stuff was changing was when I was speaking to a group of young people and I said, well, I came out when I was 16 in 1978 and the kids said, why did you wait so long? And I was like, oh my God, things have really changed. 16, I was like in the advanced placement program for K in the late 70s. It was like, you know, you know, you're gay or I don't forever. Of course I'm a gay. You know, and I think the future of drag is going to be gorgeous and fabulous and diverse. That's one of the best things about drag too. I didn't say this before. You know, people are always saying we have to in entertainment. We have to strive for diversity with drag. All you have to do is tell the truth. If you, you know, and maybe it's that way with everything. But if you just show who was doing cool stuff, you don't have to go looking for diversity because it's all there in your face. It's gorgeous. It's like something everybody was participating in in their own wonderful way. So it's not forced in any way. Just get out there and tell the truth and you'll have people of every background and color and creed and and sequin type. You know, what's it look like to you? I think drag is a huge factor in what will become a complete transformation of how we think about sex and gender in the future. How we talk about sex and gender, how we think about it, has already completely changed, right? In the future, it will be so core to who we are to talk about diversity of being non binary or trans or the diversity of gender expression. All those, you know, we'll have new words for it because the words always change, right? I think, but it will be completely transformed. One of the things I think that most people sort of don't think about it realizes like it's not just that they used to be old words and now we have cool words. Like in Swan's time, it was, you know, you were a queen or you weren't. It was about what you were actually it was about whether you were participating in balls or not. Whether you were winning the ball, whether you were a queen. And then later you were, you know, other scholars talk about like what, whether you were a fairy or a pansy and then sort of after World War II became this homosexual heterosexuals, slicing, and now we're, you know, now we're much more diverse in terms of being pan or fluid and everybody is becoming more exactly non binary transgender queer gender fluid. We have so many more options. And I think in the future, we will either have many more options than that, or it will just be so part of who we are that it becomes irrelevant in a sort of way. And it's important, I think, just to realize that we're strong enough to get through this and we will. And no matter what they do, all of the way we think about our gender and our sexuality will completely transform. Well, I hope that the future drag does not include more the ignorance and laws and hatred that your community has been dealing with. The two of you are on the spearhead of educating dumb motherfuckers on what the right things are and how to be more knowledgeable citizens. I thank you, Shannon. I thank you, Frank.
