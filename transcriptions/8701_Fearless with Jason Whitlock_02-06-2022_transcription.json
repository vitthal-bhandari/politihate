Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blaisetv.com slash The Blind. Welcome. Welcome to Ferellas with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock, a year host. Happy day before Friday. Happy Thursday to you and yours. Another great week marches on. We have a awesome, fantastic show planned for you today. Royce White is going to be here. Shemika Michelle is going to be here. Delano Squire is going to be here. And I got a fire and a fire starter for you that should get this day off and rolling. I'm very excited about it. I hope you are as well. So let's get to it. Democrats should rename their governing body. The Democratic National Committee established in 1848 in no way reflects the modern platform agenda and strategy of the party. I got an idea. The dead, knee-grow confederacy more accurately characterizes the political party obsessed with George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, I'm out our very the 1921 Tulsa massacre and 70 year old racial lynchings. Dead, knee-grows fuel the DNC. Yesterday, Charles Booker, a Senate candidate running for Rand Paul's Kentucky seat, released a 72 second ad featuring a noose tied around his neck. In the ad, Booker claimed mobs lynched his ancestors. Via Twitter, he stated three of his uncles were lynched in Kentucky. Writing quote, lynching is a tool of terror. It was used to kill hopes for freedom. In Kentucky, it was used to kill three of my uncles. In this historic election, the choice is clear. Rand Paul may want to divide us, but hate won't win this time. It's time to move forward together. I mean, I just can't think of a more unifying message than that than wrapping a new surround your neck and bringing people together. I mean, this Charles Booker, I mean, he is the great unifier. Let's check out his full commercial so you can see it for yourself. The pain of our past persists to this day. In Kentucky, like many states throughout the south, lynching was a tool of terror. It was used to kill hopes for freedom. It was used to kill my ancestors. Now, in a historic victory for our Commonwealth, I have become the first black in Tuckin to receive the Democratic nomination for US Senate. My opponent, the very person who compared expanded healthcare to slavery, the person who said he would have opposed the Civil Rights Act, the person who single-handedly blocked an anti-lynching act from being federal law. The choice couldn't be clearer. Do we move forward together? Or do we let politicians like Rand Paul forever hold us back and drive us apart? In November, we will choose healing. We will choose Kentucky. I don't know about you, but certainly don't you feel healed after watching that commercial? I mean, that news tied around his neck. What could be more healing than that? Charles Booker's commercial criticized Rand Paul for blocking federal anti-lynching legislation. The accusation is completely disingenuous. After objecting to a proposal that failed to properly define lynching, Rand Paul, alongside Republican Tim Scott and Democrat Cory Booker, co-sponsored the Emmett Till Anti-Linching Act that is now federal law. Now, the law is completely purposeless, cosmetic, and totally political. For the last 60 years, death by lightning strikes is far more prevalent than lynching. What has become prevalent in recent years is left as public figures and political activists using relics of America's racist past and dead black criminal suspects to advance their careers. Charles Booker stole his campaign strategy from Jesse Smollett, the actor who tied a noose around his neck to gain popularity. The ploy backfired on Smollett. But at work for NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace, Wallace rose from obscurity and a lack of sponsorship support on the ridiculous insinuation that a garage door broke was really a threatening hangman's noose. Two years ago, Charles Booker thought he could ride the momentum of Black Lives Matter and his participation in Breonna Taylor protests to challenge Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell for his seat. During his bid for the Democratic nomination, Booker ran a more traditional campaign. He espoused stereotypical far left Bernie Sanders approved political policies such as universal health care and the Green New Deal. Booker failed to get out of the Democratic primary. He lost to Amy McGrath who lost a relatively close race to McConnell. Here's what Charles Booker sounded like just two years ago. Check this commercial out. He doesn't need hope or faith. He's got money and power. And the more power he's won in Washington, the more we've lost in Kentucky. Sminging our friends mind our land, our labor, without paying a living wage. He denies climate change and he denies us a future. And this man knows more than anybody how to work the system in Washington. He's the architect. But he's done nothing fucking talking because he's not your neighbor. He's not your brother. He ain't from here. So I grew up in the West in the Louisville. I live in 403, the poorest zip code in the state. Growing up, I remember so often my mom would go without eating dinner just to say food for me. But I still went to school hungry and tired sometimes. I lived that and I knew it didn't have to be that way. So I had faith that things could get better. I had faith because I saw my grandparents opening up their homes to foster care. I saw my neighbors fighting back on the picket line and I saw my uncle become an advocate after my cousin was murdered. Teachers, students, union leaders were all believers. And my mom always told me that if you have faith, just the size of a mustard seed, you can speak to a mountain and that mountain has to move. I'm not the alternative to Mr. O'Connor. We are. This isn't the type of deal where someone can just run for office or someone can just ask for your phone. Now I'm asking for that kind of perseverance. You only find it Kentucky. I'm asking us to build that kind of community. You only find it Kentucky. Kentucky needs a movement and we need to start talking about our dreams again. We need a great new deal to create thousands of good jobs right here in the Commonwealth to help us do what we do best. Take care of one another. We can guarantee new jobs for teachers and nurses, build new hospitals and schools, and we can win Medicare for all so that nobody has to die because they don't have money in their pocket. We can win real democracy in Washington and the workplace. And when we win, we show that something new is happening in Kentucky. Because we're not a joke. We're not a tragedy. I know Kentucky is the future. In America, it should follow our lead. So I don't know if you're keeping score at home, but Charles Booker, and I don't say this flippantly, but maybe I do say it a little bit flippantly, but if you're counting at home, he's had three uncles lynched and an uncle who I think he said found his murdered cousin. So this man is like, he's a participant in a mass murder scheme that has included three uncles and a cousin. I don't want to be a part of the Booker family. The life expectancy is not long. Booker supporters, of course, blame racism of the white Democrats for his primary defeat to Amy McGrath. It's no surprise Booker is back campaigning with a racially divisive message. It's the primary message of the dead Negro Confederacy. The grand wizard of the DNC, Barack Obama, modeled the strategy in the immediate aftermath of the Uvalde massacre. Obama told the dead Negro Confederacy, quote, as we grieve the children of Uvalde, we should take time to recognize that two years have passed since the murder of George Floyd. The DNC does everything it can to keep dead Negroes top of mind for the American public. Wednesday, President Joe Biden commemorated the Tulsa race massacre, tweeting, quote, today, we remember the hell unleashed a one-year 101 years ago in Tulsa, where Greenwood was raided, firebombed, and destroyed by a violent white supremacist mob. It wasn't a riot. It was a massacre. We must continue to reckon with reckon with the past and work to build a more just future. The dead Negro Confederacy strikes again. Democrats do not offer solutions. They tell black people to lock their eyes on the rear mirror or risk being caught from behind by racists. It's the dead Negro Confederacy, the conspiracy theory of choice for the left. In their preferred conspiracy, the only thing standing between black people and a noose is the dead Negro Confederacy. Vote Democrat or die. That's the same message the KKK sounded when six former Confederate soldiers founded the organization in 1865. The KKK worked on behalf of the DNC. It's always been the dead Negro Confederacy. Dead Negroes have long served as the platform to elevate Democrat politicians. It explains why the dead Negro Confederacy is perfectly comfortable with Planned Parenthood and the astronomical number of black babies killed during abortions. It also explains why cities controlled by the dead Negro Confederacy have high murder rates among their black citizens and support defunding the police. The dead Negro Confederacy strives to make black people vulnerable and dependent on the goodwill of government. The DNC is against self-sufficiency and self-defense. It has pitted law-abiding black people against law enforcement by convincing black people that we're all George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, or Emmett Till. Truth is, we're not. Tamir Rice is not analogous to Emmett Till, a 14-year-old brutally killed in 1955 after a white woman accused him of untoward behavior. An overaggressive police officer made a tragic decision to shoot rice while the 12-year-old was holding a toy gun. The only people who should worry about dying the way Floyd did are people who regularly use fentanyl and think it's wise to disobey police officers for 20 straight minutes. If you're a woman who believes you could be killed in a similar fashion to Breonna Taylor, I strongly urge you to get a new boyfriend. Did Jim for a man strong enough to leave you in the bedroom while he checks on the trouble at the front door and one smart enough to not indiscriminately fire his gun at police or intruders on the other side of the door? Everyone else should be asking themselves what they find so redeeming about the dead Negro Confederacy. Perhaps it's the organization's position on climate change. Let's hope it's not the DNC's affinity for dead yes I said it. I hope they bleep it out but that's what it's all about. They love dead inwards. Their entire platform is built on the backs, the caskets, the bodies of dead black people. It's the most racist organization going in America. This clown Charles Booker, tying a rope a noose around his neck like Jesse Smalin and thinking it's okay and people not rebuking him. His commercial has more than a million views and I saw people, oh man you really made people uncomfortable. This is great. We got to keep dead black people top of mind for black people. We have to keep them looking in the rearview mirror because looking in the rearview mirror is how you get ahead in this world. Or perhaps it's how you make very little progress in this world. Perhaps it's why you don't move ahead in this world because you're constantly looking over your shoulder and looking in your rearview mirror for the boogie man. It's the dead Negro conspiracy. They love it. That is their QAnon. Let's roll out to Minneapolis. I wanted to bring in Royce White because he's running for a seat in the house. He's trying to take Elon Omar's spot in the house in Congress and I wanted to talk. This Charles Booker I think is 38 young black politician. So I wanted to bring in our young black politician Royce White and get his take on this messaging strategy that the Democratic Party has seemingly adopted across the board. Royce, I don't know. Well, you've seen the video now. I don't know if you saw it yesterday, but just your reaction to this advertisement, Charles Booker puts out with the news tied around his neck and claiming that half of his ancestry was wiped out by lynching and he's here to finally do something about it that Rand Paul refuses to do. Well, I have a lot of problems with with Booker's ad. The entire thing is double speak. My concept of where we are in America today is that the biggest lie is behind the greatest truths. There is a reality of racism in America's history. So far as I see it, the biggest and most obvious sign of racism or symbol of the racism of America is how black America has been made to be dependent on the government. We've been made to be dependent on the government culturally and we have been used and propped up to foment racial tension to distract us and the greater American public from our elites, corruption and thievery. And Charles Booker knows that and that's why he very carefully and intentionally double speaks around certain issues that would point to a greater establishment corruption. And in his attack on Rand Paul is ridiculous. Look, when you know, I would have been against the Civil Rights Act now in retrospect, I mean, I can't speak to how I would have approached it at the time given the emotion of the time that would have maybe been different. But Malcolm, I mean, not Malcolm X, I'm sorry, Martin Luther King himself in retrospect was cautionary about seeing the Civil Rights Act as a real achievement. In fact, he said, I've led my people into a burning building and that there are two Americas and he spoke to the greater financial circumstance of black people but of the working class in America. And Martin Luther King was ironically killed shortly after that speech. So, you know, these are these are all things that that Charles Booker and the Democrat establishment, but also the Republicans as well, the Uniparty have done well to tip toe around so that they can keep the conversation in the most hyperbolic spot. I would agree that Mitch McConnell is a sellout as well and many of the things that he said about McConnell are true. But what he's not saying is that he's in on it. You can be pro-imitil and be, you can't be pro-imitil and be pro-me too. Right? That's one glaring problem with the entire platform. It's just double speaking. It's become common with our politicians all across this country. So, explain to me why you think perhaps the Civil Rights Act was a bad deal for black people? Well, I mean, the Civil Rights Act was a carrot. It was a rotten carrot. It was a way to pacify black people. It was a way to say, here is a symbolic token of your equal treatment here in America given the past while we shift the entire economic scam that we have running against the wider base of American working class people. And shortly after the Civil Rights Act was written and codified, you had the opening of China, which is the single greatest, most, the single greatest economic injustice done on the American people. But black people as well. So, what is other than perhaps not having any solutions? Why do you think Charles Booker and so many Democrats don't even pretend to offer solutions anymore? It's all racial rhetoric. It's all emotional driven rhetoric. Have we just moved to a place in politics where no one even pretends to have good advice or solutions or policies that can move the country forward? Well, I think this country is ready for racial healing. And again, I think the globalist led establishment finds great value and fomenting or racial tension or keeping racial tension going to distract us. They don't have to change their sales pitch because we have not grown wise to the scam. It hasn't reflected in the way that we voted, it hasn't reflected in the way that we purchased as black people in this country. And, you know, quite frankly, I'm discouraged by these days. I'm discouraged by it. And I'm quite frustrated with how black America responds or continues to respond to these types of puppets. These are the house Negroes of today. These are the house Negroes that Malcolm X warned us about. These people who talk and double speak with a silver tongue and try to appeal to our emotion and get us distracted from the greater circumstance. You know, maybe the most racist thing that this country did to black people in conjunction with having us in a dependent mindset is we were put in a survivalist mentality. And when you develop a survivalist mentality, you become a radical materialist. You base your life, your success on the things that you have. And over time, we become diseased by this comparative model where all of our success, all of our value, all of our meaning in life is predicated on what the next black person has. And then they give us false props like a Charles Booker who seems like he has success by toting these Democrat liberal globalist talking points. And then we all want to aspire to it. It's a complete scam. It's a bait and switch. It's predatory is what it is. And the reality is when you become a radical materialist, you lose your sacred honor. And Charles Booker has no sacred honor. I don't trust no black men that we're cardigans like he's wearing in that infomercial first and foremost. And that is ad hominin. And I believe in ad hominins in some cases, especially, especially is. But you know, that is the greater scam that's being run on us. And it's a continual scam. And it continues to prove to bear fruit because black people have not become serious about our circumstance in this country. We bought into radical materialism and we've lost our sacred honor by and large. The other thing that frustrates me about all this is this anti lynching legislation under the name of Emmett Till. This is addressing a problem that quite frankly just does not exist in 2020, 2021, 2022. I don't know if it's existed in the 1980s, that there hasn't lynching went away basically in the 1950s. And so I look at everybody, Rand Paul, Tim Scott, Cory Booker, Charles Booker, this whole little anti lynching legislation in the name of Emmett Till. Who's stupid enough? It would be like, well, we got a Jason Whitlock legislation that requires him to wear size 34 pants. Well, I don't need size 34 pants. I don't wear size 34 pants. Why pass that law? And so as much as I'm upset with Charles Booker, and I get that Rand Paul was trying to anticipate a political scam. The left was running and so let's co-sponsor Bill. But they're fixing a problem that doesn't exist. Well, I mean, yeah, the lynching issue is not a real issue. If they want to go back and retroactively change laws to be symbolic towards black people. Okay, I mean, fine, I have no opinion on that really. I'll tell you what does exist today, the Me Too movement in grand fashion. And that's what that's the very lead in the entire anti lynching Emmett Till Bill is that the Me Too movement and the inability for American men to properly codify parameters around the sexual domain and how the justice system can still use that to railroad men, culturally, economically, physically, mentally, spiritually, has not even been talked about here. And it won't be talked about at all, because just like the Me Too movement is really a Democrat enterprise, the Rhino and Republican establishment have bent the needle women as well. It's a scare. They won't most people won't even touch the Me Too issue with a full throw. I happen to be somebody who's not afraid of the Me Too movement in any way, partly because I come from a life, lived experience behind the curtain of what it means to be a professional athlete. And we know all too well that women use sex, the sexual domain, to be predatory around their own selfish ambitions. So this entire just believe women, believe all women, which Charles Bookler would certainly espouse to as an ideological framework, is completely, completely dangerous for black men. And there's a history of that. So that's the double speak I'm talking about when they talk about black men and history and what this country has done on record to our people. And they skip over all of the particulars that point to the fact that they plan to be just as predatory, going forward. And the Green New Deal is a great example as well. In the Green New Deal, they want to justify the continued displacement of American jobs to assign these CCP manufacturing machine that is the greatest existential threat to America's sovereignty and national interest at all in American history. I mean, the Republicans and Democrats together and Rand Paul signed off on this in some cases, but many of the Republicans have signed off on this in some cases. In fact, it was Nixon that opened it up in the first place, conspired to let China run away with our entire manufacturing safety. Right now, if China closed its doors on us, this country will collapse. This country's essential supply chains are compromised. The Chinese have was by the throat. And these people want to talk about a Green New Deal, not because the environment is under catastrophic risk. They're talking about a Green New Deal to justify continuing on giving our sovereignty and national interest away to the CCP. And then, on top of it, they want you to believe that the new manifestation of American racism is not truly against black people or black men who they selectively decide who is in or who is out. They want you to believe that the new racism is against Chinese people. And they call it the anti-American, the anti-Asian hate crime bill. When they say anti-Asian hate, who are they talking about? They're not talking about the people in the Middle East. They're not talking about people from India. They're not talking about the Russians. Those people are all Asian. They're talking about the Chinese. They're talking about people in Southeast Asia. They're talking about we cannot talk or speak down about the CCP, their culture, and what their position is currently on the world stage as it pertains to America and working class black people. It's a scam. That was really good. I want to go back before I ask for a follow-up on your last point. You forced me to ask you your thoughts on Johnny Depp, Amber Heard, and whether or not this is some kind of blow to the Me Too movement, or that's just some little Hollywood side show that will have no impact moving forward. No, I think that I think after all of these things have sorted out in our country around our national sovereignty and all of these geopolitical issues, there is a serious issue between man and woman that will have to be resolved far better than it has been. You could say that that's going to be the battle from now from from the beginning of time and to the end of time is the conflict between man and woman. But right now, particularly feminism and that battle between men and woman has been held up and manipulated to push a cultural agenda. That cultural agenda is to say that all men, by and large, even black men, especially the straight black men who believe in God, are a product of a corrupt patriarchy. They use things like the pay gap to justify. It's ridiculous. It's the whole premise is ridiculous. Men spend more money on women than vice versa, which is part of the reason why the pay gap is the way it is because despite what the liberal democratic feminists want to preach, most women in the country still love a man who provides. And Amber heard is an example of that with all of her independent success and notoriety. She liked Johnny Depp because he was a star. He was head of his field. He had money. He could provide it was their house where she was bringing the other men to that we found out in the case. This case is a classic example of how the radical feminist movement in this country would like to create a selective world framework to judge men and to strip men of power and to manipulate men politically. So should we feel a little bit hopeful that Johnny Depp won this defamation lawsuit? I mean, it's neither here nor there. I think I mean, I think the Me Too movement is taking some huge blows culturally in general because the one thing that they really didn't account for was that there are enough men in power to reject the Me Too movement at its zenith, at its height, with all of its ambitions, where it wants to go. Men like power, individual power, and sovereignty of their own choices, of their own lives, more than they like their relationship with women. And so, you know, the powerful men in this country will only let that racket go so far. And this is a sign after 10 years of a buildup in the Me Too movement where judges and the greater culture along with evidence are saying, nah, Amber, we're not letting that slide. I got to follow up with you. And maybe we'll do it tomorrow. We'll certainly get to it by next week because I love the framework. There's definitely a brewing battle between men and women that isn't being discussed in any kind of real way. And we need to be leading that discussion right here on this show. And I look forward to doing it. Thank you, Royce. Appreciate it. Great job as always. Let me take care of some business. It's getting hot outside and that's just not from grills firing up.

Perfect time to roll out to North Carolina after what Royce just said, breaking down the Amber Heard Johnny Depp situation and talking about the brewing battle or the ongoing battle between men and women. We're going to go out to North Carolina and bring in Shamika Michelle. Shamika, I think you've paid a little bit attention to the Johnny Depp Amber Heard defamation lawsuit. Obviously the verdict yesterday. I think Johnny Depp got 15 million, maybe 10 million and then 5 million and punitive and then she got like 2 million against his agent perhaps. But I think Johnny Depp at most can get like 10 million dollars after whatever but he won clearly and the root somehow and this is a perfect segue off of what Royce and I were talking about the root somehow managed to turn the Amber Heard Johnny Depp thing to white people bickering over defamation into a headline and a story that said Amber Heard verdict sends message to black women. What was that message? According to the root, I guess it's worse being black than white but I'm trying to what was the message from this verdict that black women were supposed to get and what is there any connection that they just reached in here? So this definitely isn't what the root meant I'm sure but I think it does send a message to all women but since we want to talk about black women let's talk about them. The message that it should send is to keep your hands to yourself. What we have taught our young boys and our men for years is to not hit a woman but we have failed to teach the same thing to our young girls and what I have noticed is how violent black women have become over the years. So since they want to talk about black women let's talk about it. Let's talk about how we notice how black women like to stand toe to toe to a black man. They're so disrespectful that they feel like they can stand toe to toe and test him to see how far they can actually push him or how much they can push his buttons. I've seen women get in a man's face and point her fingers pushing his head until he snaps or just trying to see how far she can go and she'll say what you gonna do about it what you gonna do you gonna hit me you gonna hit me we have become so disrespectful to black men that we as black women we try to get them in trouble just as anybody else. We are just as much of an enemy as anybody else as we claim the white man is as we claim the white woman is we talk so much and so hateful and so disrespectful that we push black men a lot of times to their limit without taking any type of responsibility or accountability. In this article they talked about Tina Turner, Rihanna and Megan Astallion. I'm not gonna include Tina Turner because we haven't seen anything that says I wasn't abusive and these were events that happened over and over and over again but when it comes to Rihanna and Chris Brown and Megan Astallion especially with Rihanna the story that Chris Brown gave and talked about how she spit on him and threw his keys and did we do that a lot of times as black women and it is time for us to learn that we need to keep our hands to ourselves stop lying take responsibility learn how to pull back and stop pushing men to the brink of violence we do that a lot. Obviously I'm gonna dance a little bit I'm allegedly fearless but I'm gonna dance a little bit because obviously you can speak more authoritatively on that and more fiercely on that than I can. I can't say there's definitely truth in what you're saying in terms of the whole culture has basically said you're free to disrespect the heterosexual black man any kind of way you want and what we see in the Johnny Depp situation and we've seen it time from Brett Kevin on when he's up for the Supreme Court the culture has said whoo you can say and do virtually anything to the white heterosexual man and get away with it and when you give people that kind of license and freedom they're going to take it and so I'm wondering because there's a lot of people celebrating this decision and saying this is the end of the Me Too movement I don't know if I completely agree because and I'll connect it to the conversation we were having earlier you would think that Jesse Smollett putting that fake news around his neck and bringing those allegations you would have thought that would end the racial hoax deal but I'm looking at a politician basically put out a commercial with a fake news and so it hasn't stopped it just metastasized and took a different form attacked a different part of the body and so I'm wondering if you think this herd defamation suit going against her do you think it will impact slow down the Me Too movement or do you think it'll just take a different form? I think it'll take a different form because women a lot of times are just hard headed I don't think that this is going to sound the alarm as much as it should I think they will continue to try and think they can do anything and get away with anything and nothing is going to ever stop them so I don't think that this is going to be as massive as the root tried to make it for any group of women I really don't. For me, Shamika I'm just because I'm self-aware older, have been attacked. I live in fear of engaging with women I don't know very well and and so it's caused me to take a step back and not be as personable or sociable or as free with my thoughts and I would imagine other self-aware men are the exact same way. Anything can be taken as if you open a door for a woman if it's the wrong one she might catch an attitude of like you know what you're doing that for you know like I can't get it myself and so you're better off doing nothing than engaging at all. Just sticking to the racial component of it and what the root did and just where relationships are with black men and black women I almost see the situation as almost hopeless because I don't want to let me make sure I want to be careful what I say here but I've seen a lot of guys completely emasculate themselves to maintain their relationship that they know in order to survive in the relationship they have to cut their balls off and they can't be themselves and I'm just not willing to do that and and I think when I see people do that I was like well that relationship isn't going to work y'all may survive that y'all may maintain the relationship but nothing healthy nothing beneficial is going to be produced in that relationship do you see the same thing? I definitely see the same thing Jason and I wish more men would start to stand up and stop taking less than what they deserve I think it would be a big change the only reason I'm not hopeless is because I do know women who feel the way that I do that think men deserve more especially black men and I think there's nothing too hard for God so I do think there can be a turnaround but it's going to take work from all parties to actually make a change. I want to ask you a slightly more light-hearted question although I think there's actual truth to it because Pretty is kind of undefeated and so Amber Heard is attractive and so I want to ask you what percentage of men having just witnessed this trial seeing her get slammed for defamation would still like the opportunity to date Amber Heard. 85 I think it's still going to be pretty high I think it's just humans period a lot of times we have this competitive nature we feel like we can change someone oh it's not going to be me she wouldn't do this to me I'm better than Johnny Depp I just think that men are going to fall into that she won't be single for long she'll definitely have someone else because we just have this I can do it better you know you see it all the time especially with women they'll see that a man is a womanizer but somehow they feel like they have you know what they call pussy power and they're gonna chain chimp and he's not gonna do the same thing to them I think it goes both ways between men and women they just sometimes you got to learn the hard way. Yeah I can definitely see a lot of men's uh Johnny Depp wasn't hitting that right wait till she get a taste of mine that'll slow her down no I won't that won't fix nothing but I can definitely see that hey I want to get to our approval rating on Amber Heard and I'm definitely part of that 85% uh hate to admit it but let's go to job performance I gotta be and it is probably because I'm not the greatest Hollywood buff in the world other than this lawsuit I didn't know anything about Amber Heard I don't know what movie she's been in I ain't you know I wasn't aware of her until this lawsuit so you know seems like a pretty mediocre actress to me I gave her a 14 in job performance I don't even remember what I gave her I think I gave her a 21. Yeah I gave her a 21. Because first of all there was so much drugs and alcohol in the case I think I just went with 21 to make sure we were all over the legal limit I gave her a 21 because did you see her performance in court she kept her head down she looked so like an abused woman she would only look up with her eyes occasionally because she was so timid and abused and so hurt that she hate and ashamed the job performance was excellent so that's why I gave her such a high score it was excellent excellent excellent you you made one reference that I wasn't aware so they were using a lot of drugs and alcohol both of them it definitely appeared so yes there were times I think his finger got semi-severed because an alcohol bottle was she threw an alcohol bottle at him and hit his finger and almost cut it off it was just so much drugs and alcohol in that relationship it's no wonder it went astray like that. All right character I guess I got this right then I'm very low on her character she lied about him and had a very dysfunctional relationship I gave her a 2 in a character which I think is 2 points higher. Yes I gave her a zero simply because I just don't like liars I don't like liars I don't like people who have a hard time taking accountability and Amber is both of those people she's a liar and she doesn't take accountability so for me she gets a zero in character. Authenticity I stuck with my two you gave her the perfect 10 for authenticity how come not the 25 is perfect but I was anyway you gave her a 10. Yeah I gave her 10 points because some people lie so much that they actually begin to believe the lies that they tell so I think that she's been authentic and thinking what happened happened like this is genuinely who she is I think she's genuinely a negative person I think she is genuinely the type of woman you should run from I think she's been genuine I definitely think this is who she is so I gave her a 10. All right on this I think there's some agreement not perfect agreement we're both in the same range it factor as I said pretty is undefeated I gave her a 25 and it factor she's got it obviously that's how she got Johnny Depp and that's how she'll probably get her next husband or victim whoever that might be good luck Godspeed to that person I gave her a 25 perfect score 25 and it factor. I gave her a 23 because I gave her the number of the goat Michael Jordan now whether that's throat dope I don't know but she definitely has something for Johnny Depp and Ela Musk for her to have had them she has it beauty brains wap I don't know but she definitely has it so I gave her 23. First time I've heard the term throat goat and it cracked me up I have her I can't remember there was a strip of back this had to be 20 years ago when there was a controversy about NBA players and strip clubs and some some stripper in Atlanta called herself the Michael Jordan of sex and then I think Patrick Ewing and all the nicks used to come to her strip club because she was the Patrick Jordan of sex anyway I've got her at a dumpster fire amber herd 43 you've got her a candle lit thank you Shamika awesome job appreciate you. Let me take care of some business as inflation surpasses highs not seen in 40 years the value of the dollar is decreasing with every passing day you're paying more at the pump the grocery store for cars for housing face it your paper money is worth a lot less and here's why I love bullion max they're owned by veterans in the precious metal space offer some of the lowest prices on the internet and they make it so easy to buy directly from their website I want to help you get started so I worked out a special offer with them just for you get bullion max's silver starter kit at employee pricing just go to bullion max dot com slash Jason this kit includes five of the most desirable silver products to invest in including a silver American Eagle and a silver Australian kangaroo this offer is limited to just one per household so get yours now go to bullion max dot com slash Jason right now get yourself some precious metals some silver some gold I got mine and I'm gonna get more all right stick around Delano Squires next all right welcome back a couple things in the news one my Charles Booker piece that I talked about at the beginning of this show wrote about that actually came I was looking at Delano's Twitter feed and he mentioned it Delano so we'll talk with Delano about that Delano has written about Leah Thomas and how she's back in the news cycle I think she's done a couple of interviews and so I want to start there and give you a taste of what Leah Thomas has been saying in the news media and so I think we got some clips or let's play them both back to back and then we'll bring Delano in and get his take to the column he's written in what he's had new to say about Leah Thomas but let's start from hearing from Leah Thomas what do you think is the biggest misconception people have about you specifically um the the famous conception I think is the reason why I transitioned where people will say oh she just transitioned so she would have an advantage and she could win I transitioned to be happy to be true to myself trans women competing in women's sports does not threaten women sports as a whole because trans women are a very small minority of all athletes and the NCA rules regarding trans women competing in women's sports have been around for for 10 plus years um and and we haven't seen any massive wave of trans women dominating I knew like there are some people who didn't support me um on a big team not not everybody is best friends with everybody and I had my close group of friends and as a more private person that's that's all I needed was my immediate friends I respect everybody on my team um we all go through um 20 hours of grilling work a week um and I'll come into the sport and I won't I won't harsh on anybody for that. Leah obviously helps us do better right via swimming really fast via performance helps the University of Pennsylvania swim team the feeling of winning doesn't feel as good anymore because it feels tainted there was a lot of things you couldn't talk about that were very concerning like a locker room situation if you even brought up concerns about it you were transphobic if you even bring up the fact that Leah swimming might not be fair you were immediately shut down this being called a hateful person or transphobic but there's never any conversation the coaches don't sit everyone down and acknowledge what everyone's really upset about so Pat actually brought in people high up in the athletic department talked to us they brought in someone from like the LGBTQ center they brought in someone from the psychological services so you you're upset about what's happening and so you need psychological help yeah and they told us in this meeting they said look we understand there's an array of emotions but Leah's swimming is a non-negotiable however we can help you make that okay that's what we're here for so that second part obviously is a former university or former or current university Pennsylvania swimmer who had to swim on the same team with Leah Thomas that was an interview she did with Matt Walsh who put out a documentary what is a woman premiered yesterday i'm gonna watch it tonight anyway Delano without further ado Leah Thomas back in the news she sat down with a transgender espn reporter uh katie Barnes those two guys uh set around and talked the transgender issue uh in a quite positive way and then we hear the other side uh from one of Leah's former teammates or current teammates i don't know what it is anyway your take today so Jason's a lot a lot of things i have going on in my mind right so my my column really ties together Leah Thomas was back in the news as you said after a fairly glowing profile in ESPN written by someone who according to their twitter profile i uses the personal pronouns of they them so i'm not even sure what you know this person's you know uh chromosomes in the bio would be but it ties together Leah Thomas and Laverne Cox right the the actor who a lot of people know from Orange is the New Black one of the most prominent members of the lgbt community particularly on the trans on the transgender side who recently got um a barbie doll made in his image by Mattel i'm not sure if it's tucked or untucked but the the barbie doll is is supposed to be you know of of of Laverne Cox and i tie those things together you know with with an issue that we're going to talk about a little later which is that that lynching video from you know Charles Booker and my my basic premise is this and you actually heard some of what i'm about to say from Leah Thomas's uh teammate my basic premise is this there has been a direct connection by the lgbt sort of movement to tie uh particularly the the trans part of that movement to the legacy of civil rights in this country and in doing so what the left has done has created a new political identity transgender specifically and said that anyone who does not agree with uh transgenderism gender ideology in schools who does not want men and women's sports or men and women's bathrooms is no different than the the the lynchers or the bigots of yesteryear the people that Charles Booker had in in in his in his uh short campaign video so what the left has done has has turned 99 percent of the country to actually believes in in biological sex into transphobes overnight by rewriting the rules on gender so one of the things i say is that when it comes to gender ideology and the left we're all clansmen now and we're all on this boat and that's one of the reasons that lee atomens and levron cocks have gone as far as they've gone so quickly right they've reached back the trans movement reached back to john lewis on the edman petis bridge and gave us katelyn jenna at the sp's in 2015 and they they have moved with lightning speed um and really have walked on top of the elves in the in the jeez and have made it so that anybody who pushes back at all in terms of their ideology in terms of again people like lee atomens they cast as a transphobic bigot and that fear of being called a bigot is why so many people including gays and lesbians white liberals black progressives and self-identified feminists have been silent in the face of this particular movement because when you are someone who seen yourself as oppressed the worst thing in the world that could happen to you is to be labeled in oppressor and you would rather sit on your hands and keep your mouth shut and allow grown men like lee atomens jason when i first put that video on i had to turn the base down because i said he could he could change a lot of things he could change his hair he could stuff his bra he can tuck he can nip he can you know take hormones but the voice is not going to change so they allow grown men to have their way in our culture and community and the only thing that they can do is sit there and be silent you know the one the thing i think about as it relates to the transgender issue the whole lgbtq movement and how uh black people in our past have been used co-opted and and all of that is just i think about and i i don't know the passage or where it came from but at some point doesn't the devil say to god that he can get he can get him all to that i can get him all to that basically deny you and that's what i think is going on with this whole lgbt movement is the denial of god and and it's i'm looking at many of us who claim to be christian claim to believe what's in the bible we in order to be politically expedient in order to be popular over social media in order to maintain our job in corporate america mhm we are denying god and god's will and god's plan for us we are that and it's so easy and and we just well she says or he says he's a woman i'm going to hop on board with that even though i know factually and and and i'm you know what they say that we all with the whole countries agreed we all got a agree on same-sex marriage i'm going to hop on board with that because i have to to keep my job it's all a denial of god and it's all just way too easy and and i know the reason i can say it comfortable because i know i'm in an easier position not having kids not having a wife and so it's easier for me but i look at guys like yourself i look at tj moe i look at dave shannon guys with families wives kids to protect and you guys are standing firm and i'm just blown away at how easy other people are just denying things that they claim they truly believe and and jason what what you're describing really is is how shame can be used as a powerful tool for emotional manipulation and social control so in the same way that many you know self-professed white liberals spent decades with their greatest fear being you know being called you know getting called a racist right and that fear allowing them to say you know what i can't comment on anything having to do with race all the previously oppressed categories black folk women gays lesbians are in the same boat and they are they are just as afraid to say anything um this is this is why you know even women who are prominent in either journalism or business or and particularly sports i mentioned all the time people like jamael hill right mina climbs joy read these are women who have large public platforms but they will either only speak an affirmation of the transgender issue or they do not speak at all so all those teenage girls those high school girls will cry out for for one of their oldest cistern to speak on their behalf are speaking into the wind and really what you're seeing is the the the sort of fact of nature that when you remove the strong male from from from nature from the environment you leave the women and the children vulnerable to whoever the the next self-serving male is because there's always gonna be male leadership now we we abandon traditional masculinity and any notion of patriarchy and now we we've got guys in dresses and wigs both on the transgender side and also on the drag queens side i'm sure you see all these videos from libs and tiktok every other day it's a school with with drag queens right so now that's that's the type of males that that we have running the show and and the women are terrified and that's why i ended up using you know uh um i talked about disney and the lion king because disney is really at the nexus of this that a parent company of espian right the worldwide leader in sports who is promoting lea thomas and gave katelyn jenna an award seven years ago but they also they created the lion king and we we see what this story looks like when it's unfolded you had the evil uncle scar who wanted to be king but couldn't do it until he moved the the the masculine presence of king mufasa out of the way he killed mufasa sent cymbal you know running into the hills lied to the to the women and the remaining children about how mufasa died um allowed the hyenas to come in right took took what was a bountiful sort of fruitful green land and turned it into a wasteland and he remained unchallenged until cymbal got old enough and and large enough in terms of stature and strength to come back and challenge his uncles lies and his position of authority and that's the only reason that that which that that community which was ironically called pride lands was was able to get some measure of liberty and freedom and what we have now are a bunch of scars with scars of all different types running our society and our culture and it's sad right it's really sad to see because you you see the the women and children um you know who are powerless and they can't do anything espn has no choice but to write affirming articles about lea thomas right matell has no choice but to to make a uh uh at least they think they have no choice but to make a doll of of levern cox um and and we see that in every area of our culture of our politics and our school system and our major corporations and and i'm hoping that there there's a generation of young cymbals who are ready to rise up and get scarred out of here the the marines the u.s arms forces are celebrating gay pride month with rainbow bullets and helmets and uh you know at some point i wanted to talk not with you but i i wanted to talk about it ran across my mind i saw barstool sports leaned all into gay pride month and gay merchandise and black lives matter stuff you know everybody's just selling out for money man everybody and and it's it's sick but the line of the other thing i you know i wanted to get to i your tweets yesterday about um charles booker called my attention and made me go look it up and and just what when i when i look at the left and how they're using race and historic racism and dead black people as the platform for them to stand on from and that's from barack obama to hate i know you're thinking about you've all day kids but don't forget george floyd we got came from george floyd yet yesterday biden is oh my god hey you got to remember a hundred and one years ago the toss of massacre and and and and this guy uh charles booker puts a fake uh puts a noose around his neck in a commercial i i it's it's one of the most repulsive grotesque uh unethical things i think i've ever seen from a politician and there's a long politicians do a lot of really bad things he's in deep competition but but here's somebody going full jesse smile it uh is is comical to me i just anyway your thoughts so so jason this is that commercial is the epitome of what i've labeled on this show as the selma syndrome which is the fusion of america's racial history right particularly the ugly parts of our racial history and um sort of the democratic party platform and they use the selma syndrome right which has features a stock home syndrome right where the the person who's captive feels like their future is tied to the person who who is their cap tour and what the democrats do is is use that ugly racial history for the purpose of emotional manipulation and to drive people to the polls it's totally self-serving he's not making some larger point about current threats to black lives today he's not he's not drawn a line from the hanguins noose to to the the the handgun in in the hand of a largely black male shooter he's he's not making that comparison all he wants to do is show a black and white image right that he can use is the basis of his campaign and tell voters that if you vote for rampal you're voting for your own lynching but if you vote for me you're voting for freedom inequality and as i said yesterday on twitter i think that type of craving self-serving behavior is despicable and the the notion that these people say that they're concerned about history and they don't want to whitewash history anybody that would do that and and he said i think he said three of his uncles would lynch anybody that would use that type of pain for their own personal gain and as you said Barack Obama did it with George Floyd Jason i'm i meant to talk about this last week on the show we talked about George Floyd USA today ran a ran a story and a headline of it and our paraphrase and with some to the effect of you know two years after George Floyd is killed black women still you know are not moving into leadership in in corporate America and i i thought to myself what in what world do do do people think that the death of one man entitles them to a job in a particular company but that's the world we live in and as i said these people are vultures man and if they're if you can find a black victim and a white perpetrator they will feed on that carcass for as long as they can and they'll just keep picking they'll pick all the meat off they'll open up the bones they'll suck out the marrow and all of it is for their own political gain and that's why over and over again you hear them comes whenever they get in the jam they compare themselves to Emmett Till any piece of legislation they don't like is you know new Jim Crow and for me i would have compared it to a parent who adopts a child who was severely abused in their past and every time that parent wants to get that child to do something they say well if you don't listen to me i'm gonna send you back to your to your mom and your daddy and see how you like it then or i'm gonna leave you at the bus stop and see how you like it then and that type of emotional manipulation is cruel now it also shows that this guy has no policy platform to run on because he can't even ground his campaign in this century he has to go back over a hundred years to make his point so so on on the political level it shows that he's weak but again i think the larger point is how easily these people would trade on you know the the pain of the past for their own personal promotion again i would love for someone to fact check this guy he he's three cut three uncles lint and then he mentioned a cousin murdered i i just who boy i mean this guy this must be he must be from the barksdale family from the wire or so or something because it's just like hardly he's the lone survivor in his family yeah i would love for him to be fact checked again three uncles lintched this guy's 38 years old how could his uncles be like maybe 70 i guess so 70 years ago in Kentucky three of his where's the story did they all get lintched at the same time uh are these great great great great uncles that he heard about or what i would love for him to be fact checked but that will never happen uh and and i you know the one thing will this ploy i mean because he's going up against ran paul i think but i do you think this will be effective i think i think it's effective for some people because honestly part of the the selma syndrome um the unfortunate part of it is that there are a lot of people i'm talking about black voters who who feel like this is america 1922 right so i think it would be effective for those people and i've i've saw i saw people underneath the video saying oh this is so brave and it's controversial i feel like rolton martin retweeted it you know with some sense of approval um but i hope that for black folk who have some sense of dignity and respect for themselves and the past and the ancestors and this nation's history that they would reject this the same way they would reject you know the you know the story you and shimiko were talking about with the root where where they're trying to tie you know what happens to amber her to to black women and i i feel like we are at a breaking point at a cultural uh inflection point where black america the masses need to rise up and kick all of these people out of their positions of power and influence thank you delano thank you jason yeah we need to end the uh dead nikro confederacy the new confederacy started by the left all right uh that's tomorrow we'll see you tomorrow bye i i"
