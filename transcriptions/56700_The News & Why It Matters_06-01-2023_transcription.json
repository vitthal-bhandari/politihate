    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at BlazeTV.com slash The Blind. The latest in the speaker of the house drama and a new contender emerges for 2024, but it may not be who you think. So you need to tune in. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to The News and White Matters. It is Friday. It's been a short week for us. I'm Sarah Gonzalez and I'm joined today by Stuporkere, of course, host of Stu Does America, which everyone should be subscribed to, not only on YouTube, but also wherever you get your podcasts, you're welcome Stu. Wise advice, Sarah, as usual. It's good to see you. Good to see you too. Happy New Year. Yeah, happy New Year. Glad you're back. Also joined by Alex Stein, BlazeTV host of an upcoming show. It's coming out soon, but no. BlazeTV host of a show that you can't find anywhere yet, but don't worry, you will. I just want to make this point. It's been almost three weeks since I've seen you guys and it's been an emotional reunion. Yeah, because I'll be honest, I've been excluded from a lot of stuff. Always picked last on the team. Oftentimes demonized, made fun of, but here at the Blaze, you guys are treating me like family. So this time apart, it's been tough, but now that we're back, let's get it going. That's not right. That's how you know that we get told that we are ableists all the time, but we're not because we don't discriminate against the mentally district. Yeah, they actually hire them here. So it's really nice. I think they get a government kickback for them. But who cares? Don't talk about that. So I want to give the latest on, again, every day this week, I've had to say, as of the time of this taping, let's go through what has happened so far in all of the speaker, the house drama, because, you know, as you can see, a couple hours makes a lot of difference, especially with these last couple of days. So late last night, there was a report early this morning that late last night there could be a deal, a GOP deal that was emerging that could give McCarthy a path to the speakership. And now we're finding out that, let's see, there were several Republican members elect who voted for McCarthy in the first ballot after opposing him in the first 11 votes. I think there were like 14 of them. It included Dan Bishop, Josh Brekeen, Mike Cloud, Andrew Clyde, Byron Donalds, who that one was interesting to me because he was the other Republican who the others, the anti-McCarthy people had nominated. He ended up voting for McCarthy today in that first ballot. Paul Gassar, Annapaulin Aluna, Mary Miller, Ralph Norman, Andy Ogle, Scott Perry, Chip Roy, who was very outspoken as well, and Keith Self. So very interesting, again, as of the time of this taping, this could be, you know what, you could just take this entire conversation and throw it in the garbage by the time you watch it. But yeah, actually, I have an update. Taylor Switch was just, let's just speak about that. I wish. Really? Wow. Yeah, so I'm a Charlie Switch. Okay, but did you, let me just, I kind of loved Matt Gates' nomination of Donald Trump. Everybody loved that. What do you kind of love? That was even Marjorie was laughing. Well, but I'm just saying, no, no, no, but I'm saying, like, realistically, you get him a speaker of the house and then you run, like, that opens up the field for the presidency and we don't have to have this bickering back and forth of like, well, he deserves it, no one can run against him. He's just already speaker of the house and he gets to just completely taunt Nancy Pelosi. Like, that's perfect. I just have been, so yeah, this is coming from a person that was just invited to DeSantis' inauguration. So I wonder if you're, are you a little, we want to DeSantis presidency? I don't leave you guys know this. So accusations are falling now. She anti Trump now. We just busting our dollars on there. No, no, no, no, I love the brought that up because that's, I've heard that from people like, Oh, I can't believe you attended that backstabbers. I'm like, this was literally for the governorship of Florida. Yeah, like, that's all that this was. And what I was making it about something that it's not, he hasn't announced, he continues to not announce, like, I am supporting him being governor of Florida because he's the most based governor in the entire country and he has paved the way for, like, so much that other governors, including ours, have followed rather than actually leading. So, yeah, of course, I love the guy. Yeah, I agree. I mean, objectively, you cannot say that he did a bad job in Florida. Anybody that says that is insane. So not liking DeSantis because you like a candidate more. It's just, it's like the high school drama. He has red pilled, like, the entirety of Florida. No, so I love this. In Florida, but DeSantis is, if you don't like DeSantis because you like Trump, come on, look in the mirror. You got some really mental gymnastics you're going through that really don't make sense. Yeah, I just, I can't deal with the drama there. But so how does this, I guess perhaps McCarthy takes it today, but it has been fascinating to see these people continue. What were they called the Taliban 20, which was, I would say a little bit of an exaggeration. But you know, it's been interesting. It's been fascinating watching these people continue to hold out. A lot of them were saying, I don't care what you guys say. I'm never voting for the guy, but I, you know, I think a lot of them were using this as a negotiation tactic. And I think rightfully so, specifically Lauren Beaubert, who said, you know, we offered him a deal on border security and, you know, a couple other things. I can't remember them off the top of my head. And, and he didn't do it. He didn't agree to these things later on. They came back and said, okay, well, now he's starting to agree to it. So, I mean, perhaps they are getting what they wanted out of the deal, or at least most of them. I mean, there was always a large opposition to McCarthy being speaker. And they went through this process over the past couple of months to try to win a bunch of these people over. And they successfully got a bunch of them over. Then it came up to voting time. And McCarthy's last move right before the vote was to scream at them and swear at them and call them terrorists. And so you, they created, there's about 20 people in this group about, I don't know, I don't know, half of them, maybe less than half, were people who were just like, you just called me a terrorist. And I'm never going to vote for you because you're a bad person. Right? Right? Like that's where, you know, you could see that there's a split there. People like Chip Roy were kind of like focused on, hey, let's make this house run better, let's put some limitations on what the speaker can do. Let's make this thing run like it's supposed to, which seems like a really rational idea. And you know, radical, both, I guess, in this country. So he was, that group of people came over here over the past 24 hours. There's some sort of negotiation. There is a deal, they were examining it overnight. And a bunch of the people, even some of the people that were thought to be ungettable came over. And so I think they're down to seven people holding out. They can have four and he can still win the the the speakership. Though, it all depends too on like how many people are there to vote. Like Ken Buck wasn't there. So the number was a little bit lower. One Democrat, I think was not there as well. This was the first vote where McCarthy actually beat Jeffries. So the first time he was actually ahead of the Democrat after the Republicans got elected. So it's been a bizarre process. I don't think anybody is sitting here saying like, Oh, Kevin McCarthy's going to be gangbusters, going to be the greatest guy of all time. We're all going to think of him as an incredible speaker. The question is whether, you know, how long does this go on? And is there anyone else? You know, I mean, like they're talking about, okay, McCarthy goes away. He puts Scalise in there and he puts Stefanik in there. All right, I mean, it's not going to be that much different. You put in a conservative, you're not going to get the the moderates and the on the left side of the party, you put in some moderate, you're not going to get the conservatives, though you might get some Democrats. That seems even worse to me. So I don't know, I don't know where to go on this. This is, I think eventually he's going to get over this line. No, he's only got three more people he needs to win over. And he can probably bribe them into voting for him. Yeah, I mean, if they're already to the point where he's agreed to, that's what the report was that they've they lowered the threshold for them to vote for a no confidence, right? Like a motion to vacate for Speaker of the House lowered it all the way to five. And then they were like, no, that's not good enough. We want it to be one. And he was like, fine. So I mean, you can imagine like anything's on. Yeah, anything's on this. Well, obviously he wants it. But see, this is what I'm frustrated about is that these people that are holding out, I want them to continue to hold out because it leaves him with very few options. And one of those options is either getting a plurality vote, which he would lose to Kim Drefree so that he doesn't want to do that. And the other one would be actually working with the Democrats, which I would love because then we'd had evidence to show this is a uni party. They say, Oh, I'm a I'm a conservative. What? Yeah, you're going to give a billion trillion Guadalcan dollars to the Ukraine. It's like, I want somebody that cares about America and puts American citizens, American veterans, American children, Americans first. And McCarthy's not that guy. And so I think if they could just hold out a little longer and they put him in a position where he had to do that, that would wake up a lot of people, not that the people aren't awake, but the media, everybody, it would just who give this whole narrative that, okay, people say they're conservative, but really they're all part of the uni party. Yeah, I think the plurality situation that they can go for now, they have to get over 218 votes to get that rule change. But if they did it right now, as of right now McCarthy's, this is the first vote he was actually ahead of Jefferson. Oh, this one, he would have said he could theoretically win it. But then you could down to that line where he doesn't want to risk the chance of calling a plurality vote and then losing. And he could lose it because then you could see, could you see a situation where a couple of these never McCarthy people who are just like, you know what, screw you, I'm going Jefferson. Yeah, and then they and then that whole thing happens. It's possible. It was unlikely, but it's possible. Well, these people have egos that are the size of the, you know, good, you're a blimp and I'm a pimp on a blimp. So I wouldn't put it fast. I mean, they literally do not care about Americans, they care about themselves more. So in this other thing, is the backdoor dealing with McCarthy, oh, you know, don't primary these candidates don't do all this. It's just stuff that he should be doing already. They shouldn't have to be making backdoor deals with their own party in order to get his vote. So it's just a really screwed up system. It's really frustrating to see as Americans because it shows you how incompetent and how dysfunctional our federal government really is. Yeah, and it's just frustrating. I saw Rogan O'Hannley point this out on Twitter and I thought it was just such a great point that, you know, we continue to play this, I say we. I don't consider myself a member of the Republican Party anymore. So I shouldn't say we, but you see the mainstream Republican Party continue to be like, well, we have to put up someone who can work with the Democrats because I'm sorry. Did you not see Nancy Pelosi the last billion years? However long she was Speaker of the House, she impeached Trump twice over BS, you know, crap. And then she she's ripping up his State of the Union address when she's standing behind him for that viral moment. She's like, she didn't care what the other side thought of her. Why can we not agree that we need someone exactly like that? You have to fight fire with fire. I'm tired of people saying, well, we're the we have to be the moral ones. We can't stoop down to their level. Why the hell not? It doesn't matter if you're playing a game and one of you is playing by the rules and the other is not. Who wins? Right? Like if you can't continue to play by the rules when the other team has decided there are no rules. It makes it very difficult to have a fair game. I think what's interesting too is that look at the difference between the Democratic and Republican Party here. There's many differences. You just pointed out a great one. Another one is that the far left of the party on the Democrats could have done the same thing last time with the squad and a few more, right? They get universal health care as one of the ideas. It was one of the big ideas and they wind up not doing it. There's a couple reasons for that. Pelosi has some sort of mysterious power over them. But also like even though Nancy Pelosi didn't go as far left as they wanted, they knew in their hearts that she was dedicated to the generalized cause of moving this country far to the left. That is not what we have in the Republican Party. I do not have the opinion of Kevin McCarthy. Call him Andy every single time. Kevin McCarthy, his heart, his inertia, the current behind him is not to move it to the right of the party. It might be to move it less to the left than Nancy Pelosi. Sometimes you can't always tell that. But do I think that we would have lower taxes if Andy McCarthy was king rather than Nancy Pelosi? Sure. Yeah, I'm a McCarthy. Why? Andy, you jerk. You watched too much football. Yeah, I know. I've got like 10 different people named Andy McCarthy in my head and only one. Wait, is there? Wait, I'm thinking of Mike McCarthy. Mike McCarthy, you got that? You got that? Andy McCarthy isn't. I know this because I've screwed up so many times people like, are you calling him the 80s actor? No. I think the guy that's in my head is the the writer, the conservative writer Andy McCarthy. Okay. Okay. Whatever. The bottom line is now I'm going to mess with you. Yeah, I'm not. Kevin McCarthy. I'm going through all the McCarthy's in my head. Okay, go. So Kevin McCarthy, though, like we don't have that opinion of him. Like I, if we had someone who we believed was a little more moderate than us or maybe a little more open to some policies you don't like, but had a general idea of we need to have a smaller government and we need to take, you know, the federal government out of the business. Like Ron Paul, there's plenty of stuff I could find that I would have disagree with Ron Paul, I'm sure. But like, at least I know his overall intent is generally the same as mine. And that is not what we have with McCarthy, or really like most people that you could name in Congress. But let's let's applaud the Republican politicians are actually standing up for what they believe in, unlike the Democrat ones that wouldn't stand up for what they quote unquote believe in. Yeah. Okay, I want to get to this before we have to go to break. So I mentioned that there is a new contender for 2024. Well, drum roll, please. It is, of course, Donald Trump's ex national security advisor, John Bolton, the contender literally no one was asking for is now, except John Bolton has now announced he will join the race. I want to play a clip for you of John Bolton, making that announcement. And I want you to pay very close attention to which network he has chosen to make this announcement on watch. John Bolton has exclusively told good morning, he wants to become the next president of the United States. What would a John Bolton America look like if you were a commander in chief? I would get in to win the nomination and I would do it primarily on the basis that we need a much stronger foreign policy. I think Trump's support within the party itself is in terminal decline. What would you say to your critics who will obviously watch distinctive you and they will say, okay, listen, John, you simply don't have the experience. Well, I wouldn't run as a vanity candidate. If I didn't think I could run seriously, then I wouldn't get in the race. You know, John Bolton's PR team like blasted out that he was going to run to all of the mainstream media outlets in America. And they're like, we have a big announcement. John Bolton's going to announce, do you want the exclusive? And literally everyone in America was like, nah, you can just give it to Great Britain. That's fine. It was weird considering like the country exists because we exited Great Britain. Like that was the whole thing. It was the whole part. The whole plan of the country was to not be dependent on Great Britain anymore. I mean, look, Bolton has no chance of winning. I think we all know that. I mean, he's not an unserious person. Like he's he has plenty of experience to be president. He's getting cused. Yeah. He's got plenty of experience in the deep state. He has plenty of experience. I mean, all throughout government, I mean, he's obviously much more hawkish than the base of the party is at this point. I mean, he'd have I don't think he'd have much support at all. But I mean, he's not like just some random guy. He's been around for a long time, but there's not going to be any support for John Bolton. It would be a vanity candidate and he's wanted to run for a long time. Right. Right. Alex. Yeah. I mean, John Bolton, like I said, he said, January 6 was in a coup because I'm the expert and coups basically, you know, so I mean, this guy, I mean, yeah, he might be president if he can cheat and lie and steal. So I wouldn't put it past him. But yeah, his chance to become president is zero percent. That really was an amazing, amazing moment. Well, to say that literally said that publicly and didn't think anything of it. Well, just like, well, I had to say this, just like there's elections in Venezuela, now they seem to be happening in Harris County. It's like somehow somehow all the same systems and same back doors all seem to exist here in America. What were you going to say real quick? I was going to say, I read I read the book that Bolton put out, you know, a year or two ago, and he talks about all these things he was involved in. And quite the quite literal, easiest example was a very public one, which was Venezuela. Like, I mean, they, including Donald Trump, they were all very supportive of this. He was working with Trump at the time, and they were absolutely like in the middle of doing a public coup. But there were other examples in the book where he was, you know, he, look, he was deep in that world. The deep state gets overused, honestly, at times, but like with him, I mean, I mean, this is the guy. He was the one pulling these strings around the country in multiple administration around the world. Excuse me, in multiple administrations. Yeah. All right. We got to take a quick break. We will be back with more first one. I think our sponsor, my Patriot supply. So look, even the president has said, there are going to be food shortages. And a lot of you, if you're in New York, or, you know, there are some places I've been seeing pictures where they're just literally out of eggs. They're out there out of all of the food that you might need to feed your family. You don't want to get caught where you're just like, Oh, they're out of all of the food at the grocery store. And I have nothing here. I, you know, you guys want to call us preppers. Well, let me tell you, you're not coming to my house when all of the apocalypse happens. Okay. So you got to go to my Patriot supply right now, you will save $200 on a three month emergency food kit from my Patriot supply. They are America's largest preparedness company. You can go to preparewithnews.com stock up now. Wow, you can still save $200 per kid. It's going to be breakfast, lunch, dinner. It's going to make sure that it gives you 2000 calories per person so that you can have and keep that energy. You can go to preparewithnews.com for these kits. I'm just telling you, this is not the kind of thing that you want to sleep on because the whole point is to be prepared before something bad happens. Go do that at preparewithnews.com. That's how many of you noticed the date today. It is, of course, January 6th and that means it has been two years since all of the January 6th debacle happened at the White House in 2021. I think this is a story that often gets overlooked in a lot of places that there are still a lot of political prisoners. There are still a lot of people who I would say, non-violent people who are being held or are being harassed to put through the criminal justice system because of a political vendetta. I want to welcome to the program once again to discuss this with me, Joe McBride, of the McBride law firm who has represented a good amount of these January 6thers. Joe, thank you for being on, by the way, today. I know you're busy. I know you're a busy guy, so I value your time and I appreciate it, but you have just really led the way in bringing awareness and attention to what is happening to these January 6thers who are still, I guess, having their cases adjudicated, but oftentimes still in confinement in really horrendous conditions. What is your sense of, are these things close to being tied up yet? Do we still have a ton of people who are having the criminal justice system abuse them? Where are we in this process? Because it's been two years. Well, let me give you a little hint as to what the true answer to that question is. Yesterday I appeared in DC District Court in front of Judge Thomas Hogan. He is the most senior judge on the bench at 85 years old and he announced to us, surprisingly, that he was retiring from the bench and we were like, wow, you're a distinguished judge retiring from the bench, like what is going on. He didn't give us much, obviously. He doesn't have to. He simply needs to say that he's going, but he did say that he got word that there are another thousand of these cases coming and he just had no interest in doing that for the next four to five years. Because of that, his last day on the bench would be the 31st of January and that my case with Ryan Nichols would be transferred and it was transferred yesterday to Judge Royce Lambrith, who I've yet to meet. But another thousand are coming. So this is going nowhere. This is going to get worse. They are doubling and tripling down on this fight and people need to wake up. This is very, very serious. I've been saying this for two years that you could be next. They went from looking at people who were inside the Capitol to looking at people who were merely in DC that day. Now they're going after the entire community. I just, it's hard to imagine what kind of charges they want to put on these people. I want to get to the case, the trial that you have coming up next week, I believe. This is, of course, the infamous guy who put his feet on Nancy Pelosi's desk. Tell us about that case and what are the charges against him? So Richard Barnett is a 61 year old man from Arkansas with no criminal history of any kind. He showed up to the Capitol in January 6th to petition the government for redress and grievances. He was pushed, pushed into the east side of the Capitol, the Columbus doors. They will opened up from the inside. He was pushed in against his will. He had to use the bathroom and he started looking for a bathroom when he was inside. He wound up in Speaker Pelosi's office. Two journalists from the French Associated Press said, hey, why don't you sit down and take a picture? He took a picture and the rest is history. He has become one of the faces of the quote unquote insurrection, which is obviously a misnomer. This should have been wrapped up with a misdemeanor trespass plea at best. Instead, they have turned this into, you know, the prosecution of Osama bin Laden. It's absolutely ridiculous. We had been operating under one set of charges until recently, but then the government probably realized that we were about to beat them on the original indictment. And about 10 days ago, they indicted him. They superseded his indictment, adding a civil disorder felony charge, complicating the entire case for us despite no change. In fact, it's completely unfair. It's completely against the rules. We filed a motion saying, hey, this is unfair. We at needs at the very least need more time to gather ourselves here. Court really didn't care. We're going the trial on Monday. I put a great team together. It's led by myself, Attorney Johnson Gross, Brad Geyer, Carolyn Stewart. We're going to go in there and we're going to do great work under very unfair circumstances and under incredible odds. But we have no choice. We signed up for this. We were glad to stand in the gap for him and to stand on the rights out of history. And we're going to do our absolute best to get him justice in his very unfair situation. Yeah, it's really hard to understand, Joe, why more Republicans are not speaking out about this. I mean, it really, truly is like, this has been going on for these people for literally two years. They have been thrown into this and this has been their entire life. And it's like, as soon as it happened, all the Republicans were just magically, it's like they got the little men in black light. They just completely forgot that it ever happened. I mean, including sometimes, I hate to say it, but including Donald Trump. Where are the Republicans on this? Why are they not talking about this? Some of them are, the most of them aren't. You make a very good point. Look, I'm a Brooklyn guy. I grew up with a bunch of different gangster movies that I loved. There's one in particular called the Bronx Tale. And there's a moment in the movie where, where C, the young guy, he's talking about how Mickey Mantle is his hero. And the son, he says to him, said, Hey, kid, Mickey Mantle is never going to pay your rent. And the little boy learned in that moment, wow, this is my idol. But my idol doesn't care about me. He doesn't even know my name. Mickey Mantle has never gone to pay my rent. I got to go out there and I got to do it for myself. And that's my reference for these Republicans in Congress. They run on this issue of being heroic. They run on this issue of being men or women of the people. But when the rubber meets the road, they tuck tail and run. So what we can do is primary them and vote them out. We have some very good America first Republicans who have come in. We obviously have some who have been there for quite a while who are fighting. I hear based on negotiations and discussions that representative Gosar is one of the most outspoken voices in these negotiations right now. And you have a couple other good people there. But by and large, the Republicans have done a whole lot of nothing. And they should be held fully accountable. These people are not our friends. People who have spent their entire life in government, they're about their friends and their social circles. They don't care about the people back home. That's why there should be term limits. This is why there should be a full investigation into January 6th. Any Republican that doesn't vociferously speak out in favor of an investigation into January 6th should not be in Congress anymore. We got to get rid of them. We got to route them out because what they're doing is straight up cowardice. It's un-American and it's wrong. I can't agree with you more. So Joe, one last question for you. I would imagine that a lot of these I mean these people, they're just regular Americans. They don't have the money to just drown themselves in legal bills. How are they paying for all of this? That's a great question, Sarah. And I appreciate you asking it. These are your paycheck to paycheck. Middle American, blue collar Americans with no savings. They've never taken a free dime from the government, but they've never been able to save and dime for themselves. As a result, they have not been able to finance these cases. We have taken these cases on with the hope that the American people would contribute. We have gifts and goes for each of these people. And there's also a global gifts and go on my website, McBrideLawNYC.com. You can go there and look for the J6 tab. And there you can donate. Just go to the global one and just donate. All that money right now is going to Richard Barnett's trial because that's where it's needed most. But we have had to crowd fund and crowd source this stuff. And just for some perspective, Richard Barnett's original gifts and go had like $300,000 in it. They took it, they hijacked it, they shut it down, they sent all the money back to his people. And he was never raised. We haven't even raised $20,000 in this case. But we could, he was my first January 6 case that I took, Google, social media, all the platforms that made it impossible to raise money in his case. But we are going to defend him as if we had a million dollar budget, because that's who he deserves. We're going to defend him as if he were my own father, because that is what you're called to do as an attorney. But if people are inclined to give, you can go to my website, you can give there. And if you can't give, please support us with your prayers because we need them badly. Yeah, well, I just can't tell you again how much we appreciate all of the work that you guys are doing. You know, you and obviously Alex and I, Alex Stein is here. Alex and I personally know John Gross as well. And you guys are just like, you know, the goal are the dynamic duo over there. So we appreciate it very much. And keep keep us posted on how everything's going. We'll do a God bless you guys and God bless America. Thank you, Joe. All right, we've got to take a quick break. But first we want to thank our sponsor upside. So inflation has us all thinking about different ways to cut back, you know, maybe you're driving less, maybe you're dining out less, maybe you're buying less from the grocery store. Maybe it's because there's no food there. I don't know. But we can all agree. There's nothing fun about less. That is why you need to use upside. It's a really, really great app for anyone who, oh, does things like buy gas, buy groceries, dying out, which is literally everyone. And you don't have to cut back because you're getting cash back on every purchase. It's very, very easy. You just go to your phone, download the free upside app. And if you use my promo code news, you'll get $5 or more cash back on your first purchase of $10 or more. You can claim an offer for whatever you're buying on upside. You go to your app, you check in at the business, you pay as usual with whatever you your credit card, whatever, and you will get paid. And by the way, in comparison to credit card rewards or loyalty programs, you can earn three times more cash back with upside upside users are earning more than a million dollars every week. That's probably why they have such a high rating on the app store. You got to go there, download the app, and use promo code news to get $5 or more cash back on your first purchase of $10 or more. That is $5 or more cash back on your first purchase of $10 or more using promo code news. Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen. But when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. I want to go back to a story that I think broke during the break. But I think it's a very important one that we haven't discussed yet. Well, since the break, but this is a story that we've been talking about for years, which is Jeff Younger, the Jeff Younger case here in Texas who, for those of you who don't know, you're probably familiar with the story. Maybe you don't recognize the name, but he has been in this very, very long years long battle with his ex-wife against transitioning his young son, James. So they went through a long divorce process. The ex-wife is a pediatrician. And there's video documentation of the little boy at what three, four years old. Saying that, you know, mommy tells me that I'm a girl. And so there's just been this battle and he took it to the Supreme Court here in Texas. And the Texas Supreme Court has ruled against his appeal to prevent his ex-wife from moving his son, James, to California, where, of course, he is concerned that he will, she will have access to whatever she wants to mutilate over in California as a child. Excuse me. And it's just been really difficult to understand all of the rulings in this particular case other than the judges just must be a giant liberal. Because I understand, and I know Glenn talked to Jeff on one of his specials recently. And I know you're familiar with the case, Alex, as well. And I think, you know, perhaps I'm not saying this could be the case, but I do know that, the judge put Jeff under a gag order. He's not supposed to talk about it. So, you might say, like, well, he didn't follow the rules. And so she's upset at him. But I would argue too that putting him under the gag order is completely unprecedented. And how else do you fight back and speak out against it if you're literally not allowed to talk about this crazy thing that's happening to your son? But she was able to get this decision. And now she is going to move the boys to California where God knows what's going to happen to them. But it's just really sad to see happening in Texas. Yeah, it's obviously completely insane. We live in such weird times. I mean, you know, we've been doing the show with Glenn for long enough now, where like, I can remember us dreaming up crazy scenarios to mock the current thing happening, whatever the cultural bend was at the time. And so many of the things we came up with this comedy bits have come true. You know, things like this were supposed to be completely insane where you could just say with words and you say certain words and change someone's gender by just saying they're a girl, they're a girl. That's obviously crazy, right? Like, and I mean that like in the clinical sense, like it is obviously crazy to believe that that could be true. And yet our, you know, half of our society has decided it is. How do you push back against that? I mean, you know, it's one thing when someone leaves the state, right? It's sometimes difficult, you know, for one state to essentially overrule another state. But you know, the fact that like these things happen, even in red states, like Texas, is shocking, shocking. Now, of course, there are liberal judges in Texas. There's no doubt about it. You go to certain, you go to cities, you'll find out. Dallas County, man. Exactly. There's tons of them here. It's a red state overall, but there's plenty of pockets of blue in it. And that may just be what we found here. But it's just a shocking thing because if you can't come up with a basic understanding of truth with you and your fellow man, you cannot operate a civilization. Like, you can't, it doesn't mean we have to agree on everything. But like the fact that like a boy is a boy and a girl is a girl is pretty foundational to the human experience. And we can't even agree on that anymore. Well, actually, I'm going to go a little less controversial. Okay. We shouldn't be chopping off body parts of, I would say anyone, but children, right? Like, we should not be cutting off children's breasts. You would think you would think, right? It's a very general statement. But I think it's can be that general, that children under 18 should not have any sort of surgery that would, you know, cause them to have some sort of problems later on in life, whether they change their mind or whether they decide to keep their, you know, transition. But the Jeff Younger case, this is really what scares me. You know, I've always, you know, I've met Jeff. I like Jeff. I consider Jeff a friend of mine. But this is the problem for me that really scares me is that because it was such a public court case, because it was such a public battle. And because we know the system is rigged against us, the system took his kid away because he fought against the system. So for me, it black pills me. It's like, Oh my gosh, we fight against the system. They're literally going to take your kid, change its, change his sex, move them to a different state. And you literally have no legal recourse over your own biological son. So for me, it's like this black pill. Like this is, like you said, this is the dystopian future. And we're in it. It's kind of like, this doesn't even seem real. And then I also kind of look at this problem. And I'm like, I'm sure there's some, you know, liberal places in Europe. But this is like an American problem. We are the leader in, you know, transitioning children. So we need to stop this guys. Or this is, this might be the Jeff Younger of America. But there's going to be a trillion Jeff Youngers in other countries. I mean, I hope not that many. But guys, I just hope this isn't the start of we see another high profile case where a guy loses custody of his son that he doesn't want to transition. But the mom does. And it's just this huge and same fight where it divides us between left and right. And at the end of the day, the kid loses. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, it is, it does give, look, I have this conversation a lot with, you know, with the audience and just with people out there on social media that it's frustrating for me when I go to all of these events and I get the footage that I get that I don't see, like, I'm like, where are the dad making a big stink about this, right? Where are the dads of the community standing up and speaking out? And this gut does give credence to a lot of the defense that I hear, which is, what are they going to do? Because they fight with their wives, they get divorced, and then their wives are going to trans their kids and, and leave them, right? They trans them sometimes you get back at the dad. That's what I'm saying. Like, then they're just going to do it because they're going to be spiteful. And that's how women are. And you know, it's like, I, I'm not like, and this is in every shirt. It's like, oh no, but this is real. You know, I'm saying we cover this. This is real. You'll often see it's a single mom that is oftentimes transitioning their boy to a female or vice versa. It's almost like a pet. It's insane. And I've seen it touching and feeling. I can see it with my hands that this is real. This isn't just some right-wing conspiracy. So for me, it is very scary. And it's just paints a picture of the future that I don't like to see. Right. Good to go back to your point. You made about how the kids are the ones losing here. I mean, it was really true. And you talked about the show Glenda with Jeff Younger. He also did a recent podcast with a girl named Chloe. Chloe Cola. She's been on the show. She said to me 14 now. I mean, you saw the damage. I don't know how, you know, if everyone in the audience is familiar with it, but like she went through a transition. She was encouraged to do it really at the behest of doctors, even more than her parents, and wound up, of course, regretting it later on and detransitioning. And now she's suffering in a body that has been mutilated. Really, you know, obviously against her will. We talk about this with like people who, you know, who the statutory rape charges are against someone. And we say appropriately, well, they can't consent. Whether they consent it or not, they can't consent because they're too young to consent. That is the situation with so many of these stories. Yeah, they might go along with it at that time. But then they were when they were great later on, it's not their fault for making the wrong decision at 12. Right. It's the fault of sometimes the parents, sometimes medical authorities, sometimes judges, whatever the case is, this has got to stop. And I think the only way it does stop are massive lawsuits, massive lawsuits that go after these institutions and terrify them from teaching this stuff and performing these surgeries. I just want to make this quick point. Really quick. Okay, just real quick. Ginger dysphoria is a mental health issue. You're not going to fix it by cutting off anybody part. Yeah. So until we go off to the mental health issue, it's just going to continue to get back. Amen. All right. We got to take another quick break. First one, I think our sponsor, Chamonix. So look, it's a new year. We got some New Year's resolutions. Maybe your New Year resolution is to, I don't know, look a little younger. Or is that just me? No, we all want to look younger. Come on.

I want to kind of go back to the same topic here, but just a different angle. So there's a new Dutch investigative report that has revealed that the 2006 study upon which like this entire medical experiment that we're doing to our children, giving them puberty blockers and all of these things was, oh, it was just funded by a maker of puberty blockers, which will come as no surprise to those of you who have already been jaded by the medical community as I have for very, very, very many years. But I think it's important that the public realize that like, okay, let me just give you this one. So this, this is an article that was just published, the investigation that I mentioned. It's talking about the Dutch protocol, which involves blocking the puberty of adolescents who are suffering from gender dysphoria and forms, it forms the basis for gender affirming care for the model that has been adopted by pediatric gender clinics all over the world. And it was funded by Faring Pharmaceuticals, the company that makes the drug Trypto Reeland as a puberty blocker. And the research is, it's very, very shaky. And you know, it's been discredited numerous times due to a lack of control. So it was never a good study to begin with. But I think it's very important to take a step back and realize that this is not just a Dutch problem. Like this is happening, I would argue in America more than, than, you know, the Dutch that like, you got to look at who is funding these studies that the government will tout as, you know, well, look, we, gosh, I want to say something and I won't because I'm going to get us banned from YouTube. But I'm just saying, oftentimes the government is in bed with big pharma and you know, the government is funding these studies. But even when the government is doing it, you got to look at what their angle is. Because if they want a certain outcome, they will achieve a certain outcome. Just go watch the movie, the movie Vax. I'll just put it that way. Are you shocked too, that the, that the company that stung makes puberty blockers funded the study that shows that we should be giving children puberty blockers? It's very bizarre. Who could have seen it? Who could have seen it coming? I even take offense to the term gender affirming care. If you have a kid that is born a boy and you tell it, it is a boy that is affirming the gender. That's affirming. Yeah. Telling it, it is a girl is the opposite of affirming their gender. We need to get these terms straight, first of all. Yeah, I totally agree. Yeah. I mean, and I just look at the situation that's, you know, happening in the Dutch when you look at these studies, they're all rigged in some sort of way. And we look at these prestigious universities like Harvard and Stanford and any study that comes out of there, we're like, Oh, you know, this is the truth. This is, it's so black and white, whatever they say. But at the end of the day, these studies can be rigged just like any election, just like anything else in the world. So for me, if you quote a study, I basically, you know, I don't even take that as credit. If somebody, you know, like in the debate, I'm off the debate. Oh, well, this study says this. I don't believe any of these studies because the same people that are putting on these studies are the ones that are selling you the drugs that in these studies say the drug is good for you. Right. Yeah. Well, when you allow them to study themselves, I mean, you see what happens like with Pfizer, they're like, Oh, we'll take 75 years to get back to you with that data. And it's 100% and not spreading. You know, I think the early data was that it was 100% not going to get COVID when the vaccine first came out from their own data. That was one of the statistics that I believe he did say 100%. Yeah. I can't remember what it was for. Was it transmission? Either transmission or yeah, I guess it was transmission. But regardless, these guys can lie because they're the ones that are cooking the books and then when it comes to the pharmaceutical industry, I'd like somebody to freaking police the FBI or police our own police force. But oftentimes it's all crooked and it's all rigged. Yeah, last words Joe, we got 10 seconds. I mean, look, you should be able to make your own choices, right? And it's like, they went, this is the what they're doing now is banning people from social media and getting people fired for their jobs for these reasons. You know, like, it's scary and the kids are the victims. Yeah. Amen. All right, we got to take a quick break. We'll be back. I've been having like this. Philosophical. Weird. We've only got about a minute and a half left, but I just wanted to let everyone know new comic book lovers is too bad. Eric July's not here to speak on this. DC Comics has a, they have a new storyline with a pregnant Joker character, but it's a, it's a guy. So, it's just, I love the comic too. It's like, Hey, what's happening here? I guess I think you're pregnant. You're right. Like, whoa, this is not as far as I know, Sarah, you would know, does this how women find out? No, they just have that eight months and then just like, what's going on? No, no, he do he looks like he just had like a really long night at Taco Bell. Yeah, like, I looked like that before. I'm pretty sure it wasn't pregnant. I will say, by the way, sir, we have Eric July on Stu does America tonight. Great. Comment on this very story. So, wow, well, he stood me up to do. You had all that you got the famous lawyers on right now. I got Eric. I mean, we all have to have somebody on. I can't wait to hear what he has to say about this. I bet he lost his mind. Oh my God. I mean, he's also like, I'm going to be a billionaire because everyone's going to come by my comments. That's true. That's true. But I have to counter signal you guys because anybody in the world can be trans and have a baby. It's the Joker. I mean, come on. I mean, I'm just saying. I'm just saying the guy's insane. You know, they're coming of any converse makeup. Yeah, he's in makeup. He's already kind of trans. So you know what, on the side, I love the Joker. I hate to get a term like favorite villain into a trans person having a baby. But if you're going to do it to anybody, just let's let's keep super mainstream. This would be a nice time to remind you guys, rip a first comics. This is where we want to go. We'll see you guys on Monday."
