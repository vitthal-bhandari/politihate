    "text": " Guys, it pains me to say it. It really does. But I have to say it because it's, it's just, it's true and it's important. There are people out there, activists who are determined to groom your children to embrace a dangerous and hedonistic lifestyle because it furthers their own ideology. They are more than willing. They're happy to throw your children and their wellbeing under the bus. If it means that their agenda is furthered. And I am, of course, talking about the LGBT agenda here. We have this very shocking story out of Colorado where these teachers were actually secretly grooming students into embracing transgenderism to the point where one student actually tried to unalive herself. Let's just say in the interests of remaining advertiser friendly, but this comes to us from the Daily Mail. Parents are suing over claims teachers, encourage their sixth-grade daughters to join LGBTQ club. But to keep it a secret, girls were told if they are not happy in their bodies, they are transgender. Here's the thing. There is absolutely no reason why a school should have an LGBTQ club in the first place, but not only do these clubs exist, but they're actually being held in secret with parents actively being sidelined in their own children's development because these teachers, they're activists and they think they know better than you, they know better than you parents about what's best for your children. And not only are they not telling parents everything they should be, but now they're actually encouraging children to lie to their own parents. It's shocking stuff. It's nothing short of grooming behavior. Let's be clear. But let's jump into the article. Two Colorado families are suing their children's school district. The America First Policy Institute and Illuminae Legal filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against Poudre School District on behalf of Jonathan and Aaron Lee and Nick and Linnea Jerick. Sorry if I'm saying that wrong. These sixth-grade daughters attended Wellington Middle High School according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by The Daily Caller. It says the activities of the Gay Street Alliance or GSA were not known to the parents and those who headed the club's meetings actively encouraged students to keep talks about polyamory. Purity blockers, transgenderism, gender identity, sexuality, suicide, and name and pronoun changes a secret from their parents. I want to be clear. There was absolutely no reason why discussions on polyamory, transness, period blockers, any of that stuff should be at a school. It's okay. It's totally inappropriate and I'm tired of pretending that it's not and that this is just a normal thing to do. It's not. Remember back in the old days when students went to learn math and history and reading? Well, now, not only are they no longer learning math and history and reading. And we know that for sure based on the test scores that are coming out of these schools, but instead they've replaced those topics with things like here's how to trans a five-year-old. It's insane. Okay. The public school system, as we know it, frankly, it deserves to go. Okay. This is exactly why school choice is so important. If you're not able to homeschool, which would be preferable, then you have to know that sending your kids to these public schools, you can be the most conservative Godfearing family on earth. But if your child is spending what nine to three or eight to three every single day surrounded by these leftist activists, you can bet your bottom dollar. They are absorbing the things that they are being taught. It's just natural. Children are impressionable. And one of the biggest mistakes the right ever made was surrendering the education system to the left. We see exactly now the fruits of just the evilness that's going on in these schools. And to anyone out there who might say, oh, no, there's nothing wrong with this. They're just trying to teach children to be more accepting. Okay. You can teach children to be accepting without teaching them about hormone blockers. And I mean, it's pretty clear here that no, there was an active attempt by these teachers to convince these girls they were trans. It's bizarre. It says substitute teacher Kimberly Chambers, who is the executive director of the supporting pride, learning and social happenings organization, reportedly told the children that if they are not completely comfortable in their bodies, that means that they are transgender. The teacher also had children discuss what gender and sex they are attracted to and gave students LGBTQ paraphernalia such as toys, flags and other swag, if they quote, came out as transgender. Now, I have a lot to say about that. And I mean, a lot. But first, I do want to say a big thank you to today's sponsor, Boogs. Let's face it, guys. Moms go through a lot. And there are so many things they do for us every single day that they never get properly thanked for. This year, I know I at least am not letting Mother's Day slip by. No, I'm thinking my mom with farm fresh flowers from Boogs. That's short for bouquets. And what's really cool is that I've also got you guys 20% off. So you could think your mom's as well, because sure, you can give your mom regular Mother's Day flowers or you can make her day spectacular one of a kind with flowers from Boogs. And here is what I love so much about them. Number one, Boogs is different. Their flowers are sourced directly from the best farms and cut fresh so they last way, way longer. And they even have flowers get this grown on the side of a volcano. Second thing I love about Boogs is that they offer a huge selection of unique designs you'll never find on those other sites. So pick her fave tulips or lilies or send a bright and beautiful bouquet to make up for those gray hairs. You probably gave her. And by the way, in case you guys weren't keeping track, this year Mother's Day is May 14th. That is this Sunday. So order your books now. And while you're there, check out their flower subscription. So mom feels your love all year long. And what I love so much about Boogs is that for people who maybe don't live right by their moms, which I know applies to a lot of us, this is a way to let her know. She is still being thought of. She is still appreciated, even though there may be distance between you. What are you waiting for? Go online and send your mom some flowers. Help make her Mother's Day feel special. Help her feel thanked. Go to boots.com and use promo code Lauren for 20% off. That is B-O-U-Q-S. .com with a promo code Lauren. And a big thank you to Boogs for sponsoring this video. Now, concerning this teacher, I'm not going to mince words here. Telling a sixth grader that if you're not comfortable in your body, that means you're trans, that's evil. That is an evil thing to do. If there's been one constant throughout time, really, it's that teenagers, preteens, they are awkward. They are uncomfortable. They are going through changes in their body. So of course, it's natural. It's normal, I would even say. For there to be a level of discomfort with that. That is not new. And unfortunately, when I was younger, instead of this trans craze, there was something that was also harmful. It was anorexia and bulimio. These young girls were uncomfortable in their bodies. And so that dysmorphia manifested with trying to under eat or binge and purge. Now it's chopping off your breasts in top surgery. But no, this is evil. And I think this teacher likely knows exactly what she's doing. There is no way you can be a teacher and educate her and spend so much time around these children. And honestly, think that anytime a child is uncomfortable in their bodies, it means that they are trans. This is so, so gross. And to have this position of power and authority over these kids and use it to really undermine their well-being, it's disgusting. I hope this teacher gets what's coming to her in a just world. She would be thrown in prison. And never mind the fact that it also seems like she's actually trying to essentially bribe these kids to come out as trans. So not only are you just putting seeds of doubt in their minds, they might think, oh, well, I'm not totally happy. My body, maybe I am trans, but she's also giving them toys and flags. If they come out as trans, how can you not see that as grooming? And really even the idea that there was a special club for LGBT identities, that is grooming in and of itself. When kids are younger, they're looking for a community. They're looking to belong. They're looking for attention, especially, you know, from teachers. So the fact that there's the special club where you can go to and you get extra attention from your teachers and maybe toys and prizes. Yes, of course, that is going to encourage more transness. I also just think it's inappropriate, full stop to discuss with a child what gender and sex they are attracted to. I mean, it's one thing, and I would say still inappropriate to discuss in the abstract what it means to be straight or gay with a sixth grader, but to actually go up to a sixth grader and say, hey, little Sally, are you sexually attracted to boys or girls? Like that is, how can you not know that you are the bad guy in this situation? Oh my goodness, there needs to be if a Republican gets in the White House, there needs to be a nationwide, don't say gay bill implemented. And yeah, I'll call it with the left wrongfully calls it, but you know, I'm at the point now, where I would support a don't say a literal, don't say gay bill because these people need to learn that you can't shove your ideology down these people's throats, these children's throats and not expect there to be any blowback. As frustrating as the story is already, it gets even darker because you see, this teacher also told students that there was a quote, higher likelihood of suicide by trans youth, but the Lee family said that their daughter did not even fully understand what suicide was at the time. And of course, because Chambers is ultimately a groomer, she repeatedly told students it quote, might not be safe to tell their parents what happened at the GSA meeting or to talk about transgender issues and instead suggest that they speak with her or other teachers. She also offered students her phone number and told them to connect with her on Discord so they could contact her at any time. Red flags, red flags. Okay, if you are a teacher or someone like a babysitter and Annie and you're actively trying to so distrust between a child and their parent, you're encouraging keeping secrets, you're you're doing the wrong thing here. This is not healthy behavior. And yes, this did all ultimately have real negative consequences. This caused harm to the girls that were involved. It says that the Lee's were excited initially that their shy daughter was asked to get involved in school activities because she had not been given many opportunities to make friends, but they were then alarmed to find out that upon returning home from the meeting, she told them she would be transitioning despite never having had any thoughts about transgenderism before the meeting. Their daughter, thank goodness, has since said that she no longer desires to transition, but endured a quote, months long emotional decline of gender and sexuality confusion that required counseling and included suicidal thoughts according to the lawsuit. Once more, these people are evil. They are confusing students, poor, innocent children because they're trying to validate their own gross and degenerate ideology. And as bad as that little girl scenario was, it gets even worse for this other child. You see, the jerk family is suing because their daughter was subject to a lot of the same treatment as the Lee's daughter. But in addition, our teacher Jenna Rep who was the school sponsor of the GSA encouraged secrecy, confidentiality and suspicion about whether her parents could be trusted with these discussions. And following a GSA meeting, their daughter began to have her first suicidal thoughts and started leaving notes for her parents about transgenderism and stated that she was aromantic and asexual, leading to the fact that in the fall of 2021, she started to question her gender identity. And this here is the tragic kicker she eventually quote attempted to take her own life by drinking bleach and has since verbalized that her disturbed emotional state began when she attended GSA at WMS. There you have it, these people are groomers. They almost were responsible for a little girl taking her life because she was so confused by the information that they were feeding her. This is all information that no, not only should adults be wary of, but I mean a child we can only imagine how confusing this all must be for them. And you know what, I hope both of these families get a huge payout from the school board or the county, whoever it is specifically that they're suing, and I will reiterate that any GSA teachers they would be thrown in prison. This is emotional and mental abuse. This is grooming behavior full stop and sadly this is happening in schools all over America. If you guys aren't following Libs of TikTok yet you really need to because she does an amazing job illustrating how common it is for these teachers to actually simply be activists. I mean this is an art teacher in one of these instances that was leading the GSA club. I mean why is an art teacher trying to meddle in the private lives of her students? It doesn't make sense. Look if you're a teacher, I hope you care for your students, but understand that they are not your children, okay? Teachers are not parents and parents should not have to co-parent with the state or with activists lunies that are trying to trans their kids. So parents, be aware of what your kid is learning in school, be aware of what they are watching on social media, be aware of what their friends are talking about. I know, I know some of you might think that I'm sounding overbearing, but this is a real threat here. You could be the best parent on the face of the earth, but if you send your little kids to the lions then every single day, don't be surprised when something like this happens. It's just it's far too common nowadays. That's basically all I have to say for now though. And as always, if you enjoyed this video, please be sure to like, share and subscribe until next time."
