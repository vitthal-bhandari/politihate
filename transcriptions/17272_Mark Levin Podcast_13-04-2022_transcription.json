    "text": " Ladies and gentlemen, the following segment of the podcast is presented exclusively by Hillsdale College. For over 175 years, four purposes have defined Hillsdale's mission, learning character, faith, and freedom. Thank you for listening and my sincere appreciation to our brothers and sisters at Hillsdale for their great sponsorship. He's here. He's here. Now broadcasting from the underground command post deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, we've once again made contact with our leader, Mark Lovehan. Hello America. Mark Lovehan here, our number eight seven 3813 817 7313 817 3813 813 11. Well, they were having a sale, Mr. Producer on Stents, you know, the stents that go into the arteries. So I went into one of the hospitals and I got another stent. But everything's great. And I want to thank you folks for inquiring. All right, look, if we can't keep the biggest city in the nation safe, the biggest financial center in the world safe. What was once the biggest tourist center in the world safe, then we're failing as a civil society. This attack on the New York subway is an attack on all of us. Many of you listening have never been on a subway or you avoid subways. Well, people are avoiding subways because they're not safe anymore and because they stink from human feces and urine and so forth and they're rat infested. And yet if people want us to take mass transit, this needs to be fixed, but it's not going to be fixed as long as criminals are on the street, as long as we have liberal judges letting them out the back door. These are violent people. Now, I don't know who this guy is five feet, five inches tall, about 180 pounds. African American sounds like a slob. But conditions are such that at least for now, maybe there's more than one person, but at least for now, one guy, can he lewd all authorities, get on the subway, unleash these canisters, these gas canisters, wearing a gas mask. He's carrying a bag that has gasoline, smoke bombs and other things in it. He unloads his pistol or his weapon, which jams, thank God, 10 people are actually shot five in critical condition. We hear none of them life threatening, but simply could have been, that's luck. 18 others injured in one way or another. The crime in the New York subway is up 68% year to year. Now, they have an image of the guy apparently from somebody with a phone. But now the news is as of now that none of the video was working. You know, you see the video cameras in the ceilings and so forth and various subway stations, we have them in Washington and so they weren't working. None of them. So there was a systemic failure. On the other hand, who was there to moments, no moments notice? The NYPD, the FDNY. The NYPD, always the point of the spear, always there first, always there where there's smoke, where there's gunfire, where there's bomb threats, where there's mayhem. The same NYPD, less than two years ago that was brutalized by the media, brutalized by the Democrat party, brutalized by that former mayor in that city council, the defund movement. You don't hear a word now about systemic racism in the NYPD, do you? Not a word. The people of New York, the people of New York state, the people of the country rely on this police department. And this police department will get to the bottom of this because it's made a professional men and women, not racists, who put their lives on the line every damn day. Same with the fire department, right on the scene. And quite frankly, same with the MTA. There they were. Moving the wound at the casualties onto another train to get them to a hospital as fast as they could. This is a fantastic country. New York is a fantastic city, but you cannot allow violent criminals to be recidivists with these quack judges and these quack laws and these quack politicians. Now the president of the United States says federal authorities will get to the bottom of this. You know, they'll leave no leaf of unturned, no rock unturned and all the rest of it. All of a sudden everybody supports the cops, but they don't support the cops. That's why we're in the position we're in today. That's why people are moving in Moss out of New York City and it's five boroughs to other places. Like Florida, like Texas, like Tennessee, like other states, they just had enough. The taxes are through the roof. Where are they all going? Then the masks, the moron governor in New Jersey across the river there. Yes, I think second graders should learn about different sexes and so forth. And he's having second thoughts because parents, regardless of party, regardless of background, have had enough of this crap. They've had enough. And the same day this is going on in New York City, the lieutenant governor's arrested for financial embezzlement, criminal activity. He's arrested, just resigned. The governor of New York hasn't even been elected because the former governor had to resign under pressure because of his misconduct and unethical behavior. The American people deserve better than this. Now here are the facts for those of you who may not know, although it's been on television and radio. The New York City subway shooters Philadelphia rented U-Haul, is found abandoned on Brooklyn Highway five miles from where he shot 10 strap hangers, gumman dumped gun, three extended round magazines and a bag of smoke bombs at the train station. He opened fire in a northbound end train at 824 a.m. as it pulled into the 36th Street station. He'd been calmly sitting on the train as the Daily Mail reports, but then put on a gas mess and detonated a smoke bomb. Passengers were trapped in the subway car. They tried to get to the next car, but the door was locked. When the train arrived at 36th Street, injured victims spilled out onto the platform trailing blood. The gunman described as a heavy set black five foot five inch individual and wearing a vest fled and remains at large. There's a massive manhunt underway. NYPD officials have told to look for the U-Haul van with the plate AL-3148. Well, they found it. His 380 automatic handgun jammed, which stopped him from shooting more at the station. A bag of Falcon Rising Firework, seismic wave smoke canisters and three extended magazines were found. The NYPD is doubling the number of police officers on the subway tonight. They'll find the guy. I have complete faith in the NYPD. They'll find the guy. And they've located the U-Haul. Sebastian Reyes, U-Haul Vice President of Communications, said law enforcement alerted us to its search for a rental van and its possible connection to a suspect in today's incident in New York City. Well, they already have. No security cameras were operational. That is shocking. To be perfectly honest, that is a Pauling. Now, it says here that he may have jumped onto one of the other trains at the station or fled into the subway tunnel. It's been a frightening spike in crime across the city, particularly in the subway, where crimes are up by more than 60% from last year. And as I say, ABC reports a the police have obtained a photo of the suspect from a bystanders phone, but the image has not yet been released anywhere. NYPD units are scouring the city's empty subway tunnels to find the suspect. And a city alert has been issued. The FBI and others have been going door to door in the area. It's a long excuse me. It's a very large area. As a matter of fact. Is it terrorism? The mayor hasn't ruled it out. They haven't ruled it in as they gather information. This is what we know. The Daily Mail has very extensive photographs, if you wish to check it online. And the New York Post has done outstanding coverage too, if you want to check that. One witness said I thought he was an MTA worker at first because I was like, I didn't like pay much attention. He's got on orange. The smoke bomb and what I thought were fireworks. I'm hearing it was gunshots. I have no words for what I could see. I was in the car. I was in the front end of the third car. Everything happened at the back end. People started migrating to the front of the car. I don't know if people know this. It's one of those old things where they locked the door to stop people traveling between trains. There were people in the other car who saw it was happening and they tried to open it, but they couldn't. And there was blood on the floor. And I'll tell you another thing that's happening. This is where decent people begin to unite and pull together. And that's now what you're seeing in New York City. But I do want to mention again, this is an example why the war on cops is so destructive to society, to the civil society. And the NYPD that was honored after 9-11 and honored for so many horrific events that it was involved in stopping and dealing with afterwards. This is why so many of them, so many of us defended them when Black Lives Matter, which is a corrupt organization, stealing millions from people, did what they did and said what they said. The NYPD's own an apology. These liberal judges need to be removed. These phony bail laws in the front door, out the back door need to be repealed. And if the people don't do it, it's not going to be done. It's what elections are all about. I'll be right back. New York City Police Commissioner. Here's what she said today. Cut one go. Just before 824 this morning, as a Manhattan bound N train waited to enter the 36th Street Station, an individual on that train donned what appeared to be a gas mask. He then took a canister out of his bag and opened it. The train at that time began to fill with smoke. He then opened fire tracking multiple people on the subway and in the platform. Again, we will describe him as an individual. He is being recorded as a male black approximately five feet five inches tall with a heavy bill. He was wearing a green construction type vest and a hooded sweatshirt. The color is gray. See, the word is out of New York as in most of our cities now. The word is out. Everybody may not get away with a heinous crime, but many will and they'll have the politicians backing them because they trash the cops. Here's Eric Adams. He has COVID, but he called into a radio station. Cut three. He's the mayor. Go. And we know we're going to get crime under control and the problem with facing is the problem that is hitting our entire nation right now. And that is why this is a national response. We need a national response to this issue. This is what we get. We need a national response. Now, a national response is the federal government charge of local police forces is the federal government in charge of liberal judges who let repeat violent criminals out the back door is a federal judge responsible for the city council in New York or the or the government in Albany, which is all Democrat. What's the federal government supposed to do? This is the city subway system. The cameras aren't working. There's not enough police officers down there. Police officers are retiring in record number murders up crime of all kinds is up. And all these cities because they're all run the same way into the ground, into the ground. Till you, you bring back a Giuliani type until you give the police the ability to do what they used to do in New York. New York used to be incredibly safe. People went there. They didn't even fear for any kind of assault or anything. You've got a massive increase in hate crimes against the orthodox Jewish community. What are they doing about it in New York? Nothing. You got a massive increase against Asian Americans in New York. What's happening? Nothing's being done about nothing. Instead, they want to talk about ghost guns. But a ghost guns have to do with it. Ghost guns. And it's always we need a national response. We need a federal response. How much more money comport into these cities and states? They don't prioritize law enforcement. That's the problem. They romanticize Black Lives Matter and Tifa. They're teaching our children in the classroom to hate their own country. They're destroying American history. National response. When they add a president who would provide a national response, they say, Hey, it is guts in Donald Trump. Now this is the city. This is the mayor. It's the city council. It's the people in charge in the city. It's the it's the lousy judges. That's what it is. And when a whole slew of video cameras aren't working, my God, is that a national response to? I'll be right back. Folks, I have great news for you today.

The head of the national government is one of the most preposterous, incompetent individuals in American history. And by strange coincidence, he says this yesterday about guns. Cut eight, Mr. Producer, go. We're pushing in each of these areas, but none of this absolved Congress, with all due respect to my members of Congress here, they're the wrong people I'd be talking to. For the responsibility to act, we need Congress to pass universal background checks. Universal background checks. And I know it's controversial, but I got it done once. Ban or saw weapons in high capacity magazines. Anybody who owns a gun. Let me put it this way. Anybody who has purchased a gun knows that there are background checks. Anybody who's been at an NRA gun shown has purchased a gun knows there are background checks. Now for antique weapons, there were not background checks. I'd say you want to buy a muzzle loading weapon from 1750 or what have you. Or a father gives the weapon to his son or something like that. There's no background check. We've had John Lott on this program before, the foremost expert on these issues. The issue with mass murder that's taking place in our cities and all over the country quite frankly has nothing to do with background checks. Nothing. Zero. Zero. Nothing to do with background checks. High capacity magazines. Ban assault weapons. An assault weapon is nothing more than a weapon that fires a bullet every time you pull the trigger. So I don't know what a high capacity assault weapon is, quite frankly, other than a typical weapon that people use. Again, when you pull the trigger, a bullet is fired, you pull the trigger again another bullet is fired. So I don't know what an assault weapon means. High capacity magazines means that they can take more than one bullet. Excuse me more than typically 10 or 12 bullets in the magazine, but it's going to be interesting here to see exactly what was used here because apparently the gun jammed and it may have jammed because of the number of bullets in the magazine. Who knows? But the real problem in the subway in New York and subways all over the country is the lack of law enforcement. Not because law enforcement doesn't want to be there, but because the politicians either prevent them from being there as a result of slashing their budgets or because they have them doing other things like protecting politicians. Crime has been rising in the subway in New York for two years at a frightening level. More the reason to have hired more police and put more police in the subway system, but they don't do that. You get lip service that this will not continue, this will end, we'll use whatever resources we need to. I think that's what the the unelected governor said, but the fact is she's not doing that. None of them are doing that. None of them. Biden was all for the defund movement or at least slashing the budgets of the police all over the country when he's a candidate. And so he runs around and says, I never said I support defunding the police. Maybe he never expressly said it, but he supported the violent rioters that he did. He certainly did. Nancy Pelosi did too, calling the cops stormtroopers. As did other Democrats, people came on TV, lying about police officers, lying about police departments. You had professional athletes like LeBron James, you had an entire network like ESPN just trashing cops left and right and left and right. Mark, you don't know you've never been stopped. Yes, I have, but I don't argue with the cops either. Every time they've stopped me, they had a reason to stop me as driving too fast, although not lightly because I haven't been. They want to see something show it to them. What's the big deal? Because the next guy they stop, for all they know has a weapon loaded up against their chest. And as soon as the officer looks in the window, they shoot the officer. We've seen that too. The police in America have done a hell of a job. There's not enough of them, and there's not enough of them in very dangerous places. They'll tell you that and they're right. And let's have that debate now. Let's have that debate now rather than ghost guns. I don't even know what the hell a ghost gun is to be perfectly out of look it up. Apparently they're the big problem. They are. I never heard them before. They're not the big problem. Now guns in the hands of people who shouldn't have them, I agree. So what are we doing with criminals who have used guns in any way to commit crimes? Are they spending long sentences in prison or in jail for the most part? No. In California, they're releasing prisoners left and right. They can't release them fast enough. It's called criminal justice reform. No, it's not criminal justice reform. It's old week on the numbers, week on crime. I should say that's what it is. As I say, when they have their live press conference in New York, we'll go to that because I want to know what's going on too, just as much as many of you do. It's really quite sickening. Meanwhile, our old friend Kevin McCarthy, I do like the man, comes on the show, he offers to come on the show. The Republican leader in the house could be the speaker. He doesn't think impeachment should be on the table, or at least he's not sure about it. The impeachment, you remember, of Joe Biden. Well, Joe Biden is violating federal immigration laws that take care laws of the Constitution under Article two, Clause five, is as much a part of your Constitution as anything else. It's in the Constitution, whether it's the Bill of Rights, whether it's separation of powers, whether it's the Supreme Court. If a president doesn't take care that the laws are enforced, we have a lawless society. We have a dictator, maybe a quasi dictator, whatever we have. I don't care if he squints, if he mumbles. It's the same thing as if he doesn't squint and he's articulate. The president of the United States has no choice. The president of the United States must enforce the law, the entire executive branch, not sabotage it. And that's what he's doing. I would encourage Leader McCarthy to rethink his position and to at least be open to the idea of a fulsome investigation into Joe Biden's conduct, whether it comes to ignoring court orders, ignoring immigration law, and other acts that he has taken, the excessive use of executive orders, the excessive use of executive orders, when it comes to equal treatment, such as transgenderism and what he's doing to Title nine of our federal law that was specifically passed by Congress to ensure that women have a fair shake at sports in our public schools, colleges, and universities. Now, there was a time as a society when we celebrated women. There was a time as a society when we talked about how women needed more equality and so forth. There was a time when you were taught to treat women with respect when you were a guy. We've not reached a point where a coming Supreme Court justice won't even define what a woman is. In other words, what I'm trying to say is, and what I've been saying, but what I want to underscore here is the position of women at society is regressing. Not men, women. It's regressing. It's regressing because of the radicalism of the Democrat Party and the radicalism of their agenda. You don't hear about the women's right movement anymore. You don't hear about feminism anymore because feminism doesn't work. Women's rights. We can't even define women. Feminism doesn't work when you're saying that sexual identity is between the ears and not between the legs. And let me be blunt about this. There is a tiny percentage of the population that is transgender. A tiny percentage. Nobody's telling them what to do. Nobody's forcing them to do something or not to do something. How did this wind up in the classroom of kindergartners, first graders, second graders, or third graders? And how did it become the case that if a state passes a law that says you're not to discuss these things or expose these kids to sexuality, that's anti-gay. We've had gay callers on this program who say they support the Florida law because once you read it, it's a very simple law. Even your liberals should be able to comprehend it. Then you understand. There's nothing to do with gays. Has to do with sexualizing little babies, cutting the parents out of the process so they've no say on what you're doing to their children. And in some cases, advancing a sexual ideology. That's what it has to do with. I'll be right back. Folks, I have great news for you today.

You know, speaking of New York, a lot of the rest of the country people think I'm from New York. Although long-time listeners know I'm from Philadelphia because they say you have a New York attitude. When I started really accidentally doing radio 20 years ago was on Sundays for two hours, 12 the two on W.A.B.C. The great program director Phil Boyce heard me as a guest said I want to try you and he said now there's no money involved. I said fine. I've been a talk radio addict since I was a kid listening to the old W.C.A.U. in Philadelphia became W.P.H.T. the signal from W.A.B.C. in W.O.R. 50,000 watts even more reached my home in suburban Philadelphia late at night. I'd listened to Bob Grant who became a very, very close friend of mine. That's where I found Hannity one day and of course Rush. Rush was everywhere. So I did this on nation. We did extremely well and then we did a six to seven show which did extremely well six to eight and six to nine because the goal of course was to be W.O.R. which we always do. And it's a tough time slot you know when there's baseball you've got the Yankees you've got the Mets you've got hockey people also want to wind down at some point before they wind up again later at night. So listen to the radio and watch TV but we built this show and we have this real estate that we created here six to nine p.m. it's now prime time when I first came into six to nine it was not people were watching TV or doing other things. So we started to syndicate the show on the ABC radio networks and the question we had from a lot of the stations in the south. Well how's this guy from New York going to play here in the south and I said to the program or directors first I'm not from New York they didn't really care whether you're from Philadelphia New York Boston all the same. I said although I feel I kinship with New Yorkers as a matter of fact when I used to come to New York prior to the last few years I'm always stopped by the NYPD members it's just fantastic. Mr. Levin how are you Mr. Levin they're just the best and even here Washington DC all the cities. I said it's not that I'm not from the south listen to what I say. Listen to what I say and they took a chance. We're all over the south all over the southwest all over the southeast all over the Midwest all over the west of course all up and down the east coast that's because the content is important the content matters. 20 years later it's the same exact thing and I've been blessed by you people in the audience out there whatever platform I'm on however I do it but I'm no different than you I came from very modest roots very modest roots but the things I see that are happening to our country affect the people in New York City affect the people in Jackson Mississippi Seattle Washington Chicago Illinois everywhere all over the country that's what makes the difference whether you write a book you're on radio podcasting on Fox to live in TV very busy schedule around here that's what matters and I've said it before and I'll say it again right here radio is my first professional love radio it's true as long as you keep listening I'll be here one way or another that's the way it works so when we come back hopefully we'll have an update from the from the commissioner the police commission in New York City if we don't we won't move on there's so much more to cover here as the war against Ukraine continues why are we still denying them weapons I don't know if you heard my monologue on Fox on Sunday why are we still denying them weapons and why do we keep pretending genocide's not going on we've got a ton more I'll be right back this segment of the podcast is exclusively sponsored by pure talk pure talk offers great coverage and can save your family money on your wireless bill every single month go to pure talk dot com to find the plan that's right for you thank you again for listening and thank you so much for this sponsorship pure talk he's here he's here now broadcasting from the underground bus deep in the fowls of a hidden bunker somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building we've once again made contact with our leader hello american mark live in here our number eight seven seven three eight one three eight one one eight seven seven three eight one three eight one one ABC NBC networks and other networks are coming under criticism from conservatives and rightly so for failing to mention the race of the suspect mr producer isn't that shocking it's key to finding them so I have a chart here media narrative chart by john gabriel over at ricochet sent to me by my wife and he has the media narrative chart for reporting violent crime if the attacker is a non-white shooter and the victim's white we need gun control if the attackers are white shooter and the victim's non-white racism if the attacker's non-white and the victim's non-white run story about the Kardashians instead if the police officer is the so-called attacker and the victim is non-white police brutality the attackers are non-white shooter and the victim's a police officer it's reaction to brutality if the attacker is a non-white shooter excuse me I just did that if the attacker is a male and the victim is a female it's sexism the attacker is female and the victim is a male it's reaction to sexism if the attacker is a female shooter and the victim's female gun control if the attacker is female and the victim is a fraternity band fraternities if the attacker is non-muslim and the victim's muslim islamophobia if the attacker is muslim and the victim's non-muslim reaction to islamophobia if it's a muslim or muslim attack it's the Kardashians we need to cover atheist shooter shooting a christian need gun control terrorist shooting an artist need for censorship of the artists terrorist shooting a christian while it's a reaction to the crusades if it's an iraq israeli shooting a terrorist ban israel if it's a terrorist shooting in israeli ban israel it's a terrorist shooting any Jew ban israel sounds about right to me all said and done it's actually played out someone in our media today not so much in the print media certainly not behind this microphone but abc and nbc if you don't tell the american people and particularly new yorkers what the race of the purp is how do you expect them to help find you that he's five five 180 pounds wearing a certain type of jacket which of course he's discarded by now i mean that defines uh an awful lot of people the race is of course relevant it's incredible it's disgusting what goes on in this country to be perfectly honest it's absolutely disgusting why would mbc and abc do that when there is a massive manhunt quote unquote a desperate manhunt going on trying to find this this would be killer why is that we know why and that's why the cities are deteriorating because it's politics first check that it's american marxist democrat party politics first that's what it is all right you crane you've seen the pictures you've seen the video all right here comes the commissioner here we go and a hatchet also found is a liquid we believe to be gasoline and a bag containing

lavin podcast back to the press conference mr. James is just a person of interest we know right now who rented that u-hole then in Philadelphia the keys to that u-hole van were found in the subway in our shooters possessions we don't know right now if mr. James has any connection to the subway that's still under investigation the crime scene still being processed now the van is being processed and the subway crime scene is being processed but we still early right now to tell city Katie um can you explain where this u-hole was located was it nearby and also um i mean you said um you're investigating these videos but can you confirm that it was him in the video or people that know um rich how to make that connection the video the youtube videos and the videos on there's a man who posted there frank james we're still working to see if that's a person who rented the video and we're gonna be all located uh king's highway in broklaw king's highway what intersection 30 west four west fourth and king's highway anything more you can tell us about the content of the posts and i know you said it wasn't a direct threat of the mayor until the commission said about the mayor then caused you to get the security as well there were general topics of concern and i don't want to go into too many details about the mayor security detail we're just doing it uh just to be on the safe side there's any other details but almost as you mentioned there you can see about the complaints about homelessness complaints about new york nothing in general i'm sorry just general comments that caused us some concern not to stop you to investigation at this point why were there no working surveillance cameras in the station why did news radios not over in the station and how much did those factors hand for this investigation yeah we know that there were three stations that the video wasn't working we're still investigating that to see why or how those uh whether it was mechanical problem electrical issue why those videos were not there was no issues with police radios that's one of the first officers on the scene that is radio was apparently one of the teenagers there to call 911 yeah so patrol officers so officers would work top side if you will in patrol precincts when they go down the station they have to switch frequencies it's a uhf versus vhf so if they didn't switch the radio over to the vhf frequency they would not be able to transmit down in the subway station so it's a user error it wasn't a problem with the actual radio umberg news how many officers are assigned to the 36th street station and were there any officers in the station at all and it's not there so we don't typically assign officers to subway stations officers patrol on a rotating basis they ride trains they come out they patrol the stations patrol officers from the precincts stop go down they do station inspections we've been doing that since january so that that station was patrolled several times today there were no officers present in the station at the time of the shooting but it had been patrolled several times on this calendar date prior to the shooting in the early morning hours what do we know about mr. James and his local times in new york city we know mr. james mr. james has addresses in wisconsin and philadelphia as far as duyork it's still under investigation but he's just a person of interest right now in this case we know the shooter was was entered the station on king's highway so we're asking for anybody who knows from king's highway to 35th street is eight stops anybody who sees him with any information please call crime stop us we literally have hundreds of detectives out in a field right now pouring through video at train stations the egresses the recovery sites of the vehicle so we hope to have clearer pictures of who we believe has issued until my question senna about the weapon that was recouped has that been traced back to mr. james at all and is there any likelihood that our outcome is not investigated to the same person that pulled that trigger today that's pull it as far as pulling the trigger that's still under investigation as far as the firearm is concerned we know it's not part of a multi-sale we know it's not stolen we're working on what our partners in the atf to track back to the point of sale and then move forward on that gun last question your physical description and james doesn't match the description that's already put out today again as i said we there was two smoke grenades we have very difference has actually come to an end very very important information we'll take a review and we'll move on to a few other subjects as well but this man is still on the loose he's a person of interest we'll be right back i've been telling you folks

gentlemen all over the country particularly in the tri state area five state area including New York and around New York if you know a black man by the name of frank r jams and i'm sure there's many you should call him on the phone immediately and tell him to turn himself into the police if he's an innocent man he doesn't have anything to fear the question is if he's not an innocent man if he had no role excuse me if he had a role then he won't call the police it's very unlikely we have posted a photograph that was put out by the ny pd of frank r james oh my parlor getter and truth said right mr. i mean truth social sites truth social parlor and getter sites it's also all over the internet if you think you know this man after seeing the photo or if you have other information please call the crime stoppers number 1-800-5777 tips 1-800-5777 tips we've done this before on the show from time to time you might recall in a show that really was became quite famous that we were tracking the the boston killers remember that the boston marathon killers mr. producing it's hard to forget that day isn't it and guns was actually listening to the police monitor and we were informing people where the younger one was the other one having been shot i believe and where he'd been where he was hiding it didn't endanger the police at all because this individual wasn't listening to me but it was a a spectacular example of what you can do on talk radio and let this be another frank r james what happened was they found his keys the keys to the u-hall were dropped in the subway you know when there's commotion going on even the potential perp is is an issue and so um they just want to question him as a person of interest now it is interesting that they did mention they know exactly which station he got on mr. producer they know exactly what station he got on so either they have video of that or they have an eyewitness who saw him either going down to the station or getting on the subway car it's got to be one of those three things otherwise they wouldn't be so definitive they knew exactly how he got on the train right and so the rental car leads to a lot of information the rental car was found in the Bronx i think he has an address in philadelphia and he has an address in the state of wisconsin where in wisconsin obviously they didn't say but we are heard in the city of philadelphia by the biggest station in the city of philadelphia and if anybody knows of frank r james you should contact frank r james and some of the call the police and frank r james if you can hear me now you better damn i'll call the police or hear the main suspect because if you don't call the police now there's no reason to believe that you're innocent when you call the police and say i didn't do anything right mr. producer right away immediately they're tracking down the gun i believe i heard but i'm not sure that he purchased it through the usual process i could be wrong so we'll put that in a footnote they've obviously tracked down the van they know where he rented it in philadelphia it's how they got his addresses that's how they got his photo i guess they went back and saw his driver's license and when they were asked the police chief was asked if he had a criminal record he wouldn't say said he's just a person of interest right now they know all about him all about his background they have their cyber experts on this they have ATF with the weapons they've got all kinds of uh DMV material on him they have all kinds of uh he has a criminal record they know all about it employment record they know all about it by now that's what i say the nypd there's nothing better nothing better and uh he had an awful lot of that baggy was carrying or backpack that he had gasoline smoke bombs all kinds of weapons and so forth and so on sounds me like he was planning on doing a hell of a lot more damage and his gun did jam it was a uh it was a galok apparently a galok so you heard what the official said i've summarized it you know everything i know and the reason i'm summarizing it is because he's still on the loose and since this show has heard all over New York and New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Washington DC area, up north, Boston, since it's heard all over the country all over the east coast so forth that's trying to be a help again the crime stoppers number 1-800-577 tips 1-800-577 tips we the American people nothing can stop us i'm not going to get to everything i wanted to but we needed to cover what we covered we needed to talk about these things because it's very very important now law enforcement is important following the law is important when you have politicians involved it becomes a disaster Liz Cheney is way out of her lane Liz Cheney is abusing her authority as a congressman and by the way the bush family the Cheney family the Romney family Paul Ryan and that crowd they're all raising a fortune for Cheney in her primary and you know what else happens in the republican primary in wis in the Wyoming same day registration so democrats are organizing to come into that primary organizing by overwhelming numbers same day registration that has changed the registration to vote for Lynn Cheney and then otherwise change the registration back Lynn Cheney is relying on reprobate democrats to come into the republican primary in Wyoming to give her that election so i give you a heads up republicans in that state and conservatives this is a very very important matter but here she is on CNN she's loved on CNN on Meet the Press on Face the Nation on this week they used to hate the Chinese Halliburton, Halliburton, remember? now they love the Chinese because they're a disaster. Dizzy Lizzy Cheney on CNN yesterday cut 10 go. Reporting this morning that your committee has concluded that you have enough evidence to make a criminal referral for president trump to the justice department for obstructing an official proceeding and for conspiracy to defraud the united states. This is a jake tapar who's not really asking a question he's making a statement and asking if she agrees with him go ahead evidence to refer trump for criminal charges well we have not made a decision about referrals on the committee i think that it is absolutely the case it's absolutely clear that what president trump was doing what what a number of people around him were doing that they knew it was unlawful they did it anyway i think you certainly saw that in the decision that was issued by judge carter a few weeks ago the decision by judge carter she knows this but she's come to become a complete slime ball a federal district judge the central district of california who's known to be a whack job radical puts language in a decision affecting john easement and attorney about the president there were no hearings there were no evidentiary uh hearings there were no uh there was no jury there was nothing and he accused the presidents of criminal the president of criminal liability and for that he should be removed from the bench he should be removed from the bench and he should have his license taken from him so she's citing something that is really quite outrageous because she is completely obsessed rogue and out of control go ahead concluded that uh it was more likely than not that the president of the united states was engaged uh uh in criminal activity uh i think so who was representing the president in front of that judge liz you see this is the problem with cnn and jake tapor and the rest of them he's not a serious person hopefully when they wipe out the hosts at cnn and he'll be among the but apparently the hosts that cnn are getting a special meeting with the former head of discovery because the hosts are angry the hosts are nuts so the question for liz chaney mr producer would you invite liz chaney on this program let's see if she's willing to come on this program and keep this clip with you the question that jake tapor should have asked is why is a federal judge in california passing judgment on the former president of the united states when that case is not in front of him when there's been no relevant proceeding in front of him when there's been no due process representation by lawyers the presentation of evidence involving the president the former president but he doesn't care jake go ahead you have seen is a massive and well organized and well planned uh effort that used multiple tools to try to overturn an election she is really communicating with meritless garland the attorney general the united states trying to put pressure on the criminal side now what did i tell you about four or five six weeks ago there parallel lanes going on here that overlap and that are violating the federal constitution and the right of an individual's due process liz chaney adam kingzinger and the democrats on this stalinist policy committee are gathering information they claim will be used for a legislative purpose which is different than a criminal purpose so while they have wide latitude to gather information it does have an end point they are not free to gather information to make a criminal referral that's not the purpose of a congressional subpoena or a congressional hearing or a congressional investigation they're not free to criminalize their activities that separation of powers that belongs in the executive branch the constitutional rights that kick in again when there's a criminal investigation are being completely abandoned by this committee because they claim we're a congressional investigation we're not doing a criminal investigation yet when you listen to her and it's more than once she makes it abundantly clear that they are conducting some kind of a quasi criminal investigation skirting the limits of the constitution skirting the civil liberties of their targets and witnesses putting together a report moving around testimony editing texts to make a criminal referral against the president of the united states the former president dal trump and i am very concerned about this because under the highly political department of justice that goes after parents that goes after texas that goes after georgia and on and on and on that this is the game plan please listen to me this is the game plan and over at the federalist tristan justice trump haters impeached him for inciting a riot they claimed remember the last impeachment now they're claiming the riot was premeditated so we've gone from inciting a riot to now it was premeditated the idea they coordinated assault undermines the narrative daniel trump was responsible for spontaneously inciting an insurrection so they they don't even have their story straight more when i return much love in i've been telling you folks for a

over the weekend as you know many of you our president went to wilmington delaware he says they told me i couldn't go to ukraine everybody's wondering who are they who are they that told him he can't go to ukraine is if a president can't make a decision himself do you think donald trump would be held back by they he would have beaten borse johnson to ukraine in fact none of this would be happening quite frankly if he'd when the oval office none of it in my humble opinion because we are not leading the world and defending ukraine we're not leading the world and helping ukraine ukraine keeps asking for the same thing they need heavy weapons the russians are now amassing in the two provinces that they claim are there which of course are not there on the east northeast side of ukraine on the border with russia and they are amassing troops there they're bringing in veterans that is men who have fought in previous wars and are considered older in their 40s and 50s some in their 60s this is what a desperate joseph stallen did when he was fighting the nazis he rounded up the vets and told them you're in this war too and they're going to throw whatever they can maybe this will be a battle of the bulge moment for russia i don't know hopefully it is they lose but the ukrainians need air power they need tanks they need armored vehicles they exist they can be given to them the ukrainians have the right to win this war and protect their people from the genocide and atrocities that are taking place and those who do not support that in this government will be remembered for a thousand years america's colleges and universities today are less concerned with critical thinking than within indoctrination but i'm happy to report there is a college where students debate ideas openly and honestly where they pursue true together with their professors and where america's great heritage of liberty is studied and revered my favorite college hillsdale college as stated in hillsdale's founding document in 1844 hillsdale's original mission was to offer the kind of serious liberal arts education needed to preserve the blessings of civil and religious liberty across the country and this mission continues to guide hillsdale college today and you can learn a whole lot more at levin for hillsdale dot com levi in for hillsdale dot com there you'll find a short video it's just over a minute long showing how hillsdale's work not only in michigan and washington d c campuses but across the nation is effective in defending american liberty take some time to watch today at levin for hillsdale dot com that's levi in for hillsdale dot com easy easy now broadcasting from the underground command post-pilot deep in the fowls of a hidden bunker somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building we've once again made contact with our leader love them hello america mark levin here our number eight seven seven three eight one three eight one one eight seven seven three eight one three eight one one the name disney is worth hundreds of billions of dollars actually thanks to walt disney who's apegale disney i think she's a grand order great-dank grand order of walt disney she had absolutely nothing to do with starting disney with disney films disney tv disney products nothing nothing she's a disney though and that was enough for cnn the constipated news network that was enough for brine stelter to bring her on to talk about the disney law because brine stelter has no problem if his little babies are exposed to sexuality the age of five six seven or eight but that's up the brine stelter and that's up to the people who advocate these things and for my two cents worth that is really a subject at that age that should compel the various government services to take the children away from their parents i mean that no five-year-old should be exposed to some intense discussion about genitalia that's child abuse you know they used to be child abuse now it's a movement a civil rights movement brine stelter has no problem with that being discussed with his babies none but that's because he's perverse in my view and if that's what he wants to do that's on him but when did it become the power of a corporation the power of the media the power of government to impose that on our children that's what the battle is about it's not whether you're gay or straight or whatever you are it's exposing young children to this to sexuality it's they don't say gay bill where does that come from that is a lie it's propaganda but they keep saying it even abigail disney even brine stelter they're a disgrace they keep pushing this narrative on mslst they keep pushing this narrative on cnn they keep pushing this narrative even though it's a lie like so much of what they say so here's brine stelter with abigail disney and then my response go ahead what is the Walt Disney Company actually and how do you feel when you see it portrayed as this child abuse indoctrination cults right well well what i'm seeing happen is pretty coordinated strategic plan unfolding and uh disney seems like the biggest target because it's so woven into families and so if you can by the way a coordinated strategic plan unfolding i hope so that's called we the people rising up against what your corporation is now doing after decades and decades and decades of persuading us to invest a lot of money in your corporation these are shareholders are just movie watchers or attendees at your various parks go ahead that somebody's in there trying to indoctrinate your child my goodness the paranoid imagination can run run about indoctrinating your child either it's about exposing children to issues that they should not be exposed to that's what it's about go ahead run circles over that yeah and so i i understand why it's been selected in this strategic whatever strategic meeting they had for what they would turn to what's no strategic meeting you idiot no strategic meeting go ahead um but this is absurd the the the thing that disney stands for more than anything and in every film and especially in the animation where there's a gay character or not is love and acceptance and family and joy no it it it stands for little children it stands for entertaining little children that's what it stands for love and acceptance maybe love depending on how you define but acceptance are little kids supposed to accept everything what are they supposed to are little kids supposed to accept uh changing genitalia five-year-olds is that what they're supposed to accept they don't even understand it you're you're exposing them to issues that they should not be exposed to at that age go ahead and so they're trying to inject something into what disney does that has nothing to do with what disney does whether or not there are characters and i keep wondering um gay characters why would you do that why not just have characters why do you inject gay characters straight characters crooked characters just characters and so what is the point of this interview ladies and gentlemen it's to tie a disney name to this radical position that brine stelter i guarantee you brine stelter would never or has never exposed his five-year-old six-year-old or seven-year-old through these kinds of matters i guarantee you here's a preschool teacher in florida tiktok david uh mamad on my show came under attack by the usual left-wing kooks claiming that he said all teachers basically are uh perverts and waiting of course that's not what he said if you take what he says in context but it doesn't matter they're not interested in what he actually said these are both basically ideologues who are mostly illiterate they know how to get on social media kick up the dust but you know what who cares that's why i'm not on twitter and facebook here's a preschool teacher in florida tiktok i wonder if brine stelter will have him on his show i wonder if disney will welcome this teacher to playland for the magic kingdom cut 15 go man y'all thought me teaching the children of me being poly was crazy but not only that but they also know that i'm gender fluid uh at one point last year i had explained to them that i was not miss lois or mr. lois is just lois because i'm not a boy or a girl and this was all well and good until october when i also explained to them that i'm pagan so i am also a witch and at one point i got in a haircut and i got in the sides of my mohawk to shave down and i come into work and one of the children goes lois are you a boy you have short hair and his sister goes no lois is a girl and a third child who's my favorite suddenly else no guys we've been over this lois is an a boy or a girl lois is a witch duh these are preschoolers and this is the problem the teacher doesn't own that classroom now teacher can be an authoritarian addictator that classroom but a teacher doesn't own the classroom we do the people and that's the battle the parents do the taxpayers do to go in there i don't even know what polyamorous is and i'm not even going to look it up i don't care she's gender fluid she's talking to her preschool as that means there's four-year-olds five-year-olds and i wonder if abigail disney is aware of this i wonder if brian stelters aware of it i wonder if they have any questions being raised in order to protect these little kids from somebody like this florida past its law perfectly rational law that ten years ago wouldn't even have cost a dust up do not expose little babies to these sexual ideologies and practices period do not and that's said to be a don't say gay bill it don't say heterosexual don't say homosexual don't say in other words don't say sexual it's the don't be or say sexual bill that's what it is but this is the position of disney you have more and more of these teachers speaking on a tik tok and elsewhere and they should be immediately have their tickets pulled if that's what they're doing and this is why the parents are going to rise up in this election also regardless of party because biden the democrat party the democrat governors and the democrat mayors as well as the media i might add they're all promoting this now despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of the american people want nothing to do with this demonstrated in blue virginia demonstrated in dark blue new jersey last election demonstrated in san francisco which is as red as it gets frankly and i don't mean politically i mean ideologically throwing out certain school board members people of all ethnicities all faiths all backgrounds red blooded americans they've had enough of this yes you're sabotaging the family your brainwashing children it's from the top down not the bottom up and i hope i pray to god that this next election despite everybody that's going to be a slam it's going to be a slam really is and that's going to take you working hard i don't care where you live to change things you're going to have to change things because the saboteurs the ideologues from above us are imposing the will on all of us i'll be right back today's show is sponsored by our friends at

slash levin you know you can fight back folks it's called the first amendment but a disney world or disney land the first amendment doesn't apply but you have paid money to go into these places right it costs a lot you can actually do something and i want to encourage you to do it over at the epic times in an effort to honestly and respectfully express how he feels about what is going on with the disney company's management one dad's handmade t-shirt caused quite a stir at the happiest place on earth what do you think i would do mr producer if i asked 10 000 people to show up somewhere and we had a big rally in front of one of these corporations what do you think i think they'd show up gant gephers has been taking his daughters lyla and brin to disney for years over those years he's noticed the subtle changes the company's been making regarding causes they support and the policies they're implementing at their parks but the things that have developed lately in the ongoing effort by disney's management to protest the passing of legislation meant to protect children was the last draw this is an important lesson folks gephers said they'd already purchased disney tickets for himself as wife and their two daughters to go spend two days at two different parks at disney in orlando cost him two thousand dollars because he brought some other kids with him neighbors kids then he talks about disney c.o. bob chepeck a real coward anyway this transgender stuff this was it for me he told the epic times i didn't want to go anymore so i may call to see about getting a refund on my tickets they wouldn't give me a refund so this man red blooded american did what red blooded americans do he used his noggin and he was creative what did he do he had an idea it involved a plain white t-shirt and a couple of sharpies sharpies he said i had to make a statement so i went out and bought a t-shirt i put a couple of things on the back and a couple things on the front and i wore it to the park on the back jeffers wrote hello boys and girls ladies and gentlemen which of course has been now abandoned by disney on the front he wrote walt not woke walt not woke well he wasn't sure how people were going to respond he said he needed to do something to express how he felt bottom line is people did respond almost to a man and woman they patted him on the back they thanked him they were all positive even many employees showed up because see most employees behave they're not out there with their big mouse push in a political agenda they're doing a job they have a background to do these jobs very competitive to get these jobs and they know full well unless you're of the radical left marxis ideology you'll lose your job or you'll become a a social reprobate that's the problem so people are afraid to speak out because i'm convinced the vast majority of disney employees don't believe in this stuff the hierarchy most of which is based in l.a. and uh is of that mind said not that everyone is but too many are they uh they're pushing the agenda again the top down the saboteurs they're sabotaging the disney company and they're demanding that the state of florida the legislature of florida the governor of florida abandon their positions how why should they do that let disney leave just let them leave they won't leave they have it too good in florida don't they but you can do something about it boycott them some of my brothers and sisters in this business say don't boycott i say boycott them it's the free market freedom of association or lack thereof i won't be going to disney it's like watching tv or the radio if you don't want to watch something shut it off you don't want to hear something shut it off that's the way it works it's the market system and that's the way it should work with disney there's a reason why people are talking with their feet they're literally escaping these these crazy ass places and going to states that they don't impose their will but they allow freedom to take place whether it's the pandemic or whether it's entertainment or whether it's the classroom and so forth and so on this election is about more than republicans beating democrats which is all mitch mcconnell thinks it is it's about more than that ladies and gentlemen it truly is it truly is this election is about faith and family this election is about tradition and the civil society this election is about the rule of law where criminals belong behind bars and innocent people deserve to be unmolested there's a tremendous amount on the line in this election you know the country has been unraveling for many years but it's in a tail spin right now it's been in a tail spin for about five years and a reaction to Donald trump because Donald trump dared to run for president and dared to get elected a true outsider and he took on he took on these american marxist movements whether in the media in the democrat party and so forth and so on and they tried to take him out even before he entered the oval office with the fbi and the intelligence agencies and the media and so forth but the war on donald trump like the war on reagan before him is the war on you it's the war on the cops the war on the military the war on a border and citizenship it's the war on your classroom and what's going on in your classroom and who is it on the other side of this war the democrat party they've bought all in not just them but that is the political party the political entity through which they operate I'll be right back ladies and gentlemen I want to ask you a question did you know withdrawing your cash from the bank can be very risky that's right banks are now required to spy on us for the government and the report any behavior they think is suspicious

freedom in this country not me english speaking world mark call mark at 877-381-3811 remember folks all over the country if you know of frank r james uh from philadelphia wisconsin you might want to call frank r james and tell him to call the police immediately if he's not the subway bomber shooter i suppose that's more precise the subway shooter they're looking for a suspect a black man um frank r james it's not clear from the press conference whether it's the same person but he's definitely a person of interest because he rented the the u-hall they'd been looking for he rented in philadelphia and um there's a lot of frank r james is out there they meet the description i gave you so if you know one call them say hey frank you only want to call the cops and say it's not you one 800-577-TIPS one 800-577-TIPS if you know anything about this call that number because we need to find this barbarian who did what he did as a country we need to fight this stuff wherever it happens new york, allay, chicago everywhere around or in between it's one of the benefits of this format as a matter of fact you know we've uh we've talked about these never trumpers and here's what concerns me everybody says oh we're gonna win the senate we're gonna win this we're gonna win that the wall street journal editorial board like's Liz Cheney they have an affinity for Liz Cheney i'm telling you the truth and so there is still in that never trumper mentality not all the people who write there i know some but but the head guy and most of them and over at the blaze wall street journal editorial board blames trump for kentanji brown jackson being confirmed to the supreme court they argued in an opinion piece that former president trump was to blame democrats celebrated on friday the confirmation of jackson the editorial board argued that trump's focus on delegitimizing the official election results took away from the effort to win two run off elections determining george's two sanitize see here's the thing mitch mcconnell does this all the time and the editorial page in the wall street journal is basically his editorial page if you will for the republican establishment they hated the tea party they take credit for what happened in uh in virginia but mitch mcconnell is the most unpopular republican fifty two percent republicans don't like him that poll was taken about a month ago now that's pretty shocking but there's a reason for it mitch mcconnell is the reason we lost two senate seats in georgia mitch mcconnell is the reason we lost a senate seat in alabama and mitch mcconnell will be the reason we don't win the senate or win the senate by a sizable amount because of the candidates he chooses in the battles he picks he raises a fortune a fortune through businessmen and women wealthy people left and right in dc new york and elsewhere who want access why because he's the republican leader they figure he'll be the republican majority leader and so they don't want to mess with mitch and he's been there a long time and so he uses his position which the republicans in the senate give him because there aren't enough conservatives in the senate there are talk like conservatives but not enough actual conservatives and they'll vote down the line form so mitch mcconnell will be the reason we don't take the senate or take it by a significant margin he's the reason we lost the georgia senate seats he's the reason we got judge jacks and eventually on the supreme court the wall street journal will never admit this but it's true it's true nor will the wall street journal admit that there was a significant amount of serious substantive abuse of our election laws whether in pencil vane or other states more more informations coming out ladies and gentlemen not from me from real investigators from state legislatures not from me and i won't be silenced on it they go on about russia collusion for years which was a complete fabrication we have media outlets that just regurgitated this stuff as it was fed to it by the dnc the democrat party partisan democrats on the special councils force there and the justice just unbelievable what was said but these are independent in a myriad number of investigations taking place in various states and they're utterly ignored completely ignored whether they're videotapes whether they're statisticians while the courts rejected so what now they admit the laptop of course but it's late it's too late without democratic senate control said the opinion piece president biden might have been forced to choose a more moderate nominee here we go might have woulda coulda then judge jackson or possibly a juris older than fifty one with a shorter prospective supreme court career so it's trumps fault the wall street journal editorial page continues knowingly to fight for globalist policies says trump such as bad trade deals open borders endless wars that favor other country here's the bottom line with the wall street journal editorial page it regurgitates the party line in washington remember mccain they were all for mccain trashing the tea party remember how they took off after ted cruis and trashed him when he was filibustering obama care remember that remember their day in and day out trashing donald trump when he became the republican nominee the voice of never trumpers and now they blame trump for judge jackson on the court not obama mind you not biden mind you and not the feckless mitch mcconnell who controls the national republican senatorial committee that pours millions and millions of dollars into these primary races no no it's trumps fault folks trump backed the two incumbents that mcconnell had backed and they were both quite weak in my view but everybody backed them as far as i know everybody backed them including mcconnell in the establishment republicans they were just mad that trump didn't back them faster and sooner but mcconnell pulled the same thing in 2010 when they put up some very weak rhino candidates he pointed to to some of the candidates that had flaws that lost that were supported by the tea party and some of them came very close in democrat areas by the way but never wants did he accept the fact that he supported a bunch of rhinos who lost but he blamed the tea party he blames trump in many ways he's like biden even with the china connections he blames the tea party now he blames trump so the wall street journal editorial page does the same thing it's really preposterous mr producer we haven't taken a single phone call all day anybody i to whom i should speak sir trisha in canada get wabc go right ahead hi mark um this issue of children young children being taught sex of any kind and kinder bartner first grade is just infuriating and i'm going to sell my disney stock and we will never go to a disney property again um also i wanted to say that allowing the lgbt activists to misappropriate not only the language but the symbols like the rainbow that one infuriated me that was god's symbol to mankind that he would never flood the entire earth again and instead it's been taken away from a beautiful um innocent thing hopeful thing into turning into a tool of the activists and of course they misappropriate the language too and like when they said that doma or defending marriage the natural family between a man and a woman their children that's attacking gay people which of course it is not now that's right and even the word gay it's interesting how did that come to pass but that's fine we're not even talking about that here we're talking about exposing babies to sexuality and this now has become a major policy and agenda item of the democrat party the teachers unions and all the rest of them and the media that's why they're forced to lie about it like they do so much inflation they cause inflation they lie about who caused it they're doing this and they're trying to turn people who are saying wait a minute no they're trying to turn them into something that's bad this is the nature the mindset of the marxis and the left in this country and i think they're gonna i hope pray fingers crossed that they're gonna get whacked big time at the election and particularly in democrat states thank you for your excellent call we'll be right back you want to kill our black friday deal i got one for

right that's not all right mike in brooklyn new york the great w abc mike go right ahead please mike thank you for taking my calls mark mayor adam's and many in the media here in new york lecture us normal people about pronouns gender identifications and accused us of being bigoted and accused us of being bigoted we identify somebody's male if female yet we're here on the radio today and anytime there's a crime the same people describing the purpose let's say a black male i would like to ask them according to their their definitions having no that and why is it okay to describe it in that way of course i'm being facetious but my point is these idiots are a bunch of pretentious hypocrites who like to lecture us and tell us what we can and can't do but when it works for them they could do whatever they want i agree with that but it's interesting nbc and abc maybe they've changed since i watched would not identify the race of the man who is the man of interest and you're right the word man what's a man they never make sense i mean even by when he i'm gonna nominate the first african-american woman and then she testifies and she can't define or won't define woman i mean how preposterous is that and yet it's a historic appointment what's historic that she's a woman no the first black woman wait a minute we're not allowed to say woman that's exactly your point right exactly exactly very stupid how's it going there in brooklyn what are people thinking about the subway attack here it's i hate to say that it's new york people walk around as if nothing's going on really just another day this is this is what the city's about here now it's disgusting i was in manhattan the other day dear homeless people all over the place rats running around the upper east side and west side of manhattan where all the rich people live you have rats the size of cats running around there and they're all over you don't even have to look for them and nobody cares that's what the city looks like and that's why people are leaving how long have you lived there long time too long all right 40 decades maybe are you thinking of leaving a lot of my friends have moved down to florida hmm you know and you know they're moving to florida registering republican voting republican most of them yes did you know that they are i do know that i do know that well here's the problem the subway system really is the heart and soul of transportation in that city as you can imagine and uh... subway ridership is already way way down so if they can't keep people safe on the subway and people are being pushed in front of subway cars people are being raped in front of it's just i mean the city should be investing in cops not all the rest of this crap they should be investing in cops and have copied i would have a cop at every uh every landing in every station at least uh during certain times of the day New York City needs more police but people are retiring they don't want anything to do with that city anymore it's a sad sad thing i feel like in many ways it's my my home city next to philadelphia because that's where i got my radio start and i feel like i know so many of you folks there anyway we'll duke this out folks we'll we'll stand together here we salute our armed forces police officers firefighters and emergency personnel folks i'll see you right here tomorrow as well as our trucker friends and our friends in utre take care"
