    "text": " Hey guys, welcome back to the show. My name is Lauren and this is Liam. Hello. And we have a great show for you guys tonight. We're going to start off with a conversation about the hashtag men are trash. Apparently some men don't like that. Controversial. Really weird. That for the thumbnail, we should have had me in like a trash can. You're trying to ask her the grout. Yeah. See, I didn't know you're open to being in like comedic thumbnails. My whole my whole mind is like blown wide open now. So many more possibilities. Then we have 18 to eight, which is this environmentalist movement or parody. I'm not even sure anymore saying that eight year olds need to be given the vote. And also we need to introduce socialism because that's how you say the world. Kristen Stewart then gave an interview recently where she was saying she apparently was being passed over for roles, perhaps in Marvel because of her bisexuality. We're going to discuss. And then finally, we're going to be closing off the evening with a discussion about the minds are relevant that recently happened this past weekend, which we were a part of. And unfortunately, one of the, I guess, the bar that was hosting the after party, they're now being review bombed for hosting us. It's a unfortunate thing. Before we get into all of that, though, I just want to remind you all that if you're watching this, you enjoy the show. Please be sure to subscribe over on blaestb.com slash Lauren.

And finally, don't forget to like, share and subscribe because it really, really helps us out a lot. YouTube algorithm is tough cookie nowadays. Okay. So let's get into this hashtag men are trash. The other day I saw this trending. And I thought, well, that looks like some easy content. Don't mind if I do. So I was going through all the different tweets that people were sending under the hashtag. And you know, hashtag men are trash or just the saying in general, it's become a, it's almost like a slogan or a motto for like, you know, the quintessential fourth wave feminist anti man type. And usually when you see people talking about men are trash, they're complaining about things like microaggressions, man's blaining, man spreading, essentially non problems, air conditioning is another one. But what's interesting about the hashtag that was being at least it being used this time around is that it's South African feminists specifically who got it trending in order to draw awareness to gender based violence. And I mean, I think I can safely say for everybody regardless of how you feel about feminism, gender based violence, obviously a very real problem. So we have this article that's written by the South African it's a South African publication and author and pretty sure she's giving the breakdown of how this hashtag exactly came to be the article is called Twitter trending hashtag men are trash proof that men center themselves on feminist issues. The the writer writes quote the phrase men are trash has been around for a few years now. It's fair to say that the campaign has been the most effective way to spark talk about gender based violence, despite the majority of men still missing the point by a mile. The hashtag was trending on Twitter today on National Women's Day. And one just has to look at some of the tweets to see why getting men to understand the hashtag is so damn hard. She continues hashtag men are trash began trending in South Africa in 2017. When Caribou, Macoena, I'm apologizing if if that's not the correct pronunciation was murdered by her boyfriend and her body burned. It's been used by women to highlight the abuse and violence that women experience on a daily basis. Men are afraid women will laugh at them. Women are afraid men will kill them. In short, the men are trash hashtag. Sorry. In short, the men are trash hashtag is not about men. It's about what women experience at the hands of men. It's a woman's reality and lived experience, not a man's. And it's about raising awareness. Awareness is a wonderful place to start. People who want to learn will people who don't won't. It's not always easy to reflect. And not everyone has the capacity. That said, men are not supposed to be at the center of this conversation. Instead of responding defensively, the correct course of action here would be to shut up and listen. Why would we be defensive or something like that? I know, right? Just like it's not about you hashtag men are trash. No men, not about you. Stop making it about you. Yeah, not shouting to your screen about what a good guy TM you are. Many have said hashtag said the hashtag would be more effective if we said some men are trash. Honestly, though, that won't work either. Including some will lead to a problematic trashy man still avoiding the issue because in his head, he's a good guy TM and it doesn't apply to him. But the original hashtag knocks everyone in their fragility and makes you sit up and take notice. I mean, that that's true. We're talking about it. I guess we're effective. Yeah, you have that because no, not all men are trash, but yes, all women are targets. And by walking down the street, a woman has no way of knowing which one you are giving you the benefit of the doubt could be detrimental to her safety. All right. So that's the article I just want to say guys, I think we're having some issues with lighting flickering. It's actually not our lighting. It's I think we're having court issues. So even the camera. Yeah, it's not the camera. We're having some try casts or difficulties. Apologize for that. But I don't think there's anything for the time being that we'll be able to do. Hopefully it's not too much of a bother for everyone watching though. So this person is very take clearly taking an unapologetic stance toward hashtag not all men. I understand the need to kind of make these bold statements to get as much attention as possible. But at the same time, I don't think all attention is good attention though. Yeah, some people have that mentality where there is no like negative press. But I think that in this case, people really do think that you're being ridiculous. Well, yeah, I mean, that's that's fair. I was looking through the hashtag and there's a lot of women feminists who were tweeting about it will go through those in a second. But but a lot of those, I don't know, a lot of them were men who were kind of upset that they were being called trash. And here's the thing. Imagine we have some like MGTOWs or MRA's or whatever who want to draw attention to let's say gender discrimination in the divorce courts or a child custody, right? Which is a real problem. Something that I think women are trash question mark. No, let's say they say they decide to market this campaign with the hashtag women are horse, you know, they get it trending. Maybe have it on some merchants their website. And then when all these women complain, look, whoa, whoa, whoa. It's not about you. Okay, we're trying to raise awareness to men's problems. It's like, just imagine how men feel. You know, you have to look at it through our lens. Yeah, I mean, great. You're you're addressing a noteworthy cause. I don't want to diminish the seriousness of this. Like I said, this is not like some Western feminists complaining about the air conditioning being too cold or pink razor blades being more expensive. These women have the people of South Africa have a genuine problem. This is not the way to solve that. Right. So that's what's interesting is I would agree in some far-fetched way that men are trash, right? But that's that extends to all human beings is what I would say. Like the implication is that men are trash and somehow women are just kind of the sub implication of that whole notion I find. And that's what I find is ridiculous. You know, if you believe that all humans are kind of an elite flawed, I guess, but that's not what they're trying to say. No, I think it's like they're trying to bring in the like hashtag men are trash. And the reason why like this person said they're they're not saying a sum when I saw people lashing out of the idea that hashtag not all men is because even if you're not yourself a rapist, they still see you as complicit in the system. You know, they they ask like, Oh, what about your brothers, your fathers, your sons? Are you pointing out all the harm they're doing to women? You're not being as a man proactive enough and trying to help us solve this. But I mean, at the same time, if we start to blame people in a group for crimes, they have not committed. Where does that end? Right? A lot of people will say, well, women in South Africa, you know, these are these are your sons. These are your brothers. These are your boyfriends. Why aren't you doing enough? So it's just, I understand why people are upset about this. And it's if you're trying to raise awareness, then trash talking, the very people who you're going to need to help you, not a great way to start out. And I think the problem is that they're looking to fourth way feminism to solve a real problem. And that's not fourth way feminism strength. No, no, not at all. Well, especially from this lens, for this problem, I think the reality is male violence happens mostly to males. Right? It's overwhelmingly you're overwhelming, more likely to be the victim of violence. If you're a male, you know, of course, I think that it's particularly reprehensible. If you are committing violence against someone like a woman or child, or even someone who's just weaker than you in general, it's just that there's an imbalance there, I think definitely that's, you know, something worth addressing. But the reality is the problem is widespread violence, right? And I mean, it's less violence than we've ever had before. But at the same time, the lens that you're looking at it through is how does this affect women's specifically? And that's what makes the situation hard, right? Because South Africa in general is a violent place, right? Like that's a rape capital. It's also one of the murder capitals, one of the theft capitals. And we can agree that males commit far more violence than women women. That's true. That's true. But I mean, there's also like you're painting a lens where it's like all the men in this country are out committing crimes where women are, yeah, actually, like these angels where it's like, I'm sorry, a crime-ridden prop populace is a crime-ridden populace. That's not to justify or say it's okay that anyone has heard or anything like that. But it's like you have a societal problem in South Africa. And fourth way feminism's tactics of saying men are trash is not going to get you out of this, right? If we're talking about how do we make South Africa safer for women? I mean, frankly, it takes a holistic development approach. Like, I don't know, improve education, eliminate corruption, encourage foreign direct investment for companies. Like, I mean, not an easy thing to solve, granted. Fourth way feminism's tactics, sorry, ladies, it's not going to get you there. We have some tweets of people who were tweeting under the hashtag here. Here we have a man, Mothana, Wangalatu. Again, apologies. I'm sure I'm pronouncing these wrong. He says, men should not be concerned about being labeled as hashtag men are trash, but men should be concerned with horrible tragedies done by our fellow friends and brothers. We should do our best to address and to eradicate the inhumane acts and behavior. I totally agree with that, but I'm not sure why like they're making it seem like either or. Like, I'm not sure why you can absolutely draw attention to these problems without calling people trash. It's a weird dichotomy they're bringing up. Here's a Facebook post by someone named Tumelo Mogale. I find this hashtag not all men are trash thing funny. Hashtag men are trash is a movement against patriarchy, rape, culture, sexism, and female abuse. What is hashtag not all men are trash about? Defending male dignity? Who said anything about your dignity? Hashtag men are trash was never an attack on male dignity. Seems that it. Yeah. Why would you call I mean, these are, I mean, it seems like the same ideology of people who complain about things like history being gendered language. They like, they can't understand why on earth someone would be offended by saying hashtag men are trash. Okay. She continues, you've created a response movement that isn't even a response to what we are saying. We are saying women are being raped and killed. You are saying, but I'm a decent guy. Do you see that we aren't even having a conversation here at all? You are not listening. That's your biggest liability. Well, I feel like they're not maybe you should be worth listening to, you know, yes, exactly. Yeah, it is just like you've, this is why this isn't going to work. You've automatically put yourself at odds with the people who who's help you're trying to elicit. It's like, well, no, that's not going to work. And I'm sure there's people out there who are going to be, oh, you know, you're just like, they're trying to do something real, like solve rape. And you're just complaining that they're being mean to men. No, I'm not. I'm trying to help them solve this problem by telling them that they're doing an awful job of it right now because it's not going to help. Brett, something on Twitter says, STF you if you are not educated enough on the matter, you do not need to add your two cents. Nobody thinks your revolution is with your hashtag, not all men. Just so that you know, in case you didn't understand that, when he says, if you're not educated enough on the matter is means if you do not hold my opinion. Right. I thought that way. We had saying, yeah. Someone said it before hashtag men are trash is a movement against patriarchy, rape culture, sexism, and female abuse. F you if you if you think hashtag men are trash is too generalizing the protection of women and children is more important. I love like they're presenting again this false dichotomy. We call all men trash or we fail to protect women and children. Like, why is that? Why is that the option? It's like the men in the Titanic all took the lifeboats away. Yeah. That I would have agreed with them some degree sort of thing, but I mean, come on, this is ridiculous. Yeah. And so, I mean, ultimately, I feel like feminist circles have been expanding, like worldwide. I mean, in universities in South Africa, I was watching some of the videos that were posted under this hashtag. They are spouting the exact same Western talking points, but it's kind of worrying because it's like, like I said before, this isn't going to help you guys. Like, fourth way feminism was born out of a very cushy, very, I don't know, privileged environment. Yeah. So you try to take it and translate it into an area where you actually have real problems. It's not it's not going to turn out good. Yeah. And it's really too bad. Because like I said, this South Africa, like it does need the help if nothing else watching this segment. I hope we've helped raise awareness about this. A lot more effective than saying men are trash. All right. So the next segment, gosh, okay. So Twitter treasure trove of content for us earlier this week. There was a pretty interesting video going around on social media. Raisa my brows certainly got my attention. Dave Suzuki, right? Yeah, the David Suzuki Foundation, which is like an environmentalist foundation. They're they're active in Canada in the US. Not quite sure about about Europe, but they released this video clip. We have it here. So this is it HQ or headquarters for those who don't know. Every part of the machine is integral. Can't save the world without coffee. And that's we pulled kids across Canada and asked them to rank election issues in order of priority. 74% rights climate change is the issue most important to them. Climate scientists are now seeing the only of 12 years left hacked if we want to avoid catastrophic damage. That's why we're lobbying the federal government to lower the voting age from 18 to 8. Let the kids go. Let the kids go. Let the kids go. Let the kids go. Let the kids go. They are the future. It is our say. If we work together. Sorry. It's just a little pitchy. So let's try it again. You're pitching. Okay, from the top. They are future. They deserve a say. If we work together. We can lure theolds. Five two three torpedo. These kids are not here to carry on. Let the kids vote. Let the kids vote. Let the kids vote. Let the kids vote. Let the kids vote. So before we even go into whether this is a joke, this is a joke or not, I just want to establish that either way it's still exploiting kids for political gains, right? Whether this is a meme or not, I mean this is still like kids didn't write that video, they didn't shoot it, they didn't edit it, they didn't post it, this is adults who are larping and trying to use their kids to advocate for a cause that they support. Much like that, what's that young girl that's so? Greta Thunberg I think is how you say it. Right, like that whole thing. Yeah, so it's like they bring out children to try to emotionally manipulate you and then if you have any criticism, it's like how can you attack kids? By the way, it's not even. I love that, it's actually great. It's like human shields as children but for your political. And it's not even in my opinion effective emotional manipulation because when it comes to climate change, I think it's like I'm pro environment, I want us to reduce waste, I want us to have, you know, frankly, I think the conservative position should be you want to conserve the environment. That's what I would think. There's a weird kind of dichotomy there but you know, within reason of course, I'm not talking about people that socialism as corporations, I mean a lot of the initiatives that I've seen which have been really fascinating have actually been to save corporations money on things like excessive packaging, excessive ink design things like that. So not only is it good for the environment reducing waste, but you're actually reducing your own costs which is pretty cool. But yeah, I mean it's like if I did want to emotionally manipulate people in order to save the environment, let's just say that I did. I feel like the, you know, showing people footage of bleach coral, like animals swimming in trash, that is like way more effective in my opinion and actually like shows you what you're doing rather than just like here's some children. Look at the children. Yeah, I just ridiculous. And it's like I've, I think the only environmental issue we've really talked about and been critical critical of on this show is the Green New Deal. I don't, I don't remember any other things because I was posting about it's barely about it's barely about the environment. Yeah, I agree. And I was posting about this on social media and someone said, well, it's just because you hate the environment, you're always anti-environment. It's like literally only thing regarding the environment. I've not been on board with is the Green New Deal because it tries to push social, socialism and then like any type of environmentalist, like a little asterisk. So yeah, I mean, I hate this like fear mongering child exploiting a pro-socialism branch of environmentalism that has seemingly taken over. Well, they said like vote like a kid, right? Yeah, which is funny because to me, like humans really identify with things for two reasons. One is because they get attention with it and they might like it, I guess is the third one, but they get attention for it. And that happens even for adults if you know you get attention from being transgender, you're more likely to be transgender, for instance, I'm not saying that's the case for everybody don't get me wrong. But kids obviously in this situation are going to get attention for it. But there's also something unique about kids who when they really believe something, it's generally because adults told them that it's important to believe that, right? Yeah, well, that's we did an entire video about why it's wrong to exploit kids for political purposes. And like in that video, they say like, you're this many percent of eight year olds believe this. I don't care what eight year olds believe you're like that. Yeah, about anything. Like I'm sorry, I'm someone who actually thinks the voting voting age should be raised to 30. Or you know, like mid 20s at least because we actually understand neurologically, people are still developing up until it's like, I don't give a crap. I'm sorry. What an eight year old with a 16 year old says we should care about. Like the only reason you care is because you think that you can like emotionally manipulate the rest of us say like, Oh, see, they want to say the environment like they're going to die unless like it's it's ridiculous. That's how I felt about the parkland kids as well, Frank. Yeah, no, but I'm from an every angle too. Like it just we're exploiting people that agree with us for every political gain possible. And I think it's shameful, frankly. Yeah, and it's I mean, it's just it's so transparent as well because like, there's a reason why like no one is really saying like, Hey, let's give kids beer younger. Hey, let's give kids drivers licenses younger. Let's make kids allowed to sign contracts younger. This only really comes up when it comes to voting and political issues. Because then it's convenient, but when it comes to other metrics of which we're supposed to trust children, sexual consent, there's a bit like then everyone's like, no, no older is better. It's like, ha ha, I see what you're doing. So like, obviously this video came out, it got ratioed to all hell. No one liked it. I think like it was it was very, very pitiful. But some people are saying like, no, come on guys, this is obviously just a joke. Why are you taking everything so serious? Okay, this from the people who thought Ali Stuckey's mock interview with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was a, what did they call it? A doctored video. So like, don't even pull that. But anyway, we went on to their site. And we have this is like, this is the paragraph that kind of greets you as soon as you go on to 18 to 8.ca, which is the website they're promoting. And it says you think kids voting is crazy, doing nothing is crazier. Says we are a group of Canadian kids who want to tackle climate change in the voting booth. We are the future of this planet. And we're not going to just sit back and watch as it gets destroyed. While grownups are worried about grown up things like gas prices and political popularity contests, we're passionate about protecting the natural world our home and are willing to prioritize a livable climate overall issues. So this whole thing, they're lark, what we have is like adult activists larping as children. So again, like, you can say it's a joke if you want whatever on the site, first thing they're still larping, they're still in character. Maybe some people believe it actually is children's clearly not. And in the like, I guess like FAQ section, it continues like, are you serious about the future of our planet when it asks, is this serious? We need to reduce global emissions by half by 2030. And we're not on track. Time to get serious. It's really only when you go to the take action section of the site where they admit, quote, okay, we're not actually lobbying to give eight year olds the vote, nor are you eight year olds writing this obviously they don't say that but it's true. But there are some things you can do to right now to help us. If you're not a kid, vote like one. Yeah, even that like you could say it's a joke. It's still stupid. Like it's the whole premise is stupid. Don't vote like a kid. What kids would actually vote for if they could would be like more nap time free candy for anything and like socialists, they would actually believe it's free because candy and Medicare just grows on trees. So this is just like, it's an awful idea. I don't know who, but clearly multiple people must have been involved in planning this. I don't know how this got got past approval. Our partners at the David Suzuki Foundation share our passion and our vision for the future of the planet. They are asking Canadians to prioritize climate change above all other issues. And like it, see, I think it's the yellow jackets and Daisy cousins did a video about Greta Thunberg where she mentioned this. You know, the elites are worried about the end of the world. Every day people are worried about the end of the month. So I'm like, I'm one of those people who absolutely wants to do what's right for the environment. But at the same time when people say things like prioritize climate change above all other issues where they're willing to send a new new economy in order to lower emissions, it's like, you can't expect the average person who's really concerned about feeding their family to get on board with that. And you know, protecting the environment, taking care of our families, it's not really either or, but these people seem to want to make it either or because they're the things they're proposing are really that extreme. Right. And then also on the website. So what they really want to do is they have a pledge here and they want you to sign it and send it off to a whole bunch of people. This is a, this is for the Canadian government specifically. And looking through the list of demands, it's really, really interesting because there are some themes that also we see, we saw rather in the Green New Deal. So it says, dear recipient name will go here. I demand that any government that represents me must implement a strong and credible climate action plan that meets our international commitments to keep global warming below catastrophic levels. Okay. Not a fan of international commitments. You guys know that you've maybe seen my videos about the UN, but okay, overall, whatever. That's about climate change. That one's fine. Yeah. Then this is where this gets interesting. Number two, establish economic equality and ensure social justice. Hold up a second. I thought we were talking about the environment here. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Like this is okay. First you were like, oh, we want kids to be able to vote. Just kidding. We actually just care about climate change here. Sign this petition. Just kidding. We actually demand economic equality and social justice. Like, what? Yeah. Why? What is with why do these things always put together now? The people are just to read that far. This is ridiculous. I mean, it's like, it's like what a scikat Chakra party AOC is. I think former chief of staff now was saying about the Green New Deal. It's not actually about the environment. They wanted a method to introduce like far left policies, like socialism environment was just like part of it. This is like, you can't just like slip the economic equality in there. It's like a really big thing. Goodness. The third one is also strange. Respect and promote the inherent rights of Indigenous peoples outlined in the UN declaration and on the rights of Indigenous peoples. Okay. I mean, that's another one in there. It's like, what does that have to do with climate change? I'm having trouble with that. It was because Indigenous peoples like live in harmony with nature as the stereotype goes. So, you know, by giving them all of their rights, then we'll be fine. It's like Avatar. No, yeah. Exactly like that. Okay. Another one restore native biodiversity to healthy sustainable levels. Okay. That actually is about the environment. So, it's fine. Insure a livable planet for our children. All right. So, like, yeah, the rest of it is fine, but it's like those, especially the social and economic quality. Yeah. That's a pretty, yeah, pretty big one. So, I guess what I'm trying to say here is not this video is stupid. Therefore, let's hate any environmental efforts because that's not true. But I think we do need to kind of notice that there are a lot of these environmental groups popping up or environmental activists. I would include AOC in this who have a very catastrophic view of what's going to happen with climate change, which, you know, I believe in climate change, but I also think like 12 years and then we're screwed. I don't know about that. I don't know for a while now. Yeah, exactly. And they're, yeah, they're trying to use, I guess, our concern and our action toward the environment to install like far left policies. It's so strange to me how those have become like married. It's kind of like the atheism plus movement, where it's like atheism also joined with social justice. Now we have like environmentalism plus where it's like environmentalism plus social justice. There's a huge overlap there. It's weird. It's weird. Like, why don't get why those need to be the same thing? And it's like you're politicizing climate change when you really shouldn't be. I think of you were just like sticking to. It's sticking to by partisan, right? Yeah, sticking to scientific facts and not going overboard with what you expect from people. This would go a lot more smoothly beyond Lombork of the Copenhagen consensus is an environmentalist who I really like because he obviously cares very much about things like conservation, but he's also not a crazy person. He's an economist. I think. Yeah, exactly. So he recognizes that anything you do, there's costs and benefit, right? Is it worth spending all of this money to reduce emissions this much? If it means, you know, you're going to recap it on like every third world economy. Maybe we try to think of a different way to do it. So yeah, I guess in conclusion, my advice to you, gentle viewer is donate other places. Hello, David's. I'm joking. Not the David Suzuki Foundation. Not only just donate other like, I think there are a lot of environmental groups out there. Watch where you're giving your money to don't assume. Oh, they're pro environment. Therefore, they're, you know, I mean, there are you know, it's what's a great way of doing it is hunting hunters are some of the best conservationists in North America at least. Although don't bring that up to your vegan aunt as Liam found out because apparently that's I don't know why you thought that would be a good idea. I don't know. I thought she had never met. Anyway, so yeah, also, I mean, if you're looking to spend money on, I guess, environmentalism, there are a ton of like zoos. I know the eco museum and Montreal, they care for local animals that work on local conservation efforts or even just in, you know, investing in something in your own lives that works on reducing the amount of waste you produce could also be way more useful than signing this pledge to, I guess, let eight-year-olds vote and install socialism. Yeah. All right, so we move on to Kristen Stewart. If you don't know who she is, she was the actress who played Bella Swan in Twilight, i.e. like the girl in Twilight. There was like the boy vampire who fell in love with the girl. She's the girl. She's also been in some other stuff. She's an interview or she did an interview recently where she talked about how her sexuality might have impacted her getting a role in a Marvel film. We have some of that from USA Today. The article is called Kristen Stewart said she was told, quote, you might get a Marvel movie if she and girlfriend nixed PDA. So this writer says that quote, Kristen Stewart says there was a time when she was warned that her sexual orientation was negatively impacting her career. I have been fully told if you just like do yourself a favor and that's her speaking, not me. And don't go out holding your girlfriend's hand in public. You might get a Marvel movie Stewart remembered in an interview with Harper's Bazaar UK. I don't want to work with people like that. The Charlie's Angels actress also explained why she doesn't shy away from talking about her sexuality in order to openly experience her existence. That's a experience, your existence. They talk a lot like that. It's very I don't know what that means. Very feely. But let's let's experience her existence together. I think I just want to enjoy my life and that took precedence over protecting my life because in protecting it, I was ruining it. She said, I don't know what that means, but that's okay. Like what you can't go outside with who you're with. You can't talk about it in an interview. I was informed by an old school mentality. She continued, which is you want to preserve your career and your success and your productivity. And there are people in the world who don't like you and they don't like that you take girls and they don't like that you don't identify as quote unquote lesbian. But you also don't identify as quote unquote heterosexual. And people like to know stuff. So what the f are you Stewart, however, does not adhere to a label and chooses instead to just embrace who she is. I just think we're all kind of getting to a place where I don't know, evolution's a weird thing. We're all becoming incredibly ambiguous, she said. And this is a really gorgeous thing. I feel like what we're seeing in modern societies is the exact opposite of evolution, which preaches like survival of the fittest. We have become so like soft and protected that it's like the most inept incompetence, like unable to survive really are what's flourishing. It's yeah, you really want to limit the people that are fittest. Yeah. Right now. So okay, look, I feel like this interview would be kind of like if I said, oh, I was told I could have gotten a recording deal with Sony, but I mixed race so I didn't. Like maybe that's true. But at the same time, there's also probably other reasons why I wasn't offered a recording deal with Sony, right? It's like, you know, was the opportunity really there? Like, was that it? Because I mean, no offense to Kristen Stewart. But we've seen Kristen Stewart's movies and like, I mean, she was fine in Twilight. She like, because she she does that like awkward like, but in the other movies, it's like her like kind of like awkward, breathy, like emo vibe. Like, she does that. Yeah, that's fine. It worked. Yeah, it worked in Twilight. And then I also saw her in The Runaways, which is like that a biopic with Joan Jett. And she played Joan Jett. And she was fine. And that too, it worked with that. But it's like, she's like Seth Rogen. I think she just plays herself, which is fine in some movies. That Snow White movie she was in was was weird casting choice. Yeah, that's why I saw that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She can noodle the director in that one. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So I guess that explains a questionable casting choice. But I mean, yeah, the thing about like Marvel movies is that they do have almost a comedic, they're not comedies, but they're kind of lighthearted. And I just I have trouble picturing her with Thor, like, you know, with Chris Hemsworth, just kind of. Well, she's also just trying to victimize herself into a role. Right. That's the other thing. It's like that. And that's like, it's almost like what the feminists were doing in our first piece. Yeah, like men were victims here help us now, but it actually works in the industry to some degree, right? Where they need to prove, oh, no, we're not actually against bisexualism. We will. Well, that's why I thought it was a strange comment to make, especially since Marvel is woke, like Marvel is pretty dang woke. I mean, the new character they have will not really knew it's been like two movies now Valkyrie. You don't know this because you don't watch any movies, but in Thor or like among Thor's entourage, there's a character Valkyrie who is like a black woman. And I think the the North mythology, I think that was in that, right? Yeah, exactly. The actress mentioned that she had filmed a scene where her character was like queer. And I think the actress is as well. So, I mean, never mind the whole Captain Marvel fiasco. So Marvel seems pretty woke. I don't know. It seems strange to single them out as like they're the like promoting the heteronormativity in the industry and they don't want wanted to work anyone who's not straight or something. Don't quote me on this, but I think I saw a video might have been from the quartering or something like that. I just headline I would say that they might have an all female Marvel movie. I think I saw that too. So I don't know if that's true or not, but that's the wokeness level of Marvel at this point. Yeah. And in case anyone is wondering, not that I really, I don't think you're wondering, um, what Kristen Stewart is doing now, like this interview or the article mentioned, she's actually starring in one of the upcoming Charlie, Charlie's Angels reboot, which no one asked for, but it's happening. And it's a, it's got a female Bosley. It's modern. We have part of the trailer for that. And granted, she didn't write this. So let's all, you know, give her some slack, but also just the delivery. All right. Let's check it out. I think women can do anything just because they can. It doesn't mean they should. I have so many talents. It's like I'm powerful. The little finger. Oh, I just, I just the decoy stuff. That's just the way you make me feel who still you're managing. Outstanding angels. It's just like the comedic timing is, is not there. I don't know. I, I, I don't see it. Um, I'm sure this movie will do well. I mean, it's, it's hitting all of the, like the markers that we've seen have really historically encouraged a movie's growth. I mean, like they're bringing up the feminism line, like right on the get go, very awkward action scenes. Just, it's going to be good. Um, so yeah, I mean, the, the, the only thing I can really think of is that of course, when it comes to movies, I think more so than TV or even music. Um, studios are reliant on places like China in order to make their money back. Yeah. And I know that like if it comes to a movie and you want access to the Chinese market, there are a whole bunch of stipulations you need to make like you can't, it can't be ghost centric. Chinese government doesn't like that. Um, and there are a bunch of other things. Very specific things. Yeah. It's like you had, it's better if you have some sort of Chinese influence, like a funding or an actor. That's why Independence Day had that actor. That's why I think there are some Star Wars films recently that also had Chinese because they want access to the Chinese market. So I have transformer movies. They had like Chinese generals and stuff like that. Yeah. Are you filming China? Yeah. Like they have like a nationalist policy when it comes to film. They want, they're only going to let you into their huge market if you can do something for them. Um, so I mean, yeah, maybe that would be why people supposedly were, were saying her to cool, cool off with the bisexuality. But I mean, I, I don't know, I could easily see it just being, she's kind of uncomfortable to watch. I mean, in China, I think it's frowned upon, and correct me if I'm wrong, but to PDA, you would lose social points if you're, if you're a public displays of affectionate with even straight couples, right? Like there's not a, Chinese culture is very, very anti-PDA. Like it's, it's not something that you see. But I mean, I don't know, I just, I don't know how much that would translate to an actress who it's, it's not like she's Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears. Those are really old examples. But you know, the, the people who are in the media, the tabloids every day doing crazy things, I don't know, maybe Kristen Stewart is just being deprived of her well-earned Marvel roles because of her sexuality. Maybe. I deserve my Marvel roles. Yeah, maybe it's because she's kind of awkward and doesn't have much, much death. And isn't that good looking considering? But whatever, who, who are we to say best of luck in the new Charlie's Angels movies, I suppose? All right, so to finish off the evening, we have a story that actually involves us. Strangely enough. Yeah, so this past weekend was Mines IRL. It took place in New Jersey. It's, it was a conference that was put on by Mythus is Milwaukee, the guys who host MythCon. They're here on YouTube as well. Mines.com, the social media platform, founded by Bill Oppmann and Subverse, which is Tim Poole's, I guess like journalism company. Company? Yeah, so it was a one day conference featuring a bunch of different political commentators of different political beliefs, liberals, progressive, centrist, conservatives, all that. And the panels were issues like immigration, corporate activism, prohibition was one. Political violence was another comedy, future of comedy was one that I know Count Dankula was on and you know, Ruka Ruka Ali. So there were a bunch of a lot of the people who are speaking were YouTubers. And so obviously I think to most people that sounds like a lovely, if maybe even somewhat unassuming event, right? Like, oh, that's nice. The political conference. Have fun, I guess. However, because we were living in a time where reactionary morons who are also authoritarian roam the internet completely unchecked, we cannot have nice things. We really can't. So if you guys were keeping up with this, this event was announced months ago, really, really months ago, and it was completely fine. But yeah, we've been promoted for ages, it feels like. Mm hmm. And thank you for everyone that showed up. Yeah, got to meet some of you guys, which was really cool. But what happened was just around like kind of closing in on a month before the event, people started freaking out by people. I mean, like a tiny subsection of the population. I think New Jersey calls Antifa terrorists. So they're not officially Antifa, but They just have different names. Yeah, they did by any other name. It is it is that kind of people. They actually managed to get the original venue to cancel to pull out of their contract. I think the organizers are considering legal action against them now because you can't just pull out of a contract. We ended up getting a different venue, but because of all the, you know, there were threats and harassment, we as speakers only found out like the night before and people were like told two hours beforehand where to go, just so that the, you know, there wouldn't be this huge push trying to get the venue to cancel, emailing them, calling them, showing up. So anyway, the event happened. It was wonderful. But and the new venue was terrific, by the way, it was a casino, a casino security guys, not mess around. Yeah, they're not going to take any any guff from any Antifa. So that that was all great. And we had an after party afterwards, which is also amazing. But the thing is the bar that was hosting was the same bar that was originally publicized. And those people would not let up on those poor, poor owners and actually like having seen them interact with anybody and meet with them. We met their son. It's just, it was heartbreaking to hear about how they had been harassed simply for fulfilling a contractual obligation to host a party. Yes, that's all that that is their great crime. You know, people actually at that after party ended up to show up to protest. They were very low energy. They did do that like fascist KKK race, Nazi, yeah, there was like four from chanting the group of 50 and the like, yeah, very low energy. They only started chanting once we arrived. And then like, as soon as we went in, they also stopped. Because it's like, I guess they didn't have energy to keep it up all night long by the time it was over, they had left. But Melissa Chin, who is apparently my doppelganger, people mistake me for her all the time. I look nothing like her. She's full Asian. Also just like a different person all around. Anyway, she wrote an article describing everything the venue that bar had gone through leading up to this event and even afterwards. And it's, it's, I don't know, it makes me emotional, makes me really upset just thinking about these small business owners. It's from the spectator. The article she wrote is how a New Jersey brewery unwittingly became the latest culture war battleground. She writes the ensuing ordeal has transformed their story. She's talking about the whole thing trying to get the event canceled. She's talking about the owners of the bar has transferred their story into yet another cultural flashpoint in the wider outrage mob fueled political and culture war. We've been getting terrible reviews on Google as far as like, these guys are Nazis, Nazi supporters, and they started a call campaign against us, Rich said, who's one of the owners. They were three days solid a phone calls after phone call from as far away as San Francisco. A few names on the conference agenda were singled out. Carl Benjamin, aka Sargon of Akkad and Count Dankula, a controversial online personality, both of whom are members of UKIP, a right wing anti immigration party. This car Rich Myers completely off guard. So he decided to take a closer look at the minds IRL speakers. When we host events, we don't ask many questions. They tell us if it's a wedding or christening or baby shower, as far as details about guests, we don't care. He said, so that's pretty reasonable to me, right? Because you're a venue and people like, Hey, can I have a party here? I mean, do you want them to give out like, Hey, we have a questionnaire, we know we're gonna need you to give to all of your guests? You hold the correct beliefs just to make sure we're politically aligned. But then after that, that's sure. I mean, I think these people would actually say, yeah, that's reasonable. Like let's do of course. Yeah, they're insane. The first speaker he researched was Tara Devlin, a comedian and progressive commentator who founded the unapologetically liberal website Republican dirty tricks.com, stumbling upon a YouTube video where she opened with the phrase or here or queer get used to it, Rich founded in agreement with the protesters accusations. And so he went down the political YouTube wrap whole consuming video after video for three days straight just to get a better idea of the people who were going to be attending this maligned after party. It was clear that there was just no way this was a white supremacy meeting. He said, you don't bring in gay people, black people, trans people, the gambit of people that were represented by this or the number of women that were represented by this made the protesters claims extremely unlikely. I like that extremely unlikely. Maybe there's still not see white supremacists, but I like this guy. He's like, it's looking a little more doubtful. You would think the protesters themselves would have that same, I don't know, critical thinking ability. Apparently not. Megan Myers, whose personal social media accounts were linked to the breweries business page and she's the other owner, faced a barrage of personal insults online. She was first accused of hosting Nazis and before long the charges evolved and escalated to her being called a Nazi herself. As a Jewish woman, she considers the malicious use of the epithet Nazi morally unconscionable. You cannot idly use the word Nazi and not offend me, she said, rich agrees I had family disappear in Germany in World War two. There are a couple of ancestry lines that stopped around the time of concentration camps to be throwing these words out. It's really offensive. Not the kind on the border of Mexico, by the way. Yeah, like the actual kind of this is like it's so sad to see because these are people who and the article mentions earlier on that like they didn't even have Twitter accounts. So they are completely not in this whole crazy culture where they're just regular people who own a business and they're actually liberal. Like the the bathrooms there are individual stall unisex bathrooms that just say human instead of like male or female. So it's like they're just regular normies who own a bar open to hosting events and all of a sudden these crazy people are trying to get them to back out of a contract which by the way you're not allowed to do. If you sign a contract you can't just be like I'm flaking. And they're calling them Nazis. I mean I think you and I are kind of used to being called a Nazis by this point unfortunately but to the average person, like that must be shocking for them. And I'm so appalled that these people didn't have like the first thing the guy did Rich did after he started hearing all of that all this was go and look at the speaker's list. Apparently these people who had enough time on their hands where they were calling for a three day straight and managed to show up for a few hours to protest. They didn't even bother to do that clearly because otherwise they would know that there were no white supremacists. Yeah. Well one of the things that one of the event organizers told us and shout out to all of them by the way that was terrifically managed and especially with the quick turnaround on the venues they had a very short window of time to find another one because the other one backed out. And also the Sugar House Casino was terrific by the way. But he was saying that because multiple speakers did not end up showing up because of in large part. All the threats and the controversy. Yeah. That would happen. And of those speakers, there were all women. Some of them were women of color, some of them trans women like white for example. And queer as well. Right. And it's like you're so open and tolerant that you're actually your threats of violence are scaring away women, women of color LGBT women from speaking. Like I hope you're happy. Like you guys are so unbelievable. And they were also pointed out that like if you looked at the list of speakers on minds, it was like more than half women. Lots of people of color on there. You know, in fact what ended up happening was I think it was what's named Daryl. Daryl Davis. Yeah. The gentleman who would speak to KK members basically and convert them away from. Yeah, he's amazing. He like has befriended over I think 20 KK members or I think it's more. I think it's more. I thought it was 200. Yeah, I think that's right. Yeah, 200 KK members and convinced them to hang up their robes just by being friends with them. So he was one of the speakers. And it's like these people didn't care. It's still a racist Nazi event because Sargon. Ooh, Sargon is speaking. And it's like, I mean, these people, I don't know how they function in their day to day lives with their, I guess, critical thinking being as low as it clearly is like I'm actually worried about them. Do you look both ways before crossing traffic? Maybe not because I mean, if you didn't, I wouldn't be surprised based on the behavior I've seen from you. It's ridiculous. And so like this article mentions this the bar, the human village brewing brewing company, they are now getting review bombed. Yelp actually did take action to remove the people who were just calling them Nazis and who clearly had never been there. But Facebook and I think Google as well haven't been as diligent. And this article finishes off with the while the human village brewing company owners receive a lot of in-person support. They're concerned about how they've been represented on the internet. There are so many who are activists against something, but we need the activists who stand for the things they support. Megan said, where are supporters writing reviews online and countering the bad ones? Okay, so what I have homework for everybody watching this, what I need you to do is if you were there at the afterparty, if you've been to human village brewing company in Pittman, New Jersey, I need you to go online on Facebook or on Google and leave them a good review because these these are good people. Like I don't even drink beer. They had like homemade that was really good. The night of the afterparty they ran out of that cream soda and then all the beers made on site. Yeah, and they were also like offering to make people who didn't drink beer like tea, which they didn't need to do, but they were just like that they were great people. And it's so frustrating to see them caught in the middle of this. And they're being review bombed by people from all over the country and perhaps even internationally that are involved in this. Who like clearly, they've never been to this establishment. They obviously don't know what the event was. They're just acting making up a lot of stuff. They're making up a lot of stuff. We have some of these reviews here. I mean, you can go online and look at there's a ton of them. We just took some of them since from their Facebook page, this guy Brian D powers who looks like he would write something like this. No offense. Actually, no, some offense screw this guy. He says they hosted an openly white supremacist gathering at this establishment. After an attendees after an attendee shouted white power, they posted about how it was a great event. Really? Was there a presentation on pedophilia from these sickos they hosted a trash bar run by racist? I'd rather drink turpentine. Okay, no one shouted white power. Don't let us stop you, Brian. Yeah, I mean, no one shouted white power. The thing about pedophilia, I think it's like that that smear campaign that one of the British tabloids, I'm calling it a tabloid, ran against sargon. It's like you. Okay, openly white supremacist gathering. This is it's so ridiculous. And you know what? I hope that some of the progressives that were there at these event at this event, like frankly, most of the people speaking were liberals, right? Because like aside from me, Daisy Hunter. Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying they're like, S street, most people were actually W's. That's not true. But most people were on the left. There were some progressives. I hope the progressive progressives take note of this. They're calling you your panels openly white supremacists. Like if that doesn't red pill them, I don't know what will. So ridiculous. This person Megan brand we she doesn't recommend human village either. She says would be a nice place if it weren't for all the Nazis, they're harboring. And this other person says this would be a bit more believable if the owners weren't of Jewish heritage. Thank you for for using some critical thinking skills there. Twitch Megan replies, doesn't matter. If folks start throwing Zeke Hiles in your establishment and you don't kick them out, I'm never setting foot in there again. Okay. No one was throwing any Zeke Hiles. Yeah. And first of all, you you never set foot. No, let's be real. You don't use the word again, please. And what was really interesting in a lot of people who were at the event notice this too, is that like inside inside the bar during the afterparty, there were white people, mixed people, black people, Asian, Hispanic people. I met this lovely Pakistani guy like we were all all different types of ethnicities and not only ethnicities were all different types of belief systems. You know, I met some of you guys who were centrist, but still watched us like there are progressives, other conservatives, like all all types of belief systems. The only like sort of like racially homogenous white authoritarians that were there at this event were the protesters. I say that 100% seriously, they were, I think the redhead libertarian said they were wider than a Billy Idol song about weddings. Okay. That's how white these people were. And it's like, I'm not saying that, you know, because like I'm mixed, I can't be a racist. I'm saying I'm not racist because I've never said anything racist and I was happily hanging out with people of different races. So it's so crazy. Okay. We have another one though. Michael last day says this business happily accommodated the social gathering of a far right conference masquerading as an anti-racist event. We were so good at masquerading as an anti-racist event. We said nothing racist had panels about combating racism and featured one of the most prolific, I think anti-racism activists that is alive right now. Okay. He says, shame on you for not listening to your community. Like what community? And that's something that the owners owner said too. Like they were getting calls from Seattle, San Francisco. Like these people were not from, and this is by the way, Tim Poole has made videos about this who held organized to put this thing together. He actually lives lives there. These people live there. So what happens is that we have these authoritarians who are from the other side of the country, if the same country at all, trying to dictate what this business can or cannot do. Unbelievable. Shame on you for adopting and spreading these guests lies when not if someone who attended this event commits a hate crime, know that human village thought the world of themselves for allowing this person social access to their ideological peers. These people live on a different planet. And this is like, it's shocking to me how like they're so comfortable lying. Yeah, they're so comfortable. And I mean, I think for some of them, they're lazy and they're just happy to believe whatever someone tells them. Like they're not intellectually curious or rigorous. They're just like, oh, okay, you said this therefore most be true. That's some of them. But then there are some of them. There must be that are maliciously starting these lies where it's like, you didn't see it happen. But you're just going to say, right? Because the line must start from somewhere. I'm sure some of these people are just parroting what they've heard. But somewhere somewhere down the line, someone was like, I'm just going to make a bunch of stuff up. So really sad their their Yelp review. Like I said, as backup, they've kind of sanitized us a little bit. But if you're yeah, if you were there, if you've been there, please leave them positive review because they don't yeah, they don't deserve this. Lauren won't say it, but I'll say maybe if you just passed by briefly, like the worth leaving the review sort of deal, you know, wink, wink. Yeah, they need some help because they it's been pretty it's been sad. And I'll say I spoke to her at and I felt bad for her because I could tell she was definitely like this was a serious business decision for her that could have mega like really bad backlash. And she stuck by her guns. And you know, kudos to her for doing that definitely. So I would like it to be something that positive that actually gets rewarded and not not, you know, don't let the left win. Yeah, exactly. And the thing is, these people, they figured out that they can just force governments to deperson anyone they don't like, because you don't have rights. I know they don't like that. But we do. So what they're trying now is to get companies to do it. Right. And so we see this like now it's like they find their let off the government thing, but they're not going to be happy until every corporation refuses to do business with you. Until you can't get bank access. You don't think the correct things. Yeah. You know, I don't forget they're they're not just smearing the speakers. They're smearing the people who went. So like if you're watching the show right now, they think you're a Nazi too. Oh, absolutely. Well, you already knew that. You're right. I knew that. Yeah. So it's just, I don't know, we need to reward these people for not buying into the BS because it's like, look, I'm sure these people don't support me politically, but that's okay. I don't expect them to. I expect them to just be a bar, you know, good service, good drinks. And that's exactly what they did. Yeah. Why doesn't someone in the chat just throw up a link to them on Facebook and yeah, that'd be good. Thank you. Thanks. So we wanted to give them a shout out, but aside from that, I think that's pretty much all we have to say for now. Sorry about the weird camera issues. We're going to take a look at what exactly is causing that. The irony is we put in new chords. I think it's the chords. And I think it's these yeah, yeah, I think it's the new HDMI cords. All right. We're doing this. So guys, but if you're watching this on the live stream, then be sure to stay put because we're going to be back in just a few seconds with some exclusive Q&A going over all of your super chats. We'll see you in a bit. Otherwise, we'll see you next week."
