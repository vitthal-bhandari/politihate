    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you. No matter how dark things have gotten, if you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on the screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at BlazeTV.com slash The Blind. Last night, parents fought back on all accounts. Will the trend continue? We've got a lot coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to The News and Why It Matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez and I would be remiss if I did not point out that we do have, you know, it's the day after election day. The results spoke for themselves. If you guys have not yet gotten a Let's Go Brandon shirt, they are available at shop.blazemedia.com. I advise that you go get one. And by the way, you are not watching a rerun. We just have the same people here today, which is great. Because I feel like we can just add to the conversation that we have. We're showering since. I hope so. I hope so. That's so brand new. Obviously joined by BlazeTV contributors, both Jakubuians and Eric July. This should be a good show because you guys were both, as I mentioned, here yesterday when we discussed the idea of what this election, you know, election day meant as far as in Virginia and even some other places that we will get into. But what it might mean, what it might mean, how the polls were looking. And you know, as I said on the program yesterday, I didn't want to put too much stock into it because I never want to, you know, like give Democrats less credit than they deserve when it comes to fortifying the election. I do believe in their ability to fortify any election that they so choose only because they in fact themselves explained that they do fortify elections. So I don't want to like discredit them on that. So I was like, I didn't want to say it, but in fact, let's get to the first topic, which is Republican Glenn Yunken won the Virginia gubernatorial race, of course, defeated former governor. This was not the governor at the time. Obviously, he is not Ralph Northern Blackface himself. But Governor Terry McAuliffe in the Virginia governor's race. You know, this was interesting as we talked about yesterday. I can't wait to get your thoughts on this gentleman. As we talked about yesterday, this really was seen as a referendum on not just national politics, but really when it comes down to it, education, the education system. Terry McAuliffe really took issue with making sure that he supported things like CRT. He defended things like CRT. He defended the teachers unions. He even had Randy Winegarden on his last day campaigning. Had of all people, Randy Winegarden, the president of the worst teachers union ever, the national teachers union, Randy Winegarden, the devil incarnate herself campaigning for him. So you know where he stands, right? So this was largely an education issue. But Glenn Youngkin eked it out. And you know, it's interesting because this is a place where Joe Biden won Virginia by what? Over 10 percentage points. Just in 2020. And now all of a sudden, we saw Glenn Youngkin win. Now he did not, by any means I would say embrace President Trump. He maybe took a page from his playbook, but wasn't very much like, yes. Mean tweets are awesome and I'm going to be super Trumpian. But really I think focused on the issues that mattered to the Virginian people, namely education. And here we see we will have a Republican as governor in Virginia. What are your thoughts, gentlemen, on this? And I do want to get to the media's take on this. The Democrat pundits take on this after I hear from you guys because, you know, I tweeted this out last night, but it's like, are the Democrats going to learn their lesson? And like reconvene? No, they probably want. They're probably just going to double down on that, which we will see. But gentlemen, what are your thoughts on this particular election? And we can get to some of the other issues. One of the things I like most about this is this was not a Trump cartel or cocktail victory. Yeah. It was not. And we need that in our country, right? We need to just get back to the issues, truth versus lies, right versus wrong, and not a movement just from tit for tat, but an issue driven movement. And that's why yesterday I had great hope this time we won. And America see we can win elections. We won an election. A very important election because of the issues that it was won upon. The foundation of this election was, in fact, children, school choice, schools, curriculum, CRT, real critical issues that are not Virginia issues. They're national issues. They're issues for every state, for every race, whether it is a race for a mayor at the moment or a race for president. These are the issues of our day. And I think here, Virginia that's been blue, said, wait a minute, these issues actually do matter. And I'm with you. There's no way the left can walk back and pivot and go, oh, we're also for not exploiting your children. No, they can't. This is who they are, right? And so for me, it's indicative and I hope Americans now understand when we band together, like sticky rice, and we do on an issue that matters, we can actually swing this thing. Yeah, Eric. Yeah, I mean, look, yesterday was just yet another example of like the cultural awakening is more so what it is of what's happening in the public education system and the indoctrination that has been doing for very long. And that's just yet another example of that because that was not just an issue that was buried like on his platform. He ran on that. That was like the leading issue. I mean, you heard him say yesterday is like imagine that school choice when he was talking about his victory. And that was at the top basically of his list of stuff that mattered. So it showed that culturally there are cultural rather issues and they can be, you can lead with that and convince people certainly to get behind you. So this isn't even me telling you who to vote for and who not to vote for. And more so the iron's hot. Okay. Yes. People are now paying attention to this. I think what's about that happened out in Virginia starting, but with the rest of the country, we're going to be looking at this decades from now and seeing if this truly was the turning point because one or two things can happen here. You can actually deliver. More so people that could support him, those conservatives can actually push for something that is going to be a solution. Not some repackaged bull crap, which is what I fear. Now people that follow me on Twitter, I had to post that one around everywhere that said exactly that. I fear that chicken crap, that's not what I said. You know what I said. Republicans are going to get in the way of liberty and on this issue and when people start to- Which they generally always do historically, that's exactly what they do. You saw that with Common Core historically, that's exactly what they do. So if they end up doing that, we end up with another bestie to the vast situation. What does she do? Zero. She didn't absolutely- Under-tropping. Under-tropping. It's absolutely nothing. So that's what, like the iron's hot right now, I always say, look, you push for 100% no matter what. And I think what this, I mean, I use terms like abolition and that freaks some people out. But what it's ultimately about- About abolition. Yeah, well obviously not you. But what we're speaking about here is children, or rather their parents, being able to influence by way of having their money follow their children. That's ultimately what we want. If we actually extend that all the way to a logical conclusion, there seems no reason for a public school to actually exist. We want to get to the root of that. It's archaic, it's outdated. Do not look at the market right now, which is basically monopolized by the state as what it would look like on the other side in the event the public school has got rid of. This is why you have so many people having an issue with what you maybe say. And what I say when they say, well it's easier for you to say no, no. Don't look at the lens of what exists right now. We believe in markets, remember? This is a reason why we advocate for capitalism. On the other side, who knows what it's actually going to look at? We can't even say, but the idea is that your money follows that child. So this is an opportunity. More people than ever have paying attention to this issue that have been sleeping for the last decades. They now say, wait a minute, this is something that is important. Will these Republicans take advantage of that? We believe these conservatives take advantage of that. Or will they do nothing but protect the status quo, which is what I fear? And we talk about, I ain't trying to get too conspiratorial with it. We talk about controlled opposition. But when I start to hear some of them talk about what they then want, it sounds a lot like, okay, I want my guy to be in there. And we'll just remold it to, no, no, no, wait a minute. Power grab. Exactly. Another power grab. So it's a reason to be optimistic at minimum because you see that more people are paying it. It doesn't even matter how I feel about yonking or anything like that. More people are paying attention. What do we do for me? Okay, so let me just kind of branch off of that and talk about the idea. We talked about CRT. We talked about Terry McAuliffe saying basically that black students needed a black teacher to be able to teach them because I mean, that would just hurt their feelings to be taught by a white teacher. I mean, they're promoting racist ideologies there in Virginia. Now I want to get to these pundits and I want to get to what they blamed it on, which as you can imagine was like, you guys are all parents are basically white supremacists. If you are a parent in Virginia, you are obviously a white supremacist. Otherwise you would not have voted the way that you did. But I just want to point out before we get to that, I just want to point out as the Republican party did so well in Virginia, let's just kind of highlight. Who else they voted because it wasn't just Glenn Youngkin as governor, right? It was the first black female lieutenant governor, Winnesom Sears. And it was also the first Latino attorney general, Jason Miadis. So this is, this was not like a let's elect old white men. This was a new governor who happened to be a Republican, also a new lieutenant governor who happened to be a black female. I just want to reiterate a black female, also an AG who is the new attorney general who is Hispanic, Latino. And still somehow the talking point is you guys are just racist and white supremacists. Let's listen. And the exit polls showed that, which was interesting, that the coronavirus or that the virus, it was a very low. It was not an important to many voters there for a fact. It was education, which is code for white parents don't like the idea of teaching about race. And I mean, unfortunately, race is just the most palpable tool in the toolkit. Used to be of the Democratic party back in the day when there were Dixie Crats and now the Republican party, it just is powerful. Oh, it's so powerful, so powerful. And notice how she said education. The number one issue was education. How dare you guys teach your children actual education, actual history. We would prefer that you teach them things like CRT. Here is the 1619 project creator, Nicole Hannah Jones, who tweeted out yesterday, the only racial dog whistles in American politics are the one-third by the media because for the rest of the country, it's explicit. If the only educational concern in the election was the teaching of race and racism, then the issue wasn't education, it was, and is always race. And then of course we have a good friend of the program, Jamel Hill, who said, it's not the messaging folks. This country simply loves white supremacy. Guys, they love white supremacy so much that they just elected a black female lieutenant governor and a Latino attorney general. That is how much Republicans love white supremacy. That is how much parents love white supremacy when it comes to their children. I just got to say, I want to toss it to you guys, but they are not, they are not effing around. I chose my words carefully. That was me censoring myself management. They are not effing around when it comes to their children. They are done with the indoctrination. They are done with you indoctrinating them into thinking that they are racist if they are not of color. They are done with you trying to convince them that they are transgender. They are done with all of it. Let me play for you guys one more. Let me play for you, Nicole Wallace, who of course is unfortunately with MSNBC. Well, it's where she belongs, MSNBC. But she actually said that critical race theory, look, parents voted on that, I guess this was the issue, but critical race theory is not actually a real thing. I guess she just thinks it's made up. I don't know. Here's Nicole Wallace. I think we know the answer to some of this. I watched Glenn Yankin's interview on Fox News and he did nothing but Claire's. He did not, I mean, he worshipped at the altar of Donald Trump on Fox News. He flew an insurrection flag at his rallies. He simply didn't, he played dumb about a zoom rally. He did not really put much distance between himself and Donald Trump on the big lie where the deadly insurrection in which police officers were named by flagpole. So I think that the real ominous thing is that critical race theory, which isn't real, turned the suburbs 15 points to the Trump insurrection endorsed Republican. What do Democrats do about that? Yeah, turned the suburbs 15 points. I would highly suggest that Nicole Wallace keep that up. Please, please for the love of God. Keep saying that. Keep telling these parents that what they saw is not real. Keep telling them that CRT was not a real thing, that their children were not being taught racism, that they were not being indoctrinated into CRT. Please keep telling them that. Yeah, I'll go. Yeah, look, I don't know if Nicole Wallace is a mother. I can't spend two minutes of my life even even even looking into her. But what these leftists don't understand clearly, there's a gap between them and their children is this wasn't just a CRT issue. It's not about CRT. It is actually about education without quotes. It is actually about when the kid comes home from school and they spew venom and crap from the back seat and a mom wants to hit the emergency brake with what she's hearing going, oh dear God, what did you learn by who? By your teacher? Oh, hell no. This is not happening. Or the 12 year old that's addicted to porn all of a sudden because he learned it in the classroom and we can go on and on and on and on. And yes, including the indoctrination of infusing race into every conversation because that's how they divide a country. And now because the Virginians dare say, you're not going to divide us anymore. You're not going to make my son or daughter racist. You're not going to make them a homophobe or a transgender crossover or whatever, right? We're taking it back. How dare you take back your child? You're supposed to bring them to the altar of Moloch. You're supposed to sacrifice your children. We're the ones who eat and drink their blood. We're the ones who want you to just hand them over to us. How dare you? And we're saying, no, we dare. We dare. It's time. Fight me. I will go to civil war before I give my children away to the left, Eric. Look, these guys are one trick ponies. That's what we just saw in an example. There was one person on mainstream media that kind of had this epiphany by the name of Van Jones. And he was like, oh, man, there must be a disconnect between the echo chamber that we are kind of in. And the other people took you a long time to figure that out man. Van Jones, you're not representative. You try to control the information, but you're not representative of the population at large. See, the other going to try to gaslight. Yes, they're going to make it back, make it about white supremacy and all these other terms because that's all that they have. And it's starting to realize that sitting in that, okay, that tactic isn't working anymore. It's not as effective maybe as it once was, even in the previous election cycle, we don't have a backup plan, guys. We don't have a backup plan. So if they stop listening to us, they have to double down because they don't have anything else. They don't have anything else. That's it. This is all they have. So as long people wake up to this nonsense in terms of what it is, it rejected. This is why I say, I know people like they know that I'm running around the edges. I don't like that I cuss these people out and I make fun of them and all that stuff. I'm trying to delegitimize their institutions, guys. They should be mocked. They should be shamed. They should be laughed at. They're evil. Number one, but they should be laughed at because they should be delegitimize. They think they have all this control. And unfortunately, a lot of people have been tricked in believing that, but you're seeing with this Virginia election that they don't have as much power as we think or rather they speak into existence because you see when their tactics are not as effective, they have no backup plan. Yeah, it's a smoke and mirror trick. Right. And all of a sudden we're seeing behind the smoke. Yeah. People going, maybe, maybe they're not as powerful as people. I feel like the same parents who in 2020 were like, maybe we don't want mean tweets are like, all right, if the choice is mean tweets or the left indoctrinating our children into this transgender, radical, racist ideology, I'll take the frickin mean tweets. Can I have a redo? Exactly. Right. And we've got more to come on that because Virginia was not the only place where there were things happening in elections that you need to know about. First, we want to think our sponsor keeps. So how will you know when you're ready to do something about your receding hairline and the bald spot? Men, don't be embarrassed. All right, it happens.

All right, so let's talk about the other aspects of last night because obviously Virginia was not the only place that people took to the voting booths. As of the time of this taping, I don't see any way around New Jersey not coming down to a recount because it is so close. Obviously, a film or a Democrat incumbent is kind of starting to, I don't want to say run away with it because that would be an incorrect separate. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He is starting to get more votes because the very last remainder of votes to count did come from blue counties and of course our mail-in ballots. So you never know how much when they're like, look, it's a popular governor. We got to fortify it because that's what they said about the president. They said, we have to fortify. This is the most popular president in American history. Why would you not fortify this election? So we don't know what they are planning on doing. But what we do know is that this was not expected to be as close as it was in New Jersey. And yet here we are and it really is coming down to the wire. Honestly, honest to God, is it in my notes? I honest to God do not remember the guy's name right now. I don't remember the guy's name. Is she a rally or something? I can't remember. I can't remember. Yeah, it's something like that already. But that's my, okay, it's a chia de rally. If I'm saying that correctly, Jack Chia de rally, right? But my point in that is how much coverage did we get on this race? I didn't hear this guy's name. I didn't know who he was because it was not expected to be this close. And yet you had Phil Murphy who came out and gave all of these mandates when it came to the coronavirus, put all of these mandates on school, put all of these mandates on people who lived in New Jersey. And now all of a sudden it did come down to the wire unexpectedly. Is that a sign you guys that people are finally fed up with this crap? Again, I censored myself. You're welcome management. Yeah, I think, look, I think again, it's New Jersey. So we have to, we have to, we have to, not that I want to, but we have to look back and say, how did Trump do in New Jersey? How did Trump do in Virginia? Well, Trump didn't win Virginia and now it just swung, you know, it swung red. So here's a guy who didn't get a lot of public attention. His name recognition is not huge in the nation at least, maybe more so in the state. And he's giving Murphy a serious run, if not maybe a victory. I don't know. So it absolutely points towards, if it was moderate Republicans that didn't like mean tweets that are finally just saying, well, we're definitely on the bandwagon of some sanity. For me, it's a huge indication. I think we're going to see that throughout the country. I think this is a absolute sign for what we can expect to come in 2022, trying to take the house back, but historically in the GOP and in the conservative movement in this country, when we have a victory, we go to my type party time and we relax because we won in 2016 and just gave him that, you know, gave it back to them, gave him the house back just in two years. People saying do not for the love of life and of your children, relax. This is a time to put your foot on the tiger's throat. This is just the beginning. Yeah. Oh, your foot, put your foot on the tiger's throat. And this is a chokeout moment. This is the make them tap. Actually, when they tap, keep squeezing lights out. Take their lights out. So let me, Erica, want to get your thoughts, but I also want to add into the equation. It's not just Jack, whatever his name was, Chiara. Chiara, Riley. Chiara, Riley. Hey, it's not just him. There was a Republican truck driver who apparently he is in a, yes, he's in a dead heat with a long time, a Garden State Democrat leader. He is the president, the Senate president of New Jersey. And this Republican, obviously, Democrat, right, is the leader. This Republican who challenged him, his name is Edward Duhr. He's challenging Steve Sweeney. And he is a commercial truck driver who spent $153 on his own campaign. That is all that he spent. And they are still, I just, as you guys were talking, you may have noticed I was on my phone. I was like, I want to double check and make sure that this is still the case that it hasn't changed because everything is changing right now. It is still, as of the time of this taping, New Jersey truck driver Ed Duhr on the verge of upsetting state Senate president, longtime Democratic leader. I love it. Steve Sweeney spent $153 of his own money, same state that we're talking about New Jersey. It's impressive, man. It really just goes to show how it doesn't take much these days, definitely with the spread of information. Look, I believe just how elections are handled have been, you know, it's been archaic just much like the public education system. And you're seeing that you don't have to go through the proper channels to get a victory per per se. But going back to the original question, this just points to the fact that there is an adjustment and as a shift because I believe he would like the last polling put him like at a 10% victory, the Democrat going into New Jersey. And now it's basically neck and neck right now. It wasn't supposed, I cannot emphasize that enough. So even if, let's say the Republicans do not win, it still speaks to something that it was even close because it wasn't supposed to be that way. So again, like you have mentioned, it's all about what happens next, I think is most important. I mean, this could be, look, this whole couple of years could be something that we're looking at as more of a cultural revolution that we're looking at maybe again, decades from now, if people act accordingly, you know what I mean? That's the part that I fear because it's, yeah, it's comfort. It's acting as if, okay, you have victory or victory is just in owning the lives. And that's not what this is about. You know what I mean? These are about these individual issues and these sorts of principles. I just believe I'll certainly be here bringing people back, you know, back to reality as these days go on. But we need more of that because they feet have to be held to the fires. One thing to just pay lip service and to get a victory because now people are paying attention. But if that doesn't change into, and I'm not talking policy, I'm talking really lack thereof. If that doesn't change into elimination of those barriers, which is what we're really discussing and all of these facets of life, whether it be with COVID or public education, then all this amount, it's nothing. So let me give you as one more, let me give the audience out there, one more incentive to pay attention and continue being involved in all of this, actually two more things. So there was Buffalo who had a socialist candidate for mayor who was endorsed by all of the usual suspects, right? Bernie Sanders, AOC, Chuck Schumer. So the actual mayor who was there actually suffered a primary loss to this democratic socialist candidate. It was India Walton who was the socialist candidate. The Buffalo mayor who again was a Democrat, is a Democrat, but was defeated by this democratic socialist in the primary actually started a right in, I'm sorry, a right in candidacy and defeated the socialist candidate for mayor. And you see what happens. As a right in candidate, as a right in, that is how strongly people are rejecting this radical bull crap. Again, what is this? The third time in an episode, I'm telling you guys, I'm censoring myself, you're welcome management. This is Buffalo. Again, a Northern state. This is Buffalo again. So this is not like we're talking about Kentucky, Tennessee, we're swinging a seat that was blue to red. These are what happened in Texas. San Antonio, if I'm not mistaken. Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, South Texas. There was one that flipped to red that hadn't been read and how long? A really long time flipped from Democrat to Republican. One more, just to let you guys know, when we're talking about, especially up north, Minneapolis voters have rejected a ballot initiative that would have replaced the police department with a department of public safety. So we recall, we talked about it on the show, yes, that they were like, well, we need social workers. We don't want police. We should define the police. We should replace it with something else. You don't work on a replacement with a department of public safety. Minneapolis voters were like, nah, nah, we're not going to do that. We're not going to be afraid. That's a significant Sarah, because Minneapolis have spent a lot of time up there. This is Ilhan Omar territory. And this is the squad territory. They own that place. And so they would love to abolish police. So this is really, we need to pay attention to these signs and people who don't live in these areas need to say, okay, let's move, let's go. Because you're right. When they win a seat, they change stuff. Right. We're in like a wrecking ball and we need to change things when we take a seat. Yeah. We've got, like I said, we've got a jam packed show. We've got way more to come. First one I think our sponsor, Bambi. So if you're an entrepreneur, you know, HR issues can kill you.

The CDC is recommending the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 5 to 11. But that is not the only thing that is going on when it comes to the vaccine and children. It is also San Francisco who they have had a conversation. They have had a meeting about this particular development that the CDC is recommending it. And they have not just said we're recommending it. They have said they are planning on mandating this vaccination for all 5 to 11 year olds in order to participate in public life. So they will need to carry your five year old, your kindergartener. They will need to carry their vaccine card in order to participate in public life. I don't know why anyone still lives in San Francisco. I don't know how any parents can still continue to live there and pay the taxes and live in human filth and human feces and needles that they continue to live in. But here is let's see Dr. Lee Atkinson, McAvoy, chief of the division of general pediatrics at some of the hospitals over in San Francisco, one of the health officers for the city and county of San Francisco talking about this watch. There is a related question which people have asked me, which is what about the local San Francisco health orders that require vaccination to go into a restaurant or to go to a Warriors game? When is that going to apply to children 5 to 11? We definitely want to wait and make sure that children have an opportunity to get vaccinated. So that will happen no sooner than about eight weeks after the vaccine is available to kids. So there will be a limited time in which there will not be those requirements as planned. But then at some point 5 to 11 year olds will also have to show proof of vaccination to access some of those same settings. I have to believe guys, I have to believe we saw what happened in Virginia, we saw what happened when education, when children become the lead component when it comes to issues, I have to believe that if this stupid recall were redone, that if San Francisco, if the parents of San Francisco were really offered an alternative, I would like to believe that they would choose the alternative rather than continue to sacrifice their children at the altar of Big Pharma because I can't imagine a parent being like, yeah, I'll make sure to get my child a vaccine card so that they can participate and socialize in everyday life. I mean, this is absolute insanity and child abuse from the actual city of San Francisco. Yeah, child abuse. This is the same city that had acquired that saying we come in for your children. Oh, yeah. You know, we gave you a saying and said we're coming for your children. Oh, it's just kidding. Not really. Yeah, we're coming for your children. I was in San Francisco recently and it is a cesspool. It's an absolute cesspool. Here's the deal. I now am of the mindset where I'm liking what the lift is doing. Push harder because we've reached critical mass. Please go. Please mandate this. This is what I say to San Francisco population. Know your child should not carry a vaccine card. You should carry second amendment. Okay. You should carry but not the vaccine card. Yes. You should carry a little lead on your hip to protect your children. Yes. According to the second amendment, which does still account in the city of San Francisco. You have a second amendment. So that's fair. That's fair. No, that's the second amendment. We're going to carry a little friend. There you go. Al 9 millimeter. There you go. I mean, look, do you do you want to protect your children or don't you, Eric? Yeah, people. I got a good friend. Big shout out to Gary Ner are oblivious to living outside of that state. They think that they are at the mecca. They get shell shocked when they come here. Oh, it's actually okay. It's like, what do the world is, California? Yeah. Yeah. They don't really understand. They don't understand. I've seen many video testimonies, if you will, that people are like, yeah, people wonder why we stay out here is because this is all we knew and we didn't know that. And it's like, oh, I guess that is a perspective that you, if you've been there, you're in a time life in California is propaganda works very well. They have all the, you know, definitely, if you consider LA and all of that, they have all of these elites that stay there. So they think that this is their best chance when it's not. You're seeing now that these guys have no intention of stopping. So I don't blame anybody for living to fight another day and relocating closer to your allies, considering this and strip them up to tax money that they're going to be stealing from you in the event that you stayed there. Because this is, look, you talk about delegitimizing these guys and why we should do that. It's because look at what it is to do. That is an evil institution. They're evil people. They're evil people like to, for that woman to speak about this so easily and just say, yeah, at some point after eight weeks, yeah, we're going to be requiring a little bit of a 11. Yeah. Yeah. So you're going to be requiring your five to 11 year old to show me a paper. Show me your papers, please. Please. Again, these are evil people. Why not? I continue to say that your founders went to war for less. Yes. Yes. They went to war for a lot less than what we're dealing with right now. Why not just put a yellow star on your jackets? Just, you know, just saying. Right. We've got more to come, but first we want to thank our sponsor, Moink. So I don't know if you guys realize this, but 97% of the chicken.

It is called a gender unicorn worksheet over in Kansas. It is a questionnaire asking 10th grade students about their sexual identity preference and oh, much, much more that has really sparked outrage among the Olaf public schools community in Kansas. So if we could show this, this is, yeah, this is the gender unicorn and you're supposed to express your gender identity, your gender expression, your sex assigned at birth, who you're physically attracted to, which I honestly am very offended by. They only have three different options there. It says women, men and other genders, which is, excuse me, there are about 105 now. Get with the program. I don't know what phobic you are, transphobic, gender phobic, whatever the hell you are, you're phobic. That's all I know. And then not just physically attracted to, but also emotionally attracted to who are you emotionally attracted to? This was given out in public schools. We've got about a minute and a half. I want to give you both time to speak. Yaku. Set the whole thing on fire. Set the whole thing on fire. This came from what was called the gender bread man, which was a gingerbread man. And then kids in fifth grade put, put genders on it. Now they're going this way. In an era where we are concerned about big tech stealing our data, now we're getting this kind of data in the classroom from kids, which is all sexually driven, set around fire. Yeah. By the way, Eric, this is a teaching tool from the trans student education resources website, which to me would indicate that's a place that you should not get your curriculum from. Yeah. I mean, I don't know what more I could say about this other than get your kids to hell out of these public education systems. Like what the, why are they even asking? I mean, you let alone a person's gender, which we know what that is. But why are they asking kids who they're attracted to? That's freaking weird, man. Look. Why don't they just put teachers on their. Oh, they would love that. They would love that. Are you kidding me? That's coming. Get them out. Get them out. Like we don't need any more examples of this. No, just get them to hell up out of there. Yeah. Just as a, just like to tie it in with the beginning of this program, this actual worksheet, they did obviously issue it. But because of the uproar, the principal had said we are working with staff to make sure this worksheet is not distributed to any other classrooms and is not used in any instruction moving forward parents. If there's anything we can leave you with before we go to break, it is do not see your power to big government. You have a lot of power. These are your children. Right. Do not give them up. Continue to fight and good things will happen. All right. We got to go to break. We'll be back. I just want to let you know, I see you out there person who has not yet gone to wherever you get your audio podcasts and subscribed, rated and reviewed the news and why it matters. All of you out there, you comment on YouTube, you comment on Blaisty, you comment on Pluto TV, you comment on Facebook and you love seeing me angry, but do you love seeing me angry at you? I'm giving you another chance. All right. You got to go. Subscribe, rate and review. You also may see your review read live on air like the one today from Jesus love you. That's cute. It's amazing. Five stars says five star show. This is the only show I will watch for daily news. Love the discourse and funny banter. Yaku, Eric and Sarah are my favorite trio. I'm glad there are still some of us who aren't permanently damaged by public school love to you all. Well, that was a that was a good review to read today. Yeah. We got a double. I had to do a lot of learning. I had to do a lot of the same, but I will say public school when I was in school was not the same as it was today. It was not this bad. And that's why it's so frustrating. I did not ever have a general unicorn. I did not have to learn the gender bread man. See, when I was in school, the rainbow was still, yeah, when I was in school, the rainbow was still a promise that God wouldn't flood this place. I'm hijack the rainbow. That's okay. I'm learning. All I learned about the rainbow was Roy G. Biz. I just learned the colors and order, right? Right? That was a lot. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order. I learned the colors and order."
