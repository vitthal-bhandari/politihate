And then of course there's there's infrastructure as well and they're doing these two things together Because they feel like it's harder for people to understand just how Crazy this really is if you do it all at once you're overwhelmed by the amount of spending I mean you just you can't even really take in these numbers Here's Mitch McConnell talking about it and he said look it's it's left wing. It's like the squad is in charge play nine The policy they want to put behind this budget resolution read like somebody walked across the rotunda to the house and handed the squad a pen and piece of paper sweeping sweeping amnesty for illegal immigrants in the middle of the border crisis Regulations that are so radical that our colleague senator mark II quote said the Green New Deal is in the DNA of this budget resolution The great new deal is in the day. I mean it's true though It does feel like the Green New Deal is in it because they're trying to do everything they can To use the power of the purse in place of actually having to do real legislation on something right just we'll just fun something I'm not gonna pass a law saying you have to we'll just play with the the numbers and the and the Spending that the federal government has to achieve a similar goal So you've got the Senate well, let's start let me try to break these two Pieces into separate buckets for a second. This Senate approved the one point two trillion dollar transportation water broadband other infrastructure projects 69 to 30 so you had a bunch of Republicans go along with this Including Mitch McConnell by the way, so just just put that so they're all there in for infrastructure And let me tell you what the problem with the infrastructure bill is Even the parts of it that are bridges roads right the things that you might have a tougher time Trying to win an argument to somebody about why they're about idea you say okay bridges roads So those seem pretty important although we do already spend a lot of money on Infrastructure in this country that never really gets talked about but with all that stuff going on at this point in time with all that happening You would say okay. Well is this going to be? Spent efficiently and that's that's where you start laughing right? I mean there's no way There's no realistic version of this where you don't have lawyers and activists and bureaucrats and Union bosses and by the time this actually gets to Money to build stuff you will use Lord only knows what's gonna be left and what the upside of this for the actual taxpayer is going to be I mean it strikes me that this is just gonna end up being a massive boondoggle Remember shovel ready jobs under the Obama administration If you start thinking about the Biden administration as the third term of the Obama administration Everything makes sense There are no surprises it all adds up it all comes together and That's exactly what you should expect here with infrastructure. They're making all these promises They're saying all these things but even the areas of the bill that seem the least objectionable will be problematic down the line because of the implementation of this All to me this is just about moving taxpayer dollars around To favorite constituencies of the Democrat Party. That's gonna be a primary goal You know in Afghanistan, which is falling apart so rapidly now They're saying the Taliban could be in charge in a month. You see that the Taliban could be in charge in Afghanistan in a month I mean the whole country Kabul could fall within a month is what people have been saying in the last 24 hours. I mean that is Stunning that the Taliban blitzkrieg would be that effective Just goes to show you that for all those years all the years we spent US military training all the contractors over there training the Afghans mentoring them working with them all this stuff Just disintegrating disintegrating I'm gonna tell you it's not surprising to anybody who spent real time over there. It's just not it's not surprising the Afghan National Police the Afghan army They don't really have a tremendous allegiance that they don't have a sense of their honor as tied to the national government They have a sense of honor and obligation to tribe to family to religion But to the central government and Kabul Whereas the Taliban believes in their movement. Yeah, there are a bunch of sadists and and jihadist maniacs But they do have the advantage of belief on their side and they believe in what they are doing and This that country's gonna fall apart Oh, but I bring up Afghanistan because any of you listen to this or anybody who knows about how it work over there You know you could spend I'm making up the numbers here, but you would allocate You know a million dollars to build a brand new school building and you know water treatment plant or something in Afghanistan But let's just say a school building and by the time it actually got to the building of the school when you had paid off the local you know elders and warlords and strongmen and you know what do you ever gonna take in their cut you Were left with almost nothing to do the actual project now our corruption is not quite as Out in the open and blatant as that but there will be a lot of waste fraud and abuse with this money that's being spent That's definitely going to happen And as for the actual Bernie budget now the 3.5. It's really really we should be talking about this as a five trillion dollar thing The Bernie budget so to speak includes funds for universal pre-kindergarten tuition free community college Paid family leave clean energy stuff. So that's the green new deal piece billions of dollars for quote helping immigrant workers onto a pathway to citizenship end quote that's called amnesty my friends Amnesty is now something you will pay for the amnesty is coming and you're getting the bill Now let's see what Senator Lindsey Graham has Lindsey Graham has to say about this one play 10 All I can say is that I believe in climate change and I'd like to have a rational approach To solving the problem, but this is not rational. This is partisan in this 4.2 trillion dollar bill. It's not three and a half It's going to lead to a wave of illegal immigration illegal immigration the likes of what you've never seen before a 262% increase in the last six months if this bill this idea ever becomes reality You can double that if this bill ever becomes reality a dollar increase in gas prices are going to be the good old days If they shut down all the coal-fired plants without any way to replace it other than a bunch of BS Good luck with a heating bill Yep, you know who actually pays for this not only through tax dollars, but through costs people that are working for a living and trying to Stay ahead of their bills and build some financial Stability for themselves and for the future Those are the ones who actually end up paying for this those are the people that are going to have a greater challenge because of the rise in the cost of energy Because of just the well inflation of course as well, which is going to eat away at the wages of people who can least afford that change in their purchasing power But Democrats don't care in fact Joe Biden's running around talking about how this is going to be great historic recovery play 11 This goes going to help making historic recovery a long-term boom Folks above all this historic investment infrastructure Is what I believe you the American people want what you've been asking for for a long long time This bill shows that we can work together I know a lot of people Some sitting in the audience here didn't think this could happen I'm sort of ill Yeah Sometimes I wander off when the secret service He's telling me to go one direction And I go in the other direction And I go whoa whoa whoa whoa? Malarkey, Malas Malarkey, buddy. No joke. No joke Forgot where I was for a second I will never forgive the democrats for Fasting this guy on the united states. Yeah, they should be ashamed They should be ashamed honestly, and I mean that As much as it's possible for me to I mean that in a non Political fashion So this also is a reminder that the the democrats Think that they somehow have a mandate with a 50 50 cent it and a handful of votes in the house They're looking to make massive transformations To the american economy and with it the american way of life There's nothing about the democrats that has any there's no bipartisan spirit in the budget Aspect of this really I mean they're doing exactly what they want to do and on the infrastructure side I think they're swindling republicans. I think they're fooling the republicans including michmakanal Who are going along with this? I thought it was fascinating that president biden Yesterday said that that that Cuomo did a great job. This is one of the things that makes me so mad Oh, I know I didn't talk to the podcast yesterday about Cuomo resigning so let's discuss that because I did the part of the morning and Cuomo resigned after I had already finished Yeah, am I surprised by it? Absolutely and do I own the fact that I thought this guy was going to go down fighting? Yes, that was his plan. I've talked to some folks and done more Investigating of this it was his plan to fight it to the very end But turned out the democrats in the state legislature Uh really did uniformly turn on him. He had no allies no friends They all wanted him gone and I think part of what happened here Is that the tyrant In this case who had been able to rule by fear And knew that as long as he could keep some fearful and loyal He always had a weapon against the others This was the the moment that had finally turned and he looked around for allies And everybody realized now's the time we can shove this guy out safely They wanted to get rid of him And he wasn't prepared for that. He always thought there'd be some people That you know owed him a favor or were scared of him in New York state politics And so he's gone now Unsurprising Unsurprising, but this is where we are Uh Well, I should say surprising and so far as he resigned. I did think they were going to have to impeach him Um, I thought they were going to have to be I didn't think he was going to step down as you know So I I own that I I was like wow really he's actually going to go But let's be very clear about a few things one is the democrats. This doesn't mean that oh all of a sudden they're so ethical Oh, they clean they clean up their own house. He should have been He should have been pushed out of office over the nursing home scandal a year ago a year ago But no instead they gave him a book deal instead they gave him an Emmy award. I mean not just any book deal millions of dollars The entire democrat apparatus of control through everything they had behind him The Cuomo sexual phenomenon. Oh, he's just so dreamy He's such a hero to the left. He was so great during those briefings. He was horrible It was a disaster New York has suffered from worst leadership and worst covid effects than any other place in the country and still continuing to go on now, but The fact that they held up Cuomo like he was some kind of a shining example for all the rest is It's just crazy. Honestly, it's just crazy and they're not really paying the price for it and they should You know wall street has been lying for years saying a few measly percent is a good return on your stocks It's really not and that trading is so complicated.

That's the way this is supposed to go Can't think about anything else can't take any other approach Right, that's what they want you to take away from all this. That's what they want you to think This this teacher in Loudon County continued play 15 Not only that but within the last year I was told in one of my so-called equity trainings that white christian able-bodied females Currently have the power in our schools and that quote this has to change Clearly you've made your point you no longer value me or many other teachers you've employed in this county So since my contract outlines the power that you have Over my employment in Loudon County public schools. I thought it necessary to resign in front of you School board I quit I quit your policies I quit your trainings and I quit being a cog in a machine That tells me to push highly politicized agendas on our most vulnerable constituents the children I will find employment elsewhere. I encourage all parents and staff in this county to flood the private schools She quits She begins crying. She can't handle it anymore Yeah, this is what it's going to take People are going to have to stand up and say no more Not going to do it anymore refuse To play the game the way they want you to In this pronoun policy that's that's now sweeping across all these different schools People are changing their pronouns on it. I'm not kidding on a day-to-day basis You can see tiktok videos and things on this They change their pronouns on a whim and you're supposed to obey Today I feel like they them tomorrow. I feel like she her today. I feel like, you know zod zed. I mean whatever This is what they're doing and if you don't go along you're a bigot They're just flexing their power. They're just flexing their social coercion And yet democrats all go along with it little collectivist Authoritarians they love it No problem with it whatsoever. They think that this is great Speaking of authoritarians I got a real problem here in New York guys. I'm just gonna tell you this They are putting in place Mandates and some places some school some restaurants are putting in place Vaccine mandates in advance of the de Blasio mandate So what is someone like me supposed to do? I mean, I'm going to be essentially banned from public life in New York City within a matter of weeks unless I get the shot You could say move, but I can't move that fast I'm thinking now more than ever about moving. I mean I've already thought about it a lot during the pandemic, but You know my my lease ends In a few months. So yeah, I could go do anything. I could go move anywhere pretty much theoretically at least But what do I do in the meantime? I'm going to be some kind of a hermit who can't really go anywhere outside of his apartment This is the coercion the totalitarianism really of the left on display and Joe biden's out there even talking about maybe a universal Mask mandate from the federal level for schools a mask mandate. So we got vaccine mandates and they're still pushing mask mandates Masks don't do anything Masks don't work But here we are by the way, you know, ran paul doctor and senator ran paul said that on youtube Uh pulled him off youtube not allowed to say mask don't work. Why? Who at youtube is some expert in the studies the actual proof of masks working? I'm just wondering do they have anybody anybody over there have some uh knowledge of published medically sound control group gold standard scientific experiment data Are are we really to believe that the cdc in the last 18 months has never thought to set up an actual Could it work or could it not work? trial of masks No, they just rather it's a it's a religious symbol now It's we believe because we believe how dare you challenge our belief in masks It's President biden on how angry he is about governors that are stopping the mask mandate play one and one of the things that I find a little disingenuous when I suggest that people In zones where there is a high risk where the masks like you all are doing I'm told that government should get out of the way And not do that they're on the authority to do that and I find it interesting that some of the very people are saying that who are whole government positions are people who are threatening that if a school teacher asked the student if they've been vaccinated or if a Principle says that everyone in my school should wear a mask or a school board roast for it that governor Will nullify that that governor has the authority to say you can't do that. I find that totally counterintuitive and quite frankly disingenuous I find that complicated because I'm a moron and I should never have accepted this job Joe Biden doesn't understand what freedom or individual rights are Apparently he's making that quite clear Just doesn't understand Or perhaps does not care to understand But maybe he could figure it out, but he knows what his team expects of him his team expects authoritarianism his team expects the democrats demand Obedience when it comes to masks and anybody who stands in the way of that Is a problem a problem for them I ask you this show me think about how long we've been in this in this game, you know, they they brought back masks in my building now but only in the elevators I can tell you right now. I will not comply And if somebody decides to get up in my face about it We're going to have a serious disagreement It's a line from last know he can some of you might have caught that it's a very it's probably one of the best Moments that dead in the Lewis has in that movie where the British officer is screaming at him And he's just like one day you and I will have a serious disagreement and uh, yeah He ends up later on shooting the guy in the head, but for his own benefit spoiler alert I know that seems weird, but if you've seen the movie, you know what i'm talking about great movie By the way, I put it on the buck recommendation list last the mohekins great film holds up really well too so They want me to wear a mask in the elevator, but not in the lobby and not in the gym not yet at least I mean, I think they're going to come back with masks in the gym soon Has anyone looked at the mortality data recently? I just you know, you point that out to people they say oh Do what do we care about cases? Should we care about covid cases No, not really We should only care about hospitalizations and deaths now there have been an increase in hospitalizations in a number of states including texas and florida I've seen that But we've heard so many times. Oh, the hospitals are gonna be overwhelmed. There's gonna be overwhelmed The case level in texas right now is about a third what it was in january A third so were the hospitals all the hospitals unable to give people care in january Because I don't remember that in texas. Do you remember that? I don't remember that So now we're to believe that with 30 percent of the cases the hospitals can't can't handle it How does that make sense? How does it make sense? And as you know the cdc recently over reported The deaths or Cases or deaths in florida. I think it was cases in one day in florida dramatically like 100 more than there actually were Which you could say it's a clerical error, but it's kind of interesting that of course it goes against florida Because they've got to destroy desantis. You know this They've got to make desantis look like the bad guy and all this because he is such a threat To senile joe in the next election. We all know it Everyone can see it So they've got to do this. This is why they're already certainly to write these pieces about how you know ron desantis is worse than trump Who was worse than hitler, you know Yeah, that's we're already at ron desantis is worse than trump. They're already starting to try to Float that out there and see if they can get away with it.

It's time to cancel cancel culture But they hate to send us because also his policies and it's it's not just that he's a political threat to them His policies in the state of florida are a and have been a real-time Repudiation of the lockdowns and the madness that they've been Pushing all across the country for 18 months now And more than that, I guess it's uh, well, no, it's about 18 months so ron desantis Has to be ruined otherwise He's not only a risk to the biden second term But also the whole narrative of democrats is somehow the good guys in this covid pandemic when they've been the hysterical Lockdown crybabies Who demand that you mask up even if you're vaccinated even if you're vaccinated a double mask. Oh my gosh We have to stop these lunes. We have to get them to just calm Down and i'll tell you this the mortality data on on covid shows you right now You're at like 500 600 people dying a day from covid and this is during a surge Surge is not gonna last as a good night will last forever. We all see what happens. It's a four to six-week curve So we're in an upswing now. We're losing about five to six hundred people a day We were losing, you know, third 3,000 3,500 people a day During the uh, winter surge Now that that feels like a lot of people. I mean look every life loss is precious You know that we all know that but we're talking about public health data here You know does everyone go around crying and saying they can't go all with their lives because of how many people die every day In this country from heart attacks No, it's a tragedy if you know someone who died from a heart attack But we can't shut the country down and make sure everybody you know is spending an extra hour a day outside walking Because of heart attacks. We don't do that Right. We're all going to die. I mean that's ultimately A part of the the philosophical disconnect here is that democrats have this silly and absurd belief that the state can keep them Safe from a virus That if the state will keep them healthy the state will absolutely not Do that it's not going to work They refuse to believe it, but they they hate rondis santis because uh, he is Standing up against this in schools play three We're going to do whatever we can to vindicate the rights of parents And make sure that parents are in the driver's seat when it comes to the the health education and welfare of their kids And they should not be decreed by the government. There should be something that a parent is ultimately making the decision on I mean, isn't this really straightforward parents should be making decisions about whether kids get masked You Could you imagine I mean you're going into school you're going into school setting and some some teacher Is like sorry your kid has your kid has to be really uncomfortable What what if you're what if you're a parent? What if you're a teacher told your kid That you're um that just just for everyone's benefit You are going to have to You know walk around all day wearing a really itchy Wool sweater Without it without a t-shirt on an undershirt on anything We're a hot itchy wool sweater because it'll make us all feel safer. Is that okay? Say well, well, no that that seems weird. Well That's about as important as wearing a mask in school, but they they won't of course agree to that they won't accept that But it's true No, but it doesn't do anything. It doesn't do anything The kids are going to be pulling their masks down to eat they're going to be pulling their masks down when they need to Snease they're going to be pulling their masks up and down and up and down and up and down It it's not an epidemiological tool when you're calling timeouts every five minutes We all know this But they want you to do it do it do it. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm a lib. I watch seeing that. I'm terrified I'm so scared of the virus. I'm 35 And and I drink soy milk What am I gonna do if the virus comes for me? I need Cuomo worse Cuomo. He'll protect me Oh, no, he won't because I guess he's gone now What a shame Gen saki's out there responding to ronda sensing me gen saki is like a c-minus student from a from a third tier Academic background and she's the white house press secretary.
