    "text": " The optics of the Ron DeSantis 2024 campaign launch are glitchy as Twitter spaces fritzes out, but DeSantis puts on a policy clinic nonetheless. Trump responds in Trumpian style, and Target begins to slowly back away from its full-scale embrace of satanic trans insanity. I'm Ben Shapiro, this is The Ben Shapiro Show. The Ben Shapiro Show's sponsor by ExpressVPN, protect our online privacy today at expressvpn.com slash Ben. So that that's actually what it sounded like last night when Ron DeSantis decided to launch his campaign on Twitter spaces with Elon Musk. Now yesterday I said this is kind of a cool idea, right? Because this is edging around the legacy media. Instead of relying on legacy media to introduce you to the crowd, you just go direct to the crowd. It's basically an extension of what Trump did in 2016 when he took to Twitter in order to set the narrative pretty much every morning. Instead DeSantis decided that he was going to combine with Elon Musk, who is one of the most powerful people and richest person on earth in order to introduce himself to a very large crowd. And one of the big questions was going to be how that played. And the other big question was going to be would it even work? Well, not so much was the story of yesterday night. So about 6 p.m. Bunch people to numerous. Yeah, bunch of people. I mean, a lot of people. I mean, 700,000 people simultaneously tuned in to listen to what Ron DeSantis and Elon Musk were going to say to one another. And they waited. And then they waited some more. And then at about five, six minutes in, a few voices could be heard. People whispering into microphones, people not being clear if the if the tech was working and to a certain extent was like, wow, is this really what a campaign launch is going to sound like? What is going on? This is really weird. On the other hand, I was like, wow, look at the authenticity. This is cool. What's happening behind? And then it glitched out. So you have 700,000 people who are waiting to hear what you have to say for your campaign launch. And it just glitches out now. Is that the fault of Ron DeSantis? Of course not. He doesn't run Twitter. That is the fault of Musk's engineers. That is the fault of Twitter spaces for glitching out. And again, when you launch a new technology, it's extremely, extremely risky. Twitter space is not a new technology, but carrying that sort of listener burden is a very, very new thing for Twitter spaces to have to do. And you know, as co founder of a tech company of a new media company, I can tell you, we've had glitches ourselves. We've been hacked. You remember them when we premiered Matt Walsh's huge movie, What is a Woman? That day we were literally hacked. This sort of stuff does happen on a fairly routine basis, which is why if you're looking for kind of a safe and secure place in order to launch your campaign, Twitter spaces was not it. So the thing starts to fritt out. Here's what it sounded like when Twitter spaces started glitching. So many people here that I think we are, we are kind of melting the servers, which is a good sign. All right, I'd like to just introduce the folks in the room here. So it's safe to say we wouldn't be making history without the man seeing next to me Elon Musk, his decision to purchase this platform last year to restore to its original mission as a beacon for free speech. And even to expose Twitter's past complicity with a government sensitive regime might have surprised many, but not those of us who've known and worked with Elon for nearly a quarter century. His commitment to freedom is put his money mouth is accepted. And then it cut out. And so 700,000 people were kicked out of that Twitter space. So they had to launch a second Twitter space. And it took a while for people to be able to log on. I couldn't even log on. I'll be honest, I was, I was trying to re-log in so that I could actually listen and just kept kicking me out and saying Twitter space was dead. So complete tech failure, like complete tech blowout. That was a huge problem. And if you're going to launch, obviously the optics matter a fair bit. If you remember the biggest campaign launches in our history, you'll you'll remember that Donald Trump, of course, in 2016 to the famous descent down the escalator at Trump Tower and people mocked it. Oh my God, what is he doing that's so crazy? And it turns out that became incredibly iconic. And sure, a lot of the people who were sort of in the rafters were apparently paid who cares. It doesn't matter. That was an iconic showmanship thing. This was supposed to be the introduction to a new wave of politics in which, again, legacy media was cut out of the loop and something new was going to happen. And people in the media, of course, started painting this immediately as egg on the sance his face. Again, his advanced team should have worked with Twitter to make sure this was not going to happen. The true edge should be on the face of the people over at Twitter spaces, who again, failed to santas and failed musk in this particular, in this particular situation. Musk himself on the second go around. He said, yeah, the servers are pretty clearly straining somewhat. Hey, just a massive number of people online. So it's a service of straining somewhat. That awkwardness is going to make for 1000 means. It's going to make for a lot of mockery, of course. And that's precisely what happened. As you would imagine, right, the substance got left behind in favor of all of the coverage of the of the kind of craziness of a campaign launch, where you can't even hear the person who is launching the campaign and hundreds of thousands of people are trying to get in. Joe Biden, of course, responded by tweeting out a link to his own campaign saying, here is a link that works. And then it was a link to the Biden Harris donate campaign. Donald Trump responded in a in typically Trumpian fashion. And again, the people who love this kind of stuff love this kind of stuff. The people who think that, you know, maybe this campaign is going to be a fight between substance and style. Maybe see that contrast pretty strongly right here. So Trump, before this happened, he tweeted out, I personally, I'd like to personally congratulate Rob to Saint Dimonious. Rob to Saint Dimonious, they call him Rob. And finally announcing that he will be entering the race for president of the United States. Hopefully, he will get the full experience of being attacked by the Marxist, the Communist and the radical athletic attacks of our country without which he will never know the kind of job he's doing. These lowlights and misfits are fireworks than the leaders of hostile foreign countries. They must be soundly defeated in order to make America great again. That was before the launch. Okay. So first of all, I don't understand why he's calling Ron DeSantis Rob. It's because I think there was a typo in one of his tweets. And so now he's made this a thing. He's going to call him Rob. Again, this is all sixth grade silly kind of garbage. I'm sorry, like calling people Rob when their name is Ron, or we like 10. I mean, apparently the answer is yes, because it works. But like, still, like, I guess if you thrilled to that sort of thing, okay, fair enough. And then of course, he then responded to the glitchy failure of the Twitter space launch. When gets to that moment, terribly. First, remember the last time you got a free phone, you started out feeling pretty good about yourself. And then came those hefty activation fees, the forline requirements, and of course, the binding contract. Pure talk is giving you a free 5G Samsung Galaxy phone without the feeling you've been duped.

I do all my business calls on Pure Talk. Make the switch to Pure Talk.

Again, head on over to puretalk.com slash Shapiro. Get that free. Samsung Galaxy, when you sign up for unlimited talk, text, and unlimited data. Okay. So Trump continued along these lines in attacking DeSantis and the Twitter launch. So he also tweeted out again, calling Rhonda Santos-Rob, which is apparently his new thing. Not sure I get it, but okay. Rob, my red button is bigger, better, stronger, and is working. Truth! He's on Truth Social as opposed to Twitter. So first of all, I'd like to point out here that Truth Social has never supported 700,000 people simultaneously streaming anything. Like, so if we're talking about like the back end of Twitter versus the back end of Truth Social, but Rob, Rob. Okay, man. My red button is bigger, stronger, and is working. Yours does not per my conversation with Kim Jong Un of North Korea, soon to become my friend. Okay. Well, okay. All right. So that was response number two, is that he has best friends with Kim Jong Un and has a big, strong red button. So strong, bigger, better, stronger, red button, Rob. And then, of course, no, no, Trump tweet thread would be complete without his team texting out all of the different headlines from the media outlets who were very, very upset and very shocked and appalled at the failure of the Twitter spaces launch. They tweeted out, Ron DeSantis' Twitter disaster, and then it was headlines from Breitbart News, no safe spaces, Twitter launch debacle for DeSantis. Daily Mail, biggest fail in campaign launches. In history, Ron DeSantis' mock for Shambhala Twitter room presidential announcement with Elon Musk that crashes five times and leaves the user's bamboozled. Just the news, DeSantis announcement met with major tech issues Trump reacts with meme. The Washington Post Twitter repeatedly crashes as DeSantis tries to make presidential announcement CNN, glitches, echoes and melting the servers, crashed DeSantis' campaign launch on Twitter. The New York Times, DeSantis' big moment goes awry with the Twitter meltdown. So Trump did have one more response. He put out a truth social a fake Twitter spaces, including an AI voice of Elon Musk and an AI voice of Ron DeSantis. And then also his Twitter space is imagine Twitter space for Ron DeSantis launch includes. I kid you not Elon Musk, Ron DeSantis, George Soros, Klaus Schwab, Dick Cheney, Adolf Hitler, the devil and the FBI. This is this is I guess is Trump's idea of a funny response to the Twitter space. Campaign launch is that DeSantis' backers include Soros, Adolf Hitler, Satan, and the FBI, which um, boomer meme energy coming in strong here. Can you hear me? We can all hear you George. Can you just hold on for a second? Alpha, I don't think they can hear me. I don't think George knows how to use Twitter. Hello. Can you hear me now? Can I please make my big announcement now? Everyone just Hello. Just shut up George. Can somebody just mute George? Dick, could you try not to cough on the wrong hand? Okay. So how are we going to take out Trump you guys? Guys from the FBI. This is not a private call. This is a public Twitter space. Everyone can listen in. Anyway guys, we invited everyone to this, uh, this Twitter space. So Governor Ron DeSantis could everyone just shut the hell up so I can make my announcement. Okay. You go girl. Wait, the devil is gay. So what? Everyone in this call is gay. Yeah, this is what Trump put out. So, um, them's your choices for the Republican primary, I guess, I guess sort of. Okay. So that is Trump's response. And of course the media pick up on this also, as you can imagine, right? All those headlines are from mainstream media outlets with vast majority of them. And meanwhile you have, you know, overt fans of Trump, like David Jolly on MSNBC declaring this just a full-scale disaster, total disaster. This is the biggest day in the political life of Ron and Casey DeSantis. And it has become absolutely humiliating, rally embarrassing, and masculine, mortifying. Here's your word. This has been a disaster. Ron and Casey DeSantis, because even the decision to do this on Twitter spaces leans into the weirdness of Ron DeSantis. And it also suggests his greatest vulnerability is this idea that he's governor safe space, that he can only be approached and he can only get in front of people if it's been orchestrated and he's in a bubble. So he does it on Twitter spaces. And then we get to the real dangerous part, the ideology he associates tonight with someone who is a has a platform for regressive ideology, Elon Musk. And it brings to the forefront these themes Christian white nationalist themes that bring up his culture war and his marginalizing of already marginalized communities in the state of Florida. So David Jolly for Ron is a public Congress person. Now, as a Missy, it's a disaster. And Joy Reid, I mean, she, Joy Reid is so happy. If he hadn't seen the clip, Joy Reid looks like she needs to smoke a cigarette after all of that. And there's a reason that MSNBC is happy. And listen, is that good for DeSantis? Of course, it's not good for DeSantis. It's not good for DeSantis. Again, one of DeSantis basic pitches is I'm extremely competent. I'm good at what I do. All you're going to get from me is like the meat and the potatoes of politics. You're going to get good policy. And it's not going to be a shambolic bleep show. And then of course, you get what you got on Twitter spaces. So that's a bad look. That's a bad look. Now, does this mean the campaign is over? So many members of the media are like, the campaign is now, oh, guys, we call them your asses down for like half a second. The campaign ain't even 24 hours old at this point. Okay, the campaign has barely begun. And in fact, there are polls out that are showing that basically Trump and DeSantis in the primaries, in many of these states are head and head. When it comes to a head like a head to head match up between Trump and DeSantis without any of these other candidates in the race, the latest Marquette poll shows Trump and DeSantis pretty close to even like Trump at 52 DeSantis at 48. Their other polls showing him way ahead because you include the other candidates and they start picking them away at DeSantis support. In other words, it is very, very early. And remember, there's no such thing. I mean, if there's one thing we know from the Trump presidency, there is no such thing as a 72 hour news cycle. There's only a 48 hour news cycle. So if you are suggesting that the shambolic nature of the Twitter space is launched is somehow going to cripple DeSantis campaign for the long haul, I have a tough time believing you. That does not mean that it was good launch. It was not a good launch. It was a very, very bad launch. And it was a bad launch because again, it undermines the reality of DeSantis campaign, which is he's an excellent governor. He's very good at what he does ever. He's going to hit all his marks. And then when your launch is, you don't hit the marks. And when you're running against the greatest showman in presidential political history, like a person who literally made his name on being a showman, that is not what you are looking for. So DeSantis for his part tried to respond to this by saying that basically this is a victory. The reason it's a victory is not because Twitter space is crashed. The reason it's a victory is because I mean, Donald Trump had to stack like a room with his supporters at Mar-a-Lago in order to do a launch. And it was pretty disappointing, as you will recall. At least DeSantis can claim that he had 700,000 people minimum who were ready to watch simultaneously him announce this actual thing. Here was Governor Ron DeSantis announcing that they broke the internet. We had a huge audience. It did. It was the biggest they'd ever had. It did break the Twitter space. And so we're really excited with the enthusiasm. But ultimately, it's about the future of our country. Trey, I'm running to lead a great American comeback. We know the country's on the wrong track. We see it with our eyes. We feel it in our bones. We see the border being overrun. We see crime infesting the cities. We see the federal government making it more difficult for families to make ends meet. And we have a president who is a listless vessel, not energetic, and not dealing with the key challenges that are facing our country. But it does not have to be this way. Our decline as a country is not inevitable. It is a choice. And I think we can choose a better pathway. Okay, so team DeSantis is responding and you got to spin this somehow and the way they're spinning it. And it's not false, but it obviously doesn't overcome the sort of glitchy failure of Twitter spaces is there are so many people who wanted to see me that obviously there's a crowd. And again, that is not incorrect. They did in fact break the internet. Although obviously they would be better off of the internet had not been broken. And so in just one second, we'll see exactly what DeSantis said. Because again, so much of this is about the optics and optics matter. But you know what else matters is kind of what DeSantis would do as president of the United States. We'll get to that momentarily. First, we have a dog. His name is happy. He is a cute dog. And one of the things that my kids really like to do with happy is just release him as we say into the wild, which means just running around our house at top speed. He's a very frisky little puppy. He's very, very cute. We want happy to live a long and healthy life. This is why we started giving him rough greens every morning. It's the dog food that will, you know, bring nutritional value back to your dog's dead food. Right now it's got that brown look and it's all dry and weird. That's exactly scream nutritional. But green food makes it better. Rough greens boost happy food back to life and can do the same for your dog. You don't have to go out and buy new dog food. Just sprinkle rough greens on their food every single day. It contains all the necessary vitamins and minerals your dog is not getting from their regular dog food. Happy loves his rough greens and he is much healthier for it. Rough greens is the only supplement your dog will ask for by name. Rough greens. You get it. It get it to pun. It's a dad joke.

Okay. So then we get to the actual content. Hey, so I'm not sure there's ever been a campaign launch in which the optics contrast so strongly with the content. The optics of this were a mess. Obviously it launches on a failing Twitter space. It's got, you know, one of the most iconic classic people on planet earth, Elon Musk hosting the thing. And then you get to the content and DeSantis is a bread and butter meat and potatoes, conservative politician who's able to get things done. And that's really what his launch was about. Now, you know, you can say there's no such thing as bad publicity. But again, the contrast here is not particularly great for DeSantis. But if you get to the substance, the substance is really, really good as always because DeSantis is really good at this. That's the thing. If you had to pick between forget about, you know, all of the media battles for a second, forget about whose style you prefer, right? Rhonda Sanchez is very, very direct and linear in his style or Trump who, you know, comes swinging out of the trees on a vine punching people, right? Like forget about the style for a second and focus in on who gets things done. Who won the last election in Florida by 20 points, who's taken a state that was really, really purple and turned it bright red, who is implementing conservative policies across the board in the state of Florida. And the answer is obviously DeSantis when it comes to policy. And so when it came to the substance, when he actually sat with Musk and with David Sachs and they took questions from a variety of different people in the chat, this is like what DeSantis is good at. He's actually good at the business of governing. So here's what it sounded like when DeSantis announced his run. I understand that you may have an announcement to make. We've got, I think, a record audience assembled here, you know, probably the biggest room that's probably ever been assembled online. What would you like to tell them? Well, I am running for president of the United States to lead our great American comeback. Okay. And then he launched into his actual political speech. The first six, seven minutes of this call were taken up by DeSantis explaining exactly what he was going to do. He started with a description of our challenges under Joe Biden. Look, we know our country's going in the wrong direction. We see it with our eyes and we feel it in our bones. Our southern borders collapse. Drugs are pouring into the country. Our cities are being hollowed out by spiking crime. The federal government's making it harder for the average family to make ends meet and to attain and maintain a middle class lifestyle. And our president, Wellie Lax vigor, flounders in the face of our nation's challenges and he takes his cues from the woke mob. Now, obviously, all of that is true. And then he suggested that basically what he was looking to do is restore sanity to the nation, which by the way is a good campaign. Okay, the best campaign, best version of the Republican campaign here is not wild, crazy mud fight. The best version of the Republican campaign is Joe Biden is a very bad president who's not up to the job. He's wrecked the economy. He's wrecked our foreign policy. He's wrecked our border. He's wrecked us socially. You know, you know, it'd be awesome normality. Here's DeSantis making that case. We must restore sanity to our nation. This means embracing fiscal and economic sanity. Stop pricing hardworking Americans out of a good standard of living through inflationary borrow print and spending policies and please embrace American energy independence. This also means replacing the woke mind virus with reality, facts and enduring principles. Merit must trump identity politics. We must return normalcy to our communities. America's a sovereign country. Our borders must be respected. We cannot have foreigners pouring into our country illegally by the millions. We cannot allow drug cartels to poison our population with fentanyl. Public deserves safe communities and law and order must be maintained in American cities. Okay, again, all that is bread and butter kind of stuff that I think 80% of Americans agree with. That's the kind of stuff that you're going to get from DeSantis. And again, that's why the Twitter spaces launch was a negative for him. Although the numbers, again, were very, very large. We'll get to that momentarily. First, as you know, baby Shapiro number four has now joined us. This means no sleep for anyone, but when I am able to lie down in those brief moments between when he is waking my wife up and when we are changing diapers, I need to be able to sleep.

So the census continued his actual announcement once you got passed all of the headlines about the glitchiness he got to his actual his actual announcement was quite good. Kerry was talking about defending law enforcement and restoring honor to the military. We can't have inmates running the asylum and we must reject attacks on the men and women of law enforcement. We also must reestablish integrity in our institutions. This includes the military. I'm proud to be a Navy veteran and Iraq veteran and I revere our services, but when revered institutions like those in our military are more concerned with matters not central to the mission, whether it's global warming or gender ideology and pronouns, morale declines and recruiting suffers. And you need to eliminate these distractions and we need to get focused on the core mission. Okay. All of that happens to be correct. And then he ripped into an elected bureaucrats who went through sort of the rest of his campaign schville. But the part that really mattered, there are two things he said in this that really matter. And these are going to be the contrast going into 2024. He says, listen, politics is not entertainment. Governing is not entertainment. We get results here. This is going to be the actual pitch for honest, his is you want the glitz, you want the glamour, you want the distractions, you want the crazy entertainment of it. I'm probably not your guy. If you want somebody who's actually going to govern strongly, who's going to get done what you need to get done. If you'd like to win in policy terms, well, then I am your guy and I have the receipts to prove it because I'm running a state that has gained hundreds of thousands of citizens since 2020, thanks to conservative governance. Here he was talking about how governing is not entertainment. Obviously, he's substituting Trump here. But we also understand governing is not entertainment. It's not about building a brand or virtue signaling. It is about delivering results. And our results in Florida have been second to none. We can and we must deliver big results for America. And you know, just hands talked about COVID. He talked about how he did not allow vast mandates in the state, which is true. And how freedom was threatened by COVID-19 authoritarianism. These are all going to be points of comparison with Donald Trump. The rest of this campaign is going to be about Ron DeSantis calling out Donald Trump on making Anthony Fauci a world famous figure and then allowing him to essentially run his policy in fragmentary fashion while simultaneously suggesting that Operation Warp Speed is the greatest thing to ever happen in the history of humanity and saying that Georgia should lock down and then saying Georgia should not lock down. Michigan should be free. It was all very that right. DeSantis was very consistent in his policy. He was always looking at data. So that's going to be one point of differentiation. Another point of differentiation. He's going to say, listen, you want to talk a little in order? I literally paid a stipend to cops who come to the state of Florida 10 grand a piece during the Black Lives Matter riots. You were tweeting out your campaign was literally tweeting out in support of George Floyd protesters. That is a thing that did happen in the middle of summer 2020. Donald Trump did not deploy the National Guard. You talk about building a wall. You didn't complete the wall. You were the president. You had a Republican Congress. You didn't get the wall done. Right. These are all going to be points that DeSantis is going to be able to make. And Trump doesn't have a great rebuttal to a lot of that sort of stuff. Trump's rebuttal is probably going to be calling him Rob. It's probably going to be suggesting that he has no personality. It's all going to be personal stuff. So that's going to be the choice, I think, in this Republican primary. If you think it's really a two person primary, which I do, it's going to be, you know, you love the personality of Trump. You think he is wild, then he's eccentric. And that's the only way things get done. Okay, I hear. I don't think that it's fully justified by his administration. And I don't think it's justified by the election of 2020, 2021, 2021, 2020. But I hear I get the argument and I understand why people love it. And then the other side of the argument is going to be DeSantis saying, listen, you can speculate on Trump or you can earn a very nice consistent rate of return by investing in my candidacy. And that was essentially his pitch. He said, listen, there's no substitute for victory. Wining is not a substitute for victory complaining about losing is not a substitute for victory. Pretending you won when you're not the president is not a substitute for victory. Here was DeSantis. There is no substitute for victory. We might end the culture of losing that has infected the Republican Party in recent years. The tired dogmas of the past are inadequate for a vibrant future. We must look forward, not backwards. We need the courage to lead and we must have the strength to win. And to voters who are participating in this primary process, my pledge to you is this. If you nominate me, you can set your clock to January 20th, 2025 at high noon, because on the west side of the U.S. Capitol, I will be taking the oath of office as the 47th president of the United States. No excuses. I will get the job done. Hey, that's the big pledge, right? If you nominate me, I will take office because I will win, right? That is the and here's the thing. DeSantis can answer the question that Trump cannot. So to say Trump has one question that he cannot answer and I've been asking everyone around him and Trump still has not given an answer. None of his supporters have given an answer. Let's assume that Trump is right and that the election of 2020 was stolen from him, like full on stolen. And I don't mean like soft rigged. I mean, not in the way that I agree with, not in the way that like Facebook was suppressing content that was beneficial to Trump and harmful to Biden or like the rules changed in the last few months of the campaign because of COVID and allowed for a massive increase in mail in ballots that obviously benefited Democrats. But I agree with all of that. In a soft sense, the election of 2020 was rigged. But Trump talks about it in the hard sense. He thinks that it was like actual voter fraud, fake ballots that were being bust into Fulton County in the middle of the night and then tabulate, right? That's the thing that Trump has actually claimed in Arizona, in Georgia. He hasn't really mentioned it so much in Wisconsin and Michigan, which is weird because even if he'd won Arizona and Georgia, if he lose Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, he's still not the president. But put all that aside, let's assume that what Trump says is absolutely correct, that it was full on stolen from him in 2020. The question I've asked and that no one has answered so far because it's a relevant question is how do you plan to reverse this? Truly, how do you plan to reverse this? What is your actual plan for becoming president of the United States? Your case is that the system was so out to get you that hundreds of thousands of ballots were literally changed in order to prevent you from becoming the president. Going on through social and mailing off about it is not going to change that results. What exactly is your plan to change that result? Now, the thing about DeSantis is that he actually does have a plan. Okay, DeSantis in the state of Florida, for example, and this has been true since the 2018 gubernatorial race. DeSantis is extremely meticulous about how he runs a campaign. It is not thinly staffed. He is not going to rely on the vicissitudes of the media in order to buoy his campaign. He will actually get people out on the ground knocking on doors. He's going to make sure that there are people who are harvesting ballots in the states where ballot harvesting is legal. He's going to make sure that he competes on every front as opposed to Trump, who in 2020, late 2020, early 2021, told the voters of Georgia not to vote in the Georgia Senate race, because he was so mad about how Georgia wins that he basically handed two seats in the United States Senate to the Democrats, leading to the greatest unprecedented spending binge in American history. That doesn't happen if Trump doesn't tell people to stay home in Georgia. Unlike that, DeSantis looked at the state of Florida. He's like, okay, well, you know, they're doing ballot harvesting. They're organizing in a particular what if we just out organize them? What if we just outdo it and then you won by 20 points? That's the way you actually win. By the way, you know, who else knows this is Brian Kemp, who won a sweeping victory in Georgia at the same time that Trump was losing Georgia and to Georgia senators were losing their seats because people didn't show up to vote in the runoff. So that's the actual plan. Hey, if you believe, if you're a believer that elections get stolen, the only way to defeat that is to actually mobilize on the ground and change how you do the elections, not to bitch about it on truth social. So DeSantis can actually make that case because that's actually what he has done in the state of Florida. That's going to be the final line of attack. I think that DeSantis is probably going to use again. Trump's line of attacks are pretty clear at this point. He's going to call him Rob. He's going to suggest that he's meatball Ron is going to do this sort of stuff. And maybe you throw to that. Okay, maybe find an understanding. Okay, the question is, who do you think is most likely to be Biden? So when I say that DeSantis is actually pretty good at the game of politics, let me point out that despite the Twitter spaces debacle and it was an debacle. The launch, the glitch failure was an debacle that despite that, in the first hour after that, in the first hour after that, the DeSantis campaign raised $1 million to put that in perspective. When Donald Trump declared that the D.A. in Manhattan was about to prosecute him, it took him three days to raise $1.5 million in the first hour DeSantis raised $1 million. DeSantis currently has $200 million in the bank. The New York Times has a full article talking about how DeSantis is preparing an outreach push so big that they plan to knock on the door of every possible DeSantis voter in at least four times in New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, and five times in the kickoff Iowa caucuses. The effort is part of an on-the-ground organizing operation that intends to hire more than 2600 field organizers by Labor Day, an extraordinary number of people for even the best funded campaigns. Top officials with the protisantis group, a super PAC called Never Backdown, provided their most detailed account yet of their battle plan to aid DeSantis, who may believe they can sell as the only candidate to take on and win the cultural fights their definitional for the Republican Party in 2024. The group said it expected to have an overall budget of at least $200 million, including more than $80 million to be transferred from an old DeSantis state political account for the daunting task of vaulting the Florida governor past President Donald J. Trump. That's how you win elections, by the way. It is not, I understand, we here on the show, we talk about 30,000-foot politics, right? What's in the headlines? What people are saying today. But the truth is the vast majority of the American public does not register politics on that granular level. They just don't. That's why the voter turnout rates in this country are like 65%. The way people actually consume politics is they've a generalized feeling. What does that mean? It means that voter turnout matters. It means hard on the ground work matters. It means that staffing up your campaign matters. So you get to choose which candidate do you think is most likely to beat Joe Biden? And the reality is that if you look past the style of the Twitter launch and to the substance, what he was actually saying, if you look to the start, past the style, to the substance of what DeSantis achieved is the governor of Florida, if you'll pass the style of Trump on truth social, blasting out weird videos of fake AI voices, Veline Musk and Adolf Hitler and Satan talking with Ron DeSantis, and you look to, you know, spending money on the ground, getting people to knock on doors. That is actually how you win elections. Now, that doesn't mean that DeSantis is going to beat Trump in the primaries. Trump obviously has the upper hand. He's the most famous person in America. Republicans generally love the guy. Understandably, he was a great president for the first three years. I think the last year was a real problem for him, obviously, which is why he's not the president anymore. And he had a real problem with being unable to activate the filter between his brain and his mouth, which is why he's not president anymore. I said all the time during the Trump administration that if you could just take Twitter away from Donald Trump, he would never have stopped being president. He would have continued to be president. He would be president right now. With all that said, Republican primary voters, anybody who suggests that last night was the end of the campaign? No, no, no, last night was just the beginning of the campaign, no matter how badly things went on Twitter spaces. Again, just one second, we'll get to something that's going very badly for Joe Biden. And that, of course, is the debt ceiling at fight first.

He is trapped between a rock and a hard place because on the one hand, he doesn't want the debt ceiling to be hit. If the debt ceiling is hit, a couple of bad things happen for Joe Biden won serious financial turmoil. So a lot of people are going to wonder whether the US debt is actually good. There's going to be a very difficult time actually raising new debt in order to pay for the old debt and all the rest of it. And so that's that's problem number one. Problem number two is we hit the debt ceiling. The truth is we'll continue to parrotet that is mandatory spending. It's the discretionary spending that is going to get cut. That's discretionary spending is what keeps Democrats afloat. It ain't social security and Medicare and Medicaid. Right. Those things are mandatory spending. It is going to be all the discretionary spending that is going to get cut. It's going to be COVID spending. It's going to be infrastructure bill Green New Deal garbage that is going to get cut. And Biden's going to have to go back to his base and explain why all that stuff is being cut if we hit the debt ceiling. So these are two serious problems for Joe Biden. And then he's created for himself a third problem, which is that he took the very strong position of, I'm not going to negotiate under any bag of salmon. And then he has to negotiate because it turns out that he does not run the Congress and there is a co equal branch of government called the legislature that sometimes you have to negotiate with. So he can always rely on the media to do his dirty work for him. The Washington Post says GOP unites and brinksmanship over default rejecting Biden compromises. This is precisely the opposite of what is actually happening. The actually thing that is the actual thing that is happening is that the Republicans passed a bill raising the debt ceiling and saying no spending above 2022 levels. And Joe Biden has summarily dismissed all of that and then claimed that he is negotiating. This is false. The Washington Post says, quote, ahead of another round of negotiations with the White House, McCarthy told Republicans they had the upper hand in the discussions and encouraged his members to show their support for colleagues facing tough real life bids next year as a sign of unity. McCarthy urged members to make sure vulnerable lawmakers would have plenty of campaign money from GOP coffers. The overture reflects the GOP's determination to stay unified behind spending cuts, even as the nation heads toward the brink of a default, despite a rapidly approaching deadline, a White House suddenly eager to compromise and a democratic led effort to push a petition that could force a vote on raising the debt ceiling over McCarthy's objections. So first of all, no, that petition is not going to succeed. You have to have a majority of votes in order to get that petition to succeed. Number two, the White House not suddenly eager to compromise. If they were, they would just sign off on the bill. And in fact, the same Washington Post is noting that Democrats are very nervous over this whole battle. Quote, Democrats worry grows over White House approach to that talks. House Democratic leaders are voicing frustration over President Biden's approach negotiating a debt ceiling deal with Republicans, worrying that their priorities are not being championed aggressively enough. And the Biden hasn't more forcefully pushed back publicly against Republican demands. So you have the left wing of the Democratic Party, and they're very, very angry at Joe Biden for not holding the line. Akim Jeffries has acknowledged that representative Sheila Jackson Lee's team pushing the Democrats to not compromise are really pushing him. Jeffries has not raised the question with the president, according to a person familiar with the situation who like others who spoke to the Washington Post did so on condition of anonymity. Jeffries said it's my expectation that if Republicans continue to play games with the American economy, threaten default and drive us into a very dangerous situation, we begin to hear from the administration of not the president himself. Well, he can say whatever he wants. But the reality is that if we hit the debt ceiling here after Republicans have appeared as the moderates who actually want to compromise, Joe Biden is going to feel the full brunt of the American public. Right now it is a dead even split in the polling on who gets blamed if the debt ceiling gets breached. But let's be real about this. If the economy itself sinks, it ain't going to be congressional Republicans who pay that price. It's going to be the president of the United States. Janet Yellen for her part is trying to bring the pressure. She says that the US could become unable to meet all of its financial obligations as soon as June 1st. This, by the way, is not fully true. As I say, we'll continue to pay our debt. We'll just have to cut discretionary spending. I will plan to update Congress shortly and try to increase the level of precision. You know, there's a lot of uncertainty about government payments and receipts even a few weeks out. And it's hard to be precise about exactly which day we will run out of resources. But early June is, it seems almost certain that we will not be able to get passed early June. And I do intend to provide an update pretty soon. Okay. Meanwhile, the Democrats are trying to cram through the idea that Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans are the ones who are extremists on all this. The problem is that narrative already got away from them. When the Republicans passed a bill that increased the debt ceiling, Democrats were wrong footed and they have not adjusted in any way, shape or form. Here's Korean Jean-Pierre World's worst White House press secretary explaining that if we default, there will be a recession. Yeah, we know. So maybe your boss should sign something. A default would have catastrophic impacts in every single part of this country, whether you're in a red state or in a blue state. It doesn't matter. Every single part of the country. We're talking about millions of jobs lost, devastated retirement counts, and a recession. Okay, so who are you? I don't understand. Again, if the American public perceives that you guys are the ones who are not being moderate on making a compromise, you're basically talking the American public into blaming your guy. It's very bizarre. The irrepressibly stupid Alexander Ocasio-Cortez, the representative from Twitch and also Brooklyn. She says that McCarthy is engaging in quote unquote extortion. Extortion. Here we go. The reason why anyone is asking anyone on this stage about what we would vote for is because Kevin McCarthy needs our votes. So if he wants any democratic support, he has to come to the table. And we have seen him over and over again say that he will not negotiate, that they are engaged in hostage taking, not negotiation, extortion, not conversation. And that is not something we can establish. It is not something we can reinforce in this country. Except for McCarthy already passed the bill. Like they just, it's amazing. Honestly, Joe Biden, it's the biggest political blunder that I've seen a president make just as a pure matter of political gamesmanship. The president always has the advantage in the debt ceiling standoff because he can say, listen, we need to raise the debt ceiling. I'm only going to make a few minor compromises, but it's imperative that we not breach the debt ceiling. Joe Biden start off with, I'm not making any compromise. I'm not even talking about this. We're not going to have a conversation. And Republicans were like, okay, we'll pass a bill that raised the debt ceiling. Now who looks like the moderate? The only way that the Democrats can try to buy this back in the face of their own base is presumably to try and blame McCarthy, but it's just not working. From Millage I apologize, Paul, the progressive leader from Washington, she says that raising the debt ceiling is a sacred principle. Amazing what the Democrats consider sacred, right? Abortion, same sex marriage, transing of the children and raising the debt ceiling. These are sacred items to democratic leadership. Ranking member of the Budget Committee, Brendan Boyle has a great bill on this to take care of the debt ceiling, allow the Treasury Secretary to raise the debt ceiling. Many of us are proud to be on that bill. I think this is really important because I think there used to be this idea that the debt ceiling was sort of sacred, you know, that you, it was just paying your bills. This had already been negotiated. It was already agreed to. And what we've seen is Republicans increasingly taking on those very sacred principles of keeping the economy going, of not defaulting, of not throwing people into uncertainty and chaos. Yeah, that's what progressives are famous for, is paying their bills and not throwing people into uncertainty and cast. Meanwhile, again, McCarthy is coming out of this, looking pretty good at this point. Again, it's pretty astonishing turn of events for the speaker of the house who was largely derided for his near inability to gain the speakership. This is pretty good gamesmanship here from McCarthy. Listen now, moderate McCarthy sounds when he talks about the debt limit talks. It says this week we need to have a deal this week in order to avoid the public. I still believe that. Yeah. And I still believe we have time to make an agreement and get it done. Are you speaking up? I'm confident in the day that if you watched anything about my life, I never give up at anything. So we will get a deal when we have one worthy of the American public. Okay, so again, pretty moderate. And then McCarthy points out we've offered a lot of concessions at this point. So what exactly is the problem? You're going to need Democratic both probably in the house, definitely in the Senate. You're the Democrat in the White House. Why not offer a single concession beyond saying we're not going to default? We've offered a lot of concessions. The cap on the spending is a Democrat idea. They want to do that. The work requirement was a Democrat idea. The time I can't help it if the Democrats have become so extreme and now it's a party of Bernie Sanders, then the party where Joe Biden was elected Joe Biden is the president of the United States. He is the head Democrat. But if AOC and Bernie Sanders is going to run their party, that's not my fault. He is right and it makes Joe Biden look very bad. And so if that ceiling gets breached, Joe Biden is going to pay the price for that again. Very, very bad. Stratit is a strategic here by the president of the United States. Okay. Meanwhile, we are quickly reaching the point. Thank God in corporate America, where corporate paymasters, they're starting to realize that the only winning move is not to play all our war games that you can't mess around because if you do, you're going to find out. Bud Light found that out when they got absolutely trashed. I've never seen a brand get trashed harder than Bud Light has now been trashed. They literally cannot give away beer. You're seeing pictures from like Walmart of just three stacks of Bud Light and nobody picking them up because nobody wants to, what dude is interested in purchasing or even drinking the beer that is associated with a brand that believes that men are women and women are men. Like it's just not a thing that a lot of dudes are going to do. Well, now Target has really stepped in it and they've got a real problem on their hands. So remember, it wasn't just that Target was pushing the Pride Month stuff. They've been doing that for years. And it was annoying and people kind of ignored it. Then they started pushing not just Pride Month, but like giant Pride displays everywhere because during the month of June, we get the Holy Month of Pride and during the Holy Month Pride, everything is covered in rainbow vomit. It's important that every single product be covered in rainbow vomit, every single one, and not just that. Now also in Pride Progress vomit, so TransVomit. So you have to have some, you have to have some bathing suits in which boys can tuck their twig and berries underneath themselves. They can look more like girls. You have to make sure that you have baby onesies talking about bisexuality over at Target. And people don't like this very much. They also didn't like that Target had started retailing in partnership with a UK-based brand called Abpralen to sell merchandise. And a search on Target's website found some of the items. Those items were designed by a person named Eric Carnell, an outspoken Satanist whose brand features occult imagery and messages like Satan respects pronouns on brand apparel, which is just delightful. Abpralen also sells merch with aggressive messaging, attacking critics, pins with the phrases, heteronormity is a plague, and burned down the system, are featured on the website along with one that says homophobe headrest with an image of a guillotine. Carnell is a transgender designer behind the brand, explained in Instagram post Satan represents passion, pride, and liberty, and loves all LGBTQ plus minus divided by signed people. So, um, I mean, no argument, no argument for me. They think that that's not literal. I think it's a little literal. And I'm not a believer in the Christian version of Satan. Like Satan is almost a nostic, a nostic opponent of God, you know, the fallen angel who now opposes God's kingship brand. That's not a Jewish concept of Satan, but the idea that the Yates are harrow, right? The evil inclination is very into pride, passion, liberty, and sexual license. Yeah, I mean, yes. So target just got they're getting ripped up by a lot of their customer base. And so now they've decided they're going to try to walk off it. The problem is once you engage, you cannot disengage the pride progress team will not allow you to disengage. You will be forced to reengage. And so now you're forced to play this two steps. You got to take one side or another, you need to be neutral and just provide products to people to buy them, or you can take a clear demarcation line on issues of the day. Now, what's amazing about this is that you have people like Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, who is who's done a an absolutely horrific job in the state of California to the extent that 500,000 people left the state of California net between 2020 and 2022. And Gavin Newsom is out there tweeting about target and suggesting this is just a terrible we can't allow this sort of thing ever, ever again. And in fact, Gavin Newsom then started to do the old Holocaust poem, right? First they came for the and then they came for the time they came for the Jews. There was no one left to defend me. Okay. So Gavin Newsom tweeted, CEO of Target Brian Cornell, selling out the LGBTQ plus community to extremists is a real profiling courage. Well, why is he saying that? Well, because Target decided to move some of their pride progress nonsense to the back of the store in states where it ain't that popular. He said, this isn't just a couple of stores in the South. There's a systemic attack on the gay community happening across the country. Yes. As a gaze across the country, our under systemic threat in a country where gay marriage is not only legal, but now they are attempting to force your children to learn about it in kindergarten. Wake up America says Gavin Newsom, this doesn't stop here. You're black, you're Asian, you're Jewish, you're woman, you're next. Yeah, you're right. Probably Target's going to stop selling women's clothing. Probably now. And also, as a Jew, I'm feeling real threatened by by people who are not into the transing of the children. Like as an Orthodox, I feel super you'll notice that Target has been selling Conica gear for literally years. Like every conica season, a lot of conica gear, has there ever been a boycott of Target on that basis? Nope, because ain't nobody care. You always notice that Target for black history month sells all sorts of black products. Some of that stuff is pretty divisive. Has anybody ever boycott Target over that? Not really. Has there ever been an anti Asian move against Target? Nope. It is only when you start trying to trans the kids, the people start to get a little uptight for good reason. But again, now Target is stuck between a rock and a hard place of its own making as all corporate brands will be. So all you corporate brand leaders out there are preparing for Pride Month. Just remember, this could be you. If you decide to step into this minefield and then you get blown up, ain't no sympathy for you over here. And in fact, some of us are quite happy to make an example of if you decide to become the bleeding edge of the Pride Progress team attempting to foster a societal viewpoint that damages children and wrecks traditional morality. You've seen the two step here from the LA Dodgers, right? The LA Dodgers is the most clear example. They decide they're going to have a Pride night. They've been having Pride night for years. Nobody much cared. Like if you didn't like, you just didn't go to the ballpark. And then they decided, you know, we're going to honor the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, which is an anti-Catholic group in which gay men and gay women, dress and trans people dress up as Jesus and Mary in blasphemous sort of displays. And then the Dodgers had to walk that back. So it turns out like a huge percentage of their fan base is Hispanic Catholic. And then the LGBTQ plus minus divided by a sign community was so mad that they reinstated the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. So here's what you guys can do. Don't play the game. Just sell the products and stop trying to proselytize on behalf of left wing crap. Not that tough. Don't vomit rainbows everywhere during Pride Month. Just sell pants. I know this is real tough stuff here. I know this is really bad. By the way, this would make for a, you know, you want to know how you know I'm sincere about this? It makes for a less lucrative America if we do this. It makes for a less lucrative daily wiring. We literally launched Jeremy's razors on the back of Woke brands. We launched Jeremy's chocolate on the back of Woke brands. If you guys want to keep polarizing this thing, we are happy to take money from people who feel scorned and upset because they're brands who hate their guts. But you know what? I'd prefer an America where you just go back to selling a product and stop trying to promote the idea that Rachel Levine is a moral exemplar to us all. It's very simple. Go back to neutral and every all weapons go away. But if you're going to play this game, play stupid games, win stupid prizes, F round and find out. I've studied it multiple times. There's a Harvard Business School study. The Harvard Business School study shows that the left has basically been leveraging brands for the last couple of decades that left wingers will use their ire against conservative corporations in order to rip on them, whether it's Chick-fil-A or their Tobby Lobby that will go after them full scale if they even perceive any whiff of conservatism. Meanwhile, conservatives for literally decades have just been like, okay, it's a left wing corporation, whatever. I'll still go there. Not anymore. Those days are over because you have pushed too far. You have decided that it is imperative that you become the loud speaker for a system of morality that sustains traditional institutions like the nuclear family that sustains the natural necessity of heterosexual relationships and pretends that all sexual activity is morally equivalent and equally fulfilling and entirely. And there should be moral apathy about all this stuff. That's you. You did it. So now you have a choice. You can go back to neutral and stop with this garbage or you can continue to walk down this primrose path. And I am more than happy to take my business elsewhere. And more than that, we hear it daily where we're happy to start our own businesses that don't scorn our audience. Target is if you think it's over for Target, and it ain't over for Target, not by a not by a damned long shop. Okay. Meanwhile, speaking of local news stories that became national news stories and then went back to being local news stories, this one's hilarious. So you'll remember that a couple of days ago, there was a man who crashed a U-Haul truck into a security barrier outside the White House. Now, this sort of thing has happened before. In fact, back in April of 2021, there was a police officer in Washington, you see who was actually killed by a person who ran him over near the Capitol building. We don't talk about that situation because it wasn't connected with January 6th. You know, the names of people like Brian Sicknick, who may have died as a result of January 6th, but did not die on January 6th, and it's still unclear. You know, his name, you don't know the name of the officer who's killed in an actual quasi terror attack by the US Capitol because the person who killed him was not actually like a MAGA member. Okay. Well, this is a perfect example of that sort of flip. So there's a man who crashed a U-Haul truck into a security barrier outside the White House, and this was top of the news. It was the biggest story in the country. Why? Because he had a Nazi flag and a Nazi flag. And he said that he was going to kill President Biden. And so for a brief hot second, the media were like, ah, our dream scenario has emerged. Here it is, a white supremacist MAGA-headed, just a smollett attacker who's about to ram into the White House with a U-Haul truck and a Nazi flag. Oh, all of our fantasies are about to come true. Members of the media were Jeffrey Tubining it. They broke out the stores of KY. They were really getting ready for just a party. And then it turned out that the person who did it is a person named Sai Varsheth Khandula. And he is an illegal immigrant. A fuller picture of Khandula also began to emerge from an acquaintance who attended high school with him in suburban St. Louis. Apparently, the friends were shocked by allegations against him. They portrayed him as quiet and kind. They did not say what country he was originally from or when he arrived in the United States. Assistant federal public defender Diane Schruzberry, who's appointed to represent Khandula, did not offer defensive Khandula in court. Apparently, they say that it appears this guy is a crazy person. In fact, Khandula liked to wear a surgical mask with Biden's name on it during the pandemic because he got a reaction from the people at Marquette University where he was going to school. Khandula apparently has begun and lost his mind. And again, not here legally. He told authorities he bought the flag because Nazis have a great history and he admired their authoritarian nature, eugenics, and their one world order according to charging documents. And he called Adolf Hitler a strong leader. But he wasn't a Trump supporter. So not a national news story. We can't we can't have a conversation about illegal immigration or who's in the country legally and who's not. That would be a conversation media dumb one I have. So instead, we would just want to have the conversation at all. And so the story, it disappeared, it no longer exists just like many local news stories. It popped into the news for a brief hot second. And then like that, it was gone. Okay, time for some things I like and then some things that I hate. So things that I like today, Khanda zones, she made a documentary about Black Lives Matter is called the greatest lie ever sold. And it was all about how Black Lives Matter was a giant scam. The entire organization was designed to make money for its founders. It paid Patrice colors a lot of money. Hey, Patrice colors the brother a lot of money like $1.6 million for security services in 2022. Another sister of a board member and $1.1 million for consulting. It cleared tens of millions of dollars from ridiculous left wing progressives in places like California who decided that they want to put a lawn sign on their lawn reading. In this house, Black Lives Matter water is delicious. That kind of garbage. So all those idiots signed checks to Black Lives Matter. And it was it was used by a black person Patrice colors to purchase herself a very, very nice house. Well, now according to the Daily Mail, BLM's national organizations at risk of going bankrupt after its finances plunged $8.5 million into the red last year, while simultaneously handing multiple staff seven figure salaries. Oh, you mean it was a giant scam. No, you shock me. Financial disclosures obtained by the Washington free beacon show the perilous state of BLM global network foundation, which officially emerged in November 2020 as a more formal way of structuring the civil rights movement. Despite the financial controversy, BLM continued to hire relatives of Patrice colors and several board members. Paul colors was one of the BLM's only two paid employees during the year. He collected $126,000 salaries head of security on top of consulting fees. He is best known as a graffiti artist with no background in security. For the previous year 2021 tax filings reveal the BLM paid a company owned by Damon Turner, the father of colors child, nearly $970,000 to help produce live events and provide other creative services. The sister of a former Black Lives Matter board member Raymond Howard was employed as a consultant that would be Daniel Edwards. Her new impact partners has paid $1.1 million for consulting services in 2022. So donations have plunged because everybody stopped feeling bad about about the George Floyd of it all and decided to start sending their checks to their global warming scam pack. So they just moved it from one scam pack to another scam pack. But it is delicious to imagine how much money went to Black Lives Matter and their founders and then all that money went directly into somebody's pocket. So just slow clap for the racial scam that paid off until they went bankrupt. Yep. Yep. Okay. Meanwhile, some things that I hate. So Roger Waters of a Pink Floyd, he is a vicious, horrible anti-Semite. He has been for years. He pretends that it's anti-Semitism is actually just anti-Zionism. But no, it's actually just full-scale anti-Semitism. So apparently over the last couple of days, he did a concert at the Mercedes Benz Arena in Berlin. Now Berlin, you'll recall when it comes to, you know, anti-Semitism and Nazism, it has a history. There's some things that happened in Germany, a few things. In fact, the brand Mercedes Benz may have been involved in some of those things actually. Roger Waters decided it would be an excellent idea to dress up as an SS officer and then compare Anne Frank, the murdered 14-year-old Jewish girl to all just zero-journalist Shireen Abu Akla, who was accidentally shot probably by IDF forces. When I say probably, I don't mean that she was accidentally shot probably like accidentally. I mean that probably IDF forces accidentally shot her. It's still not clear whether that is the case or not, but let's assume it's the case after investigations. Clearly, the IDF was not targeting a prominent journalist who killed her. That would be a very stupid thing to do. And obviously, it is not what happened. But that didn't stop Roger Waters. That dude is now comparing a journalist who's accidentally killed in the middle of a shootout with terrorists to a 14-year-old girl in Denmark, who's taken out of an attic and shipped to Auschwitz where she was gassed to death. Because Roger Waters is a piece of human debris. He is a garbage human being. At the beginning of the show, an announcement was displayed on a screen reading quote, on a matter of public interest, a court in Frankfurt has ruled that I am not an anti-Semite. Just to be clear, I condemn anti-Semitism unreservedly. Nope. He is a vile piece of crap, and he hates the Jews, the Jews. And then he compared, of course, a bunch of victims of the Nazis to various people who have been killed in conflict with the Israelis. He is what a vile piece of garbage. Here's what it looked like. Gross and terrible. Yuck. All righty. We've reached the end of this part of the show, but you don't want to miss what's coming up next. We'll be speaking with Bishop Robert Barron. We'll be talking about the Judaism of Catholicism. If you're not a member, become a member, use Coach Shapiro Checkout for two months free, and I'll annual plans.
