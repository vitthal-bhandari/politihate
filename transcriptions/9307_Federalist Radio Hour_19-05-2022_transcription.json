    "text": " We're back with another edition of the Federalist Radio Hour. I'm Emily Duchinsky, Culture Editor here at The Federalist. As always, you can email the show at radioathefederalist.com. Follow us on Twitter at FDRLST. Make sure to subscribe wherever you download the podcast as well. Today, I'm joined by my colleague, Federalist Staff Writer, Jordan Boyd. Jordan, welcome. Thanks for having me, Emily. Jordan, by the way, edits the podcast. So take out all of your rage on Jordan. Anytime, radioathefederalist.com, address specifically to Jordan and give her headaches if there's editing problems. Yes, send everything my way. I'm kidding, Jordan is incredibly helpful on the podcast. So we appreciate that. We appreciate Jordan that you wear so many hats at The Federalist. The primary hat is that you are a staff writer for us. You've been covering a few things lately that stuck out to me as a good pattern in recent weeks juxtaposing a narrative from the political establishment about the culture war. That was somewhat of a mouthful. But what I mean is there's this narrative from the political establishment that the culture war is agenda distraction, just totally fabricated by the right, who's they're just foaming at the mouth to fight about trans issues and everything under the sun in that respect. But underneath the surface where a lot of the media isn't looking, there are serious, I think assaults on reason and on the natural order happening in our politics on a daily basis. And you wrote recently about the NIH director, I guess, the acting NIH director who had refused to, as you write in your headline, condemn chemically castrating kids despite the irreversible damage. Senator Marco Rubio, who was recently on this podcast, asked him about it during the hearing, Jordan, this is one of three incidents you've covered recently that I want to talk about and sort of established this pattern. So start off by telling us what happened with Lawrence Tayback, the acting director of the National Institutes of Health. Yeah, absolutely. Well, like you said, this is something that's sort of come to the forefront of our culture and media and politics battle in the last couple of years. And specifically, more recently, the Biden administration has been pushing it. And we've seen that come out through various agencies. So like you mentioned more recently, the NIH director, Lawrence Tayback, when he was questioned by Marco Rubio the other day about these procedures. I mean, these are things that cause a lot of damage and are frequently recommended by the Biden administration for children who are dealing with some of this gender dysphoria or even just dealing with the effects of growing up. And the NIH director basically said that he does agree with the Biden administration's push for this. And it's not worrisome to him that these procedures, despite not having FDA approval, despite not having a lot of research on just how damaging they can be, he's okay with them being pushed by the NIH. He's okay with them being pushed by the Biden administration. Rubio is one of the many senators who has problems with this and mentioned this is clearly problematic. You know, we don't want kids being harmed by processes like this yet. The NIH director said, you know what, we recommend it anyway. He brings up, he invokes this argument that is often used by the left. And that's basically, well, trans people are at higher risk for suicide. They're, you know, at higher risk for self harm. And Rubio is like, yeah, but we're harming them when we recommend these things. These are procedures that very clearly have effects on people that can cause sexual dysfunction and fertility cardiac events and do a material cancer, even transition or grit. So it's, you know, it speaks to this larger conversation for sure about what's happening. Yeah, there's a lot there. And again, the sort of impetus for this podcast is that I was looking on our site and realized these stories I had not really seen covered very much elsewhere. And that's not quantified. I didn't go and study it. I'm just saying it didn't sort of, I didn't see it really penetrate the broader news cycle. And here's what here is what Tayback said directly as you write Jordan, he says, NIH funds a small number of observational studies to gather the data on the effects of treatments that transgender youth and their parents have chosen. And there are also a small number of studies that describe the health issues and risks, including HIV that are unique to these transgender youth. But all of the research in the space is observational. We do know interventional work. Now, obviously, Tayback, is that how I pronounce his name? By the way, do you know? I think that's right, but I'm not quite sure. Okay. So obviously, he knows that observational is going to become interventional throughout the rest of the government. That's, you know, obviously that's why you do studies like this. The Federalist, we ran a story in 2018 about how these are designed, quote, design to justify chemically sterilizing children who suffer from gender confusion or dysphoria. All right, so, Jordan, you also on that note, ask or write in your piece, much like Biden's Health and Human Services Secretary Javier Becerra did in Congressional Hearing a Couple of Weeks Prior, Tayback claimed that endorsing these radical experiments for children is necessary because, quote, transgender youth are more vulnerable to depression, anxiety, engaging in self-harm. Researchers are observing the long-term psychological impact of these protocols. And so by looking at individuals, transgender youth with and without histories of puberty suppression will be able to better answer the types of questions that you're hoping for. So actually, what he is telling Rubio there is you're asking questions that we're trying to answer. We're just trying to get the right information we need to protect children, even though the research is designed to sort of go in a direction, and this is what Rubio is pushing, to go in a direction that we have plenty of information is starting to harm children. Yeah, exactly. It's juxtaposition that's very clearly hypocritical, right? Because, and Rubio makes that point. He says it's because of these long-term implications that are unknown right now that we shouldn't be pushing this. We shouldn't be trying to promote this through HHS and other agencies that are very clearly recommending this and even lying about it. I mean, the White House has a track record of lying about just some of the risks that come with all of these procedures and gender experimentation. So it is something in the larger conversation that is often twisted and often moved towards this political goal. But like you mentioned, the NIH is funding studies with the intent of having a certain outcome. And I mean, that's something that should not be surprising to anyone after the last two years with COVID as well. Yeah, when you looked into this, where as you were reporting this back and forth between Senator Rubio and Tay back out, what did you find about the studies that NIH is actually doing in this space? Yeah, so basically, I mean, like he mentioned, they're technically observational. They're supposed to be looking at these effects and seeing. But what they don't mention is that when they're weighing the consequences of the procedure risks, like we mentioned earlier, they use a medical opinion and they say, well, it's a risk for them to not receive these dangerous procedures. And they use that in the balance to justify enforcing this and even pushing it as a mandate in some cases, which I'm sure we'll address later. So it's one thing for him to say it's observational. It's one thing for him to fall back on that and say, you know, we are doing these studies. It's another thing when you actually look at the ins and outs of them and you see what's actually happening is they're looking at it. They're seeing the bad things that are coming out of this, but they're justifying it anyway. Yeah, and that's important because, again, when we're talking about how the culture war is being fomented by conservatives, which is completely backwards, it's being fomented by the left, that is, again, commissioning studies like these in order to change our sort of cultural perception of what is appropriate. What is appropriate treatment for children? What is appropriate sort of conduct for parents and physicians? They're the ones that are trying to induce a change. So that is sort of backwards in the first place. But even if you accept, you say, conservatives are milking these issues for political gain that may be true. But the broader issue is that somebody should be milking these issues for political gain because somebody needs to be empowered to stop them because they're very real and they're absolutely happening. And on that note, you wrote just today a story with the headline, Federal Judge blocks Biden from forcing religious objectors to bank world gender experimentation. So this is following on all of these things that are sort of happening in the culture war and specifically on the issue of sex and gender beneath the surface of the media coverage. This is another one of those points. Tell us about what you wrote about just this morning. Yeah, well, like I mentioned, the Biden administration is sort of streamlining this push for transgenderism and they've done that across multiple agencies, even from the White House, directly the White House podium Jen Psaki. And one of the things that they have pushed is this mandate that says, you know, under these carve outs under the Affordable Care Act and under their new definition for sex and gender, not just sex as the Trump administration made very clear in their policy making. They said that you have to fund if you're an employer, you have to fund and ensure employees who want to undergo a gender transition, who want to undergo this genital mutilation or chemical castration or whatever. And what this judge said is absolutely not. There should be no government agency in the business of evaluating the sincerity of another's religious beliefs. You know, if a religious organization says we believe in the Bible and we believe in the fundamental truth that men are men and women are women and God created men and women, then we're not going to fund this. We're not going to be forced to pay this. And the judge basically explained that. And another thing that he mentioned, he took it one step further in his opinion and he said, you know what, this AG just thing that's coming out and requiring employers to do this, not only am I going to put an injunction on it, but I'm going to criticize the fact that there aren't a lot of guidelines on this. I mean, he said, according to the judge, under these guidelines from the Biden administration, a newborn baby could undergo these procedures. Obviously, that's very drastic. That's something that's not very widespread and hopefully never will be. But he's saying this is a very broad thing that the Biden administration is pushing without regard for the consequences without regard for all of the problems that come from it. And so this judge was appointed by Trump, right? Yeah. Yeah. And he's out of North Dakota and obviously felt very strongly in favor of religious liberty on this issue. Yeah. It's interesting because we're talking about like what in this tug of war between it's not even left and right so much as it is between like radical, the radical left and the rest of the country. What is in that tug of war when, you know, we're having these debates about whether people should vote vote for Donald Trump because of judges or vote for Biden because of, you know, no more mean tweets or civility or whatever the argument is. This seems to me an interesting example of how people in different positions and are very layered sort of Republican system of government are going to start having consequential or making consequential decisions, hopefully in the direction of reason and sanity. And this does seem to be an example of that. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it is that strong tug of war. And I think, you know, when the federal government pushes something regular Americans are going to feel gas lit into believing that believing that a man is a man and a woman is a woman is wrong. And that's simply not true. Yeah, it's being pushed by the left by the establishment and by the media all at once. And we've seen pushback on it, you know, I mean, we've talked a lot on this podcast and in our federalist coverage about the parents backlash in schools against critical race theory against this radical gender ideology. It's something that parents on both sides of the political aisle are pushing back on because it's natural, like you mentioned, it's reason. And yet it's not something that's widely accepted in the framing of the way our country is working right now. So I definitely consider my incessant skepticism, both a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing in journalism, for sure. But as I've watched all of these, my pillow ads over the years, I have just been plagued by the question, are these as good as the commercials say they are always wondered this?

Yeah, so this is a rule that is and so it's in favor of the Christian employers alliance they were working with Alliance Defending Freedom in this case but federal agencies like EEO the EEOC and HHS from forcing these nonprofit and for profit employers to underwrite chemical castration general annihilation and radical gender counseling as you say due to religious conviction and the quote from the judges no government agency ought to be in the business of evaluating the sincerity of another's religious beliefs. We have been through very similar cases before in recent history particularly as it pertains to abortion. Jordan, where does this case go next? It says that this is a temporary block, right? Yeah, this is a temporary block so it's something that you know once they get through all the legal hoops people will certainly appeal it. The Biden administration almost certainly will because this is obviously something that they very much care about and you know it will end up most likely in front of another judge whether that will be a Trump appointee who feels the same way or not is unclear at this moment in time but like you mentioned this is something that's happened over and over with this issue and is going to continue to happen with issues outside of the trans stuff like abortion we saw it with the vaccine mandates and others where the Biden administration has pushed this wide broad thing on the American people who have said you know what this is crazy and we're going to push back on it. Right and there's a great quote from the judge in here that raises another issue he writes. Beyond the religious implications the Biden HHS notification and resulting HHS guidance frustrate the proper care of gender dysphoria where even among adults who experience the condition a diagnosis occurs following the considered involvement of medical professionals by branding the consideration and this is the key part as quote discrimination the HHS prohibits the medical profession from evaluating was best for the patient and what is certainly a complex mental health question. So that question of discrimination is absolutely critical because this gets to what we've talked about the federalist is that progressive or bigot binary so if you don't fully embrace every tenant of radical gender ideology you are not in disagreement you are discriminating so when you brand every pushback as discrimination rather than disagreement now those two can both be they can be the same thing but in this case I think they're not and it needs to be acknowledged that that's the case so when you brand everyone else as a bigot or somebody who is legally culpable for discrimination simply by disagreeing or abstaining in this case from providing the treatment so from abstaining from providing the treatment makes you guilty of discrimination under the Biden administration this is moderate long time Amtrak Joe senator Biden the Biden administration which was supposed to be returned to normal this is coming from them from their administration from their federal executive branch incredible I think Jordan to to know the legal implications of an ideology that is sort of crept into in some corridors of the government and has sort of swept more broadly through a popular culture but as it's crept into the government the legal the legal implications of this are so consequential and in ways the media doesn't look at. Absolutely and you know I mean it goes back to like you mentioned the the unity president Biden the one who came into office and said that he wasn't going to be splitting the country on issues like this is and is doing so in a very harsh mandated legal way and it sort of goes to the scene that we've seen rising in in radical leftist politics and calling everyone a racist or even this week you know Biden saying ultra MAGA and blaming white supremacy for all the issues that are going on it's this common theme where you muddy the waters around these really really distinct definitions of things things that really really matter in the legal world and you blow them out of proportion which you know ends up losing in court like this did and I think you know with the discrimination issue it's a lot deeper than just even even employers paying for for transition procedures it goes into title nine it goes into the white we mentioned the definition expansion between sex and gender and it's a very broad issue that you you can't take a non-specific approach on it's just simply won't work and you're going to end up hurting Americans and undermining their constitutional rights when you do that right I'm really glad you brought up title nine because that's one thing the media is also not covering but is imminent is the Biden administration is going to release rules more in line per reporting from the Washington Post and you know every indication more in line with the Obama administration's title nine rules from the the Department of Education when it comes to how schools adjudicate questions of first of all sex and gender K through 12 and then in higher education sexual assaults and these rules are radical they were scandalous at the time of the Obama administration in terms of especially adjudicating this on college campuses and actually had a wide range of people Ruth Bader Ginsburg you know people like pretty prominent lawyers on the left saying that these had gone way too far there was a great three part series in the Atlantic by Emily Yoffee on how they had gone way too far and they were just a disaster kangaroo courts utter chaos hurt a lot of people in the process men and women the Biden administration is now planning to take us back there and also back to what the Obama administration did on sex and gender by reading gender identity into the phrase on the basis of sex in title nine which has sweeping implications for every K through 12 school that basically takes federal funding and just in the sort of legal sense as well that was done at the tail end of the Obama administration I want to say it was May of 2015 and yeah I think it must have been oh May of 2016 actually yeah it would have been May of 2016 and what's crazy is that it was seen as like a very radical move then people didn't really understand it and now we have had you know all of the years in between where we start talking about these things happening in schools it becomes a liability for Democrats even in the eyes of some you know establishment moderate Democrats and the Biden administration is just about to go right back to it the media is barely paying attention you get a report here or there about these things but but Jordan um there when they don't pay attention to stories like what happened here in North Dakota that's how the right gets blamed for all of this stuff absolutely and it's it's very intentionally designed that way um I think because when you're on the side of the administration that's pushing these things like why on earth would you call attention to the criticism around it yeah the criticism exists like you mentioned I mean the title nine issue is Hughes and Huge and it's it's a growing issue it's one that expands beyond that so I think you know and and we've seen this trending right like um we saw this even happened in Supreme Court a few years back and in Bostok v Clayton County right like Justice Neil Gorsuch cited and wrote an opinion that said basically sex sexual orientation and gender identity are all under that discrimination definition that we talked about earlier and that's a very monumental slap in the face to a lot of Americans to how we've operated our systems and it's one that a lot of people oppose a lot of people had problems with like you mentioned right um and that brings me to the third thing we've talked we're we're going to talk about that you've covered recently so let's just take a step back for a moment we just talked about how the the acting NIH director is defending this advocacy research in a dangerous direction that is coming out of the federal government then we talked about the federal government a rule the federal government has passed that is not just a violation of religious freedom but is a violation of our duty to children um and the way that we approach sex and gender it's a violation of reason um in addition to being a sort of legal violation of religious rights in a very obvious way so these are two things that you would have in you know 2016 thought you would only see from the most radical of radical um type of in in the future at least after the pushback of the Obama era you might have expected to see from a very radical administration unless like Camille Paulia who after that was passed by the Obama administration I remember I saw this happen she said title nine what the Obama administration did with gender identity might be what lost um Clinton the election um and you know if you were sort of a reasonable person at the time you would think yes Democrats would be walking back from that kind of thing this is a mistake they pushed too far um but the point is now in 2022 the democratic party is so radical that not only are far left Democrats pushing for this stuff but it is being codified by the administration of a so-called moderate democratic president who was supposed to bring us back to a time of civility and and peace and cultural calm not happening at all in fact these these very dangerous things are coming out of the federal government so then uh Cynthia Lummus goes and gives a commencement address at the University of Wyoming. Jordan tell us what happened I'm just I'm gonna let you explain what happened uh because this is slightly different than the last two topics we talked about but still important in this context. Yeah so Lummus gave this commitment commencement speech at the University of Wyoming you know in her in her home state um she's a republican so in her speech she's talking about our rights are given by god and especially in the last two years they've been encroached on by the government and she goes into covid and sort of um shutting down churches but leaving bars and alcohol stores open she receives applause and then she says something she says even fundamental scientific truths such as the existence of two sexes male and female are subject to challenge these days and the mood in the room completely shifts she gets booed and heckled and uh students were just not happy with the fact that she invoked this factual statement in her speech so you know the weekend moves on that these kids graduate uh everything is is okay the university president comes out with a statement and says oh you know one of our speakers came out with uh this you know broad sweeping statement we don't agree with it we believe in diversity we welcome incredible individuality and intellect of all dynamic and um but basically condemns the fact that she stated why you know a majority of americans believe about men and women and and you know she faced and pushed back on twitter too there were some democrat operatives the university's council on diversity equity inclusion pushed back on her and instead of just like wiping these off the shoulder she gets back to them and releases a statement and says it was ever my intention to make anyone feel unwelcome or disrespected and for that i apologize she sort of doubles down on the fact that she believes there are biological differences but she couched her belief in this confession that you know she shouldn't have stated something so factual in such a public forum which is ridiculous right right right and so she says um she apologized to people who may have felt quote unwelcomed or disrespected quote it was never my intention to make anyone feel unwelcome or disrespected and for that i apologize i have appreciated hearing from members of the university of yoming community on this issue and i look forward to continuing this dialogue now this is not something you should have to say for stating a fact so she should not have to say it was her intention to make anyone feel unwelcome or disrespected because she believes it's important to acknowledge biological sort of essential biological truths um that is not uh that is not automatically um the same as that is not automatically a position that makes people feel unwelcome or disrespected reasonably so if you feel unwelcome or disrespected because somebody says even fundamental scientific truths such as the existence of two sexes male and female are subject to challenge these days that is on you not on the person who is saying it and the reason i want to talk about this third jordan is that the last two examples show how important it is for people like senator lemis to not apologize for saying things like that and in fact to say things like that because in the absence in in their silence over the last several years the left has filled the vacuum um and and under the sort of surface in so many cases as we're talking about with hhs rules and nih studies they have filled that vacuum um they have filled the silence with uh all kinds of of harmful gender ideology that is is actually really having a significant impact on children exactly and you know it's something that like we mentioned the federal government has been streamed it's now becoming more mainstreamed in medical and sociological institutions they're endorsing this they're saying that this is acceptable and obviously that's one of those things where they're claiming the ends justify the means on this and that simply should be rejected on its face especially by our republican and i think my exact words were lemis seated key culture were ground to the woke mob by apologizing she did something she contradicted her entire party which you know largely over the vast majority of republican states has actively worked not only in rhetoric but in policy to push back on some of this like you mentioned this leftist push for for these issues this huge huge coordinated effort to make this mainstream and but instead of backing up her republican colleagues instead of coming out and saying you know i didn't say anything wrong she indicted herself she she gave herself over to these people and not only is it hypocritical it's it just feels like instead of moving forward you're moving backward and it just it simply blew my mind i was so caught off guard by this i don't know if you were but um i was totally surprised yeah and i want to actually talk about that i was totally surprised by it from somebody like Cynthia lemis who um you know if you're the type of republican senator who's going to put that in your speech in the first place it you also don't seem to be the type of republican senator who's going to apologize for it um but there is a valid reason um to say that in a speech and a publicly funded university right like taxpayers are on the hook for the education these kids are receiving and they're paying for it partially and supporting it and it has the imprimatur of the state and that means when false teachings are being peddled in ways that are are so obviously harmful um and so salient to the harms in our current politics it is important to go and speak truth to a power that is speaking lies and so i think there was you know did she have to say it in her speech no but was there an argument that it's it's relevant and a useful thing to put in a speech like that absolutely and again the pressure in these situations is really awful because this sort of it goes right back to what we were talking about in terms of the hhs argument that it's it's discrimination to not uh for religious institutions to not underwrite treatments that they don't agree with um that are you know pretty pretty obviously troublesome um when you get on the wrong side and i say wrong in terms of the the radicals wrong side of this debate it is incredibly uncomfortable i i totally understand because when i was a college student i don't know if i've talked about this in the podcast before um my senior year our yaph chapter on campus was called up by the student newspaper who asked us about something the student government had done this is 2015 remember um they had like mandated that leaders of student organizations go to a mandatory training that would have taught them to use uh preferred pronouns and other different things you can you can sort of imagine what that would have done called me up on the phone i was the president of the chapter and asked if i would want a religious exemption if yaph would request religious exemption and i was like well yeah that's we're not going to do that um and it blew up into a national news story and um they tried to the the lgbt group on on campus immediately uh compared us to isis and said we should be thrown off campus um it was like it was completely insane they said that we had committed an act of violence against the transgender community um it was it was absolutely wild and every part of me wanted to apologize because if you are a decent human being you do not want to make anybody feel uncomfortable when people are saying that what you did put them in harm and made them want to you know commit violent acts against themselves you don't if you were a decent human being you would never want to hurt people of course you don't want to hurt people but so the pressure is i guess i understand how somebody like lemis even somebody like lemis who said that put it in her speech could be pushed into an apology and i think that speaks to the power of this dynamic that if you are on the wrong side on any step of the way jk rallying abigail shrier people who are you know liberals you're committing discrimination yeah and i i think you know that speaks to the insanity of this issue and the way that it's framed i mean it's honestly ill framing to say that people who don't want to use pronouns are people who state the biological scientific truth about sex are doing it maliciously i like it does make people uncomfortable but the fact of the matter is truth makes people uncomfortable and truth makes the radical left uncomfortable on a lot of issues it's why president joe biden will not address a lot of the things happening in our nation right now it's why he's avoided confrontation on the border and avoided confrontation on the formula issue and all of these other things coming up it's because the truth makes people uncomfortable and that's something that like you mentioned people like jk rallying abigail shrier this is not partisan this is not something that only republicans have latched onto contrary to the media's narrative it's something that as a whole people are saying this is much bigger than the issue that it's cut out to be this is a free speech issue this is something that's happening across our nation and and something that's bigger and you know i i did find it ironic that um this happened on a university campus this law mis apology you know because we've seen this sort of fomenting on college campuses for a long time and now it's made its way into the broader society and yet we're still apologizing it's just a very strange contrast and one that's frankly you know condemnable well it never mattered if you were in obrulan or in larry me like it never did like this was happening on college campuses in every corner of the country didn't matter if you were at wesleyan or if you were at a state school in the south it's professors and when this went through academia and when we filtered more and more students through academia um this concept of this broad idea of what is discrimination that is very harmful to children and to our cultural concept of sex and and you know the the roles of or the i shouldn't say the roles but the uh inclinations of men and women i mean kamehameha poly has been saying for years that if you want to have a women's studies department you should incorporate biology to it i just shouldn't say that for like 20 plus years and it's it's true and it's the one thing they won't teach in fact um and if they do teach it it's this very sort of like intellectual gymnastics um we don't fully know what makes people men and women uh biologically type nonsense um but but this is why it i think parents and definitely conservatives owe a major debt of gratitude to the abigail shrayers and the jk railings as liberal as they are on this issue because um people who sort of haven't found themselves in the in the crosshairs here don't understand how hard it is when you are in the crosshairs to be firm and what happened is that um you know if we circle back to what happened with me when i was in college that was really hard um i i it was it was really hard and so hard in fact that in 2015 the college republican chapter on my campus condemned the af chapter because right exactly um because you know they said they're inclusive of the lgbt community etc etc which again these things are not mutually exclusive like you can be you can be tolerant of the lgbt community and think that these ideas are insane um and even the college republican chapter on our campus drew that line and actively condemned us and so i think in what's happened between those years is that you've had more and more people like the abigail shrayers and the jk railings um step up and sort of take the arrows and that is not easy it is really really difficult but the more that that happens um the more you know you should have people like senator alumnus be comfortable saying something on a college campus um that i think they need to hear um that is you that you're not going to ultimately apologize for when they do this intense emotional manipulation and Jordan lastly i think the sad thing is um adults have failed young people to the point where some of them probably do actually experience anguish when they hear something like you know that there is the biological reality that men and women are different exists um because they have been conditioned to see the dust discrimination and that's what's really sad to me and that's what i think people underestimate is is how um genuinely anguish a lot of young people are by reason um and and sanity um and that to me is like i don't think we fully appreciate how much that's going to affect our politics like when zoomers like you are are a bigger part of the workforce absolutely i mean i think the last you know 15 years or so there's been this rise in a culture of cowardice you know and we saw a lot of that intensify with cancel culture and we're seeing it now in this issue of discrimination like true legal discrimination versus saying you know saying oh you don't want to pay for this very dangerous procedure well then you're a bigot um it's enabling this to move forward this culture of cowardice it's it's telling generations upon generations that it's okay to be steamrolled on these issues and i think that's why it's so alarming whenever people do apologize on the flip side it is so courageous when people stand up and and speak the truth and stand for it and um you know i don't think that this this transition would be where it is without those people who have stood up and said you know this is wrong this is not true this is not factual and until we reorient the conversation around the facts it's not going to to move forward properly yeah republican senators should have said this um years ago right like this is what people should have been talking about in 2015 let alone apologizing for in 2022 because people did not understand how bad it was they did not understand they would dismiss those campus craziness segments on fox and friends and say well when these people hit the workforce um they're going to be in for a rude awakening and in fact it was the workforce that was in for a rude awakening would they we have we literally have a supreme court justice now who would not define what a woman is we now have social media platforms that censor people for saying that a biological woman is a woman or a biological man is a man i mean our own senior editor john daniel davisson is still not back on twitter because he said rachel lavine is a is a man you know like that's just the fact of the matter so it's enabled this crazy crazy culture by you know just by way of no one standing up and saying something well yeah and this is um yes and and john is a good example um but it's also i think it gets disturbing in in so many different directions when you start thinking about it um but there's a actually a pretty insane essay out by chris rufo that i wanted to mention while we're talking about your reporting jordan um just as we're wrapping this up because it actually isn't easy for republicans elected officials uh elected republican officials to to say these things i actually understand that it's not easy because um manipulation and abuse early throw at you you know you're you're causing kids to commit suicide needlessly and i don't think republicans should run around um and troll and say rachel lavine is a man rachel lavine is a man rachel lavine is a man but if you're supreme court justice and first of all there's nothing wrong with saying rachel lavine is a man of course um but that's not to say that we should actually you know go out and and cause people emotional distress who are emotionally ill what we shouldn't do however is let that uh reorient our society as you say jordan in a way that hurts many many many more other people instead of treating people's mental illnesses in a reasonable and helpful way and this this rufo story is another great example of what's happening beneath the surface because the medius lack of curiosity on this the legacy medius lack of curiosity on this has also led to a vacuum it's like as republicans haven't focused on this issue enough until recently um and the media has had a total lack of curiosity because it's it's you know supportive of these things um rufo is reporting last year the school district of philadelphia encouraged teachers to attend a conference on kink bdsm transects and banging beyond binaries banging beyond binaries this is in uh city journal you can read it it's a report um that was posted may 17th by chris rufo there's more from rufo here in early july 2021 the district's office of diversity equity and inclusion sent invitations to the philadelphia trans wellness conference to teachers and staff on the stb the sdp connect mailing list promoting the conference as a way to learn more about the issues facing the trans community the conference was organized by the mizoni center and lgbtq activist organization that has worked with the district on sexual education programs now if we fast forward to the end rufo says it is important to remember that this conference is not a fringe activity the mizoni center which organized it remember organized this conference banging beyond binaries where that was included in the the content received more than five million dollars in government contracts last year and run sexuality programs in schools throughout the re the region this is taxpayer money going to a group that is educating teachers adolescents on banging beyond binaries i mean jord it's like it this has gone so far in the absence of i think republican courage and uh media just functioning media competence that we are now at public money being spent on groups that organize banging beyond binary curriculum absolutely i mean like you said this has been going on for a lot longer than it's been in sort of the minds of republicans or the american people and it raises questions you know why didn't anyone speak up was it a lack of awareness or was it a lack of courage but what matters now is that there are republicans who are speaking up and the ones who are speaking up need to be celebrated for that and the ones who are need to be chastised and because if we don't speak up now how much further is it going to go i mean how much further can you go than banging beyond binaries well um it's yeah well yeah and so if you're listening to the car with kids or around kids i'm going to keep going here and you might want to uh fast forward rufo says the event the event included sessions on topics such as the adolescent pathway preparing young people for gender affirming care bigger dick energy life after masculinizing prosthetics for sex the ins and outs of masturbation sleeves and transects banging beyond binaries the conference attendees included educators activists adults and adolescents there were graphic sessions on prosthetic penises masturbation toys and artificial ejaculation devices which some hosts explicitly promoted to minors this is a group that is funded to the tune at least last year of five million dollars taxpayer money um jordan it's a combination of a lack of awareness and a lack of courage there was this calculus that um it could be a uh that it wasn't worth the courage that it took to speak up it wasn't worth the the arrows that you would have to take when you spoke up because it was too crazy to catch on and it has yeah and what we should take from this you know instead of relying on taxpayer funded sex addict curriculum moving forward this should be the hill that republicans dying on plain and simple um and and i think republicans have gotten better about engaging in the culture war but this cannot go unaddressed at all yeah the apologies hurt children not help exactly they hurt the country not help the country jordan davison oh no i said your name rog oh my gosh jordan recently got married i'm so sorry jordan boyed i'm so sorry about that and yeah i'm so sorry jordan boy they're good at the federalist um newly married recently married jordan boyed staff writer at the federalist thank you so much for your time and for your reporting thanks for having me of course all right well you've been listening to another edition of the federalist radio hour i'm Emily joshinsky culture editor here at the federalist we will be back soon before until then be lovers of freedom and anxious for the frame"
