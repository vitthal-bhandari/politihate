Well, today we're going to talk about a sensitive topic, which is trans women athletes. We all know this is insanity. The part of it that's most insane is not that a man identifies as a woman. That's been going on since the beginning of time. But to now say that a man can compete as a woman when he is a man, totally upsetting the whole balance of the sexes of the biology of gender of sex is total insanity. You know, you can argue almost anything today. It's so relative to your orientation in America. The criminal is now the victim. The cop is now the perpetrator of crime. So everything has been turned upside down by the vermin in the media. And of course, the communists who have taken control of the language. Therefore, if you want to be a woman, even though you're a man, you can say you're a woman and that's your business, I suppose. However, today we are talking about how transgenders are dangerous in sports. Why? Because men are different than women biologically. That is a fact of reality that has been known forever. Now we'll talk about the history of Lucy. Who's Lucy? Australopithecus afarensis, a collection of about 40 pieces of skeleton, including skull fragments, leg bones, pelvis and jaw. And this, these skeletal remains were discovered in 1974 at Hadar Ethiopia by paleo anthropologist Donald Johansson of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. And the skeleton is believed to have lived in a human form 3.2 million years ago. Now, what does this have to do with transgender athletes? Well, only this. Johansson knew immediately. He's a scientist, by the way, a real one unlike Fauci. Johansson knew immediately that the skeleton fell was female. Really? My God. How did he know that? Because of her flared pelvis and wide pelvic opening, the flare gives more surface area for muscles which support a pregnant belly. And the larger opening allows for the birth of babies with larger brains. Johansson's judgment has since been confirmed with DNA testing. What does this tell us? It tells us that females in the human ancestral line have had a distinct skeletal structure for over 3 million years. That's until now, of course, we're not supposed to know what science teaches us. But this difference has great consequence for sports activity. With the hips spaced more widely apart, the thigh bone meets the knee at a knock-knead angle that is not as straight up and down as in the male. This is a less efficient weight-bearing structure and leads to more injuries such as ACL tendent tears which are more frequent in female soccer players than in males. That's a scientific fact. You can't change science to match your desires even though this is going on around the globe with insanity while not as obvious as size and strength. This structural difference between genetic males and genetic females can be extremely significant in rough contact sports which leads us to the next statement. Headline, World Rugby's transgender ban, a dangerous precedent, critics say. Two years ago, Grace McKenzie thought team sports were no longer an option for her. As a transgender woman, McKenzie said she didn't think she'd be allowed to play after transitioning and was pretty sad because she has been a lifelong athlete. McKenzie said she was surprised when a player invited her to a practice with the Golden Gate Women's Rugby Club in San Francisco. She went there and has never looked back because the entire team was extremely welcoming and inclusive. Well, that's interesting because now her sport, this is according to NBC, now her sport has become less welcoming to elite players. You see on October 9th, World Rugby, the sport's governing body, set out new guidelines that bar transgender women from playing rugby internationally because of, quote, player welfare risks. Are you listening to this? To protect women, but that's not good enough. The updated regulations, according to NBC, are among the most exclusionary policies for transgender athletes instituted by an international federation of date. And they're a departure from major governing bodies policies on trans inclusion, including the international Olympic Committee's rules that permit trans women to compete in the Olympics, provided they maintain a certain testosterone level for 12 months prior to competition. Five countries have rejected this ban on transgender women in rugby. They would include the nations, as you can guess, the United States, England, Canada, New Zealand, and France. And there's all the nations that are collapsing, collapsing and collapsing. These nations state that the rules are not aligned with their policies for the inclusion of trans athletes and or that they would not enforce it domestically or at varying levels at play. So you can have it any way you want, but you can't argue with biology. I know that that's considered anathema today, but you know what? That's the way it is on the Michael Savage show. Do you believe in biology? Do you believe in history? Do you believe in anthropology? Or do you believe in what you want to feel this started with if it feels good, do it? And it ended with insanity itself. Now we have the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics coming up and the International Olympic Committee, AOC, put out a PC seven page guideline about fanness, inclusion and non discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sex variations. What does that mean? Listen to this. I want you to hear how insane your world has become because the smallest minority of mentally unstable people have taken over every single aspect of culture, including the Olympics. Listen to this. The Olympic Committee guidelines instructs organizers and athletes and organizations with that quote, every athlete regardless of their gender identity expression and their sex variations should be able to participate in the sport safely and without prejudice. The credibility of competitive sport, in particular high level organized sporting competitions relies on a level playing field where no athlete has an unfair and disproportionate advantage over the rest. It's total in plain English. As you will learn today from a doctor John Jay Quish PhD, owing to differences in bone physiology, safe and fair competition on a level playing field becomes almost or totally impossible when women athletes compete against women athletes who are transitioning from male. This professor, Dr. John Jay Quish from Rushmore University is an expert on bone density. He says that bone size and density can play a major role in the outcome of all contact sports, especially combat sports. You learn today that many, many severe fractures have occurred in combat sports. Women's rugby has produced many crushing injuries when teams with trans women players are on the field playing against women's teams. How did this happen? And I have the biggest question of the day, where are the women's groups? Where are the NLW groups? Where are all the people who stand up for women saying this is totally insane? And matching women athletes with trans women who are really men is resulting in life threatening injuries due to larger denser bones impacting against thinner, less dense bone in the skull, neck and spine of the women who are lighter bone. This is total insanity. This is what happens when left wing fanatics get control of a society. We need to take a quick break. We'll be right back with more. Stay tuned to the Savage Nation podcast.

And he's not an ordinary professor. He has inventions for enhancing strength and function of the human musculoskeletal system. Dr. Jay Quish has been awarded seven US patents and 236 corresponding international patents in 46 countries. Moreover, they are used for strength conditioning by teams and players in the NBA and NFL, who says trans women athletes have an unfair advantage over those born female owing not only to bone density, but other physiological differences. The background of the insanity of this trans athlete situation from a physiological point of view, which you're an expert on, it does fit into the greater madness of our social order, doesn't it, Dr. It does. How did we arrive here where a man could just say he's a woman and compete with women and the women's group say nothing? How is that possible? Well, in the pursuit of an abstract concept, we call fair. Sort of anything can be justified. That's really how it happened. And obviously anything goes in other words. Right. And fairness is never something we should chase because you can take that to such a distorted and inhumane degree, like should we scar the faces of the pretty people to make life easier for the ugly? Oh my God. That's crazy. But you heard about what happened in Oregon where they're no longer going to have any school requirements in the state of Oregon for reading, writing or mathematics. And because it's that would be the most fair thing to do for some of the minority students. And I'm like, the governor actually said this will help the minority students. And I thought, I cannot think of a way you could help them less. You're not going to look for my point of view. That's irrelevant. I don't really care what needs to help the people at the bottom of society over the whole society. In other words, how cruel that may sound. If you go to the lowest common denominator, the whole society melts down. I found it out in the fifth grade. I was a fairly nice kid, but I was mischievous. And I hooked up with a nut in the class. It was a real pain in the ass to everybody and the nut. And we became best friends. And I started to screw up really badly. And the teacher took me aside and she said she was Mrs. D. I'll never forget it. She said, you know, Michael, I'll never understand that why when a decent kid hangs around with a kid who screwed up, the decent kid becomes screwed up. Why is it that the class goes to the lowest common denominator? And I didn't really understand there. But I sure understand what our society is going through now. It's a race to the bottom, Doc, the J-Quish, isn't it? Yes, it is. So are we the only society going through this at this pace in a bigger picture, this madness? All Western countries are going through this. They're having the same discussions. Some are more slightly more sane, but sanity is in short supply. And in this endless pursuit, let's look at the Olympics. Genetically born men were allowed to compete in women's sports. Now there was just a handful of them, but a genetically born male, like here's something that I think the policymakers aren't aware of. But you can see it on any crime TV show. When a forensic scientist looks at the skeleton of someone, let's say they find human remains that have been there. There's no flesh left on the bones. They can tell whether the individual was male or female. They can even tell from looking at the skeleton what race they were. How can you tell male or female in a skeleton? I never understood that as an outsider. They're well, the proportions of certain bones. So men have a stronger pelvis, but it's thinner. Women have a wider one because it can facilitate childbirth. This is amazing. We're speaking with Dr. John Jay Quish. And we are talking about a very serious issue, which is trans women athletes who are running all over biological women in sports and winning all sorts of events as we saw the other day with a swimmer who is a biological male who identifies as a female. He's a big guy. Was he surgically turned into a woman or he's intact, so to speak? I don't think they're allowed to ask that question. Oh, I'm sorry. Honestly, it doesn't. Oh, no, you can ask the question. I'm joking. I'm sorry. Very similar to sport. Yeah, right. But honestly, it doesn't make a difference because. And in my most, I don't want to be necessarily political, but here I have to, because we're looking at a situation, especially in contact sports, where someone who's a genetically born male is always for the rest of their life going to be more powerful, going to have stronger bone. They're going to be able to hit harder. And what we're looking at is genetically born women participating in sports. And there's been a few rugby games recently where women were severely injured when coming in contact with trans trans women who were genetically born as men. Why would a man do that? People I would aim, but why would a man who says, I'm really a woman inside, take advantage of women in that way? I mean, he's taking advantage of that. That's what they're doing. They know they're taking advantage of the women. You know, psychology is not my field. More mind. I would, I would say that they probably don't see it that way. They'd rather be, they feel more comfortable as a woman and they'd still rather play sports. I understand that. And I have a solution. So unlike a lot of the kind of crazy woke people who just like to bitch and complain and have no solutions, I actually have one. You want to hear it? Why not? Yeah. Okay. So women sports should be for women. People who are genetically born as a woman. Everything else open class. You know, there's, if you're not a woman, you're an open class. Because like, like nobody's worried, nobody in the NFL is worried that a trans male is going to come in and hurt them. You mean a woman who identifies as a male is going to play in the NFL. They're not worried about that. They're not worried about that. So why not have three categories of sports? Like in boxing, we have flyweights, lightweights, middleweights, welterweights, heavyweights for a reason. Because you wouldn't put a heavyweight in a ring with a flyweight. You know that the heavyweight will crush the flyweight. Yeah. No, they try to kill. Even they realized this a hundred, some odd years ago, you have to divide it by a weight category. Very clearly defined within a pound or two of different categories of weight. So doesn't the same apply here? Why not have biological males, biological females and trans people as a category unto itself? Why not have trans compete with trans? Well, because there's not enough trans people to put a team together. So they're going to win every sport. I mean, that's a possibility. But this is crazy. We're joking about insanity. But Michael, honestly, I've got to do the right thing. And when I see people, I see the sports changing so that women could get severely injured, like somebody needs to say something. I think my background with bone density, I can speak to how much more powerful man's own structure is. So let's say there's no undoing that. Dr. Jay Quish, where are the women's groups? Where did they go on this issue? Why are they not speaking up? I'll tell you what, they sided with trans athletes at first because they saw them as another oppressed group of people. Oh, yeah. Right. And then it turned on them. And they probably don't know what to say next. But the problem with a lot of these woke groups is eventually their plans will be in conflict with one another. And I mean, I'm sure you've heard this that Black Lives Matter doesn't want Black males because males are a problem. What? That's the newish thing? Yeah. I've missed that there for a while. Only militant Black lesbians will be running BLM. Or I think I straight males was the problem. So I think they'll take a gay male, but they don't really want this straight Black male. OK, this is becoming really obvious to me what this is being driven by. Yeah. And I know I've known this from the beginning. I saw it way back when Hollywood started with this nonsense. So let's stick to physiology, which is your expertise. Yes. How much denser and heavier are bones of biological men than those of biological women? And why is this important for us to discuss? They there's just a few percentage more powerful, but the structure is different. So it's a different like the structure of men's bone is really built for contact. Oh, my gosh. Whereas women are not really built for that. So the bone density, I mean, the grams to centimeter squared of actual calcium calcified material within bone can be similar, but fragility fractures when individuals get older and start losing their bone density affect one in three men, but one in sorry, one in three women, but only one in five men. Oh, my goodness. And so that's monumental to how much powerful a man's bone density is. As biological men and biological women age, the bone density ages at different rates. Does an age of different rates men just start with more? Oh, okay. Got it. Yeah. We start with that and that extra proportion dictates that they have far fewer bone density challenges as the age. So a lot of women wind up with scoliosis and things of that nature and older age. We've noticed that correct. Yeah, usually it's been there their whole lives, but it was slight and it becomes more exaggerated as the age. What type of injury Dr. J. Kish what type of injury most commonly occurs during women versus trans women contact sport competition? Can you get a trans woman boxing against a biological woman? Is that going on as well? It is going on. Oh, man. And it's going on a mixed martial arts too. Oh, my God. Yeah. And in some women have been severely injured. Yeah. But wait a minute, wouldn't the guy who's in sports like that have any sense of fairness in not wanting to hurt a woman? That's an awesome question. And I think the nature of competition is everybody trained so they have an advantage, right? So I think the athlete is so focused on having any advantage here. She can that it's not the athlete can't see it. So all the caring about is winning. Right. All it matters is winning. There's no no ethics or morals anymore. The idea of fairness in sports doesn't even enter the equation. Yeah, I think and especially when you add money into it. Ah, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Like, I can tell you, I have had thousands of discussions with various professional athletes all over the world. I talk to them every day. And fairness has never come up. Do you have a background in sports? You look like a big guy. You look like a former football player or a player. Interesting. I I've never been a particular like I played rugby in in undergrad, but I was kind of like a wide receiver type position. I was an outside center. So I was fast, but not big. And I figured out a great way to gain muscle very fast, which I wrote a book called weightlifting is a waste of time. It's Wall Street Journal bestseller. So that's I really made a few discoveries about human physiology and have been promoting them since, which is why I'm kind of. What is the best way to build muscle? What's the fastest way? Oh, variable resistance. It's not weights. It's not weights. What is it? Yeah, it's so it's a combination of using bars and plates that you stand on to and managing very, very heavy latex or polymer banding. So that like when I when I bench press, I'm holding 500 pounds of the top 300 pounds in the middle and a hundred pounds at the bottom. And then I can go to fatigue and diminishing rain. So I exhaust myself with the 500 pounds and then I can't get there anymore. So then I'm doing half repetitions with 300 pounds. Then I can't get there anymore either. So then my last few repetitions, I'm handling 100 pounds, but I fatigued the muscle completely, which can never be done with a weight. Okay, so this is super safe. Yeah, you fatigue the muscle to break it down. So it builds up. Is that what's going on? Yeah, fatigue is really the stimulus. There's no damage in muscle growth. That's kind of a myth. But you don't tear the muscle tissue. You stress it. No, just exhaustion. Right. It's sort of like, like when you get a suntan, you didn't get a sunburn. You just stimulated the skin to grow. If you go far enough to burn it, then you don't get the tan. So what happens in the bone, for example, when you stress bone, the bone comes back stronger, doesn't it? There's a minimum dose response. So the hip joint is the most studied because that contributes to earlier death. You have a hip fracture over the age of 50. You have a 50% chance of death within one year. What? That hip fracture. Yep. It's so uncomplicated. This is why I got into this. This is absolutely what I'm going to do with this issue. Yeah, my mother was diagnosed with osteoporosis. And I wanted to treat hers. And after learning this statistic, I'm like, well, I'm not losing my mother. So I developed a medical device to treat osteoporosis. Oh my God. That's called osteostrome. We have clinics in 10 different countries, like 150 clinics in 10 different countries. Wait, Dr. Jay Quish, we got to go back. If you have did you say if you have a hip injury or osteoporosis after 50? If you have a hip fracture after the age of 50, it's very hard to recover from. But why is that? Why is that? So it's a huge amount of bone, but there's a lot of complications in setting that bone because there's a lot of 10 segredy within that bone. So muscles are pulling and pushing on the bone to just as a sort of a center of the body to position everything else correctly. And when that bone fractures, it doesn't want to just come back together. A lot of times hardware needs to be installed, screws, pins, some wiring, if there's a shattering of the bone, it's much more complicated. Sometimes prosthetic pieces need to be added. Breaking your hip is very traumatic to the human body. And after the age of 50, here's what happens is they can't move around. This is the most common thing is that because they can't move around, they start collecting fluid in the lungs, which is a solvable problem until you get pneumonia. It's usually pneumonia that ends their life, but it's basically all based on the hip fracture. Owing to lack of activity, not so much the hip fracture per se, correct? I'm not even talking about athletic activity, just walking around. So okay, this is very important. So the motion and movement is critical to people at all ages, especially to older people. I'm Michael Savage back in a minute. Most savage nation is savage army man. Did you know that last month, the G20 announced a plan to impose digital currencies and digital IDs on their respective populations? That's right. Central bank digital currencies essentially allow the government to track every single purchase that you make. Listen carefully, they could even allow officials to prohibit you from purchasing certain products or easily freeze or seize part of all of your money. It's crazy. In essence, they enable the government to take more control over your finances, every dollar you spend concerned Americans are right now diversifying their assets into physical gold with the help of birch gold group, the only gold company I trust. If you want a physical asset held in a tax sheltered retirement account, I want you to call birch gold. Learn for yourself, would you please text savage to 989898 text savage to 9898 text savage to 989898, and I'll send you a free info kit on gold. What do you got to lose? The easiest way to become a birch gold customer? It's simple. If you have an IRA or a 401k from a previous employer, just gathering dust, birch gold can help you convert it into an IRA in gold. And you don't pay a penny out of pocket, please text savage to 9898, text savage to 9898, and you're going to get a free info kit on gold. Then call them because if digital currency becomes a reality, would it be nice to have some real gold to fall back on? I am very serious about this. You ought to be too. Birch gold is the only gold company I trust. Right now, text savage to 989898, free call, text savage 989898, and you're going to get a free info kit on gold. Text savage to 989898, because if digital currency becomes a reality, it'll be nice to have some gold to fall back on. And birch gold is the only gold company I trust. So please text savage to 989898 right now. We're speaking today with Dr. John B. J. Quish, PhD. You know, I had an old friend who passed away a few years ago who I'm just curious aside, no doctor, Robert F. Cathcart III. And Bob was the inventor of the Cathcart hip prosthesis, which at the time was riot. I know the prosthesis. I didn't know him, but I know the one of the nicest men I've ever met in the world. One a great man, but he was an advanced thinker in nutrition and vitamin C and all of that. And speaking of vitamins for a minute, what builds bone? Which nutrients build bone? So bone is made of 11 different minerals, primarily calcium. But calcium is just a building block. So what happens is a lot of people take the calcium, but then they don't give their body a reason to use that calcium. So you have to have force go through the bone. Sort of like you can take extra protein and lift weights and build more muscle. But if you take extra protein and don't lift the weights, do you grow any muscle? No, you do not. So and that's with calcium. And actually calcium is a little more complicated because it's the only mineral your body self regulates. So the more calcium you ingest, the more calcium your body gets rid of. The problem is you ingest more calcium, then your body starts pulling calcium out of bone and getting rid of it, which actually accelerates the loss of bone density. And then because your activity doesn't force you to retain any of the new calcium, then your bone density is just going down. Well, you know, we're on a very interesting track here, even though we're talking about trans athletes, this is fascinating because you're a bone expert. There's an obsession with taking vitamin D right now against COVID. I've always been leery of vitamin D because it's known as a PhD nutrition myself. It's known as Cole Calciferole. So I've always been a it's a hormone in other words, so people are dumping volumes of this hormone into their body. God knows what it's doing to their to their calcium levels. Is there any study? Are there any studies on this massive ingestion of vitamin D and what it may be doing to people's bones? No, like you do need some vitamin D for healthy bone function. But yeah, overdoing it is not necessarily a recommendation. Now, I know people when they when they come down with COVID, they'll take 50,000 IU of vitamin D for maybe two or three days only. Right. Until the symptoms go away. Right. But that that's not like just don't perpetually, right, like like 2000 to 5000 IU in a day would be more like normal. Well, it's the same with vitamin A. I discovered years ago in myself being a big vitamin C person. It wasn't enough for me when I felt the colder flu coming on, which was rare. I would up my vitamin A levels to 100,000 units knowing it's toxic at a certain point for a day or two. And the minute I took 100,000 units for one day, that viral illness would abate. It's amazing how the body reacts to a certain amount of you know, because I remember reading about polar explorers who were starving and they shot a polar bear 100 years ago and they ate the polar bear liver. And I forget who it was and they died because polar bear liver is extremely dense with with vitamin A and they died. They died from the poisoning. Let's get back to the trans because you know, with me, we could talk forever and I know you're a busy man as well. Sure. Talking primarily about one topic today. And that is trans women athletes who have an unfair advantage over those born female because of the bone density. You're an expert, Dr. John J. Quish in this subject. So for the safety of athletes and to create a level playing field for competitors going forward, you are advocating the establishment of a quote open competition class. What does that mean? So I was thinking of my idea was to change like what's called men's sports now and just let anybody sign up for sports because nobody's worried about that. But when it comes to women's sports, it should be just genetically born women because somebody who's genetically born as a male is going to hurt people, especially if it's give it's contact sports. Are the women speaking out are the women athletes rising up and saying this is crazy, this is unfair? Or they're really not. They're afraid of being thrown out of the competition. Yeah, they're afraid of being canceled. Oh my God, being called bigoted or whatever. From my perspective is a little different because it's just a matter of safety. But that would be like someone going into talk radio who's a stutter and I'm not knocking stutter as I've had them in my family. So you say, well, you're unfair to people who stutter Michael because you have a great voice and you never stuttering, never miss a beat. So we're now going to replace you with someone who stutters in order to make them not feel uncomfortable. I mean, this is how crazy this is becoming. Well, and that's that's the problem with chasing fair. Like nothing will ever be fair. Nothing is fair. I see those every day off my deck. And I have bread. Okay, I love these goals. So I watch what goes on survival of the fittest. I try to spread it out so the little bird gets some and all the big birds go there. But you know what, I've watched something. Those big birds will eat every piece of food you throw out there and prevent the little bird from getting it if they can. That's right. That's right. Survival of the fittest. I've seen it. Yeah. I mean, your brain is designed to preserve you. Okay, so we're not supposed to be like wild animals. We're supposed to be fair. So in sports, we develop different levels of competition lightweight. As I said, featherweight, lightweight, banthem, weight, middleweight, heavyweight. Now it's reached the point. Now we're ignoring that, right? Ignoring it. So maybe that's the way to get this across to the people, which is that even 100 years ago, people recognized that weight differences would yield different results. And a big guy will crush a little guy. Maybe we can get that across by explaining that the weight classes should be a guide for us going forward and go back again to biological classes of athletes. How can listeners of this podcast get in touch with Dr. John Jay Kush, J-A-Q-U-I-S-H, how do they get in touch with you? You have so much to offer. How do they reach you? Thanks so much. Yeah, I have a my my my last name is difficult to remember. So I have a landing page, which links to everything. It's Dr. J. calm, D-O-C-T-O-R, the letter J. Wait, wait, Dr. J? Yeah, spell it. Dr. J. D-O-C-T-O-R, the letter J. That's good. Dr. J.com. It couldn't be it couldn't be easy. Well, Dr. J.com, you have any closing words for all of the people who are going to be listening to this podcast. Yeah, I think the thing to think about is safety. Now, authorities in sports have been, they've made cold medicine illegal because certain cold medicines can give you a little bit of an athletic advantage. So if you have a cold and it's time for the time for the big day, the big game, you're not allowed to take that. So I guess you're supposed to suffer or just sit the game out. And it's like, okay, if we're that concerned about the safety of athletes, why aren't we concerned about women's safety? Thank you. No, you make a very good point. There's a let's be let's not be hypocritical. Doping commissions to make sure you're not getting an unfair advantage by taking certain performance enhancing medications or drugs. That's right. Makes sense. People have thrown off sporting activities because so this falls into that category. This is clearly an unfair advantage based on based upon biology. Sure. Maybe sanity will prevail one day. I'm not that optimistic. Oh, one day all of this woke crap will go away. It will, it will, because it's just people getting tired of it. You know, like, I don't know, like, hey, is there like, let's just use racism as an example. Is the racism? Yeah, of course. I'm sure there's some guy living in a swamp in Louisiana that actually uses the N word for real. But other than that guy, to find hate crime, I think you need to find Jesse Smollett. Thank you. Yeah, he sure got nailed. He should got hung by his own guitar, didn't he? He sure did. And, and you know, if we if we have to base the sort of movement of our society on falsified, we shall attacks. Maybe we should we should really look at the in the mirror and say, maybe this, like, the problem isn't unfair policing or the way we treat each other. Maybe somebody should actually just say racism is actually just based on fear, fear of the unknown. You notice there's no racism in urban areas because you live with everybody in an urban area. Well, you couldn't you live in a rural every, every city, we didn't have, we couldn't be too racist. I mean, we were everyone was aware of the other persons, the background, Jews, Italians, Irish, Blacks, but we went to high school together and we learned pretty quickly to get along with each other. Oh, it would have been what we have now, which is mayhem and urban warfare. Right. Let's talk about what we have in common, which is just about everything other than skin coat. Like, like pretty much everybody I know wants like fair police, clean water, good air, uh, the ability to earn money. They want capitalism. So like, why don't why don't we just focus on the things that we have in common instead of the things that we don't? Why do we let the journey of the minority dictate our society is the question to me. And you're speaking out and I hope to God that there's nothing in this podcast that's of any threat to your future because you're a great person that has a lot to offer. No, thanks. Yeah. I don't think so. And I don't, I don't think that like I'm not even somebody asked me to apologize for saying what I said. And then no, it's I'm just speaking scientifically. I'm not going to apologize for science. We're going to be people have done it. Where'd you grow up? Where'd you go to high school? I grew up in a place called Arinda, which is like a suburb of San Francisco. Oh, I know we're in the yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The People's Republic of San Francisco. By all the San Francisco is ruined now. I mean, you say you grew up listening to me on the radio 25 years ago, probably. That's right. Who's this guy on the car making sense? What's wrong with him? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And here we are a quarter of a century later. We need to take a quick break. We'll be right back on the Savage Nation podcast. The Savage Nation. It's savage. Uncut. Unfiltered. And wall. We're speaking with Dr. John Jayquish. Are you in private practice? What do you do to derive your primary income? So, so Mike, my company, Jayquish Biomedical, we redevelop products and technologies and licensee intellectual property for medical devices and fitness devices. And then now the strength device I was talking about, which is largely covered in the book, Weightlifting is a waste of time that I wrote last year. That we took to market ourselves, because I think it was too scientific for a lot of fitness companies. Like fitness is fitness and science don't really go hand in hand well when it comes to the actual market. And so I had to do this myself and it's been a tremendous success. And what's it called? What is that the product? The product is called X X3. And the website is x3bar.com. I love it. Yeah, it's so simple and straightforward. And it will be like, even though it folds up into a backpack, it will give you a better workout than the Olympic training center. Well, I was a weight lifter as a kid because I was small. And I wanted to be the guy who didn't have the sand kicked in his face anymore. Sure. So, you know, at 15, I took up weights. My father built me a weightlifting thing in the cold garage and Queens. And I felt so good. Heaving those weights up and down in the cold, 10 below 10 below zero in the garage. And I felt like a king, the feeling of power that you get from with. Sure. But this is even better. Oh, thank God. I was I'm glad I had you on today because I don't lift weights anymore. I feel like a whim as an older guy. I said, what's the point of lifting weights? I'm too old. It doesn't matter. At my age, I can still grow muscle. Absolutely. Really? Yep. So I won't be the skinny kid, skinny old man in the old age. I'm having donuts kicked in his face. That's right. No one's going to kick anything in your face. I'm not messing with that guy. Maybe the next guy. But not John J. Quish PhD. What a pleasure it has been speaking with you. Dr. Do you still live in the Bay Area? No, I had to leave the people's Republic of San Francisco. Oh, yeah. I had to get out of there. I'm very tied to California because of my manufacturing. Most of my friends who own businesses that have left the state just because the sort of everything is. Taxation, labor force, labor, impossible. Right. It's anti business. It's anti employer. Yes. I mean, I want people to let that sink into their head. California is not anti business. It's anti employer. Yes. And we need to start saying that. So people who don't make the connection, you know, they see the government scoring over a business and they're like, serves those business owners, right? You know, it's like, no, idiot. That's your job. Yes. It's the nature of business thrives, not to drive it out of the state. I don't understand what these people are thinking. Governor Newsom is not stupid. He's playing a very dangerous game because everyone I know who has any wealth at all who's built it in their own lives has left the state because of the owner's taxation and the inability to run a business here. Well, I thank you very much for your time. And I go. Thanks. America is unrecognizable from the point of view of sanity. Yes. From the point of view of true fairness and true equity. And without without quality, I've said this for years, doctor, there can be no equality without quality. There can be no equality. Right. Dr. John Jay Quish, you can find all of his great works at Dr. Jay.com. Have a wonderful, wonderful day. And I hope to see you very soon. Awesome. Goodbye now. Listen, I've told my dear listeners that maybe you, I hope time and time again, I frankly am a sexual libertarian. The issue of trans lifestyles in competitions that I'm talking about today is really not about that lifestyle per se. It's about protecting female athletes from unnecessary physical harm from men who believe they're women. All the borders, language, culture, the savage nation. To those of you who may have missed my appearance on Newsmax TV this past Thursday, where I discussed blood batteries and electric cars, I'm going to replay it for you here because it's an important one. It's one of my best. Joining us now is the host of the Michael Savage Show podcast and a great friend of this show, Dr. Michael Savage. Welcome. You know, when is Biden going to propose some real solutions, Michael? Well, first, it's a pleasure to be with two women are always right. Both of you are always on the right. That's what my husband says, Michael. I agree. Okay, that's a smart man. So my podcast is called not in my back seat, Blood Batteries, the real cost of electric vehicles, because many people are buying electric cars thinking they're cleaner and better and holier than now. And it feels good to drive around in a car that doesn't emit any pollution. However, as we all know, energy doesn't come from nowhere, it comes from somewhere. So we begin with a toy car. How does this car run? It doesn't. So if I would have pushed it on the floor for a child, the energy is deriving from my hand, my energy, into that car, you take an electric car, how does it run? Battery. That's just a toy battery, obviously, there's not a lithium ion battery. But where does the battery come from? How do you make a battery? Cobalt and rare earth minerals, whereas cobalt mine, ladies, the African Congo by child slave child slave labor, child slave labor. So where do rare earths come from? China. China owns 97% of the rare earth minerals. Now listen to this beauty. Where is the largest supply of rare earths on the planet? Afghanistan. Guess who moved into Afghanistan when Biden abruptly withdrew China, China. Oh, goodness, I feel like this is a history lesson. Michael, let me jump in here real quick, because first of all, not only are you giving us a physics lesson, but a social studies lesson, all very helpful. But Elon Musk basically slammed the build better back, the build better back bill. And he basically does not agree with these electric car incentives. As you know, in this massive spending bill, they are offering about $12,500 of a tax rebate for, if you buy a zero emissions vehicle. So you're in line with Elon Musk. Yeah, he's a brilliant guy. I really love listening to him. You know, I love geniuses. He's like the Edison of our time in many ways. And the question is, these batteries, where are we going to get rid of these batteries in 50 years? We'll have 50 million pounds of dead batteries in landfills. And this is from the same people who think that they're holier than us by driving an electric car. So we have to go back to the facts. Where does the energy come from? It has to come from somewhere. So you have plants that are manufacturing these cars that are not running on solar power. And they're running off fossil fuel to make the car. And as I say, that's a cost that we don't see. But wait, one other thing, common sense. I live in the center of liberalism in the San Francisco area. And you see the happy smug people driving into the charging stations, nice and clean. Where does that power come from? And those charging stations, fossil fuels from somewhere else. But as I say, as long as it's not in my backseat, that's the name of the podcast, not in my backseat. It's a continuation of not in my backyard. And I call it blood batteries. Well, you're big. The big issue here too is just think about it. Every move that Joe Biden has made has been to lead America into energy dependence away from energy independence. And that has been one of the biggest failures of his administration. Michael Savage, always a joy to see you on the show. Thanks for being here. But wait, there's a lot of money involved Mercedes. Who do you thinks making all the money on these electric cars? Feinstein and China. You're right. It's a huge amount of money. And I want to thank again to lady to women who are always right for having Michael. You know, the best Michael, you make us better and we make you better. Always a joy. Thank you so much. Have a fun Christmas. Michael Savage, a host like no other Michael cooking at home while drinking a glass of wine. In other words, my cooking videos on social media have become extremely popular. And how many of you are not even on Twitter or Facebook. So here is my latest cooking video for those of you who are not on any social media platforms. Go and get a glass. I wanted to enjoy it on Michael Savage. Look what I made tonight. I made a thin spaghetti with the finest scallops and Gulf shrimp. No, nothing from the cesspool of China. Came out tonight, which we all knew is that when Bill and Hillary Clinton admitted them to the WTO, they had us for lunch. Big article from a liberal publication. They finally woke up. I talked about it in the year 2000. Yeah, my genius probably. Did I try to warn America? Definitely. So just as the Chinese took over America because of the entry into the World Trade Organization, Black Lives Matter is about to take over America because none of you will stand up and say a word. You're afraid of being called names. And so eating well is not the best revenge. It's about the only thing left for us to do. And to speak out, God gave you a voice. Use it. Do not let these bastards talk you down at a school board meeting. Say it like it is, Black Lives Matter is a racist terrorist organization that is taking over the country and poisoning the entire Western world. You don't have to believe me. I don't care whether you believe me or not. You know, facts have a way of upholding themselves. Math is racist. History is racist. Juries are racist. If you believe that you deserve the country you're going to live in, because you'll be enslaved. Eventually you will be killed like they were in Pol Pot's Cambodia. But you know what? I just want to stick to my pasta and seafood tonight. I'm going to kill what your race is. Mm. That's so good. I'm going to stop talking in a minute. Look at this. You know, they say truth will set you free. That would have been true before Twitter and Facebook and Instagram, which are controlled by some of the narrowest minded racist people on the planet. When you see Biden appoints a naked psychotic, half white, half black racist, as the US Attorney, for all of Massachusetts and 7 million people are subjected to this psycho, railing and screaming against the reporter trying to interview her. The US Attorney for all of Massachusetts. I'm not the only one who's seen this. It was covered very well by Fox and others. But I'm talking about it tonight. A raging lunatic. I hate her. Mike Obama. Destroyed by her mixed race heritage. Half white, half black, so she decides to hate whites and look how far she's gone. And what does she contributed to society? Nothing but hatred. Watch the tape. Decide for yourself. So it was a deadlock in the Senate. And the other racist, Kamala Harris broke the tie and put this psychopathic racial hater in his US Attorney in Massachusetts. And that, my friends, is the state of America tonight. But it's even worse. Because of your friends, Bill and Hillary Clinton, we tried to warn you about the WTO. We were called right wing nuts in the year 2000. We told you what they would do. And they did it. They're about to become the number one economy in the world, maybe the number one military. While our moron, Millie or Miley and the other Schmuck, who's running the Defense Department, is looking for white supremacists. They're training the hardest young men the world has ever seen. And we're here and we got Ukraine. Oh, let me talk to you about Ukraine for a minute, but first I need to buy the food. Russia will seize half of Ukraine without a shot being fired. And that's it. Used to be part of the Soviet Union. It was the bread basket of the Soviet Union. Rich in resources. Putin's a thousand times smarter than the Duns is in the White House. The college girls are telling us to worry about the only men in America stand up to them, calling them racist and white supremacists and white this and white that. Every cross on every war memorial with a very small exception. That's about 99% white men laying in the ground who defeated Hitler. 99% white men defeated Hitler. I want you to think about that before you open up your stupid mouths. You left wing bastards. You're destroying my country. And if I had the power, believe me, you wouldn't have the power you have. You and George Soros would be facing the House of Un-American Activities Committee. And when you've found to be what you are, you would be deported. It's the only way we'll survive in this country. We cannot permit this to go on much longer. So that's my Friday night Sabbath service, Jewish service now. Take it for what it is. I'm a hardcore nationalist. You can call me anything else you want. You'd be wrong. I grew up loving America. I will die loving America. America's been great to my hands. Ancestors who came here and fled the oppression of the Soviet Union of Russia at the time. And they built a life for themselves dying young, working hard. They would rather refone themselves out of a building than taking welfare. Compare it now to the filth and garbage coming in from the third world. Filth and garbage, the third world is coming into this country. I'm sure this message will be blocked at which point I could care less because we'll save it and we'll put it somewhere else like Michael Savage dot com. Incidentally, if you want some science tonight, go to my podcast, the Michael Savage podcast, wherever podcasts are heard. They hear the greatest podcast in human history called Immigrants and Epidemics. It was 25 years in the making. It's something that no one else in the podcasting world has done or could do. But because I have been banned in Britain and I am banished and blocked by everyone in the media with the exception of Newsmax TV. And by the way, my great podcast company Immigrants and Epidemics is there for you to listen to. And you will find out that from the beginning of time, countries have closed their borders to the disease. And then something happened. A racial maniac named Barack Obama came along and flooded America with people with the Honduran flu, which produced a polio like illness in children. And it was swept under the rug by vermin in the media like Andy Cooper and his girlfriend, a boyfriend, a wife. They put their sexuality ahead of the reality of this world. Always the sexuality came before the reality. I don't get really care what anyone does with their bodies. I'm a sexual libertarian. I've said that for 20 years. But when you put your sex ahead of your sexual orientation, ahead of reality, you destroy yourself and everyone around you. Have a great night.
