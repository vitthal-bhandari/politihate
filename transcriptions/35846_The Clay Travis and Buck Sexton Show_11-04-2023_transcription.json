    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucks, sexton show podcast. Welcome and everybody Tuesday edition of the clay Travis and bucks, sexton show starts right now. Got a bunch of stories to dive into with you. First off, the whole foods flagship store in San Francisco. We were talking about San Fran yesterday. That whole food store has closed, not because they can't find a way to sell people very expensive gluten-free crackers and braised beef and etc. It's closing after one year because of drug use in restrooms, violent assaults on staffs. And this was quite a detail. All of its shopping baskets, hundreds of them stolen. So basically constant theft disorder, anarchy and violence in a fancy grocery store in downtown San Francisco. We will return to this because I think it shows you every at this point, every live writer and author who is saying, it's not that bad in San Francisco. They're operating in bad faith. They're lying to you. They're just carrying water for the left for the Marxist, commie lunatics, the Soros backed prosecutors that are destroying city after city. Also, we didn't mention this when yesterday, I wanted to get into it a little bit today. It's been a massive leak of Ukraine, Russia related intelligence online. Biden administration seems to be really caught off guard by it. And it goes to a number of things. The actual reality of the war in Ukraine and US involvement from the outside, as well as counterintelligence risk that we have in the era of online platforms. There's a there's now a story up that they think the leak may have come clay from disc on discord. I mean, that's where it was posted initially, which is not a platform I've used, but it's a live streaming platform will get to it. Also, we have Riley Gaines joining us today in the middle of the show. So in the bottom of the second hour of the program, she was assaulted last week by a pro trans agenda mob at you. Oh, in San Francisco, right? Yeah, what a shock in Nancy Pelosi's district. Same city where, you know, the people are fleeing as fast as they can and the stores are closing in that same city, or same area of that city, I should say, they're having these problems. But we want to start today with two things and update, if you will, there's not really much information on it, but an update on the NAS, Nashville mass shooting, and then also more information on the Louisville mass shooting yesterday at the bank. Let's let's first start, uh, Clay with Nashville, still no manifesto. A lot of stories out there about how the LGBTQ plus activists were really concerned about this coming out and the backlash against the community from this. So I don't see at this point how they won't even tell us what the declared, not that that's necessarily even we have to accept as the motive, right? They can analyze it. Motive is always a somewhat, I mean, it's not totally subjective, but it can be a multi-faceted thing. At this point, I don't see how it's anything other than a cover up. They don't want people to know because they won't even tell us what they think the motive is. It doesn't take that law on to figure this stuff out. It's 15 days. And I came on and said that I had been told that that the manifesto was going to be released and I was and it still hasn't happened. And Buck, note what's happened in Nashville. The story has shifted from psychotic trans shooter, kill six innocent people at a religious elementary school to, can you believe these crazy Republicans made the decision to hold a Democrat who took over the legislative chamber demanding gun control accountable for their behavior. Think about how quickly that pivot has happened. Kamala Harris rolled into town this weekend to attack the state of Tennessee for anti-democratic processes in the process. She was not willing or able to meet with any of the survivors of this shooting. And this to me as an example of how a droid and skilled the left wing in this country is at putting narrative over everything because the narrative of this shooter, and we're going to get to Louisville in a moment, we try to avoid. So you guys know, naming mass shooters on this show unless they are fugitives at large. And we think, Hey, maybe we can help you guys with this big audience help to catch like happened in the, if I remember correctly, Buck, the shooting that happened in Manhattan in the subway when that guy unleashed and then he was missing. And we said, Hey, this is the guy they're looking for. And when the shooter is dead, we're not going to try to make them more famous based on sharing their their names and whatnot pictures. But this is how it happens. This is how stories like the shift because it's 15 days, the narrative from this trans manifesto, we were told immediately that it existed. And then it just kind of vanished. The FBI came in began their investigation. I don't know who signs off on the release now of this. I would guess the FBI has taken jurisdiction in some way over this manifesto. But do you trust the FBI to be honest and share with the American public? I don't unfortunately. And so it needs to be released. Ever since that moment, I brought it up before on the show when the Obama administration FBI was editing out words from a recording from the transcript of the Pulse nightclub mass shooter, who was a jihadist, who was an Islamic radical who was murdering people in a in a gay nightclub. And ever since they changed the the words, and then they went back on it, by the way, it was so obvious and so politicized and stupid and act by the FBI that they change. Right? Imagine that the outcry was what he because we all knew what was what was blacked out in those lines. We could figure it out from the context. So really was it was both authoritarian or really totalitarian and insulting, which often goes hand in hand, right? It was an effort to shape the political narrative in a way that doesn't take into account free thinking human beings are the ones who are supposed to be able to discern this one way or the other. And and so that's that's one component of it for me. I just think that now we see their whole game here is to delay it as long as possible, because then there'll be less of a public reckoning about whatever it is that would it's very rare, as we know, for a woman to do something like this. Correct. So why? And she was a individual who self identified as trans. Why would a woman go in there? And I mean, she shot little kids, right? This is as evil as a three nine year old and and will not they will not tell us what happened by the way, if she's just completely, I mean, obviously at some level, it is just psychopathy and somebody that you know, probably needed to be institutionalized. But then tell us that, right? But if there are things that are that she points to that she pointed to in these manifesto policies that were being adopted by different states with regard to trans issues, we should know that people are being radicalized based upon that doesn't mean that it changes our behavior one way or the other, but there should be an awareness. It's a public safety issue to know why maniacs like this do what they do. Okay, that's one part of it. Speaking of psychopathic mass shooter maniacs, unfortunately, we have another one that we have more information on. Yeah, and I, you know, it's obviously not not very far off just next door in Kentucky. But this, I think, is also based on the profile we expect play from mass shooters of, you know, different that fall into these different categories. This was a lot of people surprise. This guy was 25 years old. He live streamed the shooter in Louisville, which just obviously happened yesterday morning. Uh, live streamed the shooting on instant on Instagram. Wow. Um, and left a note to his parents, telling them he was going to do this because he had been fired. So this is at some level, the workplace massacre, uh, component, there may be more to it, but he's a very left wing guy who hated Trump. And I think it's interesting posted a lot about that. I'm not saying that's why he did this, but I do note that there's no discussion of his individuals, politics whatsoever. And we know that wouldn't be the case if he were a MAGA hat wearing Trump supporter. These are the narrative issues that the media, um, these are, you know, the narrative manipulations that the media engages in. Yeah, this white guy was, and I think, again, we're not going to name him the Louisville shooter, but I want to give you some of the details of his background. Uh, he was a graduate of the University of Alabama. He was aggressively anti Trump hated Donald Trump. In fact, for those of you out there who remember this football game and I was there, he was furious that Alabama fans cheered Donald Trump at the LSU Alabama game in 2019. I was at that game, uh, with my, uh, my Bama fan son, unfortunately, because I'm a Tennessee fan, but, um, but I was at that game. It was amazing. It was Joe Barrow against, uh, against two talking about Loa for those of you out there who are big sports fans was iconic, one of the most watched college football games of the year. Trump traveled and when they put him on the jumbo Tron, Brian Denny stadium went crazy. This guy was super upset as an Alabama grad that Alabama fans were cheering Trump. He was also a huge BLM supporter. Uh, he was, uh, a guy who had his pronouns in all of his professional, uh, professional resumes and professional, uh, LinkedIn profiles and all these other places. He was a far left wing loon. Now clearly he was crazy. Something was often him as something as often off in all mass shooters because this is not a normal thing to do. But if you're wondering, wow, that Louisville shooter, that story really kind of vanished in a hurry. We're not hearing very much about him. It's because he was a left wing lunatic and it doesn't fit the narrative for him to be a guy who hated Donald Trump and who was a huge BLM supporter and was a huge pronoun in the bio guy. Side note, if you own a company and you hire anyone who puts their pronouns in their bios, I think you are in imbecile. By the way, I would never, I ran a company for a long time. It's rare that I would look at something on a resume and say, this guy or this girl is out the window. You got your pronouns in it. That is it for me. That would be, I don't want to bring in these crazy people into my company. But this, uh, this guy, if you're wondering, man, a white guy shot up a, a bank in, uh, in Louisville, this is like typically the wheelhouse for Democrats. Why have they kind of vanished? And what happened with this story? There's your answer. It doesn't fit their prevailing narrative. I remember hearing about, um, you know, workplace shootings of, I think it was particularly in the late nineties and people would, there was this term that was being used because of there were some postal workers, I believe, right? Who you're right in and and shot up, uh, their co workers effect essentially, um, of going postal. Yeah. So workplace violence of that kind is, you know, it's, it's as horrific as it is. It is not a new phenomenon. Um, but it is interesting to see that the politics of this individual, um, are not under discussion and, in the media at all as to perhaps exacerbating his psychological condition. I mean, I think that, and this is an argument that I made, I have made during both of the BLM errors when the most powerful media institutions in the country are telling people that there's effectively a, uh, that not only is law enforcement racist, but there is a racist genocide of unarmed, uh, black men occurring in the country year in and year out that has a very damaging effect on the psychology of people who aren't able to figure out that it is a huge lie. And also are already somewhat mentally unstable. And I will just say this, you find any incident where there's somebody who is in some way affiliated with, you know, ideologically, they can tie into the, if they're anti government in those broad sense, they will go, the left will go and they will find statements of individual members of Congress or, you know, or the president, if he's a Republican or whatever it may be and tie it to that person right away. Say your words led to this. This is what they do every time. But then when you look at the guy who shot up the baseball field, for example, under the Trump administration, shots, Steve Scalise almost killed Senator Rand Paul, he was a huge Bernie Sanders supporter who was yelling that he did it for health care because they were opposed to Obamacare. That was that mass murder was motivation, which still I think some people, and we know that because Rand Paul heard him screaming, this is for the half care as he's shooting at everybody. Okay. No discussion of, hey, maybe members of the Senate who are Democrats shouldn't pretend that Republicans want poor people to die of cancer without any assistance or any health care because they're so greedy, you know, so it's just, I'll note you can tell me that we shouldn't do this period. But every time it happens, I do believe it's worth noting that the left always ties it to their political enemies when they can. And when it's somebody who is of the left, they bury it as fast as they possibly can as a story. It just disappears. And we're not supposed to focus on any of the rhetoric. Have you heard anyone talk in the last couple of weeks about the political temperature in this country? That's the phrase that you know, the political temperature is just so high right now. When it's a right wing person that does something. If this guy had been a huge Trump supporter, it would have been a MAGA shooter. It would be the headlines everywhere. It would last for weeks. Merrick Garland would be on the ground right now in Louisville talking about how we need an investigation into domestic terrorism and how white men Donald Trump supporters are the biggest threat to democracy in this country. Otherwise, this happens vanishes. Can we put on an ask here? I'm curious. I mean, Steve Ducey will probably be able to get this one. I'm sorry, Peter. Peter Ducey. Steve is a dad. Yeah, Peter is right. Sorry. They're both great. I just get to get. Ducey of the White House, perhaps he could get this question. I want someone to ask the Biden and I really mean this. Ask the Biden administration. Why did the vice president have time to go stand with two individuals who broke the rules of their organization, their body, and were punished rightly under the rules in Tennessee, time to go stand with them in solidarity. No time for the families of the mass murdered individuals and including murdered children in Nashville, though. I would like the White House to be asked that question. It's a fabulous question.

Shock up a win for team reality. Welcome in clay Travis bucks, Sexton show. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us as we roll through the as we roll through the what is it? What is it? It's the Tuesday edition of the program, right? I'm flying down to South Florida. We'll be with Buck Thursday, Friday in Miami. It's going to be fun. Can't wait for that. All right. There's a scene in season four of succession. Episode two aired a couple of weeks ago where the main character, the dad, the media Baron is addressing his children. And I feel like we need to get this clip and just keep it on constant refrain because I heard it and I was like, this is so amazing. And the main character, the media Baron who is a Rupert Murdoch like figure says to his children, I love you, but you are not serious people. And I thought it was such a perfect line. And I know there are a lot of parents and grandparents out there that are like, Oh my goodness, they just distilled my entire life. I love you, but you are not serious people. And I feel like many left wing arguments when it really boils down, they're all cosmetic theater. They don't really have substance behind them because at their essence, they're rooted in emotion. And emotion is frankly the enemy of logic. And so I love you, but you are not serious people is such an amazing line. And it was in season four succession episode two. I thought about that. There's been a big controversy, right? We still don't have, let's start here. We still don't have the trans shooters manifesto in Nashville. It has now been 15 days. And the left wing has been a droid. They've been skilled. They've been incredibly well trained. And they have turned in Nashville, my hometown. They have managed to turn this crazy trans shooter into a democratic Republican or racist argument. That's what they've pivoted from. We still don't have the trans shooter manifesto. Kamala Harris can travel to Nashville, won't meet with the victims of the shooting because they don't want to reinforce that this was a crazy trans shooter. Instead, Kamala Harris comes here and they try to say, Oh, all Tennessee Republicans are racist, right? That's the argument. Now, to be fair, Tennessee Republicans did screw this thing up when they didn't vote the crazy white chick out to they just voted the two black guys out in the crazy white chick survived by one vote. Can we just also add to that that she begged them not to expel her? And then the moment she got her wish, she turned around and said, you who failed to expel me did so because you are racist. Just see, that is in microcosm. What it is to deal with a lib politician in America today. Please, please, I beg you, I want to keep my job. Fine, you weren't quite as egregious as the others. You're letting me keep my job out of racism, sir. That is what they did. And if you fell for it, you're an imbecile, frankly, if you were one, if you wanted to say hey, on principle, I don't think we should be voting anybody out in the Tennessee legislature. I don't think this makes sense. I'm going to vote against all three. Okay, I can see that argument because you kind of turned them into martyrs. You can see that argument. But if you tried to split the baby and you're like, I'm going to toss the two black dudes out, but I'm going to keep the white chick who begged for forgiveness and then immediately lit one outside, had those crocodile tears. And then as soon as she survived and wasn't kicked to the curb, she immediately said, Oh, it's racism. That's why I didn't get kicked to the curb. You got played, you played yourself. And speaking of playing yourself, this is one of the two expelled members of the Tennessee Democrat party. I believe we have this audio all queued up and ready to go. Right. So he went to Bowdoin, which is a super elite, probably what's Bowdoin cost? Probably $75,000 a year buck. I mean, probably tuition, something like that. Yeah. It is the same conference as my school amorous. Not as good as amorous, but it's pretty good. So in Maine, it is the one of the richest, whitest schools historically on the East Coast. This guy went to that school. All right. And he didn't just go to that school. He ran for student body president. And guys, I'm going to ask you to stop it if we can right at the end of his, this is the same guy that was expelled that now is trying to pretend like he's Malcolm X or Martin Luther King Jr. Here he is in 2016, running for student body president of this elite, super white liberal rich kid school in Maine. Listen, Dustin J. Pearson, and I'm running for president of PSG. There are a few reasons that we're running this campaign this year. One has to do with representation. How can we represent all voices in a conversation? I want to do this by partnering with organizations from the Bowdoin Democrats to the Bowdoin Republicans. I want to bring together different voices, dissenting voices, voices that may be more liberal or more conservative in order that we can reach a point of sort of the radical middle. Okay, pause. Great job there guys. That is his campaign message. Bowdoin, Bowdoin, I've ever pronounced it. Bowdoin, he wanted to be the student body president. You need to watch the video. That is 2016. Here is this past weekend in a Nashville church. He now has a monster Afro. Same dude. Listen, seem like the NRA and gun lobbyists might win. But all that was good news for us. I don't know how long this Saturday in the state of Tennessee might last. But all we have good news, folks, we've got good news that Sunday always comes. All right. Now, we just, I want to put them now back to back. Now, you heard him separated. This is the same dude again, separated by seven years, running for student body president at his super white school in Maine that costs $75,000 a year talking about how he wants to bring everybody together. And then it's suddenly like record scratch, 1965. And he's Martin Luther King Jr. Listen to the whole thing. Dustin J. Pearson, and I'm running for president of PSJ. There are a few reasons that we're running this campaign this year. One has to do with representation. How can we represent all voices in a conversation? I want to view this by partnering with organizations from the Bowdoin Democrats to the Bowdoin Republicans. I want to bring together different voices, dissenting voices, voices that may be more liberal or more conservative in order that we can reach a point of sort of the radical middle. It seemed like the NRA and gun lobbyists might win. But all that was good news for us. I don't know how long this Saturday in the state of Tennessee might last. But all we have good news, folks, we've got good news that Sunday always comes. This reminds me Buck of, remember the movie, eight mile when M&M's going up against the, the other elite rapper. And M&M just takes all these poor white kid literally eight mile. And he points out that Clarence, if I remember correctly, was his name went to Cranbrook, which is the most exclusive and expensive private school in the Detroit area for anybody listening to us who grew up in the Detroit area. And he just says, Clarence went to Cranbrook and everybody just loses it because the guy is a total poser, right? He's, and I wish we could curse sometimes. He's full of crap. He is pretending to be what I'd like a cosplay, a really bad actor that is trying to pretend like it's 1960s in Tennessee. I mean, I, I get nervous if I say y'all that people are going to think that I'm appropriated, you know, but it is such a good contraction. My wife was super nervous because she's from Michigan. She's been in Tennessee for 20 years. And I remember having a conversation with her. When can I use the word y'all and not sound like I'm a faker, right? Like not sound like I'm a real thing. Everybody y'all is the, is the best way to say what you're trying to say. Period. It's better than you guys. It's better than you all. Yes. You guys is a very, is a very, I think it's definitely Northeastern Midwestern, Midwestern, Midwestern. Yeah. Yeah. You guys, you know, but we say you guys in New York, y'all makes a lot, a lot more sense or, or if you're really a New Yorker, you know, Manhattan, you might say, all of you, but all of you is quite a mouthful. So look, I think we've got another great clip here too, but because I always love seeing this too. And I bet a lot of you are also having this reflection. Here is Hillary Clinton, who suddenly, this is one of the all time great, like I'm going to totally sound different depending on what audience I'm talking to. 2007, here's Hillary Clinton from the Chicago area pretending that she's southern. Listen, I don't feel no ways tired. I come too far from where I started from. Nobody told me that the road would be easy. I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me. I think we may have just violated the Geneva Convention by playing that on the air. Because I think we actually used to use tapes of Hillary to, you know, to torture prisoners to get information back in the day. That was brutal. This is what southerners know well, really bad southern accents because you're trying to pretend that you talk like us, right? I'm born and raised in Nashville. I've been around. Movies are filled with people with bad southern accents. We'll talk about it. You know, as southerners like you watch them. There's two things that always happen. One, there's a lot of really bad southern accents to every time there's a movie set in the south. Everybody sway. It's really, if you go back and watch like a time to kill, it's as if air conditioning doesn't exist in Mississippi. Like every time they're talking, they're covered. I've never seen someone chewing on the long, like, almost looks like a piece of wheat or something. Did I'm talking about? Yeah, straw. Yeah. They do this in movies all the time. I've never actually seen this anywhere. You know who was really good at that, by the way, Fred Thompson, Rest in Peace with former Tennessee Senator, also an actor. But other politicians used to complain because his whole campaign was, I'm just going to get in a red pickup truck and a drive around the state. And he was a legitimate elite actor. But all of his commercials, he was phenomenal. Like I can't act. People are like, Oh, you know, if you watch, we used to do skits for the sports gambling TV show that I would do. If you give me lines to recite, I am the worst actor on the planet. Like they would all make fun of me because we'd have a script and I'd have to memorize lines and I couldn't do it. If you just tell me ex deparaneously, hey, just go act normal. I can do it. I'm fine on TV. But if you tell me you have to deliver this, I can't do it at all. A lot of these dudes are actors, right? I mean, that's embarrassing. If you're represented by that guy, I mean, that is pretty pathetic. And if Saturday Night Live was actually funny or made fun of left wingers, this would be a gold mine. And look, there are a lot of a lot of people on the on the Democrat side have gotten away with very obvious pandering and and acts of you could call it, you know, personal fraudulent, right? I mean, pretending to be something that they're not. We all are every, you know, John, John Kerry, famously, all of a sudden is, I love shooting at the ducks that go quack, quack. And I'm, you know, I we had the butler gave me this wonderful shotgun to use. I borrowed it from him. I mean, he was the least man of the people, man of the people you could ever see. And I think one of the things, honestly, not to make this a Trump conversation, one of the things about Trump that people found so appealing is he's like, yeah, I'm a billionaire and I like cheeseburgers. And that's really, you know, or McDonald's cheeseburgers. And that's really who I am. And I do think that increasingly authenticity is an asset report. But I think there are a lot of frauds. There are a lot of frauds who get very, very foreign politics to this day. And you know, I mean, even, I mean, Tucker's done a lot of talk on his show about Alexandria Ocasio-Vortez was, was Sandy Cortez. And then realized, and you know, went to BU, which was at one point the most expensive school in America, most up there with GW where I went. Yeah, yeah, right up there with GW. And then all of a sudden we're being told that she's from the Bronx. She had this heart. No, I mean, she, you know, grew up in a household with working professionals who sent her to a $70,000 a year university and I think it was Riverdale, which is actually a, not just Oak, it's a fancy part of New York, but it is in the Bronx. So there's this interesting, I think Tucker says she's from Westchester. Anyway, but you see a lot of that a lot of people changing around their identity in a way that is more suitable politically for them because it makes them seem like they're of the, it's false populism is really what you're it makes them sound like you're on just like you. That's a very clip is one of the funniest things that I've heard. I mean that that look, this little Tennessee rep, whatever his name is, I don't even know his name. That's funny, but Hillary Clinton was legitimately convinced that she was going to be the first woman president of the United States. And that is the most insulting, like the bad southern accent. She has a bad southern accent. And then she tries to speak in like Southern black vernacular, which is even more awkward and ridiculous. I would just have, I mean, I feel like if you just ran that, that clip anywhere in the South, like she would not win a single southern state because it's, you can't look any more inauthentic. And that dude, I mean, it's just, it's, it's pathetic. And it also raises the question, why, and this is a good one for all of you out there. Why do so many Democrats want to pretend it's still 1954 or 1965? Like why are they, they want the mantle of the civil rights movement when you've got all the rights you could possibly need? Because their mindset is that they don't have to engage with the other side or deal with even facts or reality because they stand in a position of moral righteousness from the start that is both unassailable and unquestionable. And so that's why they love the 1960s civil rights positioning in 2023 because it's how dare you. We're the ones that are saving the country. And we sit around saying, I don't know, pretty sure transgender surgery for 10 year olds is not actually saving anything. And it's pretty horrible. And I don't think MLK would have been like, Hey, you know what, I really hope that one day we can live in America where 14 year olds chop their boobs off. I don't think that would have been the next step of the MLK progression. Just throwing it down there. I want to tell you something else, friends, inflation and prices are rising.

Welcome back in Clay Travis, Buck Sexton Show. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us. We are joined now by former University of Kentucky women's swimmer Riley Gaines. She swam against Leah Thomas, AKA Will Thomas, the man from the University of Pennsylvania who decided to become a woman and compete in women's athletics. She was just speaking out at San Francisco State University where a mob of hecklers attacked her and physically assaulted her and kept her locked up in a room. She is brave. She is fearless. She is fighting for women's sports. And she also, I believe, is like me from the Nashville area. Riley, appreciate the time. How are you? Of course, I'm doing good and I am from the Nashville area. Not too far from you. Yeah, for sure. All right. So for people out there who have not seen the viral video and have not experienced what happened to you, take us into that speech at San Francisco State University, the reaction to it, your experience and what has happened since. Absolutely. So I was invited to San Francisco State to give a speech on protecting women's sports, which is what I've been doing this past year, highlighting what it takes to get to that top level. Of course, what my experience in competing against Leah Thomas looked like, not just for myself, but for my teammates, for the other girls with that meat, what the locker room piece looked like, the silencing and the suppressing of our voices that our coaches and our administrators participated in after the fact. And I just explained why putting Title IX at risk is harmful to women and why it deserves to be protected. I gave the speech. There was many protests. Go ahead. Sorry. I was going to ask. Go ahead. No, sorry. I was just going to say, get the speech. There are many protesters in the room and it went relatively peaceful until afterwards. That's when a mob stormed in. They turned the lights. They flickered the lights. They stormed. They rushed me. They pushed me to the podium. There was lots of pushing and shoving and hitting. And then I, a cop came up, which I was supposed to meet with the campus police an hour and a half before the event. And they never showed up. And so I wasn't even aware there was a cop in the room. But she eventually escorted me out of the room to which in the hallway was just filled with more people. And we ultimately got pushed into another classroom in the hallway where we were barricaded for three hours. Riley, so you were just so everyone's very clear on this. You were physically assaulted. You were hit. Someone someone attacked you. Is that correct? Correct. And was it a transgender individual or just one of the activists or was it basically were you assaulted by a man? To my knowledge, yes. Again, the lights were flickering, but I believe this was a man dressed as a woman. So you were attacked, but to your belief, to your knowledge, you certainly were attacked. We were attacked by what you believe is a man dressed as a woman. I'm very curious. And first of all, this is, this is just horrifying. You know, the whole incident, we saw it on video. So I think that at least people have some awareness of what a, a shrieking bunch of lunatics, the protesters, you know, quote protest, it was really a small riot. It was what you faced. What were the police saying to you during this? And why didn't the police pull out pepper spray? I mean, that's, that's a standard for a crowd control situation like that. I mean, people that are gathering around you, assaulting you, these sorts of things, pepper spray would seem to be right within law enforcement escalation of tactics. Absolutely. You would think that that would be necessary, but these police to be totally honest, granted they were campus police, but they were terrified to do their job, to which they pretty openly admitted they didn't want to be accused of being racist. A lot of the, the protesters when we were barricaded in the room, of course, I could hear them behind the door screaming, you're just protecting that white girl because she's white. These police were put in a position where they didn't want to risk their job. They didn't want to be seen as anything other than an ally to that community. And so it did hinder their performance. I miss my flight home. I was supposed to fly home that evening, but because the police couldn't safely evacuate me from the building, I miss my flight. These protesters, they were demanding money for me if I wanted to make it home safely. And the police did nothing. They were negotiating with the, the Dean of Students about my safe passage home. And I couldn't believe they were negotiating this. Like this is something we were genuinely having a discussion about. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you said negotiating like what, what did that, what do you mean? Like take us into that specific, what does that sound like? From my side of the door, I could hear them talking, you know, they were saying, well, Riley got paid to be here. So why shouldn't we get paid if we want to let her leave? First of all, the university did not pay me to be there. That is not true at all by any means. Yet they felt as if they were entitled to reparations just from a conservative speaker being on campus. I mean, this is tapping my way to be clear. You were there three hours. They kept you inside of a barricaded classroom for three hours. Yes, the whole three hours yelling, violent, obscene, terrible, awesome things to both myself and the officers. They were screaming, if you didn't want the smoke, you shouldn't have come to this university. Trans rights are under attack. What do we do? We fight back. I mean, it's kind of chilling to think about what they would have done to me had someone not been able to step in because there was no way I could have safely removed myself from the situation. I was totally stormed and surrounded. And so it does kind of put you in fear for your life in the moment a little bit. You have no idea how unhinged these people really can be until you see it with your own eyes and they're coming at you. I just want to be clear. What they found so unacceptable was that you said men should compete against men in sports and women should compete against women in sports. And basically that biology is real and there are two genders. The people on that campus found that to be totally unacceptable for you to share. And maybe for people out there who might not have experienced your story, this comes out of your experience in swimming against a man. And as you said, so few women athletes, including now Megan Rapinoe and Sue Bird are even willing to stand up and say women should compete against women and men should compete against men. Yeah, I'm in a trans man stole the national championship from Riley in her event effectively, right? That's what happened at the NCAA finals. We're speaking of Riley Gaines for anyone who's joining us in progress here about what happened at San Francisco State University last week. Riley, what was the response after all this happened? So now we know what the incident was like. After all this happens, did a university take any disciplinary action against any students? Has anyone been expelled? No, the university doubled down by saying they were proud of their brave students. Literally word for word, they said. It can be very hard to have someone who so egregious come to campus and speak, and it takes tremendous bravery to stand in this challenging space. And we're so proud of the moments where we listened and we asked in-sight for questions. And we're proud of the students who demonstrated the value of free speech and the value to protest peacefully. We must have a different definition of peaceful because what I experienced was by no means peaceful. Why do you think so many women athletes are afraid to say what you are saying? And I want to go back again specifically because you tweeted about them earlier, Megan Rapinoe and Sue Bird Megan Rapinoe is an elite women's soccer player, Sue Bird, an elite basketball player, women's basketball player. They're both saying, oh, we're opposed to the idea of preventing trans athletes. That is men identifying as women from competing in their sport. That's almost basically endorsing the erasure of women's athletes from women's athletics. What are they thinking in your mind? Why are they saying that? And why are you out there in many ways on an island making the arguments that you are? Well, to be totally frank, people are scared because look at what just happened to me. For saying something as simple as men and women are different, that easy, right? That common sense, yet I was still ambushed. No one wants that to happen to them. No one wants to be labeled as transphobic. Of course, people would rather like Megan Rapinoe and like Sue Bird and like Billy Junking who were trailblazers for women's sports. So of course, it's ironic, but they want to be seen as inclusive and kind and accepting and welcoming and loving and all of the things, which of course, who doesn't want to be seen as those things. But newsflash, it's not inclusive to allow men to take a podium spot from a woman. It's exclusive and it's not kind to allow a male, equipped with male genitalia to change in a locker room with girls. That's not kind. That's not inclusive. And like I mentioned, the double standard here, these are women who fought relentlessly. Megan Rapinoe in particular, she fought for equal pay and equal access and equal resources for women. But now I'm realizing it was a sense of folk feminism because when you're fighting to have really for Title IX to be taken down, so men can compete on women's teams, it's hypocrisy. Riley, I just want to ask you before we finish up, oh, well, Clay also has a follow up, but do you plan on taking legal action against the call against the university, against any of the individuals? I mean, they they very clearly, I'm not a lawyer, Clay is they very clearly broke the law, though. We all know that. Absolutely. I definitely intend to if nothing else to send a message because when is enough enough, we've gotten to the point where there are no repercussions, there are no consequences for acting out in this manner. But I've had enough. It has reached enough for me. And so I will be pursuing some sort of legal action to hold someone accountable, whether that's the university, the campus police, the individuals themselves. There needs to be a message sent. Last question for you. And thank you for speaking out. You can follow Riley on Twitter. We'll be sharing this interview so you guys can can find that as well. Dylan Mulvaney is a man pretending to be a woman. Nike gave him a sports bra endorsement deal and a women's leggings endorsement deal. I'm just curious, has anyone and they said he's brave for living his life? Has anyone at Nike reached out to you and asked you if you would like a women's apparel deal? Oh goodness, no. And I don't anticipate that. But I don't know if they can understand the mockery of what this makes of women, especially the video of Dylan, I guess, portraying what he thinks women look like when we work out doing jumping jacks and doing different things. That is so incredibly degrading. And for Nike to take this stance, they can forget getting my money. And I talked to a lot of female athletes who agree with exactly everything I just said. We're highly gains fighting the fight. We appreciate you. We appreciate your bravery. We're sorry about what happened to you. A lot of the guys in particular. And I'm sure a lot of ladies in this audience wish we had been there to be able to help you out under the circumstances. But please keep speaking out and come back on the show whenever you want.

We had a fabulous conversation with the very brave Riley Gaines former University of Kentucky swimmer who was attacked at San Francisco State University for having the audacity to say that men should compete against men and women should compete against women. They kept her hostage for three hours in a classroom because they were so afraid of what would happen after she was assaulted. And so I would encourage all of you to go listen to that. But we're coming up on for some of you spring break season still going on. Some of you are going to be graduating from college or your kids are and you're going to be on the road for the course of the spring and into the summer. Just make sure you got the show wherever you may find yourself. Search out my name clay Travis. Search out Buck Sexton lots of podcast exclusives and uniques. You can go subscribe and you'll be glad that you did. Um, a couple of different things that are out there. First of all, I'm presuming that a lot of people are sharing their pets. I want to apologize to all the lizard owners out there for mispronouncing Kila monster. Which by the way, not a very positive I would imagine name for an animal. The monster typically not seen as a very positive. I will say this. We have two cats. They are the bane of my existence. They are destroying everything in the house. But the boys seem very happy with them. Buck, have you made any further progress towards adding a dog to your family? The discussion is ongoing. We've talked about the fundamentals in your place. We got I got nothing. We got nothing here. But I mean, can you have are you allowed? Like some places don't allow is this part of the conversation? I mean, you know, I think technically no, but you know, come on. What are they going to do? Um, so no, I don't think we are in in my current in my current home allowed to have a a pet because it's a condo and there are condo rules. I you could do it. You just have to get it approved and you know, people have dogs here obviously, but you can't just like show up with one. I think you have to get get approval for it. Um, it's interesting. Also, you know, there are breed restrictions in a lot of buildings and people get into this thing of, oh, mine's a mix, they say, because you can't a lot of buildings won't allow. And I'm not I'm not casting aspersions. I'm going to get inundated, particularly by the pit bull people out there, but a lot of buildings apartment buildings won't allow pit bulls, rot whileers, mastiffs, and then some of the more exotic large fighting dogs like Preza Canario. Um, I'm trying to think of a dogo, dogo, Argentino, which if you've ever seen these dogs, by the way, they look like pit bulls on steroids. I mean, they're they're massive. So they won't allow you with those sorts of dogs. But what I've talked to carry about is, look, maybe we think this is why I asked for Clay and Buck vip's and also on Twitter and Facebook to just send us your different pets because it's national pet day, everybody. You can tag us at Clay and Buck. The staff will see them on social if you want to do that. And, and, and I say, you know, we could just go outside the box a little bit here because as I pointed out, Florida is very, very favorable to allowing you to have exotic pets. The exotic pet trade here is flourishing. So you can get pet Fox pet raccoon. I mean, probably I could just get a pet coyote and say it was a mix. Now is this advisable? Probably not. But also sugar glider, right? You even know it as sugar glider. The like this little or are you on? I mean, I'm many, many stories up in the you're going to have the reason why I'm asking is you're going to take a coyote into an elevator into an elevator for like 24. I tell everybody it is a designer. It's, you know, a desire. It's like a coyote mixed with a poodle and nobody will know the difference. I mean, I think if you have a yard, there are potentially aggressive moves you could make in terms of what animals you want to have. But for you to like walk into a Miami condo with a coyote, I don't know what the voting process is to remove you from being able to stay in your building. But I think that that you would be on the fast track towards that. I think that would be an issue. I'm looking here at the list. I could have a pet marmoset, which is very exciting. Is it like a little like a little looks like a small monkey, a small, small primate. Yeah, marmoset, foxes you can have a pet skunk. Peppi lip you. I'm sure that that has been, you know, they take away the the the odorific aspects of the skunk. The problem with the pet skunk and we probably if you have a pet skunk in the audience, please weigh in, you know, you know, email us or tweet it us or something. I feel like, you know, how you have to discipline pets a little bit, meaning you got to be like, no, no, no, you know, you got to learn to use the litter box or whatever. That skunks got you, man. Like you start to talk a little smack to the skunk and you get hit with that the gland that shoots out the stuff and the smell. This is my thing. If you're trying too hard with your pet, I can't trust you. Just like I am very anti snake. I've said this on the show before. If you have a pet snake, and I'm sure a lot of you listening right now do, I don't really trust you because I feel like in some way you're deviant. I'm just saying if you're a snake guy, certainly if you're a snake girl, I feel like you're a little bit of a deviant. You're hiding something. I would, I would though, I'd say turtles, I'm cool turtles like people like having pet turtles. That's not trying to cool. Yeah. No, well, no one ever has to call the cops because they're being strangled by their pet dogs. No issue. Yeah. Alligators, payments trying to are just just be normal, right? You know, you can't even have. I mean, there are there are there are wild roaming chickens in my neighborhood that that people keep here in Florida. You can't even have any of these New York City. You're not even allowed to have a hedgehog. So you want to talk about tyranny? Forget all that COVID stuff. A hedgehog, Ben? It's just not American. One guy in like New York City have a tiger in his con and his apartment. That was very illegal though. Very legal. Yes. I mean, can you imagine? We'll be back tomorrow. Same bad time. Same bad channel. Don't put tigers in your apartment."
