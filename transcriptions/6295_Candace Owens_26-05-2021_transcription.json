    "text": " Hello and welcome. Somebody made the joke to me recently that it seems like Hollywood has suddenly traded in their BLM stickers for I got vaccinated stickers and now it's the free Palestine stickers. That is how the internet works. Everything becomes a trend and everybody jumps on a bandwagon. It's social media and it's signaling a virtue on social media platforms. In fact, I actually have a girlfriend. She is a model. She has walked to Victoria's secret fashion show and she said to me seriously over dinner one night, I am getting so much pressure Candace because I'm in Hollywood that I have to say something about all of these topics. They want me to post something about Black Lives Matter and to be honest, I'm not an expert on race relations in America. I just want to be pretty on the internet. That's what she said. I just want to be pretty on the internet and I said, that is so refreshing for a model to admit that they don't know what they're talking about and that they don't want to be an expert about everything. I actually miss those days. I miss those days when people were comfortable saying, I don't know. My story is interesting. I actually got into politics because I hate politics. I especially hate politicians because it's this weird culture of pretending to know absolutely everything. I have done so many political events where I've stood up on stage next to someone. They've received a question. They clearly didn't know the answer to the question, but they just pretended to because I'm in politics. I have to know everything. I have to take a stand on absolutely everything. Now it feels like that political culture has seeped down into every average individual across the entire world. They feel like they have to attend. They know about various topics. So you're going to have to imagine my surprise this weekend when I went to check out some of the direct messages that I received. They were regarding the Israel and Palestinian conflict that broke out. People actually began messaging me. I don't think I'm really known as a Middle Eastern expert, but here are just a couple of the private messages that I received. Ready? Candice, I have followed you for years. I don't understand how you can see an image like this, the image that they were referring to as an image of a dead Arab girl and not use your platform to speak out. Have you sold out? Have you sold out now because you work for Ben Shapiro? Another message I received. Candice, you need to draw attention to the Jewish people that are being attacked all over the country. I don't understand how you have not said anything at all. Your silence is violence. Silence is violence. I'm going to tell you that both of these messages really upset me because what they're really doing there is emotional blackmail. It's either do this or you are that. It's exactly what was done during the Black Lives Matter riots. If you did not use your platform to say Black Lives Matter, then well, it's because you're racist. You must hate Black people. You must want Black people to die. Now, it's the same thing, but they're in certain different groups, different ethnic groups. If you do not use your platform to say this, to speak out about Israel means that you hate Jewish people. If you do not use your platform, Candice, to say that it is sad to see a photo of a dead Arab girl, then it's because you want all Palestinians dead. That's emotional blackmail. That is what's happening on the internet today. It's emotional blackmail. I see Gal Gadot, the woman that played Wonder Woman trending and people are angry at her. She served in the IDF and they are saying that Gal Gadot wants Arab children dead. I see Bella Hadid trending. Bella Hadid, a model. They suddenly say, you know what, Bella Hadid wants all Jewish people to be thrown into the ocean. If you agree with Bella Hadid, then you agree with that message. If you agree with Gal Gadot, then you agree with that message. Emotional Blackmail. Here in America, we don't have an expert problem. We have a non-expert problem. We have too many people that don't know what they're talking about, that cannot seem to close their mouths. I'd like to speak on behalf of the non-experts, the people that have the courage to admit that they don't know everything and that they'd like to take time to learn. I want to make something abundantly clear. Silence is not violence. Sometimes, silence actually allows us to hear the debate. Sometimes, hearing the debate allows us to learn and sometimes learning allows us to think critically about our own ideas and to form our opinions. It took me years to form opinions about the pro-choice versus the pro-life debate. I started pro-choice. I ended up pro-life. Similarly, it took me a really long time to learn. I read multiple books about the environmental lobby, about climate change and why I don't believe it. And when I felt comfortable on my two feet, I spoke out. When I felt comfortable, I could defend my positions, I spoke out. Not when the internet told me to be a fraud and to cope with my opinion because it's trending right now. Sometimes, silence is courage. It's courage despite all of the noise on the internet, speaking out and saying, I don't know. And when it's coming from me, I want you guys to know something. Silence is simply authenticity. Welcome to Candace. We will get right back to the show in just one second. But first, now let's get back to the show. Israel and Palestine conflict. A lot of things are being thrown between the two. Anybody here have a very strong opinion that they'd like to share. None of us are experts. What I've been according to your monologue. Don't be intimidated by my monologue. It just means no one's an expert. I think it doesn't take an expert though to look at the situation. I think reasonable people can disagree about America's role in supporting Israel. I think it's pretty hard to have reasonable people disagree about Israel versus Hamas. There's two sides here. You've got Israel that is calling the other side before they're bombing saying, hey, get the children out. Let's not do that. Intentionally bombing places where they only know military activities going on. The other side, indiscriminately firing rockets in the civilian areas using children as human shields. So I think it's pretty easy to decide which side you can fall on there. I don't think it takes an expert necessarily to do that. Again, much more nuanced conversations can be had about America's role in that entire conflict. But when it comes to Israel versus Hamas, I think it shouldn't take an expert to decide. Well, if we're talking about America's role, and I apologize, my voice has been trying to go out for three days. So if I speak and it sounds like a pubescent child is speaking, I apologize. America's role in this, can it not be argued that a lot of things of what we're seeing is because other countries feel that America is coming from a place of weakness now? Everyone knows that Israel is an ally. Everybody knows this in America. You didn't see this kind of stuff when President Trump was in office. You see this now. I really loved what Ted Cruz said the other day when he said all 4,000 missiles should have Joe Biden's name attached to him because you are seeing unrest, you are seeing more and more almost poking the bears nation or excuse me worldwide at America. Now I do. I think that we as America, what's the point of having allies? What's the point of claiming that we have allies if we don't stand up in direct support of those allies? And I think Joe Biden has a responsibility for that. I mean to push back a bit on that, I do agree that things are worse in the Middle East than they were under President Trump. But I think there's the potential of mistaking America's domestic strength with intervention in the Middle East. Because what I liked about Trump is that he really set a different tone than something that we saw, for example, under George W. Bush. It was like strength through diplomacy and through those ties. And a lot of those historic peace deals that were initiated under President Trump, they didn't come by giving other countries foreign aid or by putting boots on the ground, which I thought was actual progress. I think it could be argued though it came because they knew that Trump would take those measures if needed to be done. But his whole campaign, he was running on get the troops out of the Middle East. If you look at his core base, a lot of the America First people, they're tired of endless conflict in the Middle East. And that doesn't mean that you can't have alliances with different states in the Middle East. But I'm seeing a lot of people on social media and it's like, all right, let's dial things back a little bit. And I'm glad that they worked out a ceasefire between them. Social media is problematic for a lot of reasons. And I can't tell you, it just kind of gets to the point of obnoxiousness when no matter what you say, you're accused of the other thing. I must be the only person on the internet that has both been, I've also been accused of being Adolf Hitler and also a Zionist. That's the internet for you. No matter what you say. You could see people that were objectively saying this photo of a dead Arab child is sad and they were being accused of you're a horrible person, you want to genocide Jewish people, or people like Gal Gadot, when I want to pull up this message that she wrote that I think is perfectly fine. And if we could, she tweeted this, actually, yeah, she tweeted this, my heart breaks, my country is at war. I worry for my family, my friends, I worry for my people. This is a vicious cycle that has been going on for far too long. Israel deserves to live as a free and safe nation. Our neighbors deserve the same. I pray for the victims and their families. I pray for this unimaginable hostility to end. I pray for our leaders to find the solutions so we could live side by side in peace. I pray for better days. This is, if you're talking about the higher diplomacy, that's it. And she got pummeled for this trending, basically saying that she is now seeking the genocide of Palestinians. And that is the internet. I do think it's worth pointing out too how first, I mean, just saying you're praying for something enough these days to get people canceled. Also, Gal Gadot was in the IDF. She has a vested interest in this. She served in these really defensive forces. And just to push back on the America first point, I think there's a false dichotomy that's been created where you can now say, well, if you're America first, you shouldn't support any kind of foreign aid or any kind of intervention. But intervention does not just mean putting troops in the ground. Intervention can also mean soft diplomacy, giving aid. America first doesn't have to mean America alone. And if America is alone in the Middle East and doesn't have this rule there. But that's not the same thing. I mean, Canada and the US are very close allies, same with Canada or the US and the UK. That doesn't have to mean all of this military aid. If we look at, I think one of the greatest issues America is facing right now is it's exploding debt. I mean, America's essentially borrowing money from China to spend on aid to Israel, military aid. I don't even not support Israel. I'm just a little bit, you know, I want to point out the hypocrisy. You've been saying, yeah, you've been seeing a lot of that on the internet too. And I think especially with COVID and the shutdowns and people are losing so much money that a lot of people are feeling that sentiment on the internet. And it does go to say something when it's like, we're just sending money to both sides. Actually right now. That's great. That's even, I think that's the most frustrating element. We haven't taken any sort of a stand when, you know, Joe Biden gets up there and he says, hey, like, you know, Israel is our allies. He's like, but also we're going to send all this money to rebuild, you know, to rebuild. It's like, okay, not exactly a position of strength to come from saying you don't really have a stance. I think we're also putting rational American citizen thought versus political politician thought as well, which anytime you try to do those things, it's never going to make sense. And we'll sit here and go back and forth all the time. What politicians, which ironically, I realized I'm running for Congress, but this is why I'm running for Congress, we have too many politicians. What politicians claim to be doing, we need to stand with Israel, we need to help this out. We need to pass this budget so the American people can get aid, but 98% of it goes somewhere else. That's a political standpoint and through a political lens. But the average American citizen is going, wait a minute, wait a minute, you know, we're supposed to be allies with Israel. Why are we at least saying something in regards to this, from the purpose of the highest authority within our leader, right? That's what I mean from that point. Donald Trump, one of his best lines that doesn't get enough talked about is F around and find out. And so I mean, yes, I love what President Trump did, first president in a long time not to start any new wars, et cetera. But I also fully 100% believe that if push came to shove, people from other countries knew they can only push Trump so much at the same time. Well, I will just say this, I think on behalf of a lot of rational Americans, I neither believe that Gal Gadot wants Arabs to be genocided. And I also don't believe that Bella Hadid wants Jewish people pushing to the state. I think there's a lot of dialogue that should happen. Let the experts hash it out. politicians should take a better stance or at least a clear stance on what is they believe. And I totally empathize with the fact that like there are Americans that are going like, come on, man, we got a lot of problems going on right here on American soil. So I do want to get to other topics, but very interesting conversation. I love to hear that the nuance. And this is what should happen. People should actually have a conversation about a little bit of nuance. I want to get to the COVID vaccine updates because I'm just so proud of myself. You guys have no idea how I had to fight to be able to talk about the vaccines and the reactions here on the show. We did it a couple of weeks ago. And it was kind of like, I can't believe Candice is going there and talking about vaccine reactions and low and behold, now all of a sudden we have the CDC investigating heart problems in a few young vaccine recipients. They're teenagers are reporting heart problems, serious heart problems. And now they're investigating this. And it just is sort of like, we people have been saying this for months. And nobody really had the courage to talk about it because they're so afraid of being censored. Very clapping just came out. Yeah. Said he had a horrific reaction to the vaccine as well. One of the first major like legends that I can think of that has come out and said it as well. And he's obviously pro-vaxx. People that are getting the vaccine, right? So they're obviously pro-vaxx are getting this and they're having reactions and they have just been essentially gaslit by the media. And now the New York Times, first they were called conspiracy theorists. And now the New York Times is saying, okay, yeah, there is some stuff going on. And by the way, this is a small part of what's going on, right? They're basically doing what they absolutely have to with back against the wall type of reporting right now. If you listen very closely, you can hear actually the Facebook fact checker screaming, cut the segment, get the segment down. You can hear YouTube, you can hear Twitter saying this can't get out at all. And that makes it really hard to have honest conversations. And the funny thing is how people really quickly go from conspiracy theorists to truth tellers. Dr. Fauci was out telling grandpa, your conspiracy theorist for questioning if the coronavirus could have originated in a Wuhan lab. And now Dr. Fauci has come out this week saying, well, maybe we should investigate that because it seems like there's mounting evidence to prove it. You mean more Fauci? So conspiracy theorists, Lord Fauci. The conspiracy theorists are having the best year ever. What are they going to do now? Because there are literally people that have been censored and kicked off the internet for talking about this. And it was crazy because we have platforms so we can make noise when something happens to us. Think about the average American. There are people that were actually taken off of Facebook for saying, I had the shot and this happened to me. And they said, there is absolutely no way. It's genetically impossible. I mean, it's biologically impossible if this happens to you. I mean, where is the justice for this when this sort of information comes out after you've been censored off the web? There is none. And what's also been frustrating to see that there have been actual doctors, people who study vaccines, who have tried to speak out about this to say, we're not sure this needs more tests. It's not ready. And they have actually been kicked off of different platforms. They've been silenced by Facebook fact checkers. It's like, if we're going to trust the science, which has kind of become the mantra of 2021, why are I mean, the Silicon Valley massless bureaucrats censoring actual doctors? Right. It makes no sense. I go ahead. No, I'll say this. And, you know, if you were to ask me a year ago when I thought of Fauci, I would have said, yeah, he's done some good stuff throughout history. We'll see how it pans out. I now think Dr. Fauci has been the worst doctor in the history of modern medicine. Because of this, he has done more to undermine. You can clap for that. You can clap for that. Because of this, regardless of his earlier accomplishments and the good things he did for science, he has done more to undermine people's faith in science than anyone in modern history. Rest in peace science. Because he has said, trust the science. If you ask questions, you don't trust the science. What scientist says we're not allowed to question established data? I think he should be audited. And I'm telling you, he is a person that should be under federal investigation. He should be audited. When you tell me that people were made poorer, locked down, say people poor, and yet somehow what emerged out of the vaccine industry is nine new billionaires. And he's got ties to the NIH. I mean, there's something about him that screams corruption to me. And there's a difference between not trusting science and not trusting these political figures. Yeah, exactly, which absolutely is. Biggest thing I want to say is this, the biggest issue out of all this, Dr. Fauci's pull a crap. Sorry, he is. It's just across the board. I've never seen somebody be wrong more times and still have a job. Either way, Americans are entering into a world. That's what that's what we're entering into right now, where we are not allowed to get second opinions. We are not allowed to listen to what we want to listen to to find out the information to make decisions, not only for ourselves, but for our children. We are living in a society that we are allowing billionaires in Silicon Valley who are honestly working with these news outlets, fake news outlets, whatever you want to call them, these journalists that are supposed to be transparent and fair. They are working together to manipulate what we're allowed to read, what we're allowed to see. Remember the doctors that stood on the stairs at Capitol Hill? Remember how quickly that got taken out and all the social media accounts of conservatives that posted it just to even say, hey, these doctors right here, they have medical degrees too and they are saying things as well. It's big pharma, it's big effect and it's big media and they're all colluding and the only people that are getting hurt because of it are Americans. Because think about if you are one of those people that took your teenagers to get that shot, how guilty you would feel when you're teenager in perfect health is now having heart problems and all the conspiracy theorists who told you that that could be a possibility have been censored off the web. You're starting to question things and you know what, it's going to be dangerous because they're going to actually start to think maybe I should stop listening to mainstream media and start listening to these alleged conspiracy theorists. I do want to get to this next topic, I don't want to forget about this person because if you're going to have this person, she will cry. Demi Lovato needs a lot of attention and by golly, we are going to give it to her today. We are going to give her the attention she is looking for. Bill. Bill. I'm sorry. Bill is the proper English way to address. Right. I tried it for 24 hours for saying that these non-binary they-them pronouns are just poor English. 24 hours I tried to get a super word outraged that I said that referring to a singular individual as them is not proper. But Demi Lovato wants you guys to know that she's officially changed her pronouns because she has come to her truth and let's watch the clip. Living in the fourth dimension means existing consciously in both time and space. But for me, it means having conversations that transcend the typical discourse. I want to take this moment to share something very personal with you. Over the past year and a half, I've been doing some healing and self-reflective work. And through this work, I've had the revelation that I identify as non-binary. With that said, I'll officially be changing my pronouns to they-them. I feel that this best represents the fluidity I feel in my gender expression and allows me to feel most authentic and true to the person I both know I am and still am discovering. There's a lot of words in that. Fourth dimension. What dimension you guys in, by the way? At least 23. After watching that, I'm back to the first. Actually, after having to watch all that, I will add to, you know when this announcement came out, the day her new podcast premiered. Yes. It just so happened that she felt the courage to tell the world about this new life update. She was having to read from a prompter. There's no way she got all those words right that she was supposed to say. Graham, that was her truth that you were talking about. That's her truth. They gave me my truth. And that's the problem. There is no her truth, there is no your truth, there is the truth. And that's the biggest issue is we are allowing society, especially elite Hollywood celebrities, musicians, etc. Just dilute our children. That's what's happening here. Okay. Rational adults, and yes, I say this all the time, people get real mad at me when I say real Americans. Oh, your racist, you said no. When I say real Americans, I mean rational thinking Americans. They don't believe any of this stuff. Like they're like, this is the craziest thing ever. Here's the thing. We all grew up. How many non-binary children did you have in your classrooms going up? There's no way of knowing how this is. How are they this? Negative one. Negative one. How are they this many? Because this is the thing is they're teaching people this. This is not normal for a person to go up and go, I'm non-binary. I'm gender fluid. And yet now the media is trying to tell you that this is normal and you should come into your truth and it drives me crazy because at the end of the day, all they want is attention. And we live auto, we need to hug. It's going to impact us soon too. It's really easy to look at this and have the first reaction. Well, how does this impact me? Let them do their thing. I don't really care that much. What pronoun you say. But it is going to impact us. There is going to be compulsory speech that comes along with this. If you look at the progression of other countries ahead of us, Canada, UK, it has become compulsory speech where it is now going to be illegal to use pronouns. If you think that's not going to happen in America, you haven't paid attention recent history in the last few years, that's how this is going to affect all of us. And that's why we shouldn't just sit on the sidelines and say, well, they can do their own thing, whatever, because it's not just them sitting alone living their lives. This is going to be pushed out on the horse. And it's frustrating because the left does this. They will shoehorn these political progressive agendas down people's throats. And then the minute that conservatives push back, they'll say, why are you so obsessed with them? Why are you so obsessed with the culture? Or how does it affect you? Meanwhile, conservatives are not the ones who are mandating pronoun usage by law. And I'm sorry, but if we are in living in clown world where the idea that something as crazy as non-binary genders actually exists, and I know that's a little bit mean toward Demi Lovato, but nothing I can say can ever come close to her doing those bangs to herself. I know, you know what? I blame Wilmer Valderrama. I feel like that was her chance to be saved when she was when he was dating her. And like, you know, she kind of said, she was getting herself together. And this is what I say. This is the course to me when you experiment with feminism for too long. Like you produce a crazy person. You know what I mean? And it's like feminism, I always say, it's like a drug you try when you're in college, right? You got to stop doing that drug when you leave college. This is what happens when somebody just keeps playing with feminism and keeps playing with leftism and keeps playing with liberalism. They end up just going, how can I get attention? I'm non-binary. And she's constantly doing stuff for attention. Don't forget, she was in the news last week for some other ridiculousness. She was complaining about the yogurt shops and I have a nice angle to come out soon. She also said this this week, it is harmful. Demi Lovato is not okay with people that compliment others on their bodies. It's like, what do you need? What sort of attention? Why can't people compliment one another? They're miserable. And in my opinion, it's too much therapy, right? It's like the therapists are making people crazy. And I think this is kind of the example that should be pointed to when Jordan Peterson talks about how we need to improve ourselves before we improve the rest of the world. You know, you've talked about things like mental health of celebrities, like Glindsey Lohan, was it Courtney? Courtney Stodden. Yeah. Right. And I look at this person and it's like this is someone who I'm not being me. Actually, I think needs some sort of counseling, right? She's unhappy with herself and she's trying to project that to the rest of the world. And it's not going to end well for her as a person. Go ahead. You can tell where the lack of happiness and the pursuit of happiness is and the fact that this is now the fourth gender identity she's had in the last two years. She was straight for a while, then she became queer. And then she said she was, oh, what's a pan, I think she said pansexual was her third. And now this is fourth. So I think there is this constant pursuit of identity and longing. Honestly, it makes you sad to see and attention and attention. It's the best way to get attention. The biggest thing Lauren, I like what you said is what we're doing with this whole back to the thing of our truths and this and that what it's doing is it's giving people a free pass not to have to actually deal with what's really going on with that individual. We have a free reign to do whatever we want to be. Literally your parents telling you 20 years ago, you can be whatever you want to be in America. They didn't mean that you could be like a unicorn flying around and whatever. No, they meant that you could work hard, have an opportunity to be whatever you want to be. People are allowed to be crazy in America. People are allowed to say ridiculous things. I was born and raised in Mississippi. We've got some crazy people in Mississippi. Some of them are my family. Some of them became president. Some of them became president. Either way, but the point is when you start mandating other Americans to fall in line with your craziness, that's when we have problems. Same thing with vaccines. You want to get the vaccine? Fine. I'm not taking it and I had COVID. I don't know if any of you guys had it. I had it. I'm good. I don't need anything else. You want to wear the mask? Fine. I'm good. That's your right to do it. I am anti-mandating Americans to do anything and we are headed very close like you just said to mandating Americans. You can't say the word manhole cover in California because it's got the word man in it. It's just ridiculous and I will say this also like it's also probably mag that this stuff is being taught in the school system. Yes. Not the only thing being taught in school systems, by the way. Just recently this has been revealed to that at a $47,000 a year man hat in school, they're teaching porn. It's a porn lesson on topics that include incest and roleplay. They are learning different genres of porn which include gang bang, gang bang, anal, and even stepmother porn. So incest, right? They are, this happened. The parents had no idea. They went to school and just you were clear, Baron Trump used to attend this school. This is an elite man hat in school. You have kids. If that was your child? Home school. Home school. Home school. Home school. I homeschool my kids and I was very anti-home school. I grew up in the generation where the homeschool kids were the weird kids that got off the van at the park and then they went back. But listen to me, my daughter who's here today, we were getting ready to enroll her in kindergarten. I won't say what state this is. I don't want to call you out. Kindergarten. Call them out. Okay. Texas. We went in Texas. Kindergarten. So you wouldn't think this being Texas. Kindergarten, they make you sign this form. Do you opt in or opt out of HIV and age training for your kindergarten? It's real life stuff in the public school system. School choice. Home school your kids. I don't care how much money it costs you. It's cost us a lot. Get family members to band together and fight back against this stuff. We just bought a building in our home because the homeschool has like exploded and all these parents are helping out to teach children. We as parents have to take back control over what our kids are learning and it's only going to get worse if we continue to rely on the government and the public school system to feed this garbage down our kids throat. In the Bible when it says woe to those who call good evil and evil good, this is what they're talking about. Absolutely. There would be a time when evil things would be held up and praised. And also I find it ironic that it's the left that's pushing these things, the left that the side of women, the side of empowerment. What could be more degrading than pushing the porn industry on young kids as if it's something to be glorified? Absolutely. Also worth pointing out all the talk of mental health. We never talk about the mental health detriments that come from porn addiction. We have millions and millions of young people, particularly young men that are addicted to pornography. There are medical parts of this, there are mental health parts of this. As if now we have to glorify it and go along with it, that is calling evil good. Listen, I mean this is and here's my personal theory, call it a conspiracy theory which means it'll probably be true in two years, five years, ten years. But the whole reason of this is because they don't want to actually produce productive adults. They want a person that's addicted to porn. They want a person that's non-binary, doesn't have a family self-mutilation when these kids are saying they should be able to do these procedures to change their gender assignment when they're young. What they're actually looking for is a bunch of people that cannot do anything in life but be government addicted, they're just government addicts because they can't do anything for themselves and that sets the stage for the government to control every single element of your life. I think you're exactly right and the problem that I've noticed amongst the right for the longest time is that they've kind of been happy to let the left do whatever they want when it comes to academia and education. I know a lot of people who have joked around that, well, leftism, it's kind of going to become extinct because no one on that side is having heterosexual intercourse which is like okay, point there. But if you look at... We just got to wait it out. Yeah, right. You might be tempted to think that but the thing is even if they're not having children, they have your children. They have your children in the school system, they have your children in pop culture. Six hours a day. Exactly. So yeah, we need to be a lot more careful with what children are being exposed to. And we also have to talk about the darker issue of all this and it goes off what you said. This is an attempt of sexualizing our children. I've talked about this a lot. I saw a TikTok video. I know, if you're a god. Anyway, I saw a TikTok video of this woman with her baby. The baby couldn't have been six months old and she goes, my baby's gay. My baby's gay. It's this whole TikTok. They're in like different locations. Where is child protective services? Exactly. What are you talking about? Ask your eight-year-old child. Are you gay? Do you know anything about sex at all? No, because they're children. Children do not think about these things. Anytime a child, if a child comes up to you and says anything of sexual nature of any kind, that is an adult. That is somebody who has put that in their head. Children don't think that way. Children don't operate that way. It's like when you see somebody like my dog is vegan. Like no, no, no, no. You show me a vegan dog. It's like showing me a trans child. You know who's making the decisions. It's always the adults. It's a crazy adult behind that. And it drives me insane because as someone who just had a child, you guys will start families. I mean, this is, you are correct. We have to start making decisions. I'm a big, big supporter of homeschool. You're right. Growing up, the homeschool kids were weird. The future, people that go to school, public schools, are going to be the weird ones. In my personal opinion. I do want to get to this field good story of the week. Cancel culture bites back. Morgan Wallen, who I absolutely love, was roundly canceled last year. He said the N word to his white friend. They don't never tell you that in the headlines, but he said the N word to one of his white friends when he was drunk. And that was enough. The video got out and they said, Oh my God, he's a racist. He hates black people. And they canceled him from everything. I mean, his record label put him on a suspension. They job us to make from the radio waves. The billboards that he was not invited and yet somehow last night, he picked up three billboard music awards after the ban. And he's got number one songs all over. And that I think is just like tells you that you can cancel the media. Can't really cancel people. And people are supporting who they want to support. Exactly. Awesome. Go ahead. No, you are taking two or three. You forgot this. We're on the same tempo. I was just going to say, you know, I am in no way condoning using the word in any regard. Highly intoxicated as he was or not, which I think if all of us were really honest of every decision and everything we've ever said when we've been really drunk, no one would have a job. Either way, the point is, shouldn't we just eliminate the word total? Brandon Tatum says this a lot. Say it all the time. Just get rid of it. On every side, every side. Nobody should be allowed to say it. There's no positive to that word in any regard. That's the problem. It's like you're sitting here saying that the word is bad. It becomes out of a white person's mouth, right? And then you say it's totally fine if Cardi B says it in all of her music. She's at the top of the billboard charge. She says it in every single song. She's not even black, right? She's Puerto Rican, Dominican mix, but somehow that is some okay. Anyone but a white person. What about my kid? Half white, half black. Is he going to be canceled or celebrated? And it's like, it depends on the politics. Can Asian people say the N word? I mean, this is ridiculous. I do all that for example. It's white adjacent. There's no such thing as a word. There should never be such thing as a word that some people can say and be celebrated, and other people can say and be canceled. That's ridiculous. It's always been ridiculous. I thought it was interesting how when you saw the fans, or the fans that voted for this, a lot of the reaction from the media was, well, this shows how racist country music fans, because they wanted to prop him up. This isn't country music fans saying or anyone saying, we're glad that he used this word and this is why we're voting for him. It's not what they're doing. They're saying, we don't like you telling us who we're allowed to listen to, and you telling us who we can support and like, and you're telling us whether we can decide if someone's mistake is worth us taking them out of our Spotify playlist. And that's why we're voting for him. That's why he got it. I think that the pushback is showing how sick people are getting of cancel culture. Have you heard his music? It's great music. It's amazing. It's just also very talented. It is very hard to cancel raw talent. And you can't cancel my hair either. We can't cancel it. We also believe that people are better than their lowest moment too. We don't believe that people are in their worst moments. That's who they are. And that's the resounding message that I see here, is that people realize, real Americans realize that, yeah, he shouldn't have done that. He probably had about three, too many shots in that video. If you've actually watched it, there's no denying this. Most real people know that we are better than our worst moments. And that's the thing that's so often forgotten with cancel culture is the idea of proportionality. You don't have to think that what he said was okay. I definitely don't. To say that, hey, maybe he shouldn't deserve losing his entire career over something. And that's, it's more of a nuanced conversation that the left just never wants to have. Because, I mean, for example, you've been really harsh on Chrissy Teigen. And it's like, oh, but isn't that cancel culture? She was telling people to kill themselves, essentially. I mean, how can we compare that to someone while drunk saying something to a friend? Like a white friend. And he, and he still apologized. It wasn't even meant as a racial slur. He said it in the exact same context that rappers say it. And, and I, you know, I can't, because there's other words that you can't say, but he said it in the same context that rappers say. It's become popular to say that phrase. He said that phrase to his white friend, and suddenly he gets canceled. That just, it feels a little bit like hypocrisy. That billboard would put one person at the top of the charge for saying that, being Cardi B. And the next person's not invited to come in, you know? So, you know, that's, that is it for today. You guys can keep up with these three on social media and stick around for an exclusive interview with Teen Moms, Janelle Evans. It's the first time that she has spoken out since being canceled by MTV. You're not going to want to miss this. We'll be right back to this episode of Candace in just one second. But first, now back to the show. Welcome back. You guys may be familiar with Janelle Evans, now Janelle Evans-Eason, who spent nine years as a cast member on MTV's 16-and-Pregnant, as well as Teen Mom 2, before getting fired and essentially canceled for something that her husband did. Today, she is here to speak out in an exclusive interview for the first time since her contract with MTV ended. Please help me welcome to the show Janelle Evans-Eason. Very nice to have you here. Thank you. I was talking to you backstage and I told you that I watched Teen Mom. I watched the early Teen Mom. I don't know about the secondary people, but I watched you, I watched Farah, and it does feel like I've almost watched you grow up because you were just 16 when you got pregnant and were on the franchise. So tell me about how you ended up on the franchise. Let's start there. So basically, back to when I was pregnant, I watched Farah's first episode of 16-and-Pregnant. And I was like, I wonder if they're looking for someone else because I was 7-1's pregnant. And I just looked on MTV.com on casting calls. And you can just look up whatever shows they're about to have up. And you just applied? Yeah, you just, you write them your story, send them some pictures. They call me two days later and they wanted to meet up. Now, obviously you were a minor then. So when you applied, was the conversation between you and your mother? Was it? Yes, it was, we want to meet up with you and your mother and have lunch. And we met up with the two producers. And we had lunch and they explained to us their concept. And at that time it was 16-and-Pregnant. So then I did only one episode for 16-and-Pregnant. And then after that, they were like, we want you to join Team Mom. And I said, okay. So how many years in total nine years you've given to MTV? And this nine year comes to an end. Do you have these producers in your life for all nine years? Do you feel like you know them? Were they like your family members? Yeah, it's pretty sad to see, you know, we had such strong relationship. And now my kid's like my oldest one, Jase. He's gonna be 12 now. And he's used to like being around them all the time. He's kind of like, where do they go? What happened? Right. And so how did it happen? So you kind of were notoriously, it was all over the news. You were fired from Team Mom. And it was because you're now husband. Lisa Waite read in the press. I'm going to give you an opportunity to explain it. Shot your dog. And it went viral. The story went viral. And then they fired you. Yes. What happened? What was the background of that story? So basically me and my, it was me, my daughter, and my other two kids, and David. And we were all sitting in the living room. And you know, my daughter and the dog were having like a cute little moment. So David started filming from far away. And then all of a sudden she went to go give the dog a hug. And the dog like bitter on the face, almost in the eye. Okay. So then after that happened, you know, the day, the way David was raised, he took the dog outside and took care of it himself. My kids were inside the house at the time. Did not see anything. Did not hear anything. David didn't announce what he was doing or anything. So. So two questions I want to ask you. First you said the way he was raised. What do you mean by that? He's very country. I was raised in Pennsylvania. And then he was born and raised in the south. So like if a dog was aggressive, they would either put it down themselves. And David said, you know, if I took the dog to the Humane Society, they probably would have done the same thing because of aggression. But this was obviously very shocking. But it wasn't it you who broke the story about it though on Twitter or. Well, it wasn't me particularly. I was trying to keep it private and I wasn't trying for anybody to find out because I felt like it was more of a family matter that needed to be dealt with. But TMZ got a hold of my ex's phone call that said I heard a dog was shot in front of my son. So that 911 call on TMZ ended up public. Okay. And this was before you met you said because I didn't you say something publicly about. And then and then yes. And then after after that news came out, I was like, all right, I got to come out and explain. Say something. Yeah. So you felt like maybe you felt pressure like I need to do PR on this because this is leaking. Yeah. And I need to get out in front of it. And I need to say something that this this was scary. This happened. And of course it upset me and I angry with it and David knows and we've talked about it and he's felt bad for what he did. And you know, he's like, I wish I would have done something else. So he does definitely realize the stress it did put on our family. Right. Well, was he angry? Was it a response of like or just I'm going to go get rid of this dog because it's shot? Yeah, just kind of like, you know, this is an aggressive animal to my daughter. So I feel like this is what I need to do. And you're sort of saying that for you, he's from the south. He's from the country. This was a natural response when they bite when they, you know, bite a child. You are correct that they do put animals down for that. But they would say, it's more humane if you take it somewhere to be done. Do you think it's more humane? I do. And you know, that's why David said maybe, you know, rehoming it would have been better. And maybe someone could have worked with the dog. So I think he definitely realized that he, you know, he's apologized so much that he's like, I'm like, okay, okay, I understand, I understand. And it still hurts me to this day. And you know, it's hard to get over it, but, you know, it's slowly happening. I want to talk about your low moments. Obviously, I remember watching so many of them fights with you and your mother. You have been arrested a lot of times. How many, do you know how many times? I think I've kind of like 24. 24 times. You've been arrested 24 times. A lot of drug related charges, a lot of ignoring court order charges. You did, am I correct to say that you did have an addiction? Well, it was, oh, yes, yes, I did. Yes, I did. For about six months period in my life. And what was the drug that you were addicted to? It was heroin. Okay. So I mean, I first want to just commend you on getting over a heroin addiction because that is not easy. So I'd like to give a round of applause. Thank you. I don't think people know how hard it is to, you know, be addicted to drugs. It's one of the biggest crises that we face in America today have, you know, the opioid crisis. And so you were addicted to heroin. Were they filming you during this time? Yes, they were. And there seems to be nodding out and me thinking in that moment, I thought, no one will know a mess. No, no one will notice it. And then I look at it and I'm like, wow, I'm sitting there like nodding out. Like, this is not good. And it's a vicious cycle when you're on that drug because when you try to get off of it, you get sick and you get so sick like you have the flu that if you don't take a little bit of it, you won't feel better. And to get over it, you have to be in that sickness for like seven days. So they depicted your husband. They stopped feeling him early on based off of what they said were homophobic slurs. Yes. I guess I'll ask you plainly, is your husband homophobic? No, not at all. Okay. So where did that come about? And what was the saga behind that? So basically David never started Twitter back in 2018. And he's like, I'm going to start one. And I'm like, okay. And like, just like, you know, Twitter's crazy. He's like, all right. He's like, I'm up for it. And then one fan asked some, you know, would you want your children around transgender people? And he said, he replied and said, if you lay down with dogs, you get fleas. And everybody got mad. Everybody, you know, a lot of fans reached out and were mad at MTV for having them on. And MTV did not call David, did not text him. They just posted a public tweet saying David is let go and fired. Okay. So what he meant by that sentiment, obviously it's an expression, if you lay down with dogs, you get fleas. Yes. Basically, David's very Christian. And he believes in God. So to him, that didn't seem homophobic. The right said it. Right. So he just doesn't want his children hanging out. And they said, transgender people or transgender children, like transgender people, like older people. And he's like, no, I don't want one. Basically he doesn't want his kids exposed. Yeah. Listen, I don't want my kid at, you know, drag. What is it? Drag time. Exactly. Yeah, absolutely not. And I think maybe he wasn't eloquent in stating that. But yeah, I think his choice of words were very wrong. But yeah, they probably thought that he was saying that trans people are dogs, but it's actually an expression. Exactly. Okay. So he's not homophobic, but at the same time, he's not sending his kids to drag queen story time. Exactly. Okay. I would say I'm not sending my kids there either. So that was the reason that he got fired. Yes. Okay. And so. And that was in 2018. Then the dog incident happened a year later in 2019. I do kind of want to talk a little bit about your relationship with your mother, because that was something that really played out. I mean, I can hear the sound of your mother's voice screaming now. Like, I mean, like it was always that was the thing that was going on between Janelle and Barbara, Janelle and Barbara. At this current moment, do you and your mother have a relationship? We basically talked just to co-parent with Jace. She has custody of your oldest son that we saw grow up on the show. Yes. And we're going through a pending custody battle right now. And, you know, I filed and we're currently going through that. So we were getting up. We were getting along up to the point for like two years up until like this past December. And, you know, my son's behavior just hasn't been the best vaguely. And I filed because nothing was being done about it. And now she's completely like just cut me off. Now, why does your son, why does your mother have custody of your son? Is it because was when you were on drugs and she filed for her? No, actually, it was back when I was, I just had Jace. He was 10 months old. And my mom told me, you should go out, hang out with your friends. I'll watch your son. Like, just go hang out. I feel bad that you've been home so much. I'm like, okay. So I went overnight, hung out with my friends, came back home. CPS was in my driveway. Okay. So then CPS got involved and was like, if you don't give your child to your mom, he's going to go and foster care just because I couldn't financially take care of him. Okay. And that's how old were you when that happened? 17. Okay. So she's had custody of him for eight years? Yeah. And then in 2015, I filed to take her back to court. And that didn't, that wasn't heard till two years later in 2017. So then finally, the custody order that was originally in place when Jace was first given to my mom was anything Barbara says goes. And any, any lawyer found that kind of crazy because I didn't look it over. And I didn't have a lawyer at the time. So I was sitting there like, well, what do I do? And I was scared. So I'm like, all right, sign it to my mom. And my mom's like, you know what, I'll give you custody back one day when you get your life together. And it's, I've just been waiting on that and try not to fight her about it. And it's never happened. Okay. So you want custody of your son? Oh, yeah. I've always wanted custody. And you have you have three children in total. Jace is with your mother. Yes. You have two, two more children. You have a daughter and a son. Yes, Kaiser and Enzley. Yes. Yeah. And so you have custody of both of them. And then we also have custody, full custody of David's daughter Marissa. Okay. 14. So you have three kids with you. Yes. And things are going well. I mean, I've seen your Instagram, it looks like that you guys were happy family and yet you can't get your son back. Yeah, it's just a constant like when we went back to court in 2017, the judge said, all right, well, there wasn't any visitation in place from the beginning. So we're going to put visitation in place. And then maybe in the future, we'll change it. So it's been a constant battle of trying to prove myself. So once again, this is something that you did when you were a teenager. And now how old are you? 29. You're 29 years old. And you don't, you don't get a chance to grow up because you made so many decisions when you were young. And you kind of couldn't look ahead. Yeah. That's a horrible thing, I think, to really go through. It was always kind of like high school drama. Yeah, exactly. So what is the future for you? It's an interesting thing when you grow up in the public sphere, right? MTV kicks you to the curb and says, okay, no more. How do you pivot your life away from being on TV? What is the future for Janelle Evans, Easton look like? Well, right now I'm looking into possibly producing things and kind of not being in front of the camera, but behind the camera. And I have a lot of ideas that weren't heard when I would film with MTV. So I just want to be involved in, you know, editing. I've always wanted to be a film editor ever since I've been in like in third grade. So that's kind of like my passion. So possibly that I'm open to talk to any networks now that, you know, I'm out of contract about filming my family life again, but it would have to be. I would like to have a say so in the approval. Yeah. What's interesting, you had brought up to me backstage that and you are correct that there's a lot of other kind of really violent things that happen on team mom, and they don't seem to have the same consequence. And most recently, you know, I know Amber Portwood, she also was very young. So she was a child constantly hitting, you know, her then boyfriend on recently she got into another mix up which involved a weapon. Yes. Machete. Yes. And she still has her contract. I feel like if they think if they do get rid of Amber, their ratings might go lower and they don't want to get rid of the original. They need the yeah, they need the originals because I hear a lot of fans come up to me like, where all these new people I can't keep up. I'm like, I don't know. I don't watch it anymore. So, right? So would you go back if they offered you a chance to go back onto the network? Would you go back? I'm open to opportunities, probably not the same show, but I'm open to talking to any networks, like I said, and we would have to have long discussions. Yeah. Yeah. And what would be one thing that you hope that young girls that have watched you have seen all of the strife, have seen all the drama, have seen the boyfriends, have seen the drug addiction, have seen you, you know, leave the network and now you are a mother. What would you hope that they learned from you? I think they, I hope they learned from all my mistakes. And I hope they learn that don't let anybody take advantage of you either. And you can get over it if you've been through some like, if you've been through as many traumatic things as me, you can get over anything. I feel like I'm very happy to see you. You seem like you're, you're very healthy now and I'm glad that you made it through the pain of really having to grow up in public. So, ladies and gentlemen, Janelle Evans, thank you.
