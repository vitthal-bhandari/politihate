    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Welcome in hour number three. Tuesday edition Clay Travis Buck Sexton Show. 14 days out, we've got a couple of different stories that are worth diving into here. First of all, reports from Bloomberg that Elon Musk will officially be closing on his acquisition of Twitter by Friday of this week. This is, this is a story I understand that a lot of you out there, like I don't care about Twitter, I don't care about social media, I do believe it's a really significant win for those of us who care about the First Amendment, the marketplace of ideas and just not a algorithmically rigged system that constantly puts our ideas and our arguments on the back foot against left-wing ideals because at a minimum, I believe Elon Musk is going to create a forum where everyone is on equal footing. And Buck, I believe that's a really big deal. This is a conversation that's been going on since when did Musk make his offer for Twitter? Was it back in April? I feel like the $54.20 offer. I feel like it was basically back in April. So now we have gone through a lot of storms and tribulations and trials across this process. And it appears based on this Bloomberg report that even will be officially taking possession of Twitter on Friday. Company will cease to trade publicly shortly thereafter or at that moment when he purchases the company become a private company. And Buck, one of the things I'm fascinated by is how quickly will left-wingers who have been arguing for years when you and I and people like us would say our opinions have been throttled, people are getting banned who don't deserve to be banned. They would always say what, it's a private company. If you don't like it, leave or found your own company, it's amazing how quickly their arguments have pivoted to. Well, this is a real threat to democracy that Elon Musk could be taking could be buying Twitter. Oh, of course. And in fact, they've gone from as we've discussed, Elon Musk can never be allowed to buy Twitter to Elon Musk Musk by Twitter. How dare you try to back out of the deal to trust me, everybody. If in fact, this transaction goes through as planned, they'll be saying, Oh, no, Elon Musk has bought Twitter. This is terrible. This is because the left, the Democrats, their perpetual mouth contents. This is honestly, it's a defining characteristic. They're just generally unhappy people, not saying all of them, but generally overall, they're dissatisfied with existence as it is, which is why they fall for and push all these utopian fantasies. And among the utopian fantasies was, if we only listen to Fauci, little Fauci, I found out today that apparently Holy Cross University has named a science building after I heard about this, they should call it the anti science building, little Fauci and the rest. If we only listen to them play, we were all going to be safe and be smart and we're so cool and we're hip and COVID's not going to get us wasn't true at all. But there's some pushback coming from New York that you brought to my attention. Yeah, look, this is good news. And I feel like a lot of times we need to make sure that we pause and actually take advantage of good news and also praise those who are helping to make this good news happen. So I'm reading from Marina Medvin, who has done a really good job on a lot of this January 6 nonsense. Constrained lawyer, Marina does good stuff. Yeah. Yeah. She, she is sharing this. And I've got the opinion pulled up as well. But I want to make sure I give her credit for what I'm reading. The New York State Supreme Court has reinstated all fired unvaccinated employees, ordered back pay, says the state violated rights, acted both in an arbitrary and capricious manner and says, quote, being vaccinated does not prevent an individual from contracting or transmitting COVID-19. Now, from this opinion, when you say Supreme Court, in most states, that means the top court in the state, the Supreme Court of New York is actually lower level courts. So sometimes that confuses people. So I want to make it clear that this opinion will almost certainly be appealed. But it has just come out and it is a absolute win. I bet this judge has occasionally, has occasionally listened to the clay and buckshow because many of the arguments that he is making here are ones that we have been arguing for a very long time. And, and this opinion, if it were upheld, would mean that everyone who was fired would be able to get their jobs back with back pay as we have argued for a long, long time. And the judge here is the honorable Ralph Porzio, who issued this opinion that is currently out there. And so this is a big deal. Buck, well, it shows if nothing else, it will show, I should say, that this is, this is going to be, unfortunately, I think, overturned on appeal, which is confusing because it's a Supreme Court, but the appeals court for the state of New York is above the state Supreme Court of New York. It will be overturned most likely. There's a lot of money at stake now in this, by the way. Yeah. This is, this would be a, this would be a big settlement. They fired thousands and thousands of people. So start thinking about the, the firing and then also would this open up individual, could the individuals then sue for, you know, I don't, usually you sue for emotional distress, you get laughed at a court, but you know, they may be, there might be broader legal implications. But Clay, what, you know what they're going to do here? I'll make a, I'll make a prediction on this one that I'm very confident about. The appeals court will eventually fall on. It doesn't matter. And, and, and there's a couple of things here. It doesn't matter if the science that we used to push the policy was wrong. The appeals court for New York with lib judges are going to say, we had the authority to do this. You defied our authority. Therefore, it doesn't matter. If essentially, look, we burned some witches, turns out they weren't witches, but we had a right to burn witches. Like that is going to be the argument that you're going to see made in the court. Now that's one part of this on a broader level. Cause we say that anybody lost their job anywhere, certainly in government service and national guard, etc. I think this should be the first bill that Republicans introduce in the house and Senate when they take it back. Absolutely. But even beyond that, I caution everybody to thinking, cause I think right now there's a little bit, we kind of guffaw and I look, I'm guilty of it too. You know, when they're saying, oh, you mean that learning loss was really bad in schools? Oh, we have this mentality because we are people who live in reality and are accountable, right? You and I do a show every day. We're accountable for what we say. Our audience is full of people who are accountable for their beliefs and their actions. They hold themselves accountable. That's not how libs operate. You will see a Stalinist rewriting of history underway right now. They don't care how absurd it is. They don't care that it's not true. The whole point is they think they have the power to create a narrative that erases all of their misdeeds in time and makes them the heroes of this clay. They're going to do it unless people call them out and stop them. I'm glad you brought that up because they're already doing it. In fact, 53 year historic decline in test scores. What did the White House say yesterday? Karine Jean Pierre blamed Donald Trump for students historic drop in test scores. And a lot of you out there are like, what? What do you? Yes, she really said this. This is not like months ago or years ago. This is yesterday in the White House, the person to blame for schools being shut down, even though they remain shut down for much of the early days of the Biden administration. It's Donald Trump. Listen to cut 23 here. When the president walked into this administration, it was a top priority for him to safely reopen schools. And he did that. And let's not forget when he walked into this administration, the COVID response was incredibly mismanaged by the former administration and couldn't and he understood it because just because it was managed. It could not that action could not come at the expense of our children. So he said he'd get to work. And the first step was reopening schools, which he did. It was about 46% of schools were open. And in short period of time, we were able to open schools fully in just a few months after the president walked into the administration. Isn't that just that's just makes me see with rage hearing that because that is what this is the beginning salvo. This is the opening of the massive rewriting of the Democrat Fauciite apparatus being authoritarian lunatics who were triple masking and like washing their hands every three seconds and shutting down businesses and six feet of social distancing and put little kids in plastic containers in the classroom to keep them safe, cut holes in the masks of the people in the band, all that crazy that we made fun of, which is actually the initial meeting of clay. I don't remember. I claim I met each other really because we're two people who are like this masking is crazy. And there weren't that many of us. They're we're not that many of us in April of 2020. And and we sit here and we hear this. And I just want to remind everybody as crazy as it is clay, the Democrat party is the party of slavery, of Jim Crow, of segregation. And somehow the history that is taught out with the Democrats or the party of civil rights, equal rights, freedom and dignity for all all people in America. People forget that the Democrats were the party of all those things. They have this whole thing of Oh, the party switched. You know, they talk about the party switch and all. No, no, the Democrat legacy is those following things as a party. But somehow they've just, you know, wave the magic wand and the history doesn't really reflect that anymore. And you might think Corinne Jean Pierre is like, okay, she's off on her own island as she often is making poor arguments. Now, this is what Fauci is saying now to Buck. Fauci is out there arguing I never said to shut down schools. And you can literally play audio clips of him saying, yeah, I advise for the schools to be shut down. And Randy Winegarden yesterday, Buck, the head of the teachers union, when these data points came out, we had a 50 year plus decline in school learning. She tweeted, I can't believe she even has the audacity to do this. These results show the pandemic's grave impact on student achievement and the urgency and importance of supporting teachers to create the safe and welcoming and academically rich environments that kids need to recover and thrive. She shut down the schools with her cohorts in the teachers unions. She caused this. And now she's arguing, oh, the pandemic's grave impact. No, no, no, note what they are saying. They're trying to show that they had no choice. We always had a choice. And the Democrats chose to shut down the country and shut down schools. And now we are reaping what all of us, many of us in this audience, certainly what you and I argued, Buck, would happen when they decided to shut down these schools. And now where they had like, who could have ever known this happened? You know, you know, you know, who had no learning loss, Sweden, you know, who had far less learning loss in this country compared to blue states like New York and California, Florida, because there were decisions that were made here. And these people who made the decisions are just completely incapable of facing up to their wrongness. You know, have you seen, for example, we're in Rachel Maddow, has she ever done? Because one of one of her clips about how basically the virus stops with you, like you won't get it, you won't spread it, it stops with you. Did a whole monologue on that? I mean, if I'm wrong, by all means someone correct me. Has this individual who's paid $30 million a year by MSNBC to speak to an audience of people who think they're so much smarter clay than you and me? They're not. But has she ever come out and said, I'm sorry, I got that so catastrophically wrong? I've seen one person, a personal trainer in Australia with a following on fitness. He has said, I'm sorry, I got this so horrifically wrong on the vaccines. I never should have been fooled by those imbeciles who are in authority. My bad. I have seen no one else do that. Have you? No, I haven't because they're all going to pretend we had no options and the pandemic caused this. It wasn't a choice, which is why this has to be a reckoning in two weeks. There are many issues, that the Biden administration has failed on. But don't forget about COVID. Don't let your mom and dad friends out there who were super fired up last year about this, forget who created this massive learning loss, make them suffer the consequences of their wrongness. This is what the essence of democracy is holding your leaders accountable for the judgments and the choices that they made and whether that's made your life better or worse. You see that Biden's a prayer. We got to come back to this. Breaking news about Biden clay will just say that and it ties into what we're saying. I don't even know what it is yet, but I know what a good look. Have you taken the time to read Jordan Peterson's book 12 rules for life in it? Peterson teaches us great things like taking personal responsibility. It's not always popular, especially with the left wing in this country. It's best way to live a good life.

Not one, not two, not three, not four. Five shots is the magic number for Joe Biden who just rolled up his sleeve on TV and he's like, not a joke. Shot number five is great. Shot number six. Gonna feel amazing. Shot number seven. It's like you see God from the mountaintop shot number eight. Nirvana. I mean, Clay, it's just getting crazier and crazier. And I just want to point out, I mean, this isn't just old man Biden who look is it? I what he is in a higher risk category. The guy's 80 years old. The shots don't really work though. So it's like, what do you really even do it? I mean, might work for him for a month or two. What they always forgotten the pandemic is okay. So you're just going to get COVID month three, everybody, right? It doesn't, it doesn't really have the impact. They think it does. But we got the White House COVID response coordinator, Dr. Jha. He's telling Clay, he's telling everybody, look, he just got to get the shot every year, play 18 during a very different place in this pandemic. And what that means is that we can gather safely again. People can get together for the holidays. People don't have to take the same level of precautions that we did in 2020. But people should do it smartly and safely. You know, I get vaccinated every year for influenza. I actually have to because my hospital where I used to work required it getting a shot once a year. That's for flu for most Americans, COVID shots now once a year. I think if people did that, they really don't have to think about this as much. They can get through the holiday season safely. And it's a new way of being. And I think it's something that most Americans are I've been willing to do with influenza. And I suspect we'll be willing to do with COVID as well. Yeah, I'm never getting another COVID shot again. Just to be real clear. And like millions of other people listening to this are saying, yeah, never. I never got one. And it's one of the things that I'm happiest that I made the choice not to get one. But if that had been the pitch for a couple of years, think about how different of a place America would be in. If they had come out not last year and said you'll never get COVID again, you'll never spread it. If they had just said, Hey, we think it's smart for you to get these shots. They're going to be yearly like the flu shot. You don't have to do it. But we really encourage people to do it. Think about how much different America would be. That's actually what a unifying president would have done. He wouldn't have threatened to fire everyone who didn't get the shots. He wouldn't have told us all that we were living in a winter of death. The Democrats wouldn't have been gleefully exulting every time somebody who didn't get the COVID shot got COVID and died. We'd be a totally different country. But instead they sold us a false bill of goods. And now they're essentially telling us what you weren't even allowed to say. It's basically the flu. It's basically the flu. That's where we are. A lot of old people get it get sick. And that's probably going to happen with COVID too. I know a lot of people in this audience are going to get hit up for any number of contributions that just happened. There are a lot of really worthy causes out there. But is there a more worthy cause than a life of an unborn child who cannot speak up for themselves? There's an organization that looks after the life of those unborn children called preborn pregnancy clinics. This nationwide organization has rescued hundreds and thousands of babies by introducing them to their mothers on an ultrasound and creating that divine connection. Their goal this fall, our goal with them is to rescue 40,000 unborn babies. One ultrasound is just $28 and through a match your gift is doubled. Any gift will help and all donations are tax deductible. If you have the means, would you consider a leadership gift? $7,500 will be matched to place an ultrasound machine in a needy center which could save countless babies lives. Preborn's mission is so critical. Dial pound 250 from your cell phone. Say the keyword baby. That's pound 250 and say the keyword baby. Let's welcome back in clay Travis, Fox, X and show appreciate all of you hanging out with us as we roll through the Tuesday edition of the program. We've been talking about how we want to have a lot of different people from a variety of states involved in battleground elections. And it's a really good sign that there are now battleground elections starting in Rhode Island in New York and California and Oregon and Washington places where legitimately Republicans are going to have very good chances to win. And we are joined now by Matt Jacobs. He's a congressional candidate in California. It's 26th district. He's a former US assistant attorney, counterterrorism prosecutor. Very close race. Matt, tell us about what your district looks like, what people are discussing and what you need to bring this back home to a Republican district. Absolutely. Thank you so much for having me. So I heard the pleasure of running in a very common sense middle of the road district. And I'll tell you, it doesn't matter what your political affiliation is here. People can't stand what's happening. We are seeing record high gas and grocery prices. We're seeing soaring crime rates here. And I'll tell you, that's why when I'm out on the campaign trail, I see people in dependence, even rational Democrats saying, hey, it's time for a change. And I'll tell you, an analogy I love is that, you know, we're all on an airplane together. Some of us are on the left side of the aisle. Some of us are on the right. But everyone knows that the people flying the plane are not doing a great job these days. So when people come up to you, there's this recognition of what's going on in California, I just I just have to wonder, do they have they not seen enough? I mean, if anyone is not sold yet, like, what are they waiting to see when you've got a state that is hemorrhaging people that has cities in disrepair and massive increases in recent years in a whole and all manner of crime. And I saw some statistic about basically, if you own a bicycle in San Francisco, is like 50% chance it's been stolen from you in the last couple of years. I mean, just crazy numbers that are going on. What else has to happen? I mean, I'm just wondering, what do independence do they they just so used to voting maybe for Democrats that they're worried about what it feels like to switch to the other side? I mean, just tell us. So I think there's a reckoning coming and the pendulum is going to swing 14 days from now, because here in California, we've seen the disaster that single party Democrat rule has been in our state. And now people nationwide are seeing that on on a national scale. And I'll tell you there are specific examples. San Francisco has under 10%. Yet they recalled the extreme radical DA a few months back. And I'll tell you, we are the richest state in the richest country in the world. And we're not allowed to water our lawn anymore. We're not allowed to use electricity between 4 and 9 PM or we're told to limit it. Look, these are third world type things going on here. I think people are realizing that there's just total incompetence at the state level, and they're looking and they're ready for a change. I don't think there's any doubt. And Matt, can you tell people out there where your district is? A lot of people know the LA area. I think you're born and raised in the area that you're running in. And what is it about this particular cycle that you think has got people in your in your region fired up? Absolutely. I am running in Ventura County, which is the county north of LA. Our district covers nearly all of Ventura County and a sliver of Los Angeles County as well. You know, like I was born and raised here, I left for about 10 years. I was a federal prosecutor. My job was to go after some of our country's worst enemies and most dangerous criminals, including child sex traffickers, mafia boss, defense no-dealers, and high level Al Qaeda terrorists. Now, I'll tell you, I came back here. I'm living where I grew up with my wife and our three amazing children. And I started to sense what everyone here is feeling that the far left was taking this community and this country in a very bad direction. So, you know, I decided to throw my hat in the ring and my opponent is exactly the problem. She's a 30 year career politician who votes 100% of the time with Pelosi and Biden. And I'll tell you a claim buck. She notices she sees that people are being turned off. That's why she's pretending with her messaging to be a moderate, but voters aren't that foolish. They understand what they've been getting from the far left. And like I said, they are ready for a common sense change. What is the we're speaking to Matt Jacobs is running for Congress in California's 26th, just north of Los Angeles. I'm curious, man, what is the messaging from your opponent? Is it just January 6th and abortion or it just feels like this stage of the game, economy, crime, border, Democrats don't even seem to have a counter argument to offer. They're just yell about the insurrection and and women's bodies not having the patriarchy in charge. You're 100% right. And look, when I was a prosecutor, we had an expression. When the defense attorneys could not argue the facts and could not argue the law, their strategy was to distract. And that is exactly what my opponent is doing. She is completely ignoring inflation and record high cost of living. That's really hurting people. She's completely ignoring the skyrocketing crime rates. She's completely ignoring an open and lawless border. That's seeing a total influx of dangerous fentanyl. She's completely ignoring the learning loss that happened in our schools. And she's focusing on these issues that appeal to her base. And I'll tell you, you know, to me, the Constitution is sacrosanct. I always wanted to serve this country. And when I'm out there, you know, I'm not I'm talking to everyone with the same message. This is about individual liberty and limited government, three enterprise and equality of opportunity. And everyone deserves, you know, the opportunity to achieve their American dream. And sadly, that dream has become as input for how to reach for many people because of Pelosi and Biden and politicians like my opponent. Matt, if anyone wants to help out with your Matt Jacobs Congressional campaign, where should they go? My website is Matt Jacobs for Congress.com. That's f o r Congress.com. And I'll tell you, you know, we have outraised the incumbent Democrat. Never happened before. We have a brand new Matt polling shows a dead heat. She has the Pelosi machine coming in with the cavalry now. But this our campaign is a grassroots operation. So every dollar matters, whether it's five or $10. Every step will go to flipping this seat, firing Pelosi and getting our country back on track. Matt Jacobs, everybody, good luck to you, Matt. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Thank you.

Get your Mantis X at Mantis the letter X dot com. That's M-A-N-T-I-S X dot com. Welcome back to Clay Travis and Buck's X and show. We we had a brief moment, Clay. We talked about this just before we we had on Mr. Jacobs from California running for Congress there. Biden, you know, just got shot number five. We think it could be six. Who knows? I can't even keep up anymore. I remember the whole two shot thing in the beginning was supposed to be because you get two and you're done. Remember that? I never got the two. I got the one and done, which turned out to be the one and thank you for wasting your time entirely. This shot was a joke. But here you have Biden being asked about New York dropping the vaccine mandate. I guess that's for private. You know, I can't even keep up with all this stuff now for private businesses. Do you think it's a mistake for New York to drop the vaccine mandate? So kind of plural there from this. Here is how Biden responds. Play 34. It's a local judgment. Well, that's so interesting because 12 months ago, just a year back, Biden was saying and enacted by federal fiat of the executive branch using OSHA, a federal vaccine mandate for a vaccine that didn't do what it was supposed to do. That's also buck a poor question. Not going to surprise anybody that I'm not that enamored of White House press corps. But the more interesting question is, what do you think about the New York Supreme Court case that came down today, which said everyone who lost their job over the COVID shot mandate should get their job back with back pay. Now, I don't know that Joe Biden could even answer that question. Frankly, Biden can barely answer, you know, what ice cream are you eating right now questions? But the New York City mandates, I believe, but first of all, it's been announced for a long time. And I think what happens on November 1st is the private business mandate is officially gone. That's my understanding. Like, but that's still a ways away. And it's been out there for a long time, the bigger decision in New York by far. And here's what I would say in general about the Biden clip we just played as well as the New York case we discussed. This just feels to me, Buck, like more inability to come up with a closing argument. Because I don't think Democrats are going to be super excited to run to the polls because Joe Biden told them to get a fifth COVID shot. And I also think it's crazy that the Biden administration decided to have this tick tock influencer who is a man who has decided to identify as a woman. This is one of the clips that the person who interviewed Joe Biden in the White House has been sharing. It's a little bit shocking. It's a little bit jarring because it's so crazy. But I think it's important for a lot of you out there who may have friends who were in your 60s and 70s. And you voted, they vote for Bill Clinton Democrats because they just have done it their whole lives. I'd like for you to play them the clip and say, do you really think that this is what you want your grandkids to be hearing? Listen to this. And we're this outfit shopping today. And I thought that these might be my new shopping shorts. But I was walking around and everyone was staring and I was like, Oh, okay, what's going on? And they were all staring directly at my crotch. And I went, Oh, I forgot that my crotch doesn't look like other women's crotches sometimes because mine doesn't look like a little Barbie pocket. And I thought, okay, Dylan, you have some options here. Number one, you can stop wearing clothes that fit like this and just find looser fitting items. Number two, I can do a talk, which is going to have to be a whole other video, but it's very painful and involved above. Or number three, I just normalize it and I wear clothes like this. And we all just normalize women having bulges sometimes that bowl just call the penis. I just want to be really clear. That's what that is called. Yes. This is who is doing individual is saying people think it's strange because I'm wearing super skin tight shorts that show my male genitalia and they're looking at it and they're thinking that's inappropriate. So maybe we can just get more people to make sure that you can see the outlines of their penises while they are saying that they are women and will make this normal. That is what is going on here for all the blue dog Democrat voters out there endorsed. This is endorsed by Joe Biden in the White House. So I think this is and look, last night buck, when I was getting ready for bed, my wife, I played this video and she said, don't share that. And she said, because it's just bringing more attention to this person. And I said, I understand that argument and there may be some of you out there right now who just heard that video and you're like, why would you play that? I think it's important to understand what Joe Biden is endorsing as we come down the home stretch here of the the midterms. He believes that your kids or grandkids, if they are 14 years old, it's immoral of you to say to them, Hey, I don't think you should get your genitals cut off and change your gender. You are being immoral by making that argument. Did you ever have this? Wasn't there like a sesame street thing? Like which of these things is not like the other? I remember also when I was like, yeah, yeah, second, third grade, you would you would pick out like, which one of which one of these sleds is different from the, you know, you just it was like pattern and that basic pattern analysis or or picking out something it didn't fit with where's Waldo trying to find where Waldo is. Yeah, we're looking for pattern analysis and recognition. I want to just submit this for the record for everybody out there. What is strange about this headline, which was in the Daily Mail over the weekend moment transgender singer strips naked on live TV and plays the keyboard with her penis. What part of that strikes you as a little odd everybody? I'm just wondering, I'm wondering if maybe you're picking up on the final part of that sentence and saying, this is what it has come to to the point you said earlier, I can understand also like not wanting to fan the flames of the crazy. Yeah, but but this is actually not fringe is the point. Clay. This is official Democrat left dogma now that somebody could play the piano with her penis is official Democrat dogma. And if you don't, if you have a problem with that, you are the problem. And again, this is in the final closing days, how many actual women out there work in journalism and will never get the opportunity to interview the president of the United States, Joe Biden picked that person to be in the people's house interviewing him to make the case for why Democrats should get votes. And let me just also point this out. A lot of you out there are getting ready for Halloween. Monday, like I do, you got kids, you're going to be out trick or treating everything else. Democrats, and I saw this on social media and I wanted to share it. Democrats believe that if your kid, your six year old dresses up like a cowboy and an Indian, right? Where's a headdress that that is unacceptable cultural appropriation. If you're white, black, Asian, Hispanic, if you're somebody who's not Native American, right? Unacceptable. Yet they believe it's heroic for people to dress up all the time and pretend that they are a different gender than the one that they actually are. Reconcile that duality for me with for anyone with a functional brain. It treats womanhood as a costume to be domed and discarded at will. And this is Democrat dogma right now. Look, folks, we stay on it. We will not shy away from this or any important discussions going on in this country. And have more on the elections for you, obviously, tomorrow. We're trying to stay laser focused, but really, you know, it's on our people. It's on them all across the country, not just to vote themselves, not just to donate if they can to their favorite candidate, politicians, but to get somebody else to get five other people if they can, to help push these candidates over the line."
