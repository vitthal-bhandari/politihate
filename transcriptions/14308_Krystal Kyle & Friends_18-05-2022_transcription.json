    "text": " And we're back with an all new episode of Keep It. I'm Iron Madison III. I'm Louis Fertel and on Zoom today I am wearing, for some reason, a white sweatshirt. I bought at some Baravan. It has MGM on it. But the lighting here is also bright white. So I look like I'm in some, I'm trying out for some low budget Emily Dickinson movie or something. You always look like Casper. Okay, but today it's looking like literary Casper. So I look like I'm writing poems to myself that I'm shoving in a cabinet. All right. Emily Dickinson today, that's you. That's you. You know what? But not not not Emily Dickinson that gets on Hulu. Is that what network that's on? No, it's on Apple, baby. I truly am not good at getting those organized. Dickinson's cute. It's Haley Steinfeld. I've seen season one. She's a fucking great actress. Yeah. I saw season one also. Yes. And you know, it's it's trippy. I here's the thing. I'm not I'm not really watching anything on Apple. Unfortunately, you something? Unfortunately, I because I don't know if this is just because of the sheer amount of television there is so many shows. I just need one season of like I will watch girls five ever, but it's sort of like I got what I wanted out of this show already. So I don't need to continue with it. This is a mental block I have with a lot of television right now. You know, you get the initial log line, which you can tell why it's sold and it's very good. And then you watch the show and then we're done. You know, I guess this is why we have the event of the limited series is that because you think that these shows are too half serialized, like they're not they're not like if girls five ever was just sitcom each week, like it was the same thing, like a Frazier, you know, like I feel like we have I feel like we have a dearth of those shows on TV. Yeah. But and of course, then we'll just get those rebooted too. So there's too much of everything. Okay. No, I mean, I think I said this before I miss a miss the era of you just tune in you laugh. I feel like that's why people like have an elementary. It's you know, it's lightly serialized to keep up with a narrative. Yeah. You could sort of just pop in whenever, you know, and I think I think we need literally more sitcoms. It's what I miss. I just want someone to say bazinga at me. And then I go to sleep from 7 30 p.m. to 7 30 a.m. Yeah. You know, we just need Neopatric Harris pretending to be straight, making misogynistic jokes. Can I say something about Neopatric Harris? I root for his actually evil turn where he hosts like an Ellen's game of games type thing and it's like, cause I feel like he's one of these people who gaze in particular like, all right, we've had enough of you or whatever. And I would like him to revolt against that and just become like like the nightmare gay in pop culture. Well, so you know, I was a writer and producer on Neopatric Harris's upcoming show on couple, which is Darren Star's new show. This is first time playing gay and staying alive. Okay. If you're if you're if you're if you're an a multi hyphenate, a multi hyphenate show that viruses like ghostface, all right. Okay. You get a phone call and it's like what's your favorite scary movie long time? The normal heart, absolutely terrifying. Yeah, Julia Julia slide in that. Yeah. So it's not his first time playing gay, but you know, he's playing gay in a romantic comedy sitcom, you know. And I think people will be interested in how good he is in it. And just sort of how like it's something new for him. He's he's also by the way, very good in into the woods, which I saw this weekend at New York City on course. Oh, right. Of course he's in it. Yeah. It was only a two week run, which I feel like people always forget about New York City Center on course, because it's always just sort of like a two week run of, you know, a revival of sort of like a show that we haven't seen, you know, in years or something like Billy Porter directed a revival of the life, which felt like the death. But into the I love when you become somebody who wrote for Variety in 1947. Baby, the show, the show should have stayed dead. Let's just say that. Okay. There we go. This office was not bomb. The life I saw no signs of it. I don't, I'm going to stop beating this show to death. I wish you would beat it to life. Yeah. So on today's show, we're going to interview for the hell of it, another fucking legend. Sometimes when these people pop into the zoom, I run I basically exchange a look, which you can't really do over zoom, but Sissy Spacek showed up and it was like, what is happening? Sissy Spacek is here. Oscar winner legend, coal miners, daughter. I mean, there's plenty of things we can say about Sissy Spacek when we get into those today. We also for the hell of it, investigate a couple of Sissy Spacek blind spots we have. I watched the straight story and three women. What did you watch? I watched Badlands and oh, great. Wildly enough, I watched in the bedroom for the first time. Oh, I'm sure you lived. I did. There are some moments in that. I did. And of course we get into in the bedroom with Sissy's too. If you've not seen Todd Fields 2001 masterpiece recently, you will be doing that after this podcast. And then also we're going to get into Eurovision because, you know, gay people be talking and singing and singing. You said that like Michigan. Coming up next, Sarah Michelle Gower and Courtney Cox. But first, a jig. Yes. All right, we'll be back with more people. On Saturday, the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 held its final performances in Italy. And the winner was Ukraine with the song, Stepania, performed by Parappa the Rapper. Did you know that it's the first song ever with quote unquote hip hop elements to win Eurovision, which sounds like when you hear, oh, there's finally a female Latin cast member on us. And I like how is that possible? Hip hop elements. I'm using air quotes because this truly was like Cypress Hill, esque 90s white men wrapping elements. I was going to say that is that is actually generous. I was going to say snow and former is giving a lickie boom. Uh, the UK Spain, Sweden and Serbia around it out the top five. And let's just get this out of the way. Spain sure was robbed. And I have had it. Okay. That girl was. She now heard it. Chanel. I have had it with pussy poppin gay. I have thumbs getting to the top three on Eurovision and not winning. I feel the same way about Eurovision that most people allegedly feel about the Oscars, which is the thing I love never wins. Like I'm watching it and I'm like, Oh, we're all, we all love this, you know, gay ass pop music, right? And then gay comes in fourth. Yeah. You know, I get upset. And then then then it's this weird reminder that like straight Europeans love Eurovision too. Which is sick. Yeah. And so they're not voting for the best. Chanel. Um, I mean, this is we should say about this Chanel woman. So Spain's entry is this woman who is mostly an actress in Spain. And she, of course, like maybe most Spain entries in Eurovision is dressed in like a spangled leotard with like a light matador touch in the coat. You can picture it. And the song itself is giving a pussy cat. Yeah, it reminds me of, uh, it's like if they had a follow up single to react, which of course they didn't. Yeah. Um, COVID sort of killed the pussy cat dolls, didn't they? Like they, right. They, they, they like Oliver and company. They're out in the streets. Yeah. Curiosity did not kill the pussy cat dolls. It was COVID. Um, I'm actually friends with this Canadian pop singer Maggie Zabo who wrote the song for Chanel and, um, it is, it is an anthem and it reminds me, uh, you know, the last, um, Eurovision contest, a lady for real for Cyprus, um, who had that song Fuego. If you remember that song, yeah, it's great. Like, like the days keep getting songs to be obsessed with and yet we're denied. Boy by Netta. That was one that won. That was for us. There are occasions, you know, and of course, Waterloo by ABBA is the definitive Eurovision winner. Toy is a very good gay pop song, but also toy beat Fuego. So you know, they can't all have the pussy popper. Then, um, you know, the, the song with the, um, message behind it, which is I'm not your toy, not your toy. Which, you know, we've learned about that in grade score. And I would rather have both of those than a pussy parappa, which I just explained earlier. Uh, cool. Parappa the rapper. What an amazing reference from PlayStation one. Waterloo, the lyric in it, the, the finally facing my Waterloo as in just the idea of, uh, of this person I'm obsessed with is my water. It's such a sweet sentiment. It's such an all time great, um, analogy. Uh, so I think it's a good definitive winner for Eurovision to have. Sweden this year, speaking of which, uh, the girl who performed, she got in the top five or so. And her song was fine and catchy. She herself was so styled exactly Swedish and yet also was a hybrid of Julian Hoth and Kaylee Kawoko that she was exactly unmemorable. Hmm. You know, it is worth mentioning that the Sam writer from the UK actually top the jury's scoreboard, um, but was overtaken by the Ukraine when the public votes were added, which this was kind of expected to be honest. I thought Ukraine was going to win Eurovision anyway, because I mean, they're being invaded by Russia. Uh, and of course. Also, it's not that the song is unlistening up. Yeah. It's not a catchy or anything. There are good pop music elements to it, but I thought it was a very competitive year. Otherwise, you know, like the, the top five all stand out in certain ways, even like Serbia, I enjoyed. Um, yeah. So, uh, it's just, it's interesting. If we're talking about the best of the best, it's weird that it ended up at number one. Yeah. I mean, not to be crass, but it's giving sympathy and Paola. Yeah. Um, it's also, this also was the year where they've decided that I guess they're going to start overhauling the jury vote situation next year, because there were a bunch of votes that were, um, off screen. Uh, what, what always happens is that when, when the announcements come in and there are, um, you know, the 40 countries that are competing, there's always, um, you know, a representative from that country who gets on the screen, um, to say, um, how many points they're awarding, like who's going to get their 12 points, right? Like Courtney at, um, represent in Australia. Uh, and this is usually just a parade of, um, people in weird outfits and fun accents. Right. Taking too long to say hello before they get to the point. That by the way, I am obsessed, uh, and I, and I know this probably just like, I'm like an American joke about how like European speak, um, but I am obsessed with how especially the announcers, like they always sort of like say a weird statement that's almost sort of a joke, but isn't really. And then they followed up with, okay. Wow. You know, or it's like, okay. Right. They almost have a quick and then there's a long pause and then they get to the rigmarole of the points, which always takes two fucking long. Oh, right. Again, 40 questions and just a tally. All right. Let's get to the points. It's like, all right, we could, we could have done that first. Um, but, um, from the country of Mario Kart. Yeah. Uh, there are several who weren't on the screen. Um, because I guess there was a scandal about countries promising to vote for one another, uh, in an effort to, I don't know, like keep another country from winning, which I feel like happens every fucking year because it's Eurovision countries are competing against one another. And I wouldn't think that alliances between countries would vanish in the midst of a song contest. No, even though I guess, you know, spiritually, that's what's supposed to happen. Like, let's just get together and love pop music and pick the best, but absolutely not. That's not what happens. Like Greece and Cyprus are always voting for each other and stuff. Yeah. I just want to say also that always somebody on Twitter will be like, what's Eurovision? Some gay guy will do that. You can't play dumb about Eurovision anymore. We have a whole will-feral movie about it. So stop pretending you haven't heard of it, which it's a big, stupid, expensive X factor finale and we invite Croatia. Okay. That's what it is. And we tried to replicate it this year with the American song contest, which I did not watch. Oh my God. Well, that makes you anybody. But Michael Bolton was in it. Macy Gray was in it. Yeah. So congrats to everyone. They tried. A K-pop song won. Oh, okay. Cute. Good job. As I know about it, Kelly Clarkson hosted it and listen, I support her, but I largely do not know what she does with her day. If you ask me what happens on the Kelly Clarkson show, I'm like, I don't know. She probably sang a cover of a pop song from three years ago and then talk to somebody. That's exactly right. No, because I'm friends with Matt Rogers, these clips are funneled to me as if I'm in a subscription service. And I'm not. This yesterday, I watched Kelly Clarkson perform with Ann Wilson of Hart's Ann Wilson. And they sounded great. Wonderful. They always do an abridged version of the song, which upsets me. But Kelly Clarkson hosting the show, I'm always obsessed with somebody having a hit thing they do. And then for one year, they're also stuck doing this other thing that's not a hit for a while. Ryan C. Crest hosted this game show called Million Second Quiz where people played trivia all night. You could watch it all 24 hours a day. And he would host the prime time hour of it. You know, meanwhile, he's hosting American Idol too or whatever. And it's just girl, what are you doing? And you're on with Regis and Kelly. I mean, I don't know if he was on with Regis and Kelly then or with Kelly Ripa then, but it's just so funny to watch somebody who's successful do something contractually that is not successful. Speaking of Eurovision, America's Eurovision was this weekend. The Billboard Awards. My favorite award show because it's not about votes. It's about sales. Well, have you seen the charts recently? We're just going to put that. We're going to put an award in front of that. It's the Good Job Awards. There's always like a controversy with like people being like, Oh, I wish this person would win and people being like, well, you know, it's because of sales. Yeah. They literally can tell them beforehand who won. Just based on what's on. You know, who's not winning? Lord. Dogecats with everything. Right. By the way, can I just say about Lord, that clip of her going viral, like someone put together a smash. I was a super cut. LOL. Of her shushing the audience as she sings either a cappella or sing something in a concert and they're trying to sing along. So she's shushing them. Why don't more people in concert do that? I assume when people are singing all the words that you, you can't hear what you're singing. I'm surprised to see she's the only person to do that. I mean, Donna Summer said, shut up, Fagret said everyone called her homophobe for decades. So maybe that's why people stopped doing it, Lewis. People really misinterpreted that as homophobe. But it was supportive. She was like, I can't hear the lyrics to bad girls. Okay. I can't hear God my one true ally. Um, actually, I would say that like I see Rina Sawa Yama in concert, like a couple of times and she does a funny bit where she's like, are you ready to slay like at the beginning of the concert? And then like the audience is like, yeah. And then she goes, shut the fuck up and goes into her song. Shut the fuck up. Oh, that's cool. All right. No, Madonna used to be hostile with her audiences. Yeah, I know. She didn't turn the AC on. Oh, that showing up three hours late over the years it became torture. Yeah. That bitches later. She's like, you can't eat. You can't know where your friends are. Yeah. That bitches later than me to a lunch date for her own concerts. Okay. You're just sitting there and it was even it was even worse when she started locking up our phones like she did for the Madam X tour. You're like, I don't even know what time it is. Is it for a am? Am I still waiting for Madonna? The Billboard Awards are only memorable. Truly forgot that they were happening. They're only I feel like being talked about now because Megan the stallion was stopped by Cara Dela Veen. What happened? Have you seen the clip? Oh, that's right. But first of all, Cara Dela Veen. I understand this is what makes her a model. The resting look on her face really is demon. I mean, I think Carrie O'Donnell tweeted that Cara Dela Veen needs an exorcism. Yeah. I mean, I think that's just journalistic accurate. It is wild to me that this woman has had so many wild moments in pop culture and still just sort of like, does she still model? Right. Or act. She was in that one movie. Suicide Squad. Suicide Squad. Which was one of the worst acting I've ever seen in my life. And she was in a, let's see, she was in a relationship with Ashley Benson, the Pretty Little Liar, slash also she used to play Abby Devereux on Days of Our Lives, which is why I love Ashley Benson so fondly. But they were engaged at one point. And I remember during COVID, they were caught bringing like a sex swing, like a sex bench into their house. Not, okay. You know, naughty lesbians. I instinctively root for any woman who brings me, Christina Ricci, because she was so far, I'm gonna have to me and I believe in that, you know, resting angst, which is important in actresses. I feel like we haven't had as much of that recently. But the thing that went viral, which is her standing around a corner peering at Meghan The Stallion and then later sitting behind her sitting next to her in the show and talking to her. So next to her. Sitting next to her. She's on the red carpet at Meghan and then she comes and like grabs the train of her dress and is throwing it up in the air. I guess so the photos look better. It also was a clear whether or not she came with Meghan as her plus one. Yeah, which that's an interesting, which I think maybe she did. And then she was like, Oh, no, this bitch is crazy because the wildest part of the video is when they're sitting next to each other. And like Megan's having a conversation with Doja Cat who's sitting in front of her and then Kara pops into frame and you could hear Doja Cat say like that woman's full government dance. She's like, Oh my God, hi, Kara Delavine, which is how you address someone where you were absolutely terrified by their presence. Yeah, it's a fearful reaction. Yeah. And of course, Kara is darting her neck out in that like, you know, attentive alley cat. And she there's also video of her like crawling on the floor taking like angled photos of Doja and the people that she's with. I'm just like, this woman was slithering all over the billboard musical awards. And it reminded me of last Halloween in New York when I went to this party thrown by the miss shapes at the box. It was a deal. You banks was one of the hosts of it. And she performed on stage and Kara Delavine appeared on stage wasted taking like a mic like trying to sing along the two one to didn't know the words and then started like lick a song that is very hard. And then and then started licking like Azalea's boots. That's too bad. And then you banks doesn't deserve that. She is the poet laureate of our generation. Right. Yes. And one of the few I would say intimidating celebrities. I love her. And I love how she's I mean, I love how she sends just like white gays into a tizzy. Whatever you try to have an argument with like a certain type of white gay about her. It's always she called us the KKK. And I'm like, I'm sorry, but she called you the she said the LGBT community in parentheses. G G G G. Are like the gay white KKK's get them some pink hoods and unicorns and let them rally down for a day or drive. How can you not tackle that? Also I can just picture it. I mean, it's a vivid image to be insulted by Azalea Banks is a gift to be like in the list of like, um, beefs that, uh, Azalea Banks has is truly a gift. Uh, and I'm honestly, you know, kind of sad that like, um, the reason that she blocked me on Instagram, um, is in public knowledge. We talked about her on the show once and she DM me and was like, um, aren't you that faggot who was talking and talking about me on your podcast? Uh, in parentheses, the brokeest form of media, which is funny. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's not the richest form. Yeah. I mean, you do have to root for honestly any celebrity who is. Extemporaneously super funny and not copying anyone. It's not contrived. Like, like, her sense of humor is very ingrained in her. And even though it's extremely rowdy, that's also what makes it interesting. I don't know. It just, it, like she has a real point of view is what I'm saying. So you can't not root for that, I guess. She, I mean, is of course a bit messy. And of course, I think still has zero albums, but I, uh, root for her. I root for her. I don't care if you call me a nobody Azalea Banks. I am a nobody on the brokeest form of media. Unblock me. All right. Uh, when we're back, we are joined by the legend, Sissy Space. You will know her from many things from her iconic role as Carrie. To her Oscar winning role in the coal miners daughter. And you can see her next in the Amazon original series Night Sky. We're absolutely thrilled to welcome to keep it the legendaries to see space. In this, and I feel like in so many of your works, you're portraying, you know, a marriage going through something, you know, there's this on this in the bedroom, uh, this, um, missing, which I guess you weren't married, but, um, how have you been a able to, I guess make each relationship that you portray on screen feel different and fresh, especially considering, um, I know you met your husband, um, while making bad lands and you've been together ever since. So I feel like, um, that must also come into play when you're, you know, um, portraying your character. Yes. And that, that's kind of was my prototype. My relationship with Jack, um, because, you know, the, you go through so much together in all that time that you're, you know, it's a really deep and abiding love, but you also want to pinch the heads off. So, if you're going to still love somebody and want to strangle them. Uh, when I think about many of your rules, it's not just that they're like incredible to watch and that they've stood up over the test of time. I would really call a lot of these performances risky. Like, when I watched Carrie, it's like, I don't know that I saw, like, I can't compare it to a performance that came before it, for example. So I felt like if I, if like if I were cast in that role, I would think I basically have to invent something new for the screen in order for this to work. Do you, do you consider a lot of what you've done to be risk taking in any way and do you have any particular favorite risks you've taken? Carrie was certainly a risk. I was very young then and I would send my scripts to my parents and just to let them read and see what I was doing. And they were, they were a little stunned. But, you know, but they didn't want to interfere. And who knew? I mean, it makes you work really hard because you think, we all thought working on Carrie that it would either work or it would be the end of us. And that's, there's some fear can be very motivating. But I learned a lot, you know, because my husband, Jack Bisco, I met on Badlands was also the production designer on, on Carrie. And I got into his research and, and studied the dorei etchings of the Bible. And so, you know, came, kind of copied all of those facial expressions and melodramatic facial expressions of lions eating people. So, you know, it was fun. It's fun to do things that are a little bit bigger than, bigger than life. Of course, I don't know if, if this is like, if night sky is, is the core of night sky is that relationship. And that's where we started from. And then we just hope that the other would unfold. And we'd know it. Well, I mean, speaking of working with Jack on Carrie, I mean, I know you worked just brief, you've mentioned that you worked briefly with him on Phantom of the Paradise, which was, um, diploma as well. Just from that experience and knowing diploma like on set, um, how did you, did you have any, were you happy to be going into Carrie, where you sort of like, oh, that movie, I guess it wasn't as well received as Carrie was as well. Did you have any trepidation about doing this role or were you just very excited to be taking on like the Stephen King not for? Well, because I worked on Phantom of the Paradise, I was a septic. And I have been, my heart was in the right place, but I was like, oh my God, this is hard. I was a set decorator and Brian, but he thought of me as a really bad set decorator. And so it wasn't as cool in Carrie. And I got a commercial that for that same day of the tests, the film tests. And I called him and said, Brian, what should I do? I got, I got this commercial and, but I want to try out for the film. He said, do the commercial. I think like, what this? And that really motivated me. I read the book that night again, the night before the tests and, you know, that was an interesting experience. But yeah, he held that against me. He didn't think of me as an actor, me as the world. It just so happens looking back, like literally reading through these Wikipedia's that you and basically like five or six other actresses who have since become like the definitive movie actresses of our time are born within the same couple of years of each other. It's like you and Sally Field and Jessica Lange and I think Meryl's in there, Sigourney Weaver, Glenn Close. And I was wondering, did you throughout your career feel a particular sense of camaraderie with these people, even though routinely you were nominated against them for Oscars, etc. Very much so, very much so camaraderie because they're, you know, now they're actors everywhere. And it wasn't such a large industry then. And I didn't, I don't think we felt, because we were all so different, we didn't feel a competitiveness. And I think, you know, when you either own a role or you don't, and if you don't own it, then it, you know, it will find it's like water finding its way down the creek. And I've, and we were all very good friends. I played softball with Sally Field back in the day, you know, and you're just going to call Sanjilas and yeah, so I love being, listen, put in that group of artists. I really do. Thank you. Oh my God, of course. Imagine if you imagine not putting you in that group. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, as a side note to see, I wanted to tell you that I'm friends with Rodan Farrow. And when I mentioned that I was doing this interview, he brought up that you are one of Mia's favorite actresses to watch on the screen. Like she absolutely adores watching you in anything and it has for years. Oh my God. And she's one of my favorites. I was going to say you both actually have a kind of comparable thing where like you appear on screen. And then I feel like some sort of transformation generally happens where you kind of get to shock us with power at some point. That's, that sounds good. Yeah. No, I like to watch that. So she's, she's really, she's really wonderful, wonderful actress. She's not working enough now, but it's, it's hard. There are just not as many roles when you're not non-journoo. Are you somebody who ends up seeing like all the new movies coming out? Are you somebody who likes to keep up on everything or do you kind of dial in and out of Hollywood from time to time? Since I know you rather purposefully went away, went away, don't live in Hollywood most of the time. Right. Right. I, I, I dial in and out. Mostly out at this point. I have grandchildren that be occupied. But that's why I was so excited about Ninth Sky because of the relationship. And it's so rare to have a whole series to develop the characters and develop a relationship with someone that you supposedly been married to for 50 years. But you've known each other for 10 minutes when you shoot your person. It's very bizarre, but. Wonderful. Well, have you found at this point in your career then it is more just sort of exciting for you to do something like a Knight's Guy, like a bloodline, you know, like a homecoming, like a television series where it feels like you're doing a lot of character work in multiple episodes. And then it, it's sort of done as well. And it's less, I guess, a big thing like a film. You know, that's I, I, it's, it reminds me of the 70s in film. It was, you know, low budget films, the director ruled. It was, you know, the art of it. And it was really magic time in filmmaking. And I think this is a really wonderful time for television, especially for older actors, you know, because now films have to be a giant event they need to be to get people out of their bedrooms and their living rooms. The worst part about television is streaming television is that you'll work, you'd give every episode just all of your blood. You just, you just give it everything you've got. And then you like, I finished it. You're so excited about certain scenes, but you never get to like talk to anybody about it because then you get the news script and you can, you carry on. So it's grueling physically. But other than that, it's, it's wonderful. It's, it's wonderful that it's come at this time in my career because I've found so many really interesting roles. Speaking of that, there's this video by this woman who goes by the name Be Kind Rewind. And she goes through biopic acting in movies and specifically coal miners daughter, but she talks about how in your career, and I think this applies to your new TV show too, you have found projects that split the difference between mainstream and altruistic, you know, where like you get to, you get to really convey like a director's strong and strange and different point of view, but it happens to a big audience gets to enjoy it. When you're picking a script, do you look for both of those things like a strong kind of, who's the director who's going to be doing this? How strange will it be and yet accessible in a certain way? Well, you know, in, in television, in film, yes, because it's all about the director, but in, in television, it's really about the writers and the creators of the show. They're, they're, they're your fearless leaders. They're, they're the ones who go from, they're there, they know everything. And you have new directors come in that, that can be a little unnerving because you're having to, you have two weeks to do an hour episode, and you've got to work out all the kinks, and you've got to develop a relationship with a new director. And it's, it can also be wonderful because it, it can, it can kind of shake things up a little bit, but you don't want it to shake things up so much that it throws you off your, your track. I really love it because you get to know people so well, you know, in a film that's like six weeks, if you're lucky, unless it's a big huge film, like my husband does, all the big ones. And you have, and particularly with people with masks on, you know, the end of the show, people take their masks out, they're like, who are you? You just kind of have to roll with it, you and, you know, I'm, I'm just, I'm grateful to still be working and working with interesting actors and interesting filmmakers and, and in different genres. I had that experience with, with Carrie, you know, I thought, oh my god, this is going to be the end of me. And it wasn't. And it's, it's still around here, like a hundred years later, there's always, there are always tormented teenagers. Yeah. But I think it's made me, the success of that made me a little braver to do things. I think that's kind of, you know, that's going to be a reach. I don't know the sci-fi. How do I relate to that? How do I, how do I, you know, what in my life can prepare me for that? Oh, I'm a human being. I'm just an orphan being who finds this thing in our backyard. And so I don't have to do anything. I just have to experience it. So I don't know. I don't know. What was your question? No, that, I thought that well enough. Yes. Yeah. Lewis brought up coal minus daughter. And I just recently saw this interview with GQ you did, where you were revisiting your iconic roles. And you talked about how that role really sort of stuck with you because you liked doing the accent, you had the band around, you really sort of loved being Loretta Lynn. And it was sad when it was over, and you couldn't go back to being her. Were there any other roles in your career where you felt like once you were done with the movie, you were like, damn, I still want to be her. Or like, they stuck with you after you were done filming. Yeah, that was the hard one to let go of. But I didn't want to be that person that was like hanging out after that. I seen footage of me in interviews and stuff after coal minus daughter. And I, that accent, it was really hard to shake. You know, I was hard to let go of. They were different. I didn't have that same experience on any of the film that I can think of. But I had, you know, I was changed by different films in the bedroom was one that really affected me deeply. And, you know, they're like your children. You love them all. And, but they're different. I loved working with Danny Lynch. Oh, I love the story. I wish people talked about that movie. It's such an unusual movie for him too. Yes, such an un I said, David, do I have to cut my hair here? I can wear a wig. And it's like, no, sis, it got to cut your hair. I had these great teeth. Oh my goodness. That was really, that was really fun. I'm happy you brought up in the bedroom because among my friends, that's a movie where like the power still sticks with us. Like your, your iconic scene, which I believe is part of your Oscars clip too. Just like, I don't even, I mean, like we see tons of fights with people on screen, but there's something about that movie where it just nailed it. Like you're really in that family's dynamic. And I don't know, can you talk about filming that movie in like Todd Field, that was his first movie? Like, how did this all come together and be so amazing? So brilliant. You know that, I think that movie cost a million dollars. And I remember first days we were in a, we were, our dressing rooms were in a motel, no tell rooms. And I remember like getting dressed and I was like, reached under the bed, who's socks are these? We were using the cruise. You know, it was really like, we're going to put on a show, but Todd is brilliant. And he was, he was just such a joy to work with. Oh my God, he was so, and, and he, actor Tom Wilkins. Oh, Tom Wilkins said, of course. Yes. Yes. The great Tom Wilkins. Unbelievable. He's a theater actor. He could have like, twisted me up and broken me in half. And he was so confident. And we had that big fight scene where Todd had a start in the kitchen. I'm throwing dishes. And then we go through the whole house. And it was just so right at the height of our explosive fight, the doorbell rang. It was a Girl Scout selling candy. And of course, he stopped. We stopped the fight, as you would do. Go buy the candy. It just was. And Marissa Tomay. Oh my God. And I, wonderful. And I had to slap her. I got to slap her. I thought, oh my God, I was slapping her with a back hand, which is just horrible. Just, you know, so dismissive. And I took my rings off. I didn't want to hurt her, but God, she was, she's spectacular. And Tom, Tom Wilkins, and if you're listening to this, I forgot your name because I'm old. I'm trying to. I mean, we all obviously, you know, like know so many of your iconic roles. But I feel like people are always stopping you to talk about, you know, like, you know, Gary, or like, you know, film fans like love in the bedroom, coalminers daughter, are there roles of yours that you feel, is there any particular film that you feel like you wish people were still talking about this film now, because you had such a great time on it. You thought it was such an interesting film that maybe didn't get the attention it deserved when it came out. The straight story, maybe that was a, that kind of fell through the cracks. You know, every film kind of finds its audience, finds its place. You know, working with Terence Malek on Badlands was a really, was like a real life changer for me because I realized that film could be art. And he was so passionate about every frame. And that there was like a fire inside of him. And that's where I met my husband, Jack Fisk, who was our director, production designer on Badlands. And we fell in love. And so it was this kind of wild, passionate love affair while we were making this film that was, you know, about to change both our lives. And it really made me understand that it's really not about the actors. It's about the director. It's about the script. It's about everybody, everybody working on the, on the show. And, and that was a great thing to learn so early in my career. And that's when I realized it's about the director. And so, and that was, that's really special time in Hollywood in the 70s where it felt like a smaller film community. And maybe it was because it was just smaller films. The studios didn't really care that much about. So they didn't keep an eye on us. And they, you know, if it failed, it wasn't a big loss because there wasn't much invested in it. Most of the films, those films were independent that I did then. And, and the directors like Scorsese and, and De Palma and Spielberg and were all friends. And so it was just a neat time. You know, it wasn't, there wasn't so much pressure. It was really just about, about the work. And that was, you know, like, hey, we're going to put on a show, Biggie Rooney. That's a thing. And the other thing is that nobody's really watching. So you have a freedom to try things and mess up and try things again. And it's when people start to notice you that you start to think, Oh my God, you know, how did I do that? I don't know how I did that. Can I do it again? I don't know. Maybe not. So it was really like it's, you know, it's like starting over every time you work on something. And I've kind of brought that along with me. Unfortunately, it's like, okay, how does this work now? But it works differently because you're working with different directors and they bring out different things in you. It's truly exciting. What was your question? No, you got it. You got it. Yeah. I mean, you've worked with truly some of the best directors and some of some of my faves. You know, I mean, I'm a huge De Palma fan. I'm a huge Lynch fan. Uh, controversial ones of years. I love an Oliver Stone movie and you're fantastic in JFK. Oh, thank you. Thank you. What a trip that guy. Oh my God. My agent said, okay, now Oliver's a little different. So just be careful. He's gonna, he's gonna try to throw you off right away. So just watch it, watch out. So I went and I had a great meeting with him and I came back and my agent said, well, how did it go? I went, it was great. He said, well, did he try to pull the rug out from on you? Did he pull anything? And I said, no, he said, well, what happened? I said, well, he said, so what was the first thing I said to you? Hi, Sissy. I hear you want to rewrite the script. And I said, well, just my part. So, right. He was, he, he, we, I didn't know enough to be intimidated. And I think that was, you know, maybe, maybe that was it. Well, I will take your, I will take your word for it that the directors are run the show on a movie. But when we have talents like you, it's really hard to believe you don't run the whole thing. And that the, all the light in the room just does bend towards you naturally. So thank you so much for being here today with us. My pleasure. I enjoyed it so much. And I love the show too. And I love you and JK together. What an awesome pairing we get. Yeah, it's, it's caught an individual. Oh yeah. calls for he's like, he's in it to win it. He's great. Love him. And I'm so glad. So thank you. Of course. Yeah. I mean, it must be, yeah. I mean, it's amazing. This point in your career is still getting to work with like exciting actors who you haven't worked with before, like JK seven. So congrats to great show. Night Sky premieres on Amazon Prime video on May 20th. To prepare for our lovely interview with the icon, Sissy Spacek. We went back to watch some of her films and discovered some of our own blind spots in our filmography. I love when we do a blind spot segment because I always get to watch a movie that I've either randomly missed or something that I've always been meaning to watch. And my blind spot is so weird. Because it's in the bedroom, which I would have thought I'd seen in 2001 when it came out, specifically because I was in high school then. And I feel like in the bedroom was definitely maybe for our age group, maybe you had this similar sort of situation happening to Lewis. But I felt the kids who were like into films at my high school, like this was a movie that they started talking about. Like there were certain films between 2000 and 2004 that like, you know, like the kids who were like, not just like, I'm going to the movies to see a movie. The kids who were like, I like cinema with like, start. Oh, see, no, I did not know anybody like that. I had to invent that from 2001. I went with all my friends to see things like rat race. Too fast, too furious or whatever was happening. I would buy myself, but then like, you know, the art, the art nerds that I was friends with like on the weekend, like we would watch pie. Oh, but by the way, okay, this is a specific memory. Now I'm thinking my girlfriend Elise, but people our age would have DVD collections, you know, that were about 15 deep. And they all, at least I'm thinking of my friend, but this is something I would see over and over again. They they all had this like moody dark whimsy about them. It was movies like pie and Donnie dark. Yes. And Requiem for a dream. Requiem for a dream. Virgin suicides was constantly being watched by the fucking people. And I was like, by the fourth time, so I was like, let's put on Requiem for a dream. I'm like, this movie makes me want to slit my wrist. It is not a fun time. I am not the same after watching what happens to Jennifer Connolly. Um, yeah, it's anyway in the bedroom as in the bedroom is one of two movies directed by Todd Field. It's that and Little Children, which is a masterpiece. These are both quote, unquote domestic movies. They take place in smaller towns. And Sissy Space that gets a yeah, we compare it to Esther role, the smashing the plates on the ground, sort of, uh, version of cacophony. And it is it really is a fabulous drama. It really is. And I would say that drama is the correct word for it. This is this is like drama that feels a bit more realistic than you know, sort of like what I'm drawn to like, like a melodrama. It's not giving cert. Yeah. You know, it's not giving Todd Hanes. Um, this is, um, it feels, it feels more quaint. It feels more lived in. Um, and even though you can sort of see that like something, you know, something, something bad is about to happen. Um, it has like the melodramatic turn, you know, of, um, Nick Stahl, um, getting shot in the head, um, by Marissa Tomey, his baby daddy. But after that, you know, that it doesn't go into sweeping melodrama, you know, it's still, it, um, you just get sort of like the human element of this tragedy. Uh, and I actually did not see that coming. I actually thought, um, I actually was thinking maybe it was going to be or more towards like a melodrama. Uh, I thought if there were a melodrama, um, they would have killed the abuse of baby daddy and maybe like, I thought there were going to be abuse of baby daddy and then like sissy space and Tom Wilkinson, we're going to help cover up a murder. Uh, and I watched nine to five recently. So that's they don't, they don't murder her and then nap it anyway. Uh, but this was wow. It was really, really fucking good. And I'd seen, uh, I'd seen little children before. Um, so I'd seen, um, Todd Fields work. Um, and, um, it was just really sort of, um, a beautiful film. I mean, I don't know. I don't know what else to say about it besides the fact that it's just like well written, well directed. Um, they sissy, it's Tom Wilkinson, it just sort of like, uh, an amazing, um, duo in that film. We were talking about that when we interviewed her, you know, sort of like how great she is with, um, the leading men that she's gotten to work with, um, over the years, you know, like a Tom Wilkinson and, you know, JK Simmons on night's guy. And, um, I have enough class that I did not ask her about working with, um, Christopher Walken on the film blast from the past, but I really want it to. Oh my God. A movie, again, a movie I've seen like 30 times and I can't explain why. Um, uh, I watched the straight story, which is a movie directed by David Lynch in the late nineties that feels very out of step with a lot of what David Lynch does, which is it's never going for absurdity in any way. It's not even like the elephant man, which has a sort of gothic feel to it. It, but it does tap into David Lynch's transcendental meditation, and in fact goes, it's about a guy who takes a trip on his lawn mower through Iowa up to Wisconsin to see his dying brother. And it's, it's really as simple as that, Richard Farnsworth, who, um, also great in a movie, a Jane Fonda movie called comes a horseman in the seventies. He is the star of this. And Sissy Spacek plays his, um, daughter who she has, she has like a sort of speech impediment where she talks in a sort of hick a b cadence and they say she's intellectually disabled, but they don't really get into it. Um, man, first of all, as somebody who went to the University of Iowa, no movie said in Iowa is more beautiful and I'm looking at you feel the dreams. You're in second place. Uh, they, they really sell you on the beauty of that state. And as they should, because I think people think of Iowa is just flat and, you know, drab looking when, no, no, no, no, no, that's the rest of Illinois, because Illinois has Chicago in it. We really give that whole state a pass. No, Illinois is not, not cute. Iowa actually don't think of Iowa. Okay. Well, get on it. Um, but, um, the music in it is so lovely. It's, it's, it's just one of those things where we made a really. Autoristic, strange guy make a kind of conventional movie. And because he's so committed to his brand of, um, artistry, it ends up being this transcendent film. It is so, so good. It might be, it's not my favorite David Lynch movie. That would definitely be Mojo and drive, but just excellent performance. If we were to it was, I mean, I love David Lynch and, um, Angelo, um, battleamenti, um, did the score for this and they've worked together. So the blue velvet, um, and it's so weird to know you're watching a David Lynch film, um, and to hear Angelo's, you know, score startup, you know, which is evoking blue velvet. It's evoking twin pigs, and then come into this film. And even the beginning of the film seems like, okay, you know, like, it's, it's not, uh, you know, there's not grotesque characters in it, but the characters feel more, more human, um, than sort of, um, you know, Hollywood fair, you know, like they, they seem like real people from the Midwest. So you're like, oh, you're going to get some like Midwestern oddities and you get a bit of that, but you really don't veer into anything that you sort of really know David Lynch for. Um, and it's no, there's one character in this movie who he runs into while he's driving the lawnmower who this woman hits a deer and she gets out of the car. She starts screaming, this is the 14th deer I've hit in three weeks or something. And it's meant to be, I think, a shocking, a joltingly comic moment, which does remind me of twin peaks a little bit. But even that, it seems like a real person. Her exasperation is real. You don't leave it thinking like, oh, that was, you know, bizarre camp and the way that you would feel about a twin peaks cameo. And you know, it's, um, what's interesting about it is that it's actually, you know, like, um, a biographical film, you know, it's based on, it's based on a real story. And I think that maybe, um, that's what makes it so different, you know, when Lynch is over, you know, it's just sort of, him respecting the actual story and what happens and not putting his own spin on it. I'd really like to read more about, um, you know, what he thinks of this film. Now, I mean, it was nominated for the Palm Door, you know, and it's also, um, the first positive review that Ebert ever gave a Lynch film. He gave it four out of four stars. Interesting. Listen, uh, Ebert will like trash and be like, you know what, um, had a good time, uh, three out of four stars or he'll see a movie like a blue velvet or an eraser head and he'll be like, what the fuck is this? I do love, I was just missing Roger Ebert recently. Like, if I'm watching a movie from, you know, 2012 or earlier, I tend to read his review again. And the zest of his writing, the unpretentiousness of his writing, but I do love his weird sticking points. Like his whole thing about video games, how they could never be the, the level of art that cinema is for certain strange criteria he put together. But, um, I like a cajorliness about my film critic. I think it was Disturbia, the movie that I saw in theaters with Roger Ebert. I need to recall which what it was. I need to look it up in our school paper, but one time I reviewed a film for, um, loyal university, um, like school newspaper at, um, the screening I was sent to downtown was, um, one of the same screenings that Ebert was at in the front. Oh my gosh. I spent most of the movie looking at Ebert. No, I am sure he had no reaction whatsoever. He's so used. You can't shock him at a movie. No, one time I was at the century city and, uh, I passed Leonard Molten walking in. You're kidding. As you know, I have a disease where I can recall the star ratings Leonard Molten gives most movies, um, because I would get the book he put out every year. And I went up to him and I said, this sounds so crazy, but I have an incredible memory for these star ratings you've given movies over the years. Like if you said a movie, I would know, like, I know Brave Hearts three and a half. I know, you know, I know you gave two and a half to Forrest Gump. And let me tell you, it's a two and a half star movie. You were right to do that. He responded with thank you and walked away. Like I was a GD Goblet. I understand. Have you ever interviewed Molten? No, I know his, uh, his daughter reached out to me one time. She had heard that I had this Jones for his rating and she told him she, she said he was delighted, but I know he's scared. And that's, this is your misery. Yes. You hold them captive. You're like, I need to know what you think of these recent movies, Leonard. Code is a two and a half. Say it. Yeah. My other blind spot was Badlands, which was, um, Terrence Malick's directorial debut. Yeah, put him on the map. You know, yeah, I mean, it's wild that like your first feature film, like puts you on the map, you know, but it's really a gorgeous film. I mean, when you, when you talk about how the straight story made like Iowa look so gorgeous, right? Like this is about, like Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek play a couple that go on the run after he shoots her father, and then they burn the house down and go on the run. And he's sort of like in his 20s and she's 15. Um, it, they go, they go on the run across America and it is so gorgeous. You know, it reminded me, you know, it was sort of like, um, like Nomad land, you know, like it was just, it was like so beautiful and lush. Uh, and seeing, you know, just sort of like what this, um, the American landscape looked like in 1973. Um, like, you know, like the swamp and the marshes and the woods that, um, he shoots in. It's just, it's so beautiful to watch. And it really is sort of like a meditation of a film, like it would be classified as a neo noir, but it's not really very, um, salacious. Yeah, it's not queen and slim for white people, you know, uh, which I'm always, I'm always needing. I'm like, can we get the queen as well as white people? I want to say also about this story in the, in the movie. It's about the, the killer Charlie Stark weather, which his, he's probably most famously chronicled on the Bruce Springsteen album, Nebraska, which, uh, there's a, there's a whole song about him. And like that album is about like the grimness of being in Nebraska in the middle of the country and, you know, being alone with your disturbing thoughts and things like that. Baby, he put Springsteen was in his bag on Nebraska. Okay. Oh fuck. Yeah. Oh no. He's like, Oh, you think I'm just writing like, uh, big anthems for your, for your uncle? Absolutely not. I, I'm unfuck with a bull, shall we say it is a, that album, that album is not a joke. I love hearing you say unfuck with a ball. You know, you know, I'm a springsteen. Reason to believe on that album. Does it get darker? And I love Amy man's cover with her husband, Michael Penn. The, I didn't, I don't know why I didn't place that this was, um, inspired by the Stark weather, um, case, but I know the Stark weather case inspired, uh, natural born killers as well. Yes. Um, which is definitely a film. Right. I don't love natural born killers the way that I think that some people do. It's like, it's one of my lesser stone films. And I do like Oliver Stone. No. Oh, as we discovered in our Sissy interview, or you will discover on our Sissy interview, who haven't listened to that part yet. Um, the other movie I watched was three women, which, can I just say something about the films of Robert Altman? You basically have to be taught to seek this man out because with the exception of Gossford Park, over the past 25 years, there's just, you know, you, it's just somebody that like the criterion channel points you at, and you, you need someone to say, watch all these movies. This movie is so good. And I cannot believe we had a movie starring Sissy Spasic and Shelly Duvall. I mean, the, the eye size in this movie is just unprecedented. I, that we would put them both together. And as my friend said, I was telling, uh, one of my girlfriends, can you believe that Sissy Spasic and Shelly Duvall arguably the definitive eyes of the 70s with, if they added Karen Black, it would have been perfect. And she goes, wait, she goes, Sissy Spasic and Shelly Duvall, were they nightgown salesmen? Come on, that joke. Yes. I'm going to say, I'm going to say nothing else about that movie other than, uh, watch it Sissy's performance and her, uh, turn in it. It's like, you know, I think that, um, I would also sort of classify Terrence Balak as sort of one of those directors. I mean, I know he makes a lot more films. Yeah. Oh, definitely. Days of heaven, another movie that is gorgeous to look at from the 70s by Terrence. Yeah. They're, they're both sort of directors from that era who, you know, you need like, you need like a real film buffs of the, the criteria and collection holders to be talking about. And that there are always people who are sort of like mentioned, when people, you know, want to only talk about like, Scorsese, um, you know, I'm talking about film Twitter, not actual film buffs. Um, but Malak, I wouldn't know if film Twitter hates much. We know they gave both of us. Um, Terrence, Malak and, um, Robert Altman are really like, I feel like they are directors. You sort of have to be like, I'm going to sit and watch this movie. You know, you sort of have to, I agree with you have sort of to teach yourself to watch them. I mean, like I saw recently, um, a hit in life by Malak, uh, which is, you know, about, uh, you know, an Austrian farmer, um, who refuses to fight for the Nazis in World War II. I watched it because, um, one of the actors in it is Franz Riggowski, who's just in this great gay film that I just watched, um, Great Freedom. I don't know if you've seen that. Um, uh, it, that movie was about how it was a legal to be gay, um, in like, um, post, um, Nazi Germany and like people would be locked up for it. And it spans him over decades, um, being locked up, um, repeatedly, um, and sort of like developing relationships with different men in prison. Uh, it's beautiful. And I think, um, he's regarded as like one of the, um, sort of best, um, German actors sort of ever. He's great. So watch a hit in life if you haven't seen it. But, um, Altman and Malak are definitely, um, people with a lot of blood spots. I have, I actually haven't seen three women. Oh my God. I mean, also just like Shelley Duvall, just to say beguiling one of a kind presence. Obviously people know her most from the shining, but she's in a ton of Altman movies. She's of course in Popeye was this before or after the shining before the shining. So before she was, um, emotionally wrecked by Stanley Kubrick. Yeah. I, can we get the just the definitive account of how horrible he could be to actors. I mean, it couldn't have just been that movie. You know, we, we talked to, um, Alan coming quickly about the amount of time he put into filming eyes wide shut the 30 seconds he's in that movie. And it sounded like he lost two years of his life. So, uh, we need a film like that. Um, Hitchcock film, which was, you know, supposed to depict his relationship with Janet Lee. Uh, just, I would like to see Kubrick, who would play Kubrick Adam Driver. Now you said it. Wait for it. He can't wait for the role definitely. Yeah. I think he has the like, steely face, you know, and like the, the wispy sort of hair. Uh, the intensity too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, Adam, Adam, Adam, you know, he's going to have two, two Oscars and I'm going to say 15 years. Okay. Um, check back with me then. I would say him or Leo. Oh, well, I mean, if Leo wants to do it, then who plays Shelley Duvall? Oh, now that we should be able to figure out me a goth done. Okay. I love it when I know. Oh, and you know what? She's perfect for the role because, you know, she's expecting a child with Shia LaBeouf. So I think she's expectedly. I think she's been through her own shining. Right. Right. Right. Right. She she's she's done some running through some hedge mazes, if you will, her minds in Disturbia. She'll bring up the movie I talked about. Disturbia. Can I say about Disturbia quickly? And then we'll move on. I actually first a movie that is just rear window. It is, I think entertaining enough. And Shia LaBeouf is really good in it. Does that bastard that there that there, who's house still looking into? Does he not have fucking alligators in a pit or something over there? Come on. Obviously you can't do this. You don't. What is it in here? It's like devil in the white city. It's also like a discovery zone. Like what is happening in this house? First of all, devil in the white city. I worked at borders in Chicago when we were in college. The choke hold that that book had on people. Everybody was reading devil in the white city. I can't believe an adaptation has it come out yet. I think there was supposed to be one. I forget if it might have even been Leo that was attached initially. Of course. Can you believe it? Like psycho intense guy? He signed up. Yeah. I mean, it's just one of those books where I feel like even people who don't really read books that often, like everybody was fucking reading devil in the white city. But no, people would just show up to a borders and shrug and say, this is the book. And as a someone who worked there, you know, like you'd always get different variations of the title. White devil in the city. I'm looking for the devil book. You're like, babe, babe, white devil in the city. Yeah. My favorite white devil. Next week, we'll talk about how babe was a white supremacist pig. The sheep. Yeah. Guess what? Guess what? Guess what will he was wearing? Okay. The it was a robe. The great farming theory is what babe wants to teach you about. By the way, the evil neighbor in Disturbia was David Morse, who. Right. Crazy role. Who I just saw on stage and how I learned to drive. He plays the uncle, who sort of, you know, like, Melissa, Mary Louise Parker in Paula Bogle's How I Learn to Drive. By the way, I've decided about Mary Louise Parker that one, I will be seeing this production. Two, I when she is in a play, I like follow her around the country fish style. I think she is that one of a kind and worth it. She is. She I mean, I feel like she's the. She's it's weird to her. She and Sam Rockwell are both on Broadway at the moment, because I feel like they're very similar as actors, like, at least to me in my heart, you know, they both have a weird quirk. And I would also follow them both to the ends of the earth, you know, and you know, how many fucking movies I've watched were Sam Rockwell plays a white supremacist just because I love him. I watched that movie with Taraji and that wig. Oh my god. No, no, Mary Louise Parker is like the Yale of Sandy Dennis who is an upholster behind me. You know, they've got the ticks. They've got the neurosis, but it's also soulful and also fucking real like you're there's just something about the way she expresses herself where you're getting a full person immediately. And also, of course, it's a Pulitzer prize winning play. I should just see it. Well, they just extended it. So you should go see it. Exactly. Yeah. All right, New York, I'm coming. So watch out. I'm always obsessed with on Twitter when they like somebody like they make fun of gays who say they aren't ready for us this summer. And then they're not ready for you when you're shorts and always so funny. Yeah. Thai tea is not ready for Lewis. It could it's it's specifically ready for everybody looks like Oh, all right. When we're back, keep it. And we're back with our favorite segment of the episode. It's keep it. Lewis, how should we go first? Yes. I'm sorry. I'm being like David Lynch and I'm just meditating on mine for a moment. My keep it pertains to Grindr, which I did a rant on Grindr on Kimmel last week. Maybe you saw it. I sort of gave a PG 13 rundown of what happens on Grindr, you know, for people like my mom who are perpetually, you know, clutching at their collar like the white guy and the baby got back video. So I've decided to pick a classic Grindr happening to critique for my keep it this week. My keep it is to people who message you and instead of saying hi or just being nice, they immediately criticized how you handle your body here. The amount of people who are like, Oh, that's too bad that you shaved that or it's too bad that you didn't shave that. It's like girl, I didn't realize I was fucking artwork for you to critique. It's such a strange, pernicious thing that I feel like all of my friends have experienced where people just decide you want to hear grooming tips from a complete stranger. Now, obviously, there's a lot of overstepping of bounds in lots of directions. Lots of people in Grindr still post things like whatever, no Asians or just straight up blatantly racist things. So there's worst, worst things occurring on Grindr. But this as a particular nuisance is so strange to me. I wonder what it is about body hair that makes people think you want to hear the correct answer about how to handle it. You know, I've always thought that you were a piece of art to critique Louis. I think of you as my Venus Demila. Oh, as you want to rip my arms off. Yeah, I don't know. I have a very hairy chest, so I've never experienced that. I feel like people are there's always been this line of thought like, Oh, real men are hairy or something. Meanwhile, they are. You get a fucking mean, you get a fucking haircut, don't you? So it what it does, why would any other hair be different than the hair on your head? Because Samson lost his power when he cut his hair, but his chest hair remains intact and gave him the power of being a man. I don't know where I was going with that. No, you wrapped, you wrapped into evangelicalism in a way that made me think of someone like Iola. Criticizing body hair, not on my watch. What a great celebrity. I miss her. Where should you say that like she's a Magoolog now? I don't know where she is. I feel like I haven't heard from her recently. That's your keep at this one. Yeah, that's it. Be nice to each other and grinder. Also, everybody needs a picture of some kind. I don't care if it's not your face. The blank shit that's got to go. You know, they are creepy. My biggest pet peeves, like I will get a message from someone with a blank like no profile. And they're like, how's it going? And I'm like, I'm good. And I'll always respond something with like stranger or like mysterious person with no photo. And they'll like laugh it off and keep talking or they'll just go silo. No, nobody wants to get deeply unidentifiable text. You ever seen the movie, Personal Shopper? It's bone-chilling. Yeah, I mean, have you ever seen confessions of a shopaholic? Also bone-chilling? Yes, I don't know. But very griddle-y real. But grinder is featured heavily in that movie. I'm sure it's not. It could be. Have you ever seen it? Let's visit that blind spot, Lewis. No, I've seen confessions of a shopaholic. Isla Fisher's greatest word. Ira, what's your keypad? My keypad this week, unfortunately goes to my vanilla king, Jack Harlow, and his new album Come Home, The Kids Miss You. The vanilla king period. I mean, who else is even competing with him at the moment? Yeah, I feel like I always have a new one though. You know, like it used to be Charlie Puth. Now it's Jack Harlow. Well, if he's not going to put out that album, he's not our vanilla king. Well, and here's my thing. Jack Harlow shouldn't have put out his album. Oh, I see. Uh, maybe, maybe Charlie Puth is a superior vanilla king because he is not putting out his work for scrutiny. Jack Harlow's new album Come Home, The Kids Miss You, is adequate. I listen, it's literally the definition of I like the beat. Because listen, Pharrell is doing some crazy shit on this album. You know, like Justin Timberlake is on the album. And you know what? I'm also coming out of Justin Timberlake fan witness protection. I can't, I can't do it anymore. I like Justin Timberlake. I'm sorry. I listened to 20 2020 constantly. I do. I felt like I really had to hate him because of what he did to Britney and to Janet. But, um, I like them. Okay. The fans are now flipping through the hundreds of episodes we're talking about are disdain for Justin Timberlake. So this reversal is feeling a little haunted to me. You know what? Maybe that's my real keep it. My real keep it is to having to hide the fact that I like Justin Timberlake's music. And I like him. The man in the woods. And I wish you would, I wish you would disappear into the woods. That's where you belong now. I don't like him that much. It can be very annoying. But the music, baby, the albums are great. Two perfect albums. Two perfect albums. Wait, future sex love sounds and justified. Oh, oh, early ones. Okay. Well, let me say something about future sex love sounds. What continues to bother me about that album is he was clearly copying the naming structure of Speakerbox the Love Below. But the deal with that album was it was two albums. So him taking the slash is just senseless and contrived. All right. Next album. What's up now? Disappointing. But anyway, like the getting getting back to Jack Harlow, I think a album was just specifically by rapper to sort of tell you something about them. And I don't feel like I really learned anything about Jack Harlow on this album. It sort of feels very blank. Like, like, like anybody could have wrapped this, you know, like, I thought he was so interesting as like a rapper who hopped on Lil Nas X's, Industry Baby song. Like, I love to hear like what he thinks, you know, about, you know, being thrust, you know, into like gay culture like that, you know, I mean, he has a song called Do A Lipa on the album, which, you know, is like has the line, Do A Lipa trying to do more with her than get a feature, you know, which so you're attracted to do a Lipa. Cool. Who isn't? What else is going on? Yeah, right. Yeah, there are a couple songs I like, but overall, like it's sort of forgettable. And that's unfortunate because he was one of the like most exciting new rappers to sort of come out recently. Anyway, getting back to the fact that we're now living in a post me admitting I love Justin Timberlake world. I know. I feel shattered. Yeah. I think well, it's going to be jail time for you. Me, I will continue doing what I do, which is getting ice coffee. That's our show this week. Thank you to Sissy Spacek for joining us. And we'll see you next week.
