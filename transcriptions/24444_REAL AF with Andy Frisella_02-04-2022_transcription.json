Let's dive into this headline number one headline reads scoop. Jen Psaki planning to leave White House this spring for MSNBC gig shocking. Very, very fucking shocking. So White House press secretary Jen Psaki in exclusive talks with MSNBC to join the network after she leaves the White House around May, according to a source close to the matter. This is why it matters. It's been speculated for weeks that Psaki would leave the White House for TV gig, White House communication staffers often negotiate TV jobs once they leave an administration. So the details are Psaki has been in close consultation with the White House Council's office about her departure. According to two sources familiar with the plans, she's been treading carefully on the ethics and legal aspects of her plan. I'm sure. I'm sure she's very ethical. Yeah. So so far, no contracts have officially been signed. Government ethics rule, ethics rule have stipulations about how public public employees can pursue private sector jobs, opportunities while they're in office. She also told some senior officials at the White House, her departure and her plans to join an MSNBC, MSNBC this spring. We've been seeing this. People jump a fucking ship. So you got you got to jump one one singing ship or another one. Like that's not a fucking move up, bro. Like nobody nobody's watching that. When you jump the sinking ship, you're supposed to jump on to one and a sink and we're supposed to go to dry land. I'm like, yeah, get off the water period. Talk about the fucking clear supremacy. Holy shit, dude. Vaughn, she's wider than you, bro. She is. You look like you look Dominican. That's pretty bad. I'm just right. She doesn't have much pigment in her. But do talk about the most hateful fucking face out there. It's it, dude, you know what, if she was the sweetest person in the world, people wouldn't think that up or in her face. It's her fucking personality. That's real. She's rude as fuck. She's smart ass. Condescending. She's a person. She's arrogant. She's an elitist. You know, like I'm so like, dude, when she told everybody, oh, you're struggling now. Just go ahead and take a break. Get a margarita this weekend. Mother fucker. We can't afford margaritas. Right. So fuck. Dude, it's fucked up. It is interesting though, because like we said, we talked about this. I can afford some margaritas, but I'm just saying. I'm just being real. I'll buy some for y'all. But like, watermelon. Jesus Christ. Great watermelon margaritas, bro. That's a real story. That's a real story. Have I told that story on the podcast? Have you? We're fucking, did I? We're DJ fucking, no, I don't think we told it on there. Yeah. That's a good word. The bar. You told the wood, uh, selling. All right. Anyway, we're going to tell our funny stories. We tell them all the fucking times we want to, but today we'll pass. Anyway, dude. I don't have anything else to say. I'm not a fan of this woman. Yeah, me either. I think she was intentionally placed to piss everybody the fuck off. I think so too. I mean, I don't see how you could actually talk and speak and deliver the way she does and think that it's going to go over in any way whatsoever. Right. Yeah. It's pretty bad when even other members of the liberal establishment media don't like her. Dude, that's what I'm saying. That says a lot. Yeah. I love it. Like dude, I don't know anything about Peter Ducey, but I just love the Peter Ducey Jen Psaki back and forth. Like, you know, eventually your probably going to have sex. They may have already had it. That's why there's so much tension there. Dude, those shit they probably already did. They hate each other. That's what the whole thing is about. I don't know. She may be doing some stuff. She may be doing some stuff. That what you just said. Yeah. Yeah. No, man. I think that's the pegging thing you're talking about. Yeah. Like based. No. All right. No, but dude, it's funny because there's a lot of these fucking a lot of people are jumping ship right now, bro. A lot. Well, that's what happens when things suck. That's the and rats are not loyal. They fucking jump ship when the ship sink and bro. So yeah, I'll be happy that not, I think you could literally like that woman they have doing it now is like communications director. She's like. She's cool. Yeah. Now, I'm not saying she's cool. I don't like the shit she says, but it's way easier to hear from her than it is from this woman. Yeah, 100%. Like dude, your job as the president of the United States is to unite people United States. It seems to me and people can have their own opinion, but like I just personally knowing what I know about organizations and marketing and just culture and everything. I don't see how you could put someone out there like that and not have to be a purposeful thing. Like we're going to put out the most irritating person that we can. No, I'm serious. Divide as much people as we can. That's my opinion. I mean, this woman's been seen with a hammer and sickle hat on. It's a famous photo. We've all seen it. Even if that wasn't the intentions, it's definitely the fucking effect. And I don't think it's a coincidence that all this shit is finally coming out about how they're compromised through 100 Biden's finances. And now all of a sudden she's jumping. She don't want to be implicated in all that shit. No, because she and by the way, she is. She is because she's the last two years denying it. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? So I mean, it's people like this. And this is why the message always comes back to fucking accountability. I don't care if she fucking goes to fucking resort in Mexico and works with the fucking housekeeper. Bring her back. Accountability. Listen, dude. You know what I am? I don't think these people realize what their life is going to be like from here on out. Like they're not going to like normal people are not with the shit that they're trying to push. It's very obvious. It's the polls they're promoting. They're pushing out. The polls they're pushing out are that the administration is in a 30% approval. Like you have to intentionally do that. You have to intentionally do that. Yeah. Like you can't like you I could get up there and literally say my exact feelings. And dude, I have some pretty extreme thoughts. Like I believe in very, very harsh crime punishment. I'm a victim of violent crime. I don't fuck with that shit. Okay. I'd be putting motherfuckers in jail for littering and people think I'm joking. I'm not joking. And you know, I still think I'd have a much higher approval. I fucking is in this person. Like I think I could get up there and say everything I truly fucking believe. And it would I'd have I think I'd have a higher approval percentage even though it's not what most people believe and I know that. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's so I don't know man. Like I don't know. She's not a likable person. No. Well, see you. Yeah. I mean, dude, CNN did just to give you an idea CNN plus launched your subscription service. They're streaming service on the 29th of March on the 30th. They were already laying people off because it didn't sell. Nobody bought it. No, for real. Like they created this whole streaming network. Did you see that story? Any of you guys? Yeah. Two nine nine a month. Yeah. Two dollars and 99 cents a month. Nobody will fucking pay it. So they had to fire all the fucking people. Jeez. Yeah. And one day they figured out like, holy shit, this is going to sink. Think how bad that is. MSNBC ain't fucking any better. No. No. These people are fucked. Dude, listen, we're going to have a culture revolution. You're fucking timestamp this shit and look back on it in five years, it's going to be fucking gold. We're going to have a culture revolution. All these traditional medias are going to go away. The new media is going to rise up. That's that's a that's not a that's not a that that is not an upward mobility move for her. It's it's a fuck she's going to sink with that ship. So it is whatever. How do you walk down the street after what she's done for the last how many you have no conscience? Well, I'm just saying like people aren't going to fucking tolerate. Like people are going to I'm surprised people are throwing fucking fruit at her in the street. You know, so it but it'll get there. You know, when it comes out that all these people are legitimately supporting like what they're supporting, which is fucking kids get. I'm sure this is on the list for things to talk about today. The fucking our administration advocating for eight year old kids to have sex changes. When you advocate for that, your life is over. And she's going to find that out. You know what I think I think for the if like, if our president, I would make these press press briefings open to the public. You know what I'm saying? You do that easily. I mean, like their security measures, you could take medical detectors, all that simple shit. But like the fact that they do these close meetings, they they do they're all scripted. It's all scripted. It's their people. You know what I'm saying? Like I would open that shit up. Let the public come in. I'm for the people, right? And if at the end of the day, you have a problem with something that I'm saying, like have like, because there's only like 20 people there and they'll have five spaces for the average people to come in for the public. Yep. I'd be down with that. You know what I'm saying? Like, like, I want to hear the people's fucking like, I would be down with that. Do these people don't realize how out of touch they are with the regular media? Yeah, they don't get it. You know what I'm saying? Like, like I would be down for that. I ask Griden's all the time. I'm like, bro, because he's the guy that has that I know the best that has the most experience in politics. And I ask them, like, bro, are these people evil or are they just fucking stupid? And he's like, bro, they are that stupid. Yeah. He's like, and they're evil. Right. Like, but like, they are that stupid. Yeah. And see, I don't think they're just out of touch, bro. They're completely out of touch. These motherfuckers are 80 years old and plus, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, they're out of touch. Yeah. That's that's another thing I would do if I got into office is I would put a fucking operational in it. Yeah. Of 65 years old, whatever the national retirement age is. You know, that's it. If you did that and you put Jim Fricella as one of the five and then recorded it, that would be a blockbuster reality show. Oh, yeah. One of the first we've ever go from fucking, you know, 20 minutes about two hours. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you pop. Well, because every question we have to start with a real long story. Yeah. Yeah. But that's all right. The stories are good. Yeah. Yeah. Good. They're probably the highest rated press conference. All right. Well, fuck her. Let's move on. Let's move on. Headline. Don't fuck her because it would be gross, but unless you want to do ski. Headline number two headline reads, Zalinski demotes to Ukrainian generals calls them traders. Ukraine's leaders said Russian troops regrouping in Kearson, Maripul and near Kharkov. Ukrainian president Valatimir Zalinski said during an overnight speech Friday, this just came out a couple hours ago, that he has demoted two of his own generals describing them as traders. The leadership shuffle and the upper echelon of Ukraine's government comes as it wars, comes as it's war with Russia stretches Friday into its 37th consecutive day. Quote today, another decision was made regarding anti heroes. Now, I do not have time to deal with all the traders, but gradually they will all be punished. Really? No. What will happen here, bro, is you're going to get you're going to die. They're trying to tell you they fucking just stop. He's going to die. I think that's what happened. Listen, they're setting this guy up to be a martyr. This is why they've made him into a celebrity. So his generals don't like using Ukrainian people as fucking shields. And they probably don't like parking their military vehicles inside hospitals or transporters or transporting their troops with ambulances. And then when Russia fucking blows them up, and then they say, oh, they blew up some innocent people in the ambulance. Right. That's what's happening. Yeah. So it's whatever, dude. Like this guy's going to get his fucking this guy. Oh, there's more. Oh, you're good. You're good. I mean, this guy is going to get killed. There's no there. It's just going to happen. Yeah. So yeah, he's also painting a picture because there was also just an attack, one of the first attacks inside of Russia by operatives from Ukraine. And they hit a couple of oil fields. But during the speech, Linsky, he added, he told you cranions that quote, there will be battles ahead and quote, we still have a very difficult path to cover to get everything we strive for the invaders are allocating their sick creativity to the temporary occupied areas of the Kirsten region. He added also in Donbas and Maripu and in Kharkov direction, Russian troops are accumulating the potential for strikes, powerful strikes. I don't think this is over. And that's the weird thing too, because everybody's keeps trying to paint this is, is always riddling down. That's like a fucking green screen. It does. No, it does. It absolutely does. That looks like a fucking green screen. He's referring to the picture in the auto guys. You got to see it. It's on the green screen to you. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck. Maybe he's not going to get killed. Maybe he ain't even there. Maybe he's in fucking DC. Maybe he's in Israel. Right. Yeah. I know. All I know is that what this guy's doing and what people don't get told. And I've seen videos of it. And they're fucking fucking tanks inside shopping centers and shit. Armor vehicles, jeeps, all their shit inside hospital parking garages and this and that. And then when Russia blows them the fuck up, they're trying to say, oh, Russia killed all the blue hospital and killed all those people and this and that. I mean, that's the transporting troops and ambulance to shit is really, really fucking people. People probably say, well, where's your source? Or how do you know this? Well, fuck dude, all you have to do is really just kind of go on the internet and look, and you can see the fucking videos of it. They're not fake. It's real shit. These are like videos being posted by Ukrainian citizens who are saying, don't believe the news. So you should believe the right, you got Ukrainian people in the streets saying, don't believe your fucking news. And you guys still believe it. No, no, bro. That's Russian disinformation. Yeah. That looks like a green screen. It really does. No, it really, really, really does. That's definitely a green screen. I mean, I've done enough fucking green screen shit to know like that's a green screen. That's fucking weird. Yeah, I mean, look at the wash on his face on the left side. There's like no shadows. I mean, they could do two lights and have it really filled in, but there's no shadow on the street. There's no white kind of washing on that. Plus, if they had if they had those two big lights, you'd see the light on the fucking ground and you'll see it on the ground. 100%. Yeah. Huh, make sure you post that picture on our site. Moving on to our third and final headline guys headline number three. By the way, hold on. I want to add, I'm really getting tired of seeing this motherfucker, trying to guilt everybody and get on everybody's fucking screens and say, hey, you need to help us or go to war and this and that. Hey, fuck you. Okay, we're tired of sending our fucking people to die for shit. They have nothing to do with us. Not to mention we've already sent him billions of fucking dollars. Yeah, fuck you, dude. You're trying to get us into World War three with fucking Russia and China. Fuck you. Yeah. That's it, dude. That's the weird thing. Any of you motherfuckers sympathizing with this fucking guy. I told you the first day of fucking happen. You go back and play the fucking pack or podcast was that by the way, while I'm talking, you go back and listen to it. I told you what the fuck this was the first fucking day. Whatever, dude. The thing I don't get and we've talked about this, but like how it seems like the narrative keeps switching. Is Ukraine fucking losing or are they getting their fucking ass kicked? That's a good point. You know what I'm saying? Like, which one is it? The brave Ukrainians are kicking the shit out of Russia. Oh, send troops because the Ukrainians are getting their asses beat by Russia. What is it? Not both, bro. It can't be both. We're talking a bunch of lies. What it is. What's one of people are now starting to connect the fight, the dots that we've been laying out for years to them that not everything is what it seems. The Biden laptop information has come out. All the shit links to Ukraine. And these fucking crooked ass politicians who are highly compromised are trying to drag our country into a World War Three to cover up for a fucking piece of shit like Hunter Biden. Think about that. Yeah. Oh shit. Which is really for themselves. This is all coming to a head, bro. It's going to be interesting to see what happens. Bro, I'll say it all the time. You know, that Charles Swap's Schwab shit, you know, the great reset. No, we need a new reset. We do need one. Yeah, yeah. Just not going to have a reset. And they're going to be on the losing end of it. That's what's going to happen. All right, guys. Headline number three, my third and final headline for you guys. Like, dude, if you've seen the fucking propaganda, they put it like the fucking propaganda tweets they put out about Zelensky like, Oh, every every woman in America has a crush on better Vladimir Zelensky, whether you like it or not. Yeah. Yeah, get the fuck out. All you fucking this guy. All you fucking cuck motherfuckers, dude. That's the truth. Like, it's fucking gross, I can tell you this. You really got the dancing fucking high heels and let me know. There ain't no none of the women I know were happening. She's about to tell you that. No, bro. They are. They just don't know what you're Oh, yeah. I'm just in denial. Yeah. Fucking All right. Headline number three, headline reads. Biden says trans people made an image of God. Parents must affirm identity. We think Vaughn. Well, he's right that they are made in the image of God and all people have dignity. But why do you want to fuck with that? So exactly. Hold on. Let's DJ finish. President Biden released a video message to mark international transgender day of visibility, which I thought was every day. Just yesterday, Thursday, today's Friday when we're recording saying that transgender people are quote made in the image of God and that their parents should affirm their gender identity. Biden, who was a senator, who as a senator backed an array of anti LGBT legislation slammed what he called quote hateful bills in several states that restrict transgender participation in girls sports and limit discussion of sexuality and gender identity. Here's the video for you guys in the full speech to everyone celebrating transgender day of visibility. I want you to know that your president sees you. Jill, Kamala, Doug, our entire administration sees you for who you are made an image of God and deserving of dignity, respect and support. But we know it's hard when there are those out there who don't see you and don't respect you. For example, the onslaught of anti transgender state laws attacking you and your families is simply wrong. This administration is standing up for you against all these hateful bills. And we're committed to advancing transgender equality in the classroom, on the playing field at work, in our military, in our housing and healthcare systems, everywhere, simply everywhere. Today, we're announcing even more steps, but there's always more work to do to end the epidemic of violence against transgender women of color and girls of color. To ensure transgender Why the fuck are we are we tying? Why are we tying trans in with color? They have to, bro. Okay, hold on. Let me so basically everybody except white people. So so so everybody LGBTQ minorities, everybody except white people. Yeah, W's not in the alphabet straight white people. So so it's everybody else. I thought this was trans. Oh, but it's race now too. So everybody else except fucking straight white people. Okay, got it. Keep going. Kind of weird. I mean, it feels feels like, you know, I don't know, racism. To finally pass a bipartisan equality act. To help transgender persons around the world live free from discrimination and violence above all, to be there with you. To parents of transgender children, affirming your child's identity, one of the most powerful things you can do to keep them safe and healthy. There are any transgender American who's struggling. Please know you're not alone. To parents and children alike, please ask for help and know this. You're so brave. You belong. And we have your back. God bless you all. Be brave. So that is the president of the United States of America, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah. Yeah. Denying the basic, the basic, the most basic scientific fucking facts on the fucking planet, male and female. So I think it's smoke and mirrors because while I do think that there is violence, obviously there are crappy people who do horrible things to a variety of different people that they don't like. The overwhelming number of people that you and I will meet will encounter someone like that. We've got a transgender. I'm not sure how they identified that. How would you know because it changes every day? That's true. But my point is, is that this person that tests that everybody's kind, everybody's nice. That's not the issue. This is not an issue of treating people with kindness. And he's making it sound like that's because this has been hijacked. Right. It's been hijacked. What this is, is not an issue of common decency because most Americans treat anybody they meet who's different. They treat them with kindness. That smoke and mirrors what he's, what he's, what he's addressing is not the issue. The issue is the agenda that's being afforded in our school systems and among young people that is basically creating all sorts of confusion. I have a, I have a good friend who, his daughter wants to transition. It's the most brutal thing I've ever personally experienced anything anyone ever experiencing. And he talks about how it's really insidious, especially goes after girls in a society where it used to be that supposedly the number of transgenderism in, in America was like 0.04 or four. It's skyrocketing because frankly, it's being trumpeted and almost this, this cool trend. And so what happens is on the, on the educational level, kids are filled with a lot of things that confuse them. And then you have some kid who's an outlier or maybe is not very accepted. And all of a sudden he realizes, oh, if I transition, everybody's going to like me. Everybody's going to think that I'm this big hero and celebrate me. And that's what's happening. There's a great book out by, I forget the name of it, but it's called I believe the name of it is irreversible. And the author does an amazing job of showing how there is a, an intentional, um, agenda that is confusing kids. And the problem with Mr. Biden, the way the problem with his statement is he's making it about mixed Biden. What's that? Yeah. Right. But he's making, does your simmers identity? Exactly. But he's making it as if the issue is an act of love. Are there crappy people in the world? Of course. Who are going to cheat? Yes, but it's not. He's making it sound like the offense is with the average American citizen. No, the offense is with the liberal establishment, the establishment that is foisting an agenda on our children. And by the way, I got four girls under the age of eight and I've got a boy on the way. Anybody who's a parent is outside their minds. If they think that kids are able to make this kind of life changing decision before the age of 18, let alone before the age of 21. They don't, they don't, they shouldn't have children. No, it's not to be allowed to be a shoulder. They should have their children taken away, bro. bogus. Yeah. That, that kids are at the age that they can make that kind of life changing decision. Oh, and by the way, look into the statistics and you'll find that of a huge percentage of the people who go through this gender, gender transition. It's 33%. Is it a reverse it? Try to reverse it. Or if they don't reverse it, they admit that they're no happy. No, no, no, they have a, they have a 50, it's 50 times more likely that commits suicide. Yeah. It's, it's crazy. And, and yet you and I are being held up as the bad guys that are somehow mean, I'm not mean. I'm not, I don't hate these people. I'm sad. Do you breaks my heart? Okay. I, I get that. But to understand why they're doing, does anybody here understand why they're doing this? I know why they're doing it. Why? Pushing this play of like, oh, it's violence, because that's what they want to happen. They want the blowback. They want people like me, when I see a man walk out of my fucking woman's restroom and target and I beat the shit out of him, they want that. They want that. Because if they can get the blowback, again, it's distractions, everything else, nothing else fucking matters. Well, that, and it's just another way to divide. So do you really want to know why they're doing it? Anybody really know why? Okay. Procreation. Oh, yeah. Okay. This, the sake thing, the reason she's leaving is because the Biden administration is highly compromised. It's becoming, it's coming out in the public right now. He's highly compromised by the global agenda. The global agenda is depopulation. Why do we push, why do we push homosexuality? Why do we push transgender? And why do we push, it's not being accepted anymore. It's now pushed. Why is it pushed? It's pushed so there'll be less people on the fucking planet. That's a fucking fact. Okay. It's also pushed to remove the identity of the individual so that people will fall in line with a one world government and a one world religion and a one world standard of living. That is, that is basically all of us are the same. We're not man or female. We have no real identity. And if we have no real identity, they can't control us. Right. We're humans. That's what this is about. This man talks about elderly trans people. There are no fucking elderly trans people. It's less than 1%. It's 0.0 to Von's point. It's 0.02%. Then what happens is as you start to go through the generations, okay, you go from the traditional list, people born before 1945 to the boomers, people born in 1945 and beyond. It goes up with each generation, right? To where it goes all the way from 0% to right now for Z, it's up to 18%. Okay. Now the problem with that and what people will say, well, that's just because, you know, it's more accepted now and it's out in the open. No, that's not what's happening. It's being taught and conditioned and it's a fucking cultural play that if you can't see by now, I don't know what to tell you. You know how many friends tell me? They're like, bro, this shit is just forced down our fucking throat everywhere. We fucking go. You know why that is? So they could create little, far left liberal fucking soldiers to come up from behind and root for their fucking shit because they what they do is they run on social, right? That when I'm saying is they run on social issues. Oh, we care about you. Be brave, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I see. And they get all these people to vote for them. And then they go in office and they steal, steal, steal, steal, steal, and fuck everybody. And that's what's going on. And they want more of those people who will vote for them and they're willing to ruin your fucking children's lives, to create a lifetime of regret, create a lifetime of confusion, create a lifetime of depression, create a life that is statistically proven to be more to more likely end up in suicide to get their way. That's evil shit. Yeah. Okay, this has nothing to do with acceptance. Okay, it has nothing to do with equality. I think most people even most conservative people these days have no problems with alternative lifestyle. The conservative, the conservative Americans have moved to the center. Right. Okay, they've moved the entire scope of the political spectrum. They've shifted it left. Okay. And that's their gut. That's their plan. That's what they want to do. So they want now people who would normally say that's fuck, that's not right. Like two dudes, that's not right. Now they want them to say, okay, it's okay. Just leave me alone. And that's what happened for the last 20 fucking years. And now it's not that anymore. Now it's if you don't fucking do this, you're a bigot. Right. If you don't support this, if you're a bigot, if you don't champion this cause you're the A and LBGTQ, I found out stands for ally. Right. So, so people who are for this shit are in this shit just because they agree with it. Right. Okay, so now it's people of color. It's people who believe it. It's the actual gay community. So what they've done is they've hijacked the actual gay community. Every day it's another letter. I don't know. Okay, because they don't because they it's the new racism, bro. It used to be you know, racism was the worst thing. Now it's bigotry towards LGBTQ. And they've replaced that. And now they've included every single human on the left in that in that group. Yep. And it's against everybody else. And like, dude, the gay people of the world, the regular normal, like people who are just happen to be gay, they're they're hijacking your shit. And the pedophiles are hijacking your shit. And I'm going to tell you right now, this is the truth. The 80% of America that don't fucking like Joe Biden, they're not going to deal with that minor attractive people shit. No, the pedophile shit, it's not going to be okay. The gay community should speak speaking up against that. Yeah, they have to. Bro, they have to. I know they are to me. Yeah, like it might be I'm so filled after the last couple shows with with gay people who listen to the show, whether they're gay or lesbian, whatever, I'm saying gay people, okay, who are like, bro, thank you for saying that. We that's what most most of us feel this way. It's just hard for us to address. So like now they're being shamed inside their own community to go along with it. It's the same thing that happened in BLM, bro. Like when the big BLM push was coming around, any black people that didn't go along with your uncle Tom fucking tap dancing. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? It's like, you know, so if I were a gay person, right, and I'm saying, hey, that's just not cool, what are they going to like what's going to be the next term for them? You know what I'm saying? Oh, you're not really gay. How many dicks did you take this week? You know, I mean, like, first of all, who how black are you? It's the same creates the whole identity around who wants to put there where you want to put your fucking dick or your vagina or whatever you change it into. Okay, like your whole identity is that is that like, dude, that's not normal gay people. I know that's not them. No, they're business people. They're fucking the creatives. They're there are everything everybody else is their normal motherfuckers, their cops, their firefighters, they're fucking they just happen to like to do something else with their fucking stuff. Okay. And cool. Right. Cool. I don't care. But but when this shit when you have the president of the United States, talking about laws that are anti trans and what the laws actually state is that it's not okay. Like the don't say gay bill, but don't say gay, which is they don't even say gay in the bill. No, it's an anti grooming bill. Right. It's an anti grooming bill so that these crazy fucking left teachers can't take your kids and your kids and your fucking kids and teach them that this is the actual normal way. Right. And dude, I posted that meme last night. I posted that meme last night on my story, dude. No normal, well adjusted adult wants to talk to a kid about sex. That's what I'm saying. It goes both ways. Exactly. It goes both ways. So if you like, but dude, this is the president of the United States wanting to talk to your fucking kids about cutting off their fucking penises. Right. And eight years old. Well, that's a thing because the argument from the left is, oh, we're not trying to groom your kid. Okay. So then you don't have a problem. DJ, they're 100% grooming the kids. 100% bro. And it's not just to be trans. It's so they don't reproduce and so that their political activists on their side. Yep. That's what it's about. It's about a cultural decline, intentional crash of our cultural moral society in America. It's what it is. It happened already in history, dude. I talk about it all the time. Why am I Republic? Go fucking read about it. Anyway, fuck this guy. Yeah. 100%. Bro, these people are going to lose on this issue. Like, I'm telling you, like, I feel like I got a pretty good ground level fucking temperature. Maybe people aren't being as known about it yet, but they're fucking pissed off about this. Joe. They are. I agree. Yeah. Even the gay people are pissed off. They're like, bro, we have we're legitimate, well adjusted, homosexual people who have jobs and careers in this mess. And these fucking child groomers are trying to lump themselves in with us. Fuck them. And that's dude, you guys got to stand up, dude, to that. You guys got to stand up. We're not having that in the world, bro. We're not having a fucking we're not we're not going to trans fucking eight year olds and fucking child prostitution. And you date you're you being 40 years old and this is the truth. No, it's it's bro. I told somebody on Facebook just that today, man. We had a conversation going back and forth on this fucking post and this guy's trying to explain to me how it's, you know, the LGBT, all the alphabet should be protected and all of this. You know, I said, hey, listen, listen, walking a bathroom with my daughter, I dare you. Yeah. Like it's literally that simple. It is that simple. We saw the video of that woman up at the, uh, the swim meet the NCAA Championship. There was a because Leah Thomas was fucking swimming with the girls dominating. Congratulations, bro. There's a dude in the pool. Listen, but dude, this motherfucker, there's a there's a fucking six foot two fucking 300 pound man with fucking long hair trying to go in the women's bathroom and dress on this little and this little lady who I can I fucking con like I believe she was a parent of a massive respect. Oh, said, uh, you're not going in the fucking girls bathroom. Right. And he's like, well, I don't care if you don't like it. I have just as much right. And she's like, the fuck you do. And like, bro, that's what's got to happen. If you people don't start standing up in public to these motherfuckers, this is not about acceptance. Right. Everybody does deserve respect. If you want to be trans and you want to walk around and you want to have that surgery and do all those things, I support a fuck out of you, bro. You should not be getting harassed. You should be treated kindly. You should have all the rights of every other citizen. But the minute that you start talking about other people's fucking kids that you could teach them whatever you want and do whatever you want. And minor attractive people, you are you are playing with motherfucking nuclear bombs, bro. And they don't even fucking get it yet. I believe this issue will be the issue that puts everybody over the edge. That's my opinion. It will be the issue. It is. It already is. It is the is so many people in my DMS that are that don't necessarily agree with how I think, which mostly people don't because I'm crazy. That's fine. But the point is, I have a lot of people who listen to the show that don't agree. You guys don't think that, but it's the truth. I have a lot of people who hit me up DMS and tell me everything they disagree about. And that's cool too. I fucking that's your right. I'm just expressing my fucking thoughts. Hopefully, if you take anything away from the show, you should take this. When you're authentic to yourself, good things happen. I'm authentic to what my beliefs are. And my beliefs are, if you fuck with kids, I don't care if I go to fucking jail. That's the I mean, find me a cop though. That's right. If I'm who's going to arrest me for that. That's what I'm saying. And the good thing is, bro, we live in St. Louis. I'll be out in three days. Well, as long as Kim Gardner's in fucking power, you will get kicked out and then might have to actually go there. But my point is the cops should refuse to arrest people like this. That's what I'm saying. And I think they will, dude. Most cops are like fucking conservative people. Yeah. Let me pay the picture for you. Cop pulls up because bro, I love Target. Okay. Everybody knows this DJ loves Target. Really? Oh, bro. Listen, I love Target. Really? Yeah. I love Target. And what's your favorite thing about Target? The mahogany section. I'm sorry, Magnolia section. It's like the home to courtship. And Jojo. That's that shit. You should go to fucking home goods, man. I fuck with home goods too. Like I do fuck with home goods. Home goods and spot. You guys like that shit. I like to Emily comes home with all these little fucking gadgets and shit. Like, dude, you saw what I do with them? What I do. I put them under the fucking sink. I said, me got a ball for a basket full of balls. Like, I got this fucking big basket on my table up in the office. And it's always in the fucking way of shit I'm trying to do. Fucking it looks as came from home goods. Clearly. It looks nice though. No, it doesn't. It looks good underneath the sink up there. Why never see it. No, you're right though about this being the issue that unites people because it's interesting how different people are. Hold on. You're doing MFCO. See, see what we do here is we go way off track. So what you're trying to do is your old job. I appreciate that. Anyway, tell us about Target. Yeah, target. Like the cop fucking pulls up because I just beat fucking Michael's ass because he was probably was fucking Michelle. Cop pulls up. Mr. Johnson. Did you beat us? I sure did. I'm talking about Wama. Huh? No, just another mic. Not like I said, sir. Did you be? Why did you beat his ass? Well, because he went into the restroom with my daughter. Yeah. Is that fucking what you're gonna do? Listen, dude, they're playing with fucking fire, bro. This is a line that 80% of people hate this dude. This is this is gonna this. I don't know what the fuck these people think if they're doing it, if they're truly that ignorant, but this is going to create massive back off. Yeah. I appreciate it. I mean, I thank you. Yeah. You're giving your show to us who the fuck you are. Thank you. You know what I'm saying? So anyway, what were you saying? Well, no, I was just saying, I mean, this issue is creating very interesting allies because on the one hand, you had religious people who say, no, God created human beings, either man or woman. There's no like spectrum. But then on the other hand, you have fairly radical feminists who have no religious commitment and they're going, wait a minute. Are you literally telling me that the woman of the year is Rachel Levine? Right. And the person who won me, Ralph, you know, whatever, the NCAA swimming championship is a biological male. Like, something's wrong with this. With a dick, dude. This is incredibly anti-transitioned female. It's a like the dude, the dude changes in their locker room with his dick out. Yeah. Well, that's crazy. Did you hear about the letter written to the NCAA by the, I think she's from Russia, but she, she's one of the best swimmers at Virginia Tech and she missed the qualifying finals by one. But I loved her. I loved her approach. It wasn't necessarily my approach, but her approach was, listen, Leah can do whatever Leah wants to do. I celebrate her, but it is morally wrong for this person to compete as a biological male in women's sports. And so I liked it. I mean, she had a very nuanced attitude toward it, but I think more and more people are starting to come out for different reasons. They're starting to say, this is not okay. You know, all right. So, that's enough about Dix. Got Joe Biden, Lee Thomas. Yeah. Let's talk about something else. All right. Our final segment of the show, ladies and gentlemen, our thumbs up section, where I show a headline to see if they're gonna get two thumbs up or two thumbs in the butt. And with that being said, all right, we're going through. Yeah, I'm all three. Are you sure? Yeah, we had a breaking news at first. Yeah, everything. Yeah. All right. Move it. Our thumbs up headline reads, I got my girlfriend's lips tattooed on my face and instantly regret it. Oh, man. Oh, fuck. So a man reportedly got his girlfriend's lips tattooed on his face before getting a phone call that made him instantly regret it. A tic-tac video posted by official feel good ink shows the man in a tattoo chair while in the process of getting his face inked. The man sent to Texas girlfriend showing showing her the still in progress tattoo saying, baby, I got your lips on me forever. The message read moments after he sent the text message to the man phone, rain. The man believed his girlfriend was calling to say OMG, babe. He says in the video, here's the video for you guys. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Whatever, though, hello. Okay. So we're gonna get it for two weeks. Hold on, bro. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Bro. Wait, what? You're a petite. Are you serious? What the fuck do you mean? Like you got my lips tattooed on you. Are you supposed to swear? What? That's just fucking coming to hell. You're fucking me. So we're gonna get it for two weeks. So they've only been together for two weeks. That's a psycho shit, bro. Yeah. Yeah, I, you know, that's what happens when you don't treat fucking when you don't bring up that guy's young. He's probably thinking he's 22. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. Okay. This is what happens when you teach when you don't teach people the reality of life. No, I'm being serious. I'm being serious. Yeah. The guy that's probably his first fucking girlfriend. He's probably all excited. You know, he thinks he's doing something super romantic. And I'm one without a dick. Yeah. No, no, I'm just saying, bro, this goes back to what I what I was talking about a couple weeks ago is like we have these women who raise these men and don't tell them the truth about shit and tell them like all this hopeless romantic, you know, shit that isn't real. And this is the shit they do. They do crazy shit. I mean, dude, I feel bad for this dude. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's kind of pride. He's like surprised. He's like, give a fucking weird. He's like, what do you mean? We've only been together two weeks. Yeah. You heard like it was probably hard to hear, but he said, he said, oh, she's gonna say OMG, babe. Yeah. So happy. Yeah. No, she didn't say that. And you know, bro, now you look like a fucking idiot forever. Yeah. I'm gonna get that shit lasered off or grow a beard. First of all, dude, I'm gonna be real. Like, I don't feel like people that are under the age of 30, she even be getting tattooed. And I know that you're under 30 and have tattoos. I am heavily tattooed. I have almost three years of conversation. I have 300 hours of fucking tattooing. I didn't start until I was 34. All right. So and so you don't even know who the fuck? Vaughn, do you know who the fuck you are before you're 30 years old? No. Not at all. You don't? And all of you guys, do you, Joe? Did you? Okay. You think you do. So that's out of the six people in this room, or seven people in this room, there's three of us that are fucking above 30. Now, are you, how do you? 32. Are you? Did you, how much have you figured out in the last couple of years? I feel like there's a sudden switch that happens inside your mind once you turn 30. I don't know what it is, but you try to, you start to figure it out. It's different. 100% and right. Like, once in, you feel like you have everything figured out, but you don't. Bro, remember like those barbed wire tattoos everybody got? Remember that shit? Yeah. No, for real. I thought that shit was cool when it was fucking, when it was in. Like when it was in, like I wanted to get a barbed wire tattoo. And I have fuckers. Think of my motherfucking ass had a barbed wire tattoo right now. Yeah. Right? Yeah. Okay. So that should tell you, like, even I don't have the fuckership figured out. I'd be walking around with, you guys would make a fun in my shit. Right? Yeah. This guy is, this disappoints me, dude. Yeah. Because like this is not just like a funny situation where this one got, like this is an epidemic that men do not understand how to be men and how to date women. And you know, they think it's Netflix and chill and this and that and this. And we've talked about this on MFCO a bunch of times. Bro, like these dudes, you guys have no fucking clue what you're doing. And like the women that you girls who are posting your tits and ass and shit, thinking that that's fucking right. Like, dude, you have no idea what the fuck you're doing. Yeah. No idea. You guys are ruining your lives and you don't even fucking know it. It's going to be, it is what it is, man. Yeah. It's fucked up. Like we got to have, we got to start teaching these younger kids, like how to actually deal with women. And vice versa. It's not just about getting some fucking pussy, bro. I'm sorry. Like I know that's exciting to you when you're fucking 20 years old and 22. And you think, oh man, I'm, you know, doing some like, and guess what? It's still cool when you're 42, but you got to understand that that shit that you're trying to do can ruin your fucking life if you don't understand it. And like dating someone for two weeks and getting a fucking lips tattooed on your face is the epitome of of what this man has probably been taught his whole life. It's, it's, it's tragically needy too to be that. Oh god. I mean, like to do that for two weeks to be dating her for two weeks. Yeah, but on that's, that, that neediness is bred into men. Yeah. And women are not attracted to it. Right. Like dude, women are waiting for you motherfucker. You guys think I'm crazy dude. And I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. I'm telling you right now, be a fucking real man. Stand up for shit. Have a fucking voice and you'll have more girls and you know what the fuck can do it. Okay. But doing this kind of shit is going to get you the same. It's going to get you in dysfunctional dysfunctional toxic, all that shit over and over and over and over over again. It's okay to do the things that, that are good manners. Hold the door. Pull out a chair. This, that, this, this, this. But there's a baseline of fucking man respect that has to be laid down first. Yeah. And these fucking kids don't know how to do that because the single mom's raising them don't teach them that. They teach them, oh, be a hopeless romantic and send her flowers or you know, get your lips tattooed on you. I don't know who would say that. But my point is, is that girl, yeah, but girls don't value that at that age. That's that's women who are raising boys filling in what they're missing into their sons and their sons go out and try to do this shit and they get stomped on by women, dude. Stomped on. Stomped on. Like stomped on. I do. How many, how many young men killed themselves because the female in their life did some fucked up shit to them? Like bro, we got, we got to start teaching our kids different. This is fuck done. And it's fucking bothers me. And I feel bad for this kid. And if this kid, which he doesn't listen to show, but if you do, we'll get that shit laser off dude. Like right now. Yeah. And the rest of your bullshit tattoos you got. Wait till you can afford some good ones. Yeah, that's shit. I'm being real. That was real shit. That's why I didn't get tattooed till I was 34 because you know what? A real fucking tattoo artist. Guess what? Shit's expensive. Yeah, well, I don't know that the real tattoo artists won't do that shit. No, every tattoo artist I know personally who are the top ones in the world, artists, they would tell that dude to get the fuck out of here. Exactly. It's real man. Well, obviously guys, that's two thumbs in the butt. So God, I feel sorry for this kid. Yeah. Like look at his face. Yeah, you can see it in his eyes, man. Yeah. That's sad. He's defeated, bro. Yeah. Well, dude, it's a no win. It's a no win. It's fucking terrible. Bro, you young man, you got to get your fucking house in order in terms of finances, in terms of your physique, in terms of your career, and all that shit before you ever even think about like getting a girlfriend, in my opinion. That's just my opinion. Or you meet someone who's on that same track and be a girlfriend boyfriend with them. You know, like this shit is crazy, dude. I'm glad I grew up when I grew up. I'm just going to say that. Yeah. Or you and who you grew up around. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No shit, dude. That's a big one too. Well, Andy, Ron, guys. Yeah, it's just two thumbs in the butt. Well, that's all I got. All right. Share show. Bitch, booty, slow. Gotta own bank, roll, kang, fold. Dusted, no. Hit, shot, case, close, close."
