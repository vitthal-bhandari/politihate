    "text": " We're back with another edition of the Federalist Radio Hour. I'm Emily Jaczynski, Culture Editor here at The Federalist. As always, you can email the show at radio at thefederalist.com. Follow us on Twitter at FDRLST. Make sure to subscribe wherever you download your podcasts as well. Today, I'm happy to be joined by Ginny Gentles. She is the Director of the Education Freedom Center over at the Independent Women's Forum. Ginny, thank you so much for joining us. Thanks so much, Emily, looking forward to our conversation. So, folks, I'm also a Senior Fellow over at IWF and just believe a lot in what you guys do. So, Ginny, I want to start. I think this is a good entry point into this broader conversation we're going to have, but just could you start by telling us about the Education Freedom Center? It's a fairly new project of IWFs. What are you all up to at the center? Well, Emily, as you know, a lot of the women who work at IWF are mothers and we were impacted very directly by school closures during the COVID era and looked around and realized some of the theoretical work that we might be doing, the discussions that we're having about school choice and the benefits of school choice really apply not to just small groups anymore, but everyone. The school system utterly failed in its educational mission, the utterly abandoned its educational mission, closed schools, created a learning loss crisis, and refused to open, refused to listen to parents. And even when school started opening again, refused to get masks off kids, even though it was very clear that children's speech and reading, learning and acquisition were severely impacted by masks, not to mention the impact on their social development. So between school closures and masks, and then what we were seeing as we looked over the shoulder of our children into Zoom classrooms, what was being taught, it was very clear that a lot of these schools were, again, abandoning their educational mission, not focusing on academics and instead focusing on various ideologies and in fact, seemingly indoctrinating kids into these ideologies. And so at IDAB if we realized, okay, we need to stop just writing op-eds and talking about school choice and educational freedom and we need to connect what's happened during the COVID era, what's happened with these ideologies, having captured the education system, to education freedom and let mothers, parents know that opening up the school system, creating opportunities for families to leave, creating a threat to the school districts that families will leave and take their enrollment funding with them if they're not responsive. That has to happen. And so we decided to launch the Education Freedom Center, elevate the voices of parents, celebrate different education freedom and school choice initiatives around the country, shine the light on what's happening with these ideologies in classrooms and on the good news, that there are movements like classical education, and that parents do have very positive options out there. Right, that there are real alternatives that allow you to sort of escape a failing system. And, Janie, if I'm not mistaken, you were fairly involved as a parent in Northern Virginia and Northern Virginia was a hot spot. It's one of those places that always gets excess media coverage because so much of the media is in DC in Northern Virginia. But over the course of COVID, there were very real, very newsworthy happenings in Northern Virginia schools as it related to lockdowns, as it related to health measures. And I know you got involved in some of that. Can you tell us what your experience was like as just as a parent, I'm trying to deal with some of those. Right, well, I live in Little Arlington County, which is a small county near Fairfax and Loudon, the two giant Northern Virginia counties that got all of the media attention. But honestly, Arlington really deserved a lot more of the attention and still does because a lot of these problems originate in the school districts that are easy to capture and areas where parents just feel like, well, I spent a lot on my house. I have an absolutely massive mortgage. Therefore, I'm sending my children to good schools. And so they don't question that these quote unquote good schools are actually doing their job and they don't really pay very close attention or monitor what's being taught and what's happening until the school districts close the schools and refuse to open them for well over a year. And so my county Arlington was was one of those school districts we closed in in mid March of 2020, like like many other areas around the country. And students did not return full time again until fall of 2021. Oh my gosh, the school district open on a very part time basis for some students in the spring of 2021 over a year later after closing to shortened days, which is shocking. This is a year of children's life that was taken from them by a district that did not train their teachers on how to deliver education remotely, did not develop a curriculum that could be provided remotely. In fact, in the spring of 2020, I had a middle school student and an elementary school student. And the middle school student, the then sixth grader was told, you can keep the grades that you had in mid March when we closed the schools, or you can do a little extra work for the rest of the school year and try to get them up. But there was no class, there was no Zoom school in Arlington County. There were no classes for her to log into. And there was no incentive to do any coursework because she had all A's. Why do more? And so it was up to me as a parent to kind of create and structure her academic experience to ensure that she learned something during the rest of the school year. And then for my elementary student back in that spring, I was told, I think maybe just work on math and reading with them, but no more than 20 minutes per day for my then third grader. It's insane, right? That's insane. And again, no online school, no instruction provided. There were some, you know, you could click around in the difficult to navigate Google system and try to find little packets to download. But that's definitely not something that a third grader could access on their own. So school was done for that school year. And again, like 2020, 2021, they basically abandoned that school year as well. And so I left. And I knew that my children have special needs. And I knew that the school district was not going to prepare them for anything academically. And so we enrolled in the state virtual school. But I did plug into a local parent group here in the county that fought really hard to try to open schools to no avail. And now is trying really hard to hold the district accountable for learning loss. Sometimes they also tried to hold the district accountable for the federal emergency spending. The millions of dollars that that districts have been receiving in federal emergency spending 190 billion overall across the country. And again, to no avail because the districts don't care. They're going to do what they want to do. Amazing. And it's just, and this is where it kind of goes into it. Most people think it can't get worse, although I think we probably all realize that it can at this point. Jenny, you sent an email to Molly Hemingway and myself about a tweet that Molly posted earlier this week where she said, was trying to find a new practice because at a recent doctor's appointment, a male doctor dressed as a woman asked my daughter if she quote, identified as female, she replied, no, I am female, good for her. But if anyone knows of a Northern Virginia practice, that's safe and sane, please let me know. And we were talking about the education system. And this isn't to pivot to the medical system at all. It's actually the same thing because the medical system, the funnel, the only funnel, it's a one way road into medical practice. And that's through our education system, obviously for some good reasons. But the consequences of that are in ideology that has come to capture not just the medical industry, but many others. This one though for parents, I imagine is particularly concerning. So I'm glad you reached out Jenny because I think it's really worth amplifying the voices of parents who have experienced this. Have you seen this yourself in not just Northern Virginia? I'm sure you've heard from other folks around the country at this point, but how concerned should parents be about this? I hope parents to be totally and completely concerned. And it takes a while to really realize what's going on. And that's what's happened with the schools, right? We're just now becoming aware of what the schools are teaching, what these books are exposing children to, what these lessons play on, drafted by activists are teaching and preaching to them. And just how captured these teachers, particularly the young women, having recently come out of education schools, just how captured they are by this ideology when we're talking about gender ideology or the desire to push trans identity and pressure children into choosing them. We're just now realizing that with schools, I don't think parents have realized how much they're going to be encountering this in all aspects of the medical community in upcoming years. And they've got to go in eyes open and with a script prepared and with a pushback ready because it's everywhere. And I'm here, Molly's here in Northern Virginia, where a lot of these things tend to start warning you, it's coming if it's not already there in the medical providers. So that Molly's tweet was actually sent to me by Nicole Solis, who works with us at IWS and lives in Rhode Island. And she had an experience in Rhode Island where her pediatricians practice had slapped on trans activist stickers right at children's eye level in all of the waiting rooms. And so her, I think then five year old was asking her to read her what the sticker, the colorful sticker said. And so Nicole went to go confront the practice and say, I'm not comfortable exposing my children to the conversations about sex and sexual identity and gender and gender identity at this young age, please remove the stickers or put me in a waiting room that doesn't have one. And the conversation concluded with Nicole being kicked out of the practice and forced to find a new pediatrician. So that is a possibility in a state like Rhode Island that is not necessarily what parents are going to encounter in other places. They should speak up. I feel like kind of a worst case scenario. But this definitely happens everywhere I go in my area, the pediatric dentist, the orthodontist, the pediatrician, every therapy practice, they're all captured in this area by gender ideologies. We talk about internet privacy here all of the time. So most of us know that our internet service provider basically knows literally everything we do online. I mean, it's just true. You might as well be handing your laptop to a stranger and opening up your browsing history. That's why having a VPN is an absolute must every time you go online.

PIA vpn.com slash federalist. Yeah, and I was excited to talk about this. Maybe excited is the wrong word eager to talk about this because I had a strange experience over the summer on I had an exchange that was on a show I hosted at the time with a pro abortion activist who referred to pregnant people and I stepped in and corrected and said pregnant women. And that kind of went viral turned into a little bit of a scuffle and I heard from a very trusted physician who I knew to be on the right that basically was upset and said we know it's not the case that just just women can have children can get pregnant. And it was really again like a trusted physician I need to be on the right. It was really, really surprising moment and not is somebody who's more advanced in their career and very removed from the current educational system and what I find very frightening is not just that this is happening now, but that where we will be in 30 or so years, you know, it can't this stuff will not go away with a so called vibe shift because it's now deeply embedded in the moral codes of a lot, a lot, a lot of people and to correct that to change that. I don't know how that happens. I mean, it just seems like an incredibly daunting task that, you know, when you're looking down the road, not just that right now, but who was going to be in control of some of these institutions years from now, that's what I find the most frightening. Well, it's not just who will be controlled in the institution. It's as I'm looking at, you know, aging over the next couple of decades and wondering what my doctors are going to know about the female body. You know, like a heart attack in a female is different than a heart attack in a male. We know that I know that, but these younger doctors will and medical professionals will not have been trained in the biological differences between females and males because the captured institutions are not allowed to teach that, you know, there are biological differences between females and males. And that is a real danger and a real risk. And so I just, I fear for people as they age and their current doctors age out of the profession and these younger doctors come in with no real knowledge about how to treat a female body versus a male body, which puts people at real medical risk. Yeah, something absolutely needs to be done, you know, to give a personal example. I have a neurodiverse daughter with short hair. And so when we were on an online, like post-COVID check, you know, you had to back a few, even a few months ago, you had to get a check with the doctor in order to return to school. And the nurse practitioner hopped on the line, saw the short hair and immediately started referring to my daughter as they. And when she got off, my daughter left the call, I spoke with the young woman, this new nurse practitioner and said, look, you know, we've been with this practice and she was born almost 14 years. Like since she was born, why are you doing this? Like, why do you look at a child's short hair and see that maybe they're a little different and immediately go to a they pronoun. And so this young woman in the way that social justice warriors do immediately said that she felt uncomfortable and attacked. And by me asking her these questions and so the conversation had to come to an end. So of course I look her up and she graduated from University of Virginia in 2019. And so I'm realizing, oh, she probably like her program probably taught her that there's no other way of thinking about these kinds of things. You see, you know, you look at children, you base their pronouns on gender stereotypes and it's morally wrong if you're questioned for doing that. So I don't know what the solution is, Emily. I hope that you do or someone does, but something needs to be done about these these nursing and medical programs now. Yeah. Yes, because there's a piece I always think back on that was published on Barry Weiss's sub stack. It was written by Katie Herzog who did a fairly deep dive into the politicization of medical schools and that basically like the profession in general, even hospitals. And one of the really striking cases that Katie highlighted was in an emergency room. There were BLM protesters essentially saying there should not be police allowed in an emergency room and the police were saying we are here to protect people from gang members who come back to try to finish the job. Not an unkindment thing. You can save lives by having police officers in emergency rooms. And the BLM activists had sort of successfully pushed them out of the emergency room. And this is a good example of how actually the ideology is costing lives kind of immediately. Like right now, people are in danger because of the fealty to this ideology. And the solution has to be starting to, in my perspective, and Jenny, I'm curious what do you think because you work on this on the policy side and talk to parents all the time, start suing people for sex discrimination, start suing people for race discrimination based on certain policies, certain teachings. We've seen this start to be used in at the education level where curricula or even like corporate HR curricula includes just outright sexist racist teachings that are being taught under the banner of anti racism or anti sexism, feminism, whatever it is. The only thing I can think of as lawsuits and even then lawsuits of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But even then, I just have a hard time seeing how we deal with the people who have already sort of been taught to see all of this as the appropriate moral code. Right. There has to be some sort of mass deprogramming that would go on or. Again, I don't know what to do about the these people who have been taught incorrectly in medical school and nursing school. But and I'm so glad that you mentioned the Katie Herzog piece on Barry Weiss's substack because sometimes I think things have a life on Twitter and on substack for a day, maybe three, and then we move on. But that reporting that she did was incredibly revealing. And I had no idea that these medical students had so much power over their professors. She gave an example, I believe in that piece where to that issue of of using the terminology pregnant people and not only implying that that women get pregnant, the medical students like rose up against their professor and then the professor profusely apologized, which is ridiculous. Like if you are a professor at a medical school and you have supposedly smart grown up students attending your classes, you should be able to stand your ground and and make it clear that there are female bodies and male buddies. And that's the deal and then teach accordingly. Otherwise we're endangering society. So yeah, everyone should read Katie Herzog's substack piece there. Well, the other thing is you asked you, Jenny, is you mentioned earlier that people need to have a script to prepare for these conversations with doctors. And that seems to me, I think one thing that's powerful because the powerful thing that brought a lot of this to the fore that was sort of lingering in the fringes of academia for decades, you know, coming from folks like Judith Butler and on down the line, it was always on the fringes. And when it starts to take off, it's because there becomes a social stigma to not agreeing with it. There should be a social stigma to agreeing with all of these things. And what you mentioned about sort of preparing parents with a script for things they really might not expect. Maybe they don't live in Northern Virginia. Maybe they live in Wisconsin where the trusted physician I referenced is and they will still be confronted with this stuff. It no longer matters if you're in a red or a blue state because folks around the country have gone through the state schools, public schools, where all of this stuff is sort of taught as fact. But what should that look like? Do you have any ideas of how parents sort of tactically, strategically and compassionately can approach these conversations when they're confronted with them? Yeah. And let's make sure we talk about the lawsuits too because you're absolutely right that lawsuits have to be going forward. And they are. And like you said, this isn't just in Northern Virginia. It's not just in California. Parents might think that at this point. But one example of a lawsuit right now is in Iowa. Parents defending education has helped move forward in a lawsuit against an Iowa school district that is pushing the gender ideology, pushing the lessons and the pronoun rituals in an extremely aggressive way. So this ideology is everywhere. The lawsuits are going to be everywhere. And the scripts need to be in place everywhere. And I think one of the challenges that I still have, even though I do live in this particularly captured area, is that I'm surprised, in part because I've been going to these practices taking my children there for so long. We had moved away from the area and then moved back in 2015. Okay. So we've been here. We've been back seven years, right? Seven years. We've been back a long time and either return to practices that we were at since my children were babies or have been consistently going all these years since the beginning of 2015. But a number, but I'm encountering this issue everywhere I go, including at the pediatric dentist just last week. And so I'm still surprised. And I think that is the clear message that I want to have out there right now. It sounds like Molly was a little surprised by her practice. And Molly knows exactly what's going on with it with this issue. I'm still surprised. And we all need to stop. We should still be shocked. This is happening. This is shocking. This is ridiculous that they're putting this pressure on the children to go through these pronoun rituals to choose one of the 100 plus gender identities to assume that they're not just male or female, that it's being implied by the dentist, by the orthodontist, by the doctor, by their counselor, it's being implied that they could be a boy, a girl, both or neither. This whole swirl of confusion and pressure is being foisted on our children. So we should be shocked by that, but we should no longer be surprised. This is going to happen in your area. It could very likely happen to your family. And it's particularly going to happen if you have a child that doesn't conform to gender stereotypes because so much of this belief system is caught up in stereotypes. So again, a child with sensory issues, like a neurodiverse child, probably is going to cut their hair. A girl is going to cut her hair because of the sensory issues. The longer hair is uncomfortable. A neurodiverse person is generally gender nonconforming and therefore the clothing might be different than the stereotypical girl or boy of that particular age. And so parents, particularly of gender nonconforming kids, need to be ready to either call ahead to their doctor's office and find out who they're going to be seeing that day and what the practices are. And so a call ahead might be good to see if there are new people in the practice and if any new rituals have been put in place as a result. The parent should be prepared in the moment to gently redirect the person if they're suddenly for pronouns or assuming pronouns. And the parent should definitely be prepared to say no when they are ordered to step outside of the examination room. That is happening on a widespread basis in my area. And I'm hearing about it from parents in other areas that the practitioners want to get the children alone to talk about, and these are young children, to talk about sexual activity, sexual identity, and gender issues out of earshot. And so the parent can just gently say no, I'm going to stay put. And that gets away. And it doesn't have to be a confrontation, right? If you're prepared, there doesn't have to be conflict. It's just a gentle no. And then after the fact, so this is before call ahead, while you're there, be ready to gently say no, to gently redirect if they're going through pronoun and other rituals. And then afterwards, if be prepared to call the head of the practice, whoever is in the management position, which is what I did for our pediatric dentist, to ask, hey, we've been going to your practice since 2015, has something changed on a policy basis that now makes you go through this new pronoun ritual, your new dentist that you hired on was doing that. I've never encountered that before. So here's some good news. I was not kicked out of the practice. In fact, the woman said, no, no, no. This is the head of the practice the dentist who formed it. No, that's not what we're doing. I'm sorry. I'll address it. So good things can come from conversations when you're prepared to have one. This story is unbelievable, unbelievable until you discover the larger mechanics at play. Next month, the late co founder of Microsoft, Paul Allen sold his art collection for the record breaking sum of $1.6 billion. How, as most other markets and investments struggle, is fine art hitting record highs. Because it's got a low correlation to other investments. So when they take losses, your art investments don't have to. Masterworks knows this. That's why they qualify their paintings with the SEC. So you have security while you invest in art on their platform. It's also how Masterworks has been delivering real results this year, selling seven paintings. Their last three sales have delivered 13, 17 and 21% net returns to their investors. As a result, Masterworks even has a wait list. But you can skip it at masterworks.art slash federalist. That's masterworks.art slash federalist. See important reg aid disclosures at masterworks.com slash CD. Oh, that's so interesting and actually a source of a real source of optimism. I was going to say my colleague, Kylie Griswold, wrote a story this week. Actually, she reported out a story about how Children's Hospital in Wisconsin has hired a clearly like trans activists as the in the chaplain staff. And it's another just a good example of how this really does happen absolutely everywhere. Kylie wrote the first tip off to new endorps beliefs. This is one of the new chaplains about the sexes was featured prominently on the posters with the proclamation of program pronouns as she her hers. And those are for fiance a female who goes by they he and Jenny, the question I want to post to you because I'm not a parent is what the devil's advocate argument that I would anticipate to all of this is people on the left saying this is just pronouns. It's just adults, you know, identifying as they want to identify or it's just adults, you know, giving Children the option to identify how they want to identify. We're not talking in this context. You know, we haven't mentioned puberty blockers. We haven't mentioned any surgical interventions. This is all just labels and it's just optional. What are the dangers though from your perspective as a parent of the language? Like if we're just, let's say we're just talking about the language. What are the dangers of having that so embedded in the medical industry? Well, we know that this is a social contagion, particularly among girls, particularly among Children who might not have fit in, who and who felt uncomfortable socially and feel uncomfortable in their bodies. And so they grab onto this promise of trans joy. If only I embrace this identity, then I can opt out of girlhood because I never fit in in girls. I never knew how to navigate the complex world of girls. So I'm going to opt out of girlhood and I'm going to embrace this identity and I'm going to experience joy. Well, the joy doesn't just come from the pronouns. We know that it doesn't stop at that. The pronoun is the beginning of the rituals and then it leads to this obsessive rumination about what identity the child is. And you'll see online these videos of different teenagers and young adults just kind of cycling through different identities. Oh, I'm I'm Polly or I'm I'm I'm gender fluid or you know, it's they they go through all these different different identities. And unfortunately, a lot of the individuals who start with the pronouns cycle through their identities still don't find that satisfaction. Opting out of girlhood. Opting out of girl world didn't bring the trans joy. So they have to move on to the next step. And and the conversations that push them down the next step come when they're presenting their pronouns and their identities. So then the the people at the school, the people at the medical practices are like, Oh, okay, so you're trans, that must mean that I need to refer you to a gender clinic or a gender therapist or need to make sure you are aware of the hundreds of Planned Parenthood clinics who are providing cross sex hormones. And for for parents, they are pressured to start considering puberty blockers and rituals and and hormones for those kids. And unfortunately, some studies have shown that 98% of the kids who do go on the puberty blockers, then go on to the cross sex hormones, becoming potentially lifelong medical patients if they stick with it. And then we know that, you know, particularly the these girls who embrace either male gender fluid or non binary identities, then go and have their healthy breasts cut off in what's called top surgery. And then there's other surgeries beyond that. All of these things, puberty blockers, hormones, surgeries have incredible side effects and are quite dangerous for for these individuals when it comes to their mental health. You're putting an emotionally vulnerable young woman on a class three drug testosterone. I mean, it's it's a it's a controlled substance. That's going to mess with their mental health in a really significant way. And so you're you're you're pushing them. Yes, you're starting with pronoun rituals, but you're pushing them down this really dangerous, expensive, risky and and fraught path. And and so it has to stop the pronoun. It's not kind and inclusive. It's destabilizing. It's confusing and it's dangerous. Right. And it obviously legitimizes this ideology. Even if we're just talking about the language, everything you just explained is legitimized by the casual acceptance of this language or the casual sort of normalizing of this type of language in a way that I can imagine as a struggling teenager is exacerbating and already painful and difficult situation. Jenny, is there anything else you think is relevant relevant that people should be thinking about in this this context as parents, perhaps as people interested in policy solutions? Is there anything we missed in this conversation? Well, I think it's really important if we're talking about the social contagion and the fact that these young adults and these kids are being so pressured by the medical community and that and the teachers and all these adults who should be taking care of them but aren't. We need to recognize that that that that the social contagion could be stopped, not by these adults who've abandoned their responsibilities to keep kids safe. But if we get the kids listening to the D transitioners, I don't think that the kids are going to listen to their parents. Like they're in fact, the part of the ideology is to teach them not to listen to their parents. You must reject your family. If your family is gently questioning this, you must label everyone as bigoted and transphobic. You must count the days until you can escape this oppressive home life. So I don't think that some parents have been successful and watchful waiting and pulling their children away from the grips of this really cult-like mentality. But I think that elevating the voices of the D transitioners, these young women and young men who have maybe hit their mid 20s, their brains have now developed. They've been through this really awful experience of trying to feel better through all these hormones and these surgeries. But in fact, it didn't help at all. In fact, it did the opposite. And they're coming out on the other side saying, I never want that to happen to anyone else. I think that's who these kids need to listen to. I think the social contagion can be stopped if kids listen to youngish voices like these D transitioners. So anything that people can do to elevate their voices, an IWF has a wonderful identity crisis series. Our wonderful colleague Kelsey Bolar has produced a series of videos, including a number of videos of young women who are explaining what happened to them and making sure that other people know that this should not be happening. They should not have had their breast cut off. They should not have their voices permanently lowered because of testosterone. They should not be dealing with the emotional trauma of trying to pick up the pieces physically and emotionally after being put down this path. And I think we need to make sure we're sharing those identity crisis videos and empowering parents with them and hoping, hope, hope, hope that teenagers and young adults who are captured by this will watch them and think twice. Yeah, I was actually going to mention that because I remember there was a dinner about a month ago with IW folks and some of the people featured in the series and everybody should go take a look at them. The Federalist Senior contributor Kelsey Bolar did over with you guys at IWF because it's this people that are not just in Manhattan, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and are dealing with this either as it relates to their children and their relationships with their children or themselves. I mean, people who have gone through this process, been sucked into bad internet trends and have suffered and are still suffering because of it and are now brave enough to be speaking out about it, their stories should be amplified and understood. And I do actually think, Jenny, in this whole conversation, as we've been sort of looking to what might be a solution, those stories are solutions because they do stigmatize. The rigid dogma. I mean, if there's something that can cultivate a stigma in our society, it is seeing what has happened to people who sort of got sucked into and affected by the ideology. Those are really powerful stories. Their stories, the left doesn't want to tell, even when the left is often so good at storytelling. These are as powerful as any story that the left latches onto. And that, I can imagine, the more people are aware how this is harming the people, how real women, real parents, and just through these gateways that we've talked about, that I have to imagine. As a parent, Jenny, say you're not somebody that's plugged into this debate in politics in general, that's the kind of thing I imagine would change your mind. For sure. Yeah, the power of the stories is it's going to make a big big difference. Yeah, make sure to check that out. Folks, that's at IWF.org. Jenny Gentles, where can people find information about the Education Freedom Center? Well, IWF.org slash EFC for Education Freedom Center. We've got our work there. And I have a monthly newsletter, The Defender. I encourage people to sign up for that. And we have a podcast coming in students over systems. So stay tuned for our podcast. Awesome. All right. Well, Jenny, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. Appreciate it, Emily. Of course. Even listening to another edition of the Federalist Radio Hour, I'm Emily Jucinski, the culture editor here at The Federalist. We'll be back soon with more. Until then, be lovers of freedom and anxious for the fray."
