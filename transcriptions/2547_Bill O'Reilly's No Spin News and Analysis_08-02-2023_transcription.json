Bill O'Reilly, here you are listening to the O'Reilly update coming up next. The news with Mike Slater. Thank you, Bill. It is Wednesday, February 8th, 2023. Here's what's happening today in America. Biden's second state of the union address, also the Church of England debating kind of an important thing in a miracle in Turkey. That's all coming up. And then Bill, we'll be here with the message of the day. But first, Biden's second state of the union address last night. He's going to cure cancer. If I may, and Bill will surely give some more in-depth analysis, it was quite the hodgepodge from saving democracy to ending airport baggage fees. When it comes to the economy, what people care most about, the theme for Biden was the trend is our friend. Quote, inflation is coming down. Gas prices are coming down. Food prices are coming down. Inflation has fallen every month for the last six months. While take-home pay has gone up. As I stand here tonight, we've created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four. Sure. But when the government makes it illegal to go to work, we have quite the whole to dig ourselves out of the Church of England right now is officially debating whether or not to make God gender neutral to remove all references to he or him or our father. Replace them with more gender neutral or even female alternatives. Some members of the Church of England say a theological misreading of God as exclusively male is a driver of much continuing discrimination and sexism against women. The march through the institutions continues and the craziness grows. Meanwhile, trans rights activists have occupied the Oklahoma state capital and they're heralded as the great champions of democracy. This is what democracy looks like. 150 people enter the capital building protesting a bill that says only men can use the men's bathroom and women use the women's bathroom. Now, are these protesters or insurrectionists? Did they enter the capital or did they storm the capital? It's always how it's spun, ain't it? Yesterday we gave a terrible update on the earthquake in Turkey. Now it's over 7,000 people killed 5,000 buildings collapsed, but some miraculous news a baby was found in the rubble, but not just a baby. Like, I mean, just born. Like, how just try the umbilical cord was still attached to the mother. Mom and every other member of the family were killed by the rubble, but the baby survived. Could it be possible that the mom was trapped under the rubble and dying and then gave birth right before she passed away all while underneath the house that collapsed? Could that be the timing? It's unbelievable. The rescuers heard cries and said the baby wouldn't have survived another hour in the cold. A mics later, Bill, we'll be here with a message of the day next. Our home breaks. Contact their professionals to repair or replace it within the agreed-upon coverage limits. It's that easy to stay stress free and limit budget breaking surprises. Right now, take $50 off.

See ahs.com slash contracts for coverage and tales, including limit amounts, fees, limitations, and exclusions. Time now for the O'Reilly update, message of the day. If series of polls this week, say most Americans, including a sizable number of Democrats, do not want President Biden to run for re-election. That should come as little surprise as Mr. Biden is not really running this country. And voters see that. His advisors tell him what he needs to do. And Jill Biden sees that her husband complies. To be fair, which we always are, you have to admire the message discipline the Biden people put out. There's no problem at the border. Trump, not Biden is responsible for inflation. Afghanistan, a stunning success, as is the record breaking federal spending, the White House champions. Also, there are very few leaks coming out. Joe and Jill are not being exposed by insiders. You may remember Donald Trump couldn't hire enough plumbers to even slow down the harmful leaks during his administration. The primary problem President Biden and his party has now is a perception of weakness and incompetence. Trump may be bombastic and childish at times, but he is not weak. The USA is not an easy place in which to live these days is violence, corruption, and eroding spending power for the folks. Even those who avoid paying attention to their country, no things are not good. And the situation will not improve under Joe Biden, who's going downhill faster than Lindsey Vaughn. I'm Bill O'Reilly. I approve the message by writing it. You can reach me. Bill at bill riley.com. Bill at bill O'Reilly.com. Name in town if you wish to opine. Now let's go to the mail. Mark abradeitch, Struthers, Ohio. My wife and I are attending the Super Bowl as well. You have any advice on how to enjoy the moment. Get everywhere early. Okay. If you're going to have the dinner make your reservations now, it's going to be a zoo in Phoenix, the Valley of the Sun. I just walk around, stroll around, get to the park early, you know, just take in the ambiance. It's quite a spectacle. Dale Dalton, Los Angeles, outstanding interview Mike Pompeo. The best anywhere. Thank you for your excellent use, Cas who you're welcome, Dale. Bill Clark from Boston. I just wanted to reach out and say that I received your killing book series for my son as a Christmas gift. I just finished my first one, Killing Kennedy. Fantastic read. You have a great son, Bill. He gave you all 12 killing books. What a guy. Enjoy it. You'll be much smarter after reading all 12. Patrice Erickson Arlington, Texas. My granddaughter is thinking about pursuing a degree in broadcasting. You have any recommendations for school in Texas. It still teaches ethics. Texas A&M is probably the most fair school in Texas. But that's a concierge question. Concierge members can write to me about their kids and grandkids and all that. But I wanted to, Patrice, give you a heads up on that. Richard Varvel of Valparaiso, Indiana, assisted for years finally ordered the stand up for your country mug.

Now the O'Reilly update brings you something you might not know. On this day in 1990, CBS News suspended legendary broadcaster Andy Rooney from 60 Minutes for comments he made about African Americans and homosexuals. Here is the story. Rooney's career began while he was serving in the Army during World War II. He started writing for the Stars and Stripes as a correspondent for that newspaper. He also flew in bombing missions over Germany. Later, Andy Rooney began delivering his trademark commentary on 60 Minutes that began in 1978. In February 1990, Rooney was suspended after making the following statement, quote, Most people are born with equal intelligence, but blacks have watered down their genes because the less intelligent ones are the ones that have the most children. They drop out of school early, do drugs, and get pregnant unquote. Rooney also said gay marriage causes, quote, self-induced death and the concept is repugnant. Mr. Rooney initially denied that he said all that, but he did. The suspension by CBS, however, did not last long. The network reinstated the broadcaster a few weeks later after 60 Minutes plummeted in the ratings. On March 5th, Andy Rooney returned. He remained on 60 Minutes for another 21 years. Old Andy delivered his final farewell in October 2011. And all this time I've been paid to say what is on my mind on television. You don't get any luckier in life than that. This is a moment I've dreaded. I wish I could do this forever. I can't though, but I'm not retiring. Writers don't retire and I'll always be a writer. Andy Rooney was hospitalized 20 days after his final appearance on 60 Minutes. He died on October 25th, 2011 at the age of 92 back after this. Thank you for listening to the O'Reilly update. I am Bill O'Reilly, no spin, just facts, and always looking out for you."
