Investing made better. Hi, I'm Annamarie Cox. Welcome to With Friends Like These, a show about difficult conversations, awkward pauses, and relationships, and politics, and politics, and relationships. Really happy about the show this week. I get to talk to two of my very favorite people in the world. In the second part of the program, I talk to Doreen St. Felix, who is, for now, a colleague of mine at MTV News. She writes about everything under the sun, music, fashion, politics, culture. And we talk about the legacy of Hillary Clinton and what the autopsies of her campaign get right and wrong. And I think most enjoyably, to be honest, we talk about aesthetics of the presidency. From Trump to Obama and Obama to Trump, she's got such great insight on that stuff. I think I might have her back as my regular fashion correspondent. But up first is Parker Malloy. If you're on Twitter, you might follow her. She is hilarious and topical and feisty. She's at Parker Malloy. She's a writer for Upworthy.com. And she happens to be a trans person. And I talked to her about her decision to be out and what's that like from her side of the screen coming right up. Let's just dive right in because I know I don't have that long. So you do spend a lot of time on Twitter. I do as well. And that's sort of where I know you. Know you from. Basically, this show could be People I Know from Twitter, the podcast. And I believe actually our first few interactions, correct me if I'm wrong, were actually somewhat salty as I recall. Yeah. Totally. First off, I mean, I have a tendency to sometimes be a little. I used to be a little more of a firebrand. You know, used to be a little more of a flamethrower. But yeah, yeah, if I remember correctly, I forgot what it was. But yeah, there was something you said that it's just like, yeah, our interaction was not exactly positive. Right. It was one of the things where we disagreed in a way that still worked out to where I was like, okay, I guess I'll follow her. But I want to say specifically, it had something to do with trans activism, I think. I think so. I can't I can't recall what the exact situation was. I think it's funny that we can't recall what it is. But I think that's important because, you know, you were probably the first like kind of non-celebrity trans person that I had like a significant kind of interaction with. Right. And you, it's in, you know, it's in what you do. You're very out about it. And I listen, I mean, I remember thinking to myself, well, you know what, like, I gosh, I gotta, I should listen to this person, you know, like this person speaking from experience that I don't have. And I said something. And I actually think it was something where I kind of said, I might I gave some ground. Like you brought some authority and some, you know, thoughtfulness to the conversation, I believe you were salty. But you I remember thinking like, okay, I should listen to this person. And the reason why I sort of mentioned this kind of specifically is because, you know, I wanted to talk to you about the concept of outness and being out. Like you being out is what gave what made me kind of like pause more than I would for someone else, which maybe isn't fair, maybe speaks badly with me. But it was important. Yeah. You won't. So, so the whole, the whole thing about being out, not being out, it's it's a very personal sort of decision. I mean, my my my my my person, like I just have no confidence in myself. I would always assume that everyone I'd run into would just immediately know I'm trans. And that's not the case. Like, if I it turns out if I talk to strangers, I can know know people and, you know, see them in person and talk to them and whatever. And then and like they don't know I'm trans until they like stumble across some article that I wrote and they're like, wait, I didn't know this was like, yeah, I'm just going to you know, no biggie. But I just assume that everyone would would be able to tell or would figure it out. So I was just like, I'm just going to be really open with it. So I would introduce myself in a way that was always very much like awkward, like, hey, I'm trans and I hope that's not a big deal. And you know, like I just just I'm trying to be a normal person. Like, like not like grocery stores and stuff, right? But, you know, yeah, not a person. You can't wait. Someone knew. Right. And that was it because it was a big fear of mine. It was like, because all I want it, all I still want in the world is to really just be able to blend in and exist. And you know, I love it in the world. I didn't have to talk about trans stuff that these issues just kind of went away. But sadly, they aren't anytime soon. And it's really disappointing. But yeah, I mean, I had kind of that decision. Like, do I, you know, do I kind of stay stealth or hidden or, you know, hide who I am? But then I noticed that there was a lot happening in the media around the time I came came out as trans where things were just being reported so horribly. People were being called the wrong names, the wrong pronouns. But they were just, you know, it was still a time where trans people were being treated like that, like, like freaks of nature, essentially. By mainstream news outlets by like CNN and, you know, MSNBC, like, it was bad. And so I started blogging and I started just blogging about my experience. And I never thought that anyone would actually want to pay me to write. I think I remember writing you an email being like, how do I find a job writing? And you're like, it's hard. And that was, it was so helpful. Yeah. Well, but it's true. It's like there's, there's no clear cut way. So it was one of those things where it's just like, I'd write things and then I'd send emails to random editors that find online to be like, hey, interested in running a piece about, you know, something trans related. They, you know, a lot of, a lot of the reaction is really cold up until when Chelsea Manning came out as trans. But suddenly I went from having no one interested in running any of my articles to suddenly people were running to, running to me, sending me emails and be like, hey, hi, I'm so and so from whatever, I'm really interested in running an article of yours about trans stuff. Because it was, it was a situation where it was another non-celebrity trans person who just came out. And a lot of people were very confused about these types of things. So, you know, it was kind of, it was kind of cool. It wasn't someone in Hollywood. It was, it was someone whose situation and circumstances were very controversial in themselves. So then you add this layer to it and it's like, how do we talk about this? And that's where I kind of came in and got a few, got a few writing gigs. And it's all kind of been, you know, it's all kind of gone from there. And I never really expected to be so out with being trans, but, you know, that kind of what laid the foundation for at least a couple of years of writing about almost exclusively trans stuff until I was able to establish myself and start writing and talking about things that don't have to do with trans issues. It's a delicate thing in a way. I mean, I've talked to my friends who are people of color writers, who are people of color about this too, where, you know, you want, you know, you can't blame editors for wanting to have an authentic voice and again, have someone that brings a particular set of experiences to a topic, right? You want to have someone speak with authority and authenticity about something, but at the same time, like, that can't be the, you can't like look at that person is the, that's the only thing they can write about, you know, like it's not really fair to anyone. But I want to get back a little bit, because you said, you know, you just assume everybody knows and that you are self-conscious about that. And, you know, the one sort of place in my life where I can draw a little bit of trying to think a little bit about what I might feel that could be what like you're feeling. I obviously can't put myself completely in your place. But it's about, you know, being out as an alcoholic and as someone who has mental health issues, which is that I have actually, when I first like kind of realized as an alcoholic and trying to get sober, I did kind of assume that that was something that everyone knew and I might as well just start saying it. Like and also you get so used to saying it in meetings, like I would be like, I would be like walking into people in grocery stores and be like, hi, I'm an alcoholic, you know. And it didn't, yeah, it didn't feel like, you know, it was a choice on one level, but at the same time, I kind of felt like, well, I better just, you know, like kind of go with this, right? Like, yeah, it's, it's, I also, because I think we might have this in common, I don't quite know how to be anything else. I don't quite know how to cover it up. Like, yeah, I think that's really interesting. Because yeah, I mean, and I think that, you know, really, I feel like everyone has something that they can relate to in that sort of way, their own, whether it's, you know, a quirk or it's a medical condition or it's a, it's something like, like being an alcoholic or being trans or, you know, anything like that where it's just kind of an, an albatross that hangs around our neck that kind of, you know, the way that we assume that others can just kind of constantly see. So, so we make excuses for it. We are open and talk about these things when maybe we don't need to, but maybe we do it for our own comfort or for the purpose of educating others or to avoid, which I think this is, this is in, in my situation, it's to, to avoid a very awkward situation later. Like I'd rather control the terms of when I tell someone I'm trans rather than get into like, uh, Lou, for example, like, uh, go, going to a doctor's office and they'll be like, they'll be like, so when was your last period and I'll be like, never. And they'll be like, why I'll be like, I don't have a uterine. And they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, why? And I'm like, okay, gosh, you know, it's like, like in those situations, it's like, okay, I try to like dance around the, the question because sometimes it does, you know, like obviously most doctors, it's good to, you know, I left, I left, you know, as much ahead of time as possible. But like, I went to a dermatologist to look at a bump on my leg. You know, it's like that person probably doesn't need to know my whole same thing with a dentist, which speaking of I went to a dentist for the, for the first time in 10 years. Oh, wait. It was, it was less than ideal. Um, but yeah, I think that, yeah, we all have these things that um, you know, personality traits or, uh, characteristics that, that we bring with us. And it's, it's what we contribute to society and to the world and to ourselves. And, you know, it makes us all unique and different. And, uh, you know, I, I do find it interesting to, to think about how people, uh, relate to all these things in different ways on a personal level and how they perceive others. I feel like some things like being an alcoholic, for instance, or being trans or, uh, you know, uh, dealing with mental illness, you know, these are things that in a lot of ways are still stigmatized. And by talking about them, we have the opportunity to try to take a forceful step toward the stigma, stigmatizing them. Um, whereas if we were silent, you know, we're, it's neutral. Right. Um, but that's, that's an issue. But the stigma, stigma that comes, comes with things like, uh, you know, then you're an alcoholic or being trans disabled, you know, you know, these are things that kind of, uh, follow a lot of us around. And I know you must have heard, or I don't assume, but the, uh, episode that I did with disability rights issues with Alice Wong. Yeah. Um, I think that I talked to her a little bit about the parallel with alcoholism and mental illness. And she also pointed out that technically both of those are disabilities too. So, you know, I'm one, actually said, she congratulated me on, you know, welcomed me into the tribe of, of the disabled, which I embrace. They are technically disabilities and are in some ways, right? Disabilities. Um, uh, and I think that the, you know, what I think about when the parallels, I think about how I think it is really important, the idea that we're controlling what it is that people know about us and when that's a very powerful thing, right? Like even if it feels like it's unavoidable, like, I'm going to have to say this at some point, when you say it first, it is, it is a way of, of setting the terms. Um, and you don't have to think about it anymore. Right. And it's clean, and it's claiming it too. It's like, I mean, I think that's one of the reasons why in 12 step programs, it is always part of the ritual that we say our names and our, you know, what, what we're there for. Cause it's like part, cause it's, it's part of like, it's just part of who I am, you know, like, and, and it's as important a thing as anything else. Like I would say, you know, equally important are things like I'm an alcoholic. I'm a red head. I'm the born on the cusp of Virgo and Libra. You know, I live in Minneapolis. Like those are all important things and all equally important, you know, like, I mean, I shouldn't say all specifically equally important. They've had different kinds of impact on my life, but I don't. Sure. I want people to think of all of them when they think of me. Right. Right. And, and I think that in, yeah, when it, when it comes to trans issues, and one of the reasons that a lot of people, trans people are reluctant to, you know, be out as trans is because in a lot of ways it kind of defines them. Um, and I think, uh, because there are, I, like, I have a decent number of Twitter followers. I don't have your 1. something million. But, you know, I have a decent Twitter, Twitter, uh, crowd. Uh, but it's, uh, it's one of those things that's kind of interesting because I will go a while without talking about trans issues. Then I'll talk about trans issues and I'll mention that I'm trans and I'll get a bunch of messages from people who are like, I had no clue. And it's really interesting to kind of think about, think about that. But, um, you know, I always worry that when someone knows that I'm trans, that that's all they see me out, that they, that they can't, um, can't see me as someone who knows a lot about, uh, politics or knows a lot about baseball. I was going to say, you know, any, any of these things that make up who I am as a person, you know, like I'm defined by far more than the fact that, you know, my gender isn't the one that, you know, uh, the doctors were like, here it is, you know, trying to think of the least awkward way to like describe that. You know, we are, we are proudly our rated podcast. You can, like, you can be, you know, as explicit as you want to be, but I, I'm also kind of Midwestern in that I do appreciate it when people talk delicately about such things. Um, yeah, but I think, I mean, I did want to say when you were saying, I just assume everyone knows, like, I don't think that's true Parker, you know, like, I think, um, I think that that's something that you bring to the table. Um, and, and it is kind of, I can see why some people might be surprised because you do write about other things. You do have other interests. Um, you know, I personally follow you for your, you know, baseball and dog posts. Like I think those are, those are probably as important to me as anything else that you do, which, which so far in this interview, I've only had this for something at meatball once. It was overeating, uh, eating all my, uh, rabbits in the corner of their poop. So, oh, you have rabbits to wait a minute. Like this is breaking news. Rabbits, like I have two rabbits and they poop. Yeah. And meatball tries to eat it when I'm, if I do a podcast or like, I'm doing like a, a meeting over like FaceTime, uh, me ball knows that I can't, can't get to her. So she goes, she does all the horrible things that, um, that she's not supposed to social go and try to eat the rabbit poop. Oh, well, and people of course should follow meatball. She's at O meatball and she is a meatball is a meatball. Meatball is pretty great. Meatballs pretty great. Um, let's go. Let's talk a little bit about the mental health stuff too, because that's something you're very open about as well, which I appreciate as someone who's open about my, uh, bipolar diagnosis. I always, I kind of, I'm trying to not say bipolar disorder these days, I guess, try to kind of like make it less. It's not a disorder. It's a thing, you know, right. Um, and it was that something that you also felt like, oh, people are just going to know, or is that something that you had a little more like, I'm going to talk about this because I want to talk about this. You know, it, it was kind of. So it was kind of a little bit of, uh, a little bit of bull. So a lot of, you know, in this, in this kind of ties back into, you know, the, the trans stuff, because I get, I get so you know, a lot of emails from people seeking help in various ways or advice or whatever, um, for trans and. Like a lot of a lot of people will just make it, make the assumption that coming on this trans, going on hormones, doing all this stuff, like that that will fix. Everything in their life. Um, but the, but the truth is that it will fix a lot, but what you're going to start, what you're going to notice are any underlying issues that still are, that are still there, that have nothing to do with being trans. So I tried to open up a bit about, you know, uh, struggling a little bit with, you know, with depression and with anxiety, um, like really severe anxiety at times to the point where, um, I'll be like, just about ready to go out the door. And then I'll just kind of be like, I can't do it. I feel sick. I'm going to throw up, you know, like, like it gets really, really intense. But, um, you know, I decided I was going to just kind of start talking about this because, you know, a lot of the writing that I do over at, over at upworthy, um, you know, some of it has to do with trans stuff. Some of it has to do with, um, you know, just trying, trying to spend, uh, build, build empathy, you know, is something I tried to look for, you know, how to build empathy in, in storytelling. And, you know, one of the things that I kind of found that the most powerful stories, the most, the most impactful ones to me in like searching for stories, what were ones where people just opened, opened themselves up. So, you know, if I want to help people and if I want to, you know, be a net positive on society, um, I felt. Obligated, I guess, to open myself up to, to, um, to be vulnerable. And, you know, to put myself out there. And it was, you know, it's all, it was a lot easier when I had 5,000 Twitter followers instead of like 77,000, because it was like, I would get a couple of tweets a day. And sometimes they were mean, but now it's like, you know, I, I had to, I've already opened myself up. So all this stuff is out there. All my flaws are out there to the world and it makes me question, you know, am I. Should I have opened myself up to the extent that I did? And it's something that I revisit every once in a while because, uh, you know, when you do that, people get the sense that they know you and they know what's best for you or they view you in a different way than when you present yourself in a carefully curated, idealized version of yourself online. Um, but the truth is that, you know, it's like with, with my, you know, mental health, um, issues. It's like, it's, it's hard to put on a, you know, constantly put on, put on like a brave face and pretend that everything is going okay. When sometimes it's just not and sometimes it'll just be open about it. You know, and like on my Facebook page the other day, I just kind of like straight up said, like, this has been a bad week. Uh, it's been really tough with my depression. I've been struggling and here's what's been bothering me. And I just said it was a friends only type post, but it was something that. I, I felt that I needed to do it just for the sake of venting, but also that. Uh, it's, it's just honest and I feel that maybe there are some people who will see that and go, okay, I'm not feeling alone because that's one of my biggest fears is to be alone in any way, any shape. Um, and as much as we like to decry online, oh, it's, that's just online and that's not in person. And it's not real life. It's like being online, that is real life. Like, you know, some of my best friends, some of my favorite people in the world are people that I know only online. You know, you're one of those people. You're one of my favorite people in the whole world. You're one of my favorite people too, Parker. And we've never met in person. Right. Uh, but it's, it's, it's one of those things that, um, you know, if I want to be a good friend to others, I need to be, um, you know, open about, open about myself. So, you know, basically curating my life in that way. And that open, honest way is my attempt to be a good friend to those who I know and those I don't know. Yeah. I think that I think it really matters. Um, again, sort of to go to the places in my life where I feel some, you know, kinship around mental health and around being an addict alcoholic. Like, I don't think people who are that way in public, people who have come out in whatever way that is a stigmatized. Identity. Sometimes I think it, they don't realize what it means to those of us who haven't come out yet. Right. Like, I mean, I think I'm going to start. Mm. Like, I think of a David Carr, who was a good friend of mine and who was a joyously in recovery, you know, like, he lived his life in this completely open way. And with such joy, like, he really showed me, like, that you could be a full person that for some reason, like, you know, like I headed in my head that if I got sober for one, no one was like me because I wouldn't be fun anymore. Um, and that it would be like this crippling thing, like to have to be sober all the time, right? And to have to like live inside sobriety. And he showed me that was not the case, you know? And then like, you know, as I think we both adore Carrie Fisher and she was so open about who she was. And again, like, showed that, you know, these things that are stigmatized that feel like a prison when you're inside them, you know, are not and don't have to be. I 100% agree. And that's, I mean, and that's the worst thing in the world, in my opinion, to me, is feeling, feeling alone and feeling broken. And seeing other people publicly, you know, acknowledge some of the same struggles that I've had has been tremendously has been a tremendous help. For myself to try to, you know, feel less, feel less broken, feel less alone in the world when I, when I would read Carrie Fisher's books where she's talking about, you know, talking about mental illness. It's like, okay, I get that. I get that. See, there she is, like, things seem to be going well and I think it seemed to be great for her. Or not well, but she's great. But, well, yeah, but she's, you know, she, but she still struggled with all these things beneath the surface that she then opened up about, which I thought that that was really powerful to me. And it was really sad when she, when she died last year, but, you know, she did so much good and it goes so much further beyond her, her acting. So I think that, and that's kind of another message that I, that I take. It's like, I may be, you know, I may be a writer, you know, writing articles most days, but at the end of the day, it's like, I feel like I'm going to affect the lives of others in so many other ways, you know, people I know, people who meet me later in life. And we all do. And so, you know, I try to think about how all these extra steps and these extra lengths and extra, you know, things we do in life can have a, have a broad positive impact. And of course, I'm not perfect and I'm not, I'm not always a great. Any sort of role model, you know, like, like you said, like our first interaction was pretty salty. And I, you know, used to get in all these like really, really wild, really over the top, like internet fights with people. But I'm trying to like learn and grow on that and be better because, you know, I see people doing good in the world and I want to emulate that. I think that's a perfect note to end on. And I know you have to go. So, are you going to the dentist or the doctor? I am going to the doctor. Gotta get some stitches out. Oh, okay. Well, I hope you're well. I did. I remember actually tweeted about the dentist thing and I think I told you, like I did the exact same thing when I was actually in my addiction. I didn't go to the dentist at all. Because it's weird form of like lack of self care. One of the reasons I used to not go to the, not go to the dentist was after I came out as a child. I was always worried that people that anyone who got that close to my face would be able to just tell, you know, where it would be like, oh, I can see. Oh, there's some facial hair, you know, like up until like, zapped it off with leaves and stuff. Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah, it's funny how like those things like those little things impact our lives. And I think you don't really think about it. You know, other people don't think about right. But I think about them constantly. Yeah. And more people than you realize think about it too. That's the powerful thing. But anyway, it's been great talking to you. A writer at Epworthy, Parker, Maloy, be well, snuggle, meet both for me and say hi to Kayla. Well, yeah. All right.

So I wanted to talk to you because, you know, we had a conversation about Hillary Clinton last year that was helpful to me. But I don't want to summarize your point for you. I mean, I think my position on her, just to put our priors out right before we talk about the new information, is that I've had a more positive view of her in the past. I should say more positive. It's just more sympathetic. It's not more positive. It's more sympathetic. As I've gotten older, I've kind of mellowed my own view of her, but she's always been problematic for me. And while I have a lot of respect for people who see her as a feminist icon, that has not always sat particularly well with me. And you had something, as I recall, somewhat parallel point of view, but I don't want to put words in your mouth, so you want to give your priors here? Yeah, so that conversation, which we had, it's almost a year to the day now. My argument was basically that I completely understand that the ascendancy of Hillary Clinton's career parallels the ascendancy of a sort of mainstream girl bossy kind of feminism. But I really balk at the idea that because these two things are happening at the same time that they should be conflated or made to seem as examples of the other. Right. And another thing that I remember us talking about was just like the slim generational difference between us meant that I had a different awareness of Clinton from a very young age. Growing up as a Haitian American in Brooklyn. During the Clinton presidency in the 90s and early on. I was sort of like. Always told by different factors in my community that the person was not someone to be trusted that in fact, all the actors in that family weren't to be trusted. And I think that's where my lack of sympathy probably comes from. Yeah, I mean, I think my sympathy for her basically grew directly from having her have to go through this election. You know, like it's basically just the sympathy of like, oh man, that sucks for you. Like, wow, you really drew the short straw on this one, didn't you? And that's sort of where I guess our new conversation begins. There's this new book out called shattered. It's a pun. Get it? You know, the doomed candidacy of Hillary Clinton. And I think the experience of having of seeing her go through the gauntlet of this election definitely kind of made me more sensitive to slights against her that seem to be gendered. And I'll tell you right away, the first excerpt I saw from this book, I believe the lead sentence is, Hillary was so mad she couldn't think straight. And I was like, all right, well, not reading you. Like that sentence in and of itself to me was like, there are so many legitimate criticisms, but right off the bat, like I feel like the narrative is about like, I just, that sentence doesn't read the same to me, you know, saying it about a woman. And I sort of turned it off. But I'm curious what you think of the narrative that's coming out about her campaign now, which is that mismanaged, no coherent theme, you know, badly managed people like too concerned about, you know, position and too concerned about, you know, how things look. To me, a lot of that. And again, I think it's just because my having seen her go through this and having seen a bunch of criticisms that do seem pretty gendered to me, like I couldn't help but read a lot into this. It's like, would you be saying this about a guy? Like, would you? And that's like, that I can't help but have that be the frame that I see through right now. Yeah, I mean, I absolutely understand having that reaction, especially when you like read sentence like that in the book. But for me, I think. I wasn't prior to the publication of shattered. I wasn't totally convinced by a lot of the autopsy of the campaign that were coming out because they seem to like heavily. Depend on like characterizations of Hillary's personality, but I think there's a coherence to the argument. That's based on, you know, all these interviews that the journalist had been doing over the past year and a half or past two years that to me I find sort of satisfying a coherence that I think. Illuminates what we all sort of sensed, right? Like there did seem to be like, for example, when Clinton got sick in September, it seemed to kind of like catch a lot of her staffers by surprise as much as it did the public. And so that's the part of the argument in that book that I'm most interested in, you know, like how did this tribe of political staffers completely. Never like, how did they never seem to unite under the common goal of getting this person to the White House as opposed to her opponent? And, you know, now we can see that like that was literally Trump staff's only goal because now they're in the White House. No idea what you're doing. Yeah, that's right. And that's true, right? I mean, that was like, and that's where in the places where I kind of go like, would you be saying this about a guy is that one of the main arguments of the book is that is that. Is that a reason or not just a reason, but a primary reason for her failure was that they were never able to agree on a message or on a purpose? Like why she was running? There's a lot of like energy spent talking about how they just had all these different kinds of justifications or rationales and that you really just need one rush. Every candidate needs that one powerful rationale for running. And I was like, okay, tell me why Al Gore ran. You know, tell me why Bush ran. What was Bush's power? Like, you know, I can't tell you either of those things. I mean, Donald Trump had a great branding slogan, but most of the reasons when we say like, why does someone run? That's branding, not a like coherent ideology, right? Like, you know, Obama ran on hope. That's not a coherent policy platform. You know, and so like all of the like hand ringing about how she didn't really have like a message and she was it, which, which feeds into this idea that all she wanted to do was be president. She just wanted the power. She just, she didn't have a reason. It was just her turn. Like that seems really not something you would say about a guy. Yeah, I just want to quickly say that I think the what's like lurking underneath that critique of Hillary Clinton's campaign is that her message was that she was like the most prepared candidate in the history of presidential campaigns. And so anytime, you know, you'd be watching a debate and some question would come up on which, you know, Trump would just like sit there and like make things up off the top of his head. Hillary Clinton actually had informed and season responses because she's literally done all that work before. But the problem with that kind of message for lack of a better word is that it's not exciting. It doesn't incite people to gather around the candidate in a way that they did around Trump, right? Like nobody just wants to like vote for someone because they're good at their job. There have to be other things. We had no idea that Obama would be good at his job and he was elected. Right. And also I mean, I do think that maybe next time around the message I'm going to be capable might be a little more exciting because we'll have had four years of like four years of like four years of disaster. So I think, Hey, I know what the job is and I know how to do it might seem more compelling to people. And but I want to say like also, so we I don't think we should ever, you know, forget she did win the popular vote. It was compelling to some people. But it's true. It wasn't compelling to the right people. Right. It wasn't compelling to this Rust Belt group of, you know, disaffected white people who had various forms of anxiety and who were in word middle class. Yeah, I was going to say that kind of reading the writing that I did on Clinton last year. I wonder if a class or a group of young feminist women, young women, is women, young women of color might have over. I think there might have been an over determination of how much it mattered that Hillary Clinton reached out to women of a certain class, you know, women on the coast, women who were highly educated women who are of color and not sometimes because I do think at the end of the day, like, she just had that contingency of voters in the bag, right? There was just no way that the majority of those workers weren't going to go to the polls and vote for her that day. And so I think that we ended up, a lot of feminists ended up getting caught in this like void, this conversational void of trying to evaluate whether or not Clinton was a feminist, when that wasn't even the question that was most important to how she was going to win this candidacy, right? It's like, at a certain point, the presidency of the United States of America is just not going to be relevant to the question feminism. And maybe if there had been questions that were much more focused on questions of class and regionalism, maybe we would have approached a more appropriate way of putting her through the gauntlet last year. And there is the fact that she lost white women, right? I mean, which still kind of, I mean, it doesn't, I shouldn't say it blows my mind because in a way it doesn't surprise me at all. Like, she's the wrong person to make the argument to white women, you know? I mean, I think there's a lot of different sort of ways to unpack that. One of them that I think is important is that gender identity isn't as collectivizing, I think, as other kinds of identities. I think that women don't, I don't know if this was something that the Clinton campaign, like you said, like, over determined or assumed that they had that group in the bag. But that was a very dangerous assumption to think that because I think it's been pretty clear throughout history that you cannot assume that women will be supportive of other women. And that she needed to make a different argument than that. I mean, I think there was a certain kind of person and I know these people who really responded to it's, you know, I'm with her stronger together. It's her turn. And, you know, I met women all throughout the campaign who were really moved by it, you know, who got tears in their eyes and had profound attachment to the idea that there might, that there, it felt like that there was going to be a female president. But in the end, you know, that did not move a lot of people, clearly. I mean, I don't know what would have the white women that voted for Trump. I'm not sure what she could have done, to be honest, like. Like it was a foregone conclusion, you mean? Well, because it's her, like because she's had brings a particular set of, you know, issues and baggage to the table that she has. I just, I mean, in part of it, and it's unfortunate because when I'm about to say the stuff I'm about to say, like, I feel like a bad feminist because I think these things are tied up with her gender, but like the untrustworthiness and the power hungariness. Like that stuff that like she's done her curse is that she's performed, she has done a lot of the same stuff that other politicians do, male politicians do, but she gets the bad, you know, rep for it, right? You can name almost any negative attribute of Hillary's and it will be true of not just most male politicians, but like specifically Trump. You know, like she's secretive and vindictive, right? Okay. So is Trump, right? Like she happily plays, you know, pay for play politics in the sense that she's happy to sort of, you know, accept a donation in exchange for access. So did Trump, you know, she's incredibly insular. So is Trump. Like the only way she's, the way she's different from him is the fact that is the positive stuff, right? She is capable and smart and curious about the world. But those things didn't matter, you know? I mean, I mean, there's a lot of talk that she should have done. I mean, you mentioned it yourself. Like she should have done more outreach or had a better economic message. Our mutual friend, Ira Madison, the third has pointed out that the black voters in Milwaukee and Pennsylvania and Philadelphia felt pretty ignored and to assume the assumption that they would vote for her to and they want to just not turning out. Yeah. Do you have any fresh thought about that? Like having looked at this book, having thought about it since the election. Yeah, I mean, I think to maybe kind of like recapitulate my point earlier, but just sort of like telescope it on that specific community of voters. I think. The mothers of the movement. Campaign moment is an example that I'll use. So these women who were the mothers and sometimes. Wives of men who had been. Gun down in police related violence ended up. I think it started in November, 2015, they started traveling with Clinton on her campaign stops, you know, they kind of like debuted at the D and C and all this stuff. And I thought that that was obviously like a very like keen. Savvy and sentimentalist move for her, but. The way that that movement was supposed to be a stand in for all of the problems that black citizens experience that lead them to be in these competitions with the police. I think that was like a perfect encapsulation of what was so like. Wrong about her campaign's approach. Everybody knows, you know, you need like an average Joe. You need some kind of like. Avatar, some kind of everyday citizen avatar for the policies that you'd like to bring to certain communities of voters. However, I thought, especially at the time, you know, there's like a very, very heated question black lives matter in these communities. I thought that instead of, you know, talking about police community relations or talking about like economic initiatives or talking about the ghettoization of American city, just kind of like locating that huge not a problem within these. Like symbolic figure of mothers of the movement was like a bit of a misstep. I thought that they were given, I think too much of a burden to carry for this candidate who had to undo. You know, more than two decades worth of conceptions about how she interacts with with the communities and what I was talking about, you know, that New York Times article where they like. Interview that guys at the barbershop who just like didn't vote because they hadn't felt that they'd been reached out to. That's exactly that communities are specific. You can't just like. Create this like grand national narrative around the many, many problems black people experience in this country and expect everyone to connect to that narrative or expect everyone to feel seen. And yeah, I thought that the broad strokes were too broad. Right. And then as I've told this anecdote many times, but I think it's important is that you can't, if you're, if you're pitch to black voters is the other guys are racist, that's just not much of a sales. Like that's. Exactly. Right. Exactly. Like, black people are like, Oh, really a racist in the White House? Yeah, that would be horrible. Gosh, you know, never had that before. Wonder what that'll be like. I hate to laugh about it, but it's true. Like that was her pitch. Right. Yeah. And then I think that's why we see such a, you know, big generational difference between younger black voters and older black voters. Right. Because these younger citizens, they've come to demand more of their politicians. They're engaged in these new ways via grassroots organizing and via the internet. And I think that, you know, it's not good for the Democratic party, but they're young black people who are not excited about it. I mean, I also see that. I mean, and I also think that this, this, this conversation that you and I are having right now is not being had enough in the autopsies of Hillary's campaign. I think that the race issues get, gets talked about primarily as a question of the, you know, working class white people and what Trump did to appeal to them. And the part about not exciting people of color and also what that, that means for the future, right? Exactly. Is not something that Democrats are at least in the national conversation that people have on Twitter and that national political reporters have with each other, which is pretty accurately reflected on Twitter, actually. That kind of, that critique is a getting made. Like, I feel like it just drops out almost entirely. Like, you talk about the mistakes she made as a candidate and not going to, and not going to Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, but that's off, that's read entirely as not going to rust belt cities to appeal to white working class, not the message that I would see, like, and that, you know, I repointed out, which is not going to Milwaukee, not going to Philadelphia, not going, you know, or she went to Philadelphia, but. You know, not doing outreach in the communities of color in those rust belt states, which could have gotten her there. Yeah. You know, there are these margins that were just like both mall and completely, you know, it's just a number of people of color who didn't vote that day. Yeah, and that reminds me when I ran I still had speed dial the podcast, we had the right to refer on and she is a scholar at Harvard, the Kennedy School there, and she, you know, wrote this book called the loneliness of the black Republican. And so interesting in our conversation with her was that she was anticipating, right, this polarization that, especially after like, what can only be described as both like a spiritual and ideological spike in Barack Obama, that come down a tarsh. And so all of these, I thought it was like a very critical time for the Democratic Party, not just Clinton to really double down on their commitment to these voters. And that's not what they did. You know, they were completely just like ignored and kind of like shuffled off to the side and like, I mean, even the way that the party is going in this like post mortem year is even more alarming in my opinion, because like, it's not for gone. It's not for the Trump conclusion that Trump will not be president again in four years, or that someone like just as bad as him won't won't gain that office. You're listening to with friends like these with Anna Marie Cox. I was actually really excited to get blue apron as a sponsor because I am not exaggerating. Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating just a little bit, but blue apron sort of saved my marriage. You know, I live in a two income household. We are both incredibly busy all the time. We both really, you know, love our jobs and thrive on that fulfillment. And that can mean that sometimes, you know, other priorities fall aside, like grocery shopping and making dinner for each other. And it was a real source of friction, like, who's going to make dinner? What do we have in the refrigerator? Do we have enough time to go out and buy new stuff? So finally, we got a blue apron subscription. And, you know, it just takes all the thought out of having great meals. You know, we're no longer kind of just like making an omelet with leftovers.

The other thing that occurred to me to talk to you specifically about is the aesthetics of Trump, which is something you've written about also. And I've conversed about as well. I am fascinated by them as you are. And the article that I know we shared was one about dictator chic. And you also wrote your own article, but the article about dictator chic actually was by an interior designer who went through and looked at, you know, the houses and homes of dictators around the world. And was like, that's what Trump does too. Your take on Trump's aesthetic is what? Well, I can paraphrase from the article that I wrote, which I guess at this point is not four years. It seems like it. It seems like it. Four months old and the topic will always be evergreen, right? Because Trump and his family have become sort of icons of style, taking that term as loosely as you will. I think icons is totally appropriate. And then style is like, yeah, that's a really general term of style. But style is a neutral term, right? There's style and there's been style. That's right. They ostentatious style. And I think that's what Trump projects, although I don't think that he, I think that if you were to ask him, he wouldn't have like a definition of what his personal style is. Because I think for him, style is always only an indicator of money, miss or wealth, right? So that's why when you go to his like really shitty restaurant, there are paintings that are just like copies of very kind of like hyperbolicly lush renaissance scenes, right? So nobody like those are the paintings that you see when you go to that like one island target, right? That like grandma would be fine. Yeah. And it's like, it's like parodies of Renaissance style almost. It's like it's what if you didn't, if you only knew the term Renaissance style, what you would think it was. Yeah. That's when you would gravitate towards, you know, it's a combination of both like Frenchness and Italian-ness, but not in the way that they manifest like in the 21st century. And I think the regression that we see when we look at, you know, photos of like the Mar-a-Lago or his penthouse in New York City or even the small changes that they've made to the interior of the White House, you see someone who like transmutes their insecurity into the surroundings around them, right? So they're just like. The furniture, the painting, the gold, it's so loud that it's like basically speaks for itself. And that's like absolutely the opposite direction that style has taken in the past century. You know, everything is like more muted and subdued. People don't really have gold in their homes anymore, especially wealthy people. If anything, they've moved to blacks and whites and grays. So Trump completely, he goes in the complete opposite direction of wealth as we've seen it manifest through personal style, like fashion, but also styles that we see in homes and business places and that kind of stuff. And I guess that's always been part of why when people talk about how he has to sleep, you know, on the campaign trail, he always went home to Trump Tower and all these weekends he's spending at Mar-a-Lago. I think it has to do with the style, you know? I think it has to do with where he feels comfortable. And it turns out even like a tacky hotel room isn't tacky enough for him, isn't gaudy enough for him. You know, like he needs to be where he needs to be at Trump Tower, he needs to be at Mar-a-Lago. Like in the White House definitely isn't enough for him. You know, he needs to be surrounded by these signifiers of wealth and comfort and security, I think. I mean, we're psychoanalyzing, but that's one explanation to me because I don't think he's ever going to read. Well, I'd ask your opinion. Like, what do you think his style, the impact his style is having and his aesthetics are having, like on the White House, on the presidency? So I think if anything, if there is an impact that Trump's style is having on both the presidency, but then also just like the populist at large, I think it would be a repudiation of overt wealth or lavishness. I've actually read a couple of interesting articles by fashion critics who anticipate that people will kind of like move away from gold in color and these like very bombastic, stylistic displays in response to how in response to the Trumpian aesthetic, basically, which makes a lot of sense, right? Like, if you're autocrat, you've seen stylistic and fashion studies whenever the autocrat like projects one kind of way of looking often the people kind of respond by doing something else. And so it's funny. I don't think that there are very many people, especially in the wealthy class in America who like even still lean on those aesthetics anymore in the first place. So you have both poor people, obviously, being really upset when they see the excesses of Trump's style, but then you also have wealthy people kind of like lampooning him and judging him because if you were a real sophisticated, if you were up to date in his cultural references, his places wouldn't look like that anymore, right? Like, that's like, it's like an SNL version of what a rich guy would look like in the 21st century. It's very dated. It's very regressive. And it isn't imaginative, which all good stylists have good imaginations. Like, we're looking at Obama right now in his post presidency glow and like, he's come out with these outfits that are like really creative and imaginative and so has Michelle Obama, but Trump and Ivanka as our pseudo first lady, they huge to very state, stuffy aesthetics. And that's not what people want from their presidents anymore. I'm curious. I would just be doing a little hint at what you've seen about Obama's aesthetics lately. I noticed he got rid of the dad jeans, right? He got rid of the dad jeans, but more importantly, Michelle got rid of the mom jeans. I think I saw this photo of Michelle. She was on vacation. They've been on like a perennial vacation. They deserved it. And she had her hair. Her hair was completely natural. It was in its natural textured state and that was a really big deal. We've never seen Michelle Obama with her hair like that. And that's of course because the nature of the role that she was in kind of like forced her to look a certain way and for a black woman that often means pressing your hair or straightening it. And also, I think it has meant for her. Always being stylish, but sometimes having to like sway more towards like matronly silhouettes, you know, the kind of like pencil or or. But now like there was one day they were out in New York City and they were both wearing matching pantsuits. Wait, I have to look this up. It's an amazing photo. I'll send it to you. And Obama, you know, he has like two buttons undone, but you never really did when he was president. The fit is a lot more European. So it made me think about as much as we thought of Michelle and Barack is like maybe the most stylish presidency. In American history, they were also beauty. Their style in a certain way. They weren't going like too coastal or too fashiony. But now I think we're just going to be like. Okay, I went to see Michelle and come to Garth know, you know, I mean, I mean, I think it's funny because they were basically I, you know, Michelle's go to. You know, off the rack designer and during her time in the White House was fucking true. I mean, there is not a wider brand, right? Like I struggle like maybe Oshkosh, like I don't know, like it would have to be some kind of like farming implement brand that would be more white. But she definitely like I was going to say not matronly is one word. I don't think she ever I would say I don't think she ever dressed matronly. I think she always had kind of some sass to her, like some. With and humor to her dressing, meaning like a little bit of creativity, a little bit, you know, winks to certain kinds of styles. But it was definitely within the boundaries of like pretty preppy, right? Like you, you know, Muffy's mom at the country club could wear the same outfit. You know, and now like what I'm hearing from you and now that I think about I'm also there wearing stuff that you would not find at the country club. Yeah. Do you think they couldn't wait? Do you think they were like, do you think they had these outfits in their closet and we're like, man, the day, day we could. For November 9. Oh my God. I mean, and there were also moments in Michelle Obama style evolution specifically where she would insert like really peritably avant-garde looks. She often, you know, she works with really young designers, which is something that like the like fashion world doesn't like to do all the time, you know, but she would work with designers who were like straight out of school or sometimes still in school. She also works with a lot of like non-American designers and introduced very new Afropolitan prints and cuts to her dresses at the White House. So she always, even though she like had to be a J crew model over eight years, she found ways to wear designers that were definitely off the beaten path for a woman in an office like that. And I, and you think she's just going to continue like I always had a feeling that she did rain herself and his first lady and her personality as well too. Because you know, you and I would never have never forgotten, but I think a lot of people have like she was the, she was the powerhouse superstar in that relationship for a long time. I will never forget that. I will never forget that. For law school first. Yeah. Yeah. She was successful first, right? She was bringing home the bacon first. And that, you know, she, I'm sure it, if you have nothing else, the marriage is definitely a partnership. Like you can see that in the way that they relate to each other. So I don't think like she was like, I'm going to take a step back and you're in control, honey. But it was more like, this is your, this is your thing. Being president is your thing. It's not her thing. No, no. I mean, I'm looking forward to mission. I'm really, people are all like, I wonder what Obama's going to say. And we're going to what Barack Obama is going to say about Trump. I wonder what a Barack Obama is going to do about Trump. I cannot wait for Michelle to let loose. I know. I just like sit down with Diane Sawyer and just give us all the tea for an hour. Yeah. I mean, I mean, remember the speech he gave? Like that was probably the best, I mean, one of the best features she's ever given. Yeah. It was just an extended sub to eat. Yes. Well, not even so much sub. It was like a reply. Yeah. But I think it was such a great rhetorical direction to go in to go to in that she never used his name, right? Because ultimately, if we walk away from these next four years or possibly eight years of who knows more, if we walk away from this period of American time without realizing that Trump was not just one man that he was a phenomenon will have failed. And so I think by in that speech, the way Michelle Obama talks about, yeah, she references him as a singular person, but also references this tide of racism and all of these, like, incredibly dehumanizing ideologies that are springing up again in America. I think by doing that, she did something that, you know, I think Clinton probably should have done, which was to recognize that this is a movement and that the movement had origins going much, going back much earlier than like whenever Trump fought the Maralaga. Mm hmm. Yeah. I think I like that formulation that if we, if we wind up thinking this is just Trump, like we will have failed. It isn't just Trump. And the thing I always, again, I know you never forget this, but I always like to remind people in the audience and every, another political, you know, pundits is that even if Hillary had won, this country would still be as racist and as divided and as sexist as it is now. Like, you know, that was there and is there and needs to be dealt with. And the day that Trump leaves office, it's up to us as to whether or not it still exists then. And I was so profound. I've, I've stunned you into silence. So, I will end there. Thank you so much. I'm like, I've been itching to be on this podcast. Yeah. And it's going to happen again, I promise.
