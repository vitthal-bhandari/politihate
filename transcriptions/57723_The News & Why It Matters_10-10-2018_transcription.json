    "text": " The Blaze Radio Network On Demand This is the news and why why why why it matters Hey, I'm Sarah Gonzalez welcome to the news and why it matters we have two special guests with us today Jason Howerton is back from CRT V We have some more estrogen in the room I'm Dr. Deborah, so Can you please tell everyone what your expertise is? I'm a science journalist and I'm a columnist for Playboy calm and the Globe and Mail, which is Canada's national newspaper Yes, yeah from Toronto. Yes, so you like Texas so far. I do I'm loving in here good awesome So now when you say and just one because if it never knows you because we talked about this earlier I think let's have a vote. I think the Playboy credential hurts It makes it sound like oh, I'm I'm Dr. Ruth Westheimer that you are a real legitimate scientist that looks and studies the brain for Hypers that you went for hyper sexuality and parafelias is what I used to do yeah, right and and then what was the second one? It's oh and hyper sexuality and parafelias parafelias, which I know with all those things I'm a doctor I could explain because you told me about 20 minutes ago That is just Abnormal or out of the mainstream unusual sexual preferences, but I have to say Playboy has a history of having excellent journalism So I am very grateful for them always read it. It's just a stereotype that's yeah, yeah, yeah, dr. Glenn back Yes, yeah the top story for you I'm gonna have to use the M word today. Oh, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. This is a family-friendly show. I know I know Are you sure? doctor You good with that? Oh if you have to There's a giant hurricane hitting the coast and that's of course because we all drove here in cars Okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna piggyback on Glenn and won't be the first time so wait what kind of activity Today I'm gonna be talking about the American Academy of Pediatrics and a statement that they put out okay All right before we get into she's too smart for us. This is not good boy. This is shows gotten better Before we get into all of that want to thank our sponsor Rydia zone Rydia zone is great if you need to lose a lot of weight Like I did at one particular point in my life which one is her Yes, I don't know if you can you believe that yeah? 10 that's really me that was me I'm the one standing next to her She was number 10. I wouldn't even recognize. Yeah, so that was listening on the podcast. I was about 100 pounds heavier than I am right now So I do know about weight loss. I know about weight loss and I know how hard it is so Thankfully there is Rydia zone if you need to lose weight or if you're just trying to maintain keep that weight off It takes the good molecule and olive oil and you get a metabolism boost and you also get a handle on your cravings It has worked for me. It really has I can tell you that you can go to Rydia zone calm and save 30% off of a three-month supply And you use promo code the blaze and that is RID use the ONE Dot com for all of your podcast listeners Glenn yes, do you mind if I? Go to the guests first as far as the top stories go well as she's doctor of the brain I'm a doctor of humanity so I can I can talk about the entire body, but we'll ladies first You'll be able to weigh in on yes as a fellow doctor Please so the American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement Saying that for children who are gender dysphoric or gender nonconforming that the best way forward is to affirm them but from a scientific perspective The research consistently shows that the best way forward is actually to wait and see what happens at puberty Hmm so they're going against science yeah, which is doesn't seem to be abnormal now No, it's becoming more and more in the norm Especially on this issue with the children and I find it really concerning because these are actual lives at stake These are children who are impressionable and who are very much dependent on their parents and caregivers to do the right thing And the science says that they are more likely to De-sist Right and and more likely to become just homosexual right to grow up to be gay and adulthood. They won't be in transgender. Okay what happens to a child when you start injecting them with things and They're 14 are you talking about as far as altering their hormones? Yeah, altering their home where you start injecting them you start doing the things that some people are now doing to their Teenagers are allowing their teenagers to do right so puberto blockers are one approach that are being advocated for But we don't actually know what the long-term effects will be because it is an off-label use when it comes to cross-sex hormones Sterilization can be one of the outcomes and even if you stop taking cross-sex hormones you'll be left with Physical changes so if you're taking testosterone and you stop you'll still get facial hair your voice will forever be changed I'm an obviously with surgery surgery is irreversible. So for like sex specific hormones testosterone estrogen whatever it may be How how important are those things for kids as they're growing up as they're you know becoming it growing into young adults like To to alter that or to to say take a boy from developing testosterone What does that do to a boy who is who is? Growing up into a young man. That's the thing we don't know yet. So I should emphasize I don't work with children I used to work in a research capacity only but It's it's completely new ground and it's in the name of being progressive. I do think for kids who are gender nonconforming or gender dysphoric or who say they are born in the wrong body that they should be supported and that You know parents should just be open-minded don't push your child one way or the other The biggest thing here too is like you know It's one thing whether you get good results or bad results if you're an adult and you do something that changes your body or whatever That's that's kind of your call right like you're not in a position to figure out what you're gonna have for dinner when you're a child It's a real alone figure out what sex you are if you're gonna change and when you're making those you know permanent changes based on this information That's so young. I mean it just seems completely unhealthy doesn't taking estrogen also Maybe it's just older women, but when you take when you take estrogen doesn't that also have a higher rate of cancer bone density also Right, so what is that going to mean? And we have no studies on it. We're just doing it Yeah, these kids really are guinea pigs and it's it's crazy And for the parents to who speak out and say that you know, let's slow things down or let's advocate for some caution They get called far right they get called bigoted. They get called transphobic They get told that their child is gonna commit suicide and that's suicide statistic that they often bring up They say 40% of trans people have tried to kill themselves. It is an inflated statistic I don't doubt that being transgender is difficult But it's not fair for that statistic to be thrown in parents faces and used to emotionally blackmail them Yeah, cuz I mean let's say that they do believe the statistic that does the medical community believe the statistic I think it depends who you talk to okay because go ahead I think legitimate practitioners and clinicians Would advocate for caution, but just in this climate they know that they're gonna be called these awful names Okay, they're afraid to say because to me It's like if you see if you think that that statistic exists or if there's any sort of statistic that Transgenders are more likely to commit suicide. You wouldn't want to push them to that doesn't yeah After the sex change it's just as high is it not right? I mean for some people transitioning can be beneficial, but there have been studies that have shown that the suicide rate does continue So it's important to get at the underlying cause especially with these kids who say these things kids say all kinds of things So why are we not looking at what's the reasoning for what they're saying instead of taking it at face value? My son actually said he was a cat yesterday But I actually know that he's not tail attachment or no, I didn't actually I just told him you're actually not a cat far right I'm gonna ask you this I am I'm a Mormon okay and our doctrine teaches that each of us is You know designed beforehand we come down we get a body whatever your body is flaws and all that's what you're supposed to deal with okay, and changing the body especially the gender for a for somebody of my faith is Not good is not good. I'm not pushing that on anybody else. That's just what I believe Can't a parent say With love and understanding if if my child was gender dysphoric I would forget religion You're not doing anything until you're on your own until you're an adult But isn't it is there any benefit as for a parent to say? You know I understand and what lifestyle you choose later in life You know that's that's your business and whatever But be happy with who you are be happy and I understand that there might be some dysphoria but shouldn't we treat that shouldn't we talk about that shouldn't we Be able to Be happy with who we are fat Feeling differently whatever it is Can't a parent say no I Honey you're born the way you were born and that's the way it is they should be able to I agree with you I think for the parents who are on board with this some of them do it because they want to show off and show how open-minded they are I think some others are coming from the perspective of Previously so in my perspective I do think transitioning can be beneficial for adults. So they don't want to say No, I don't have a prop you're an adult do whatever you want right your life So I but I think the reason why some people are a little bit more empathic to this cause is that they see transgender adults Having suffered and not been allowed to transition So they say well, I don't want to do that to children I don't do that to my child and and prevent them from being happy if Transitioning is going to make them happy But I think these parents have been lied to they don't realize that again most kids are gonna outgrow it Most kids are just gonna be gay and fun and they don't need to transition to be happy Okay, we have a little if we have a second to do a little bit more on this on that study that you mentioned that has over 40% of Transgendered people committing suicide. It's such a that's a really to me a really dangerous statistic And when you look at the study like I mean they didn't they didn't have follow-up questions It was people who volunteered for the study There's all sorts of flaws that make that number way too high you look at there's another category in the study for heterosexuals that are in the study and their Suicide rate is something like 34% It's like do we think that 34% of heterosexuals are killing themselves? I mean it doesn't seem likely the problem with the stat though and why it's quoted so widely at least this is my theory is You have a situation where there's no one who's talking about this in this debate with an incentive to disprove it People who are on the far right would say well you shouldn't live that lifestyle look at there and that suicide rate people on the far Left are saying look how badly this jet this community is being vilified look how high their suicide rate is There's no one who has a you know an incentive in the political argument to come in and say wait a minute Look at the study it is not saying what we're trying to make it say and those when those stat like that can do a lot of damage it really I think misinforms people and No one can have kind of a real sensible conversation I think my fear from what she's saying is like I feel like this it sounds like and it looks like the scientific community is kind of becoming afraid to just look at things objectively from a science standpoint because if you're incentivized right because if you come out with a conclusion that is against what the trans community wants or whatever then all of a sudden you've got this big firestorm and you Got stuff that you don't want that's my big fear is that science becomes Part of politics and that's like the last thing we want and that's what I was gonna I wanted to ask you was because to me I hear that coming from the medical community and it makes me distrust The medical community as a whole I stopped on the butter thing I mean, what would you say to you know a parent who's who hears this and it's just like I don't trust the doctors anymore I crossed the board. I think it's important to look at Everything with anything look at it on a case-by-case issue by issue basis And if you're skeptical do some digging and look at the studies yourself see who's funding them look up the researchers See where they're affiliated What is their educational background that can usually tell you a lot? We had a good conversation earlier about AI and and the The real true science behind looking will a robot of a child help a pedophile act there and not in in the in society and That's an important study to do and we were talking about funding and everything else the problem it seems with science right now is We talk about get money out of government and politics Money is driving much of the science where if you're going if you want to grant Study what they're trying to prove prove what they want to prove. It's no longer The search for truth. It seems it's I want to find this answer go find this answer Because I've got somebody who will pay for it. Yeah, I think that's accurate Yeah, and funding agencies also know if you find something that the public doesn't like the public is not gonna be happy And they're gonna be going after them and saying well, why did you give these researchers money? So they don't want to deal with that on top of it Parents I just want to warn you when we come back after the break We are going to be talking about the m word so if you have any small children to do it to make sure that that they leave the room We may not we may not be able to send it. Oh, I just did it Wow, sorry, we need to take a break Oh Glenn back is coming live to talk about the right path forward and to make fun of the people standing in the way He might not be able to save the country But at least we can all go down laughing Glenn back live be addicted to outrage tour on tour this fall All right before we get into the m word want to thank our sponsor my patriot supply We as we mentioned earlier stew mentioned there is a hurricane Yeah, we've had a couple of Florida right now and there's been one in North Carolina North Carolina We had such a great run for how many years without being hit with anything. You know, you didn't play attention to global warming Yeah, and now we've warmed for cooling where we have to prepare for these things apparently yeah Yeah, well, but truly I heard in Florida. There's a lot of people who are expected to not have power. Oh god I mean, it's a really bad one. Yeah, you know, it hit an almost a category five Wind speeds one hundred fifty five Hour upon landfall. It's it's gonna be really damaging So these are the times when you really have to you have to look at that and say okay They're out there out there without power What do they do for food if they're stuck in their homes if they still have a home, right? You're stuck in your home. You're without power or you're flooded. Nothing's gonna be open We were in Texas We went down to Houston and and all of these people were leaving and they were going to stay at a hotel And I looked at them. We were helping clean out their houses They were not wealthy How are you paying for the hotel and the food for you and your children for God knows how long? Harvus Lee, how are you doing that? Yeah? So it is really important that you have some sort of food supply in the event that something like that happens That is where my Patriot supply comes in super handy. It's delicious food and right here You can see a two-week emergency food supply for seventy five dollars. That's a steal. It includes breakfast. Lunch breakfast Breakfast. Lunch and dinner. We're than wrong For only seventy five dollars, so you cannot pass that up go to preparewithnews.com All right gentlemen, I'm gonna let you Glenn Introduce the m word. Yes. So last night my wife just be very just be gentle I know I will my wife and I were talking and she was I don't know yelling at me about something and she's and and she was very intense and it was I was late at night and I was tired and she was like now listen tomorrow we have to blah blah blah and and I'm I just look down and I check and I see the headline Anchor freaks out over use of m word and I never do this to my wife because it doesn't end well. I said excuse me And she said I'm so I'm here today. Are you even listening to me? And I'm like usually yes, just not right now And I said do you know what the m word is and she said what are you talking about? And I said let me read the headline anchor freaks out over use of m word. We're down to the M's now What is the m word? Here it is on CNN watch I believe it's the over reaction of the left when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out Or restaurants by a mob. Oh, you're not gonna use the mob. I will. Oh, it's it's totally a mob It is without a doubt. There's no other word that's it's a good one Put up a mob stop stop a mob a mob is what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia To August ago no a mob What we saw People who were at the Supreme Court Banging on the walls. What do you saw that? So here's the thing civil protest on this whole thing. Here's the thing There there's mob That is a group of people that are trying to cause Chaos of some sort doesn't have to be violent doesn't have to hang people that would be a lynch mob Okay, a mob can lead to a riot If you can't define this as a mob what we have seen the mob mentality if you can't if you can't say that it is A violent mob with antifa You are not even on the same planet anymore How many more words are we going to redefine a weird word to protect to like like she was so outraged? Yes, so outraged by someone saying that yeah, it's not a pat at all. That's very strange I mean look, I mean, I think Charlottesville absolutely could could have been described that way Why can we not describe both that way? I think if a group of conservatives went into a restaurant in in in Chased Cory Booker out of it that would be a mob You don't do that we were told that you can't use in politics Targeting districts because you were signaling you want to kill some people Are you kidding me? Look at what's happening to us. The media is so discrediting themselves The American people can see you can see it's it's what Martin Luther king said Trust the American people put violent up to peaceful. They will pick peaceful every time Americans can see what people are doing and they can say I don't want to be a part of that I don't I don't like that. I don't want to be a part if conservatives act the same way in response The American people will say I don't want to be a part of either of you You have to just put them up The press is just discrediting I didn't it's funny. I think it's revealing that that matt lewis was asking her to play that clip and she didn't cut to it So Just saying and she was very dismissive at the end was just again where the mward came from was at the end of that clip She said we're gonna move on from the mward. Yeah Just dismissed it in bizarre I mean, I mean of course they go back to to what you know all the sources that did call the tea party mobs including places Like cnn and huffing and posting all that that did at that time You know, I mean the double standard never even got close. Yeah, but I never got close to that I was gonna say as a liberal that is embarrassing. It's absolutely embarrassing and to see them mobbing A couple having dinner. It makes those of us who are reasonable liberals say the far left does not speak for us We don't want anything to do with that and we're gonna move further right. So I you know like you're saying I think that Whichever side is behaving badly should be called out and it just makes liberals look bad. So being from the sea place Which we have to call in Texas How does America look to you? That's great. What do you what do you mean by that in what way? Saying have we gone insane is Canada gone? We've gone nuts too though. So I feel like it's the pot calling the kettle black really That's really sad though that you guys have gone so nuts that you think we look good But we're we're so polite though. So when we're nuts, we're really nuts, you know We did have that who is that who is the cocaine guy that the mayor that was on Going forward. Yeah, I mean people love there. Yeah But seriously though you what what where have you guys gone? So much farther than us. Well, I mean the jet Yeah, we have the hate speech thing. We've compelled speech with the gender neutral pronouns We have the sex ed curriculum Telling kids that gender is a spectrum and that it's due to traditional gender norms Things like that whereas at least I feel with the states there is more of a pushback whereas in Canada people just kind of say Oh, and then they look the other way. Mm. We have freedom of speech. You don't How scary is it to speak out? I mean here we pay a very high price But I imagine you're paying a very high price there But in Canada you can actually become in trouble with the law As well for saying no, no, that's not true. I mean Jordan Peterson No, I'm not going to call them by their selected pronoun Because it's not true Right. I mean it's gone so far now, you know with the whole gender ideology Stuff where kids are being taken from their families if their families don't affirm them And so going back to like the topic we're just discussing If parents are just wanting to take a slower approach If the child decides that's not okay, they can be removed from the home. It's horrifying Okay, well America's looking pretty good, right? We got closer to an ending of this there was actually case in Ohio of this happening. So you guys are catching up Okay, even better. All right, let's take a break I So, um And that's good for like people with strokes and things like that. Can you See in the context of what I was looking at with Sexual arousal say we can show people pictures and see what they find sexually browsing But it can be used for lots of different lots of different stuff. Yeah So Um I don't know if you've heard the technology that China has come out with to where they're putting Sensors in workers hats And they said I think they started this two years ago Do you remember stew two years ago maybe? And it took about a year before all of the workers started to quote love it And what it is is they have one person that is watching the lines and they can tell If you're drifting if you're tired if you're depressed If you're happy whatever it is and if you are drifting at all you are told Stop drifting And a second time you're asked to leave the line And the employer is saying that it's great because we can get in touch with what people Did they just did they put a collar around that shocked something? Very compassionate Yeah, I mean what's happening with? Technology being able to look inside of us Is truly frightening? Are you concerned about any of that? Are you up on any of this? I'm not scared, but I think it's because my background has been as a scientific researcher so I look around at the field and Researchers are so busy. They don't have time to have nefarious intentions Although you see as you in the case that you just mentioned Um, it can be used for unethical reasons, but in terms of brain imaging I'm not worried because I I see neuroscience as a growing field and that it's being used to answer important questions Like how are we going to improve people's health or how can we better understand? Cognitive processes in the brain Um, I don't see it being used in that way in terms of say mind control or anything like that But how would you go? How would you address things like um um Social media and and even you know the use of iPads and everything else We have people who are high up in silicon valley saying my kids aren't using it What is it? You know that I don't know, you know We don't know how this is going to affect us at all where our kids are guinea pigs on almost everything now um And we know that We've had people from google that have walked out and said this is unethical what we're doing So it's not necessarily the scientists It's the people who are applying that science in different ways that kind of employing them right yeah Right. I think my overall Approach though is always to just see where it goes And if people do use it in an unethical way then to call it up But I think to try and stifle the research out of fear that it might be used unethically Yeah, it's not it's not good. It's not helpful either Uh still climate change climate change, um, you know We've talked about actually like reading the reports Yes, and actually understanding where the source material says and I think a lot of times we get into trouble Because we just take these sort of media summaries of these things and and don't understand what's actually going on Or we take these really crazy claims that people make that aren't supported by the actual science You know like you look at the scientific reports from the uni pcc, which is kind of like the big global warming Uh source of choice Uh, and they go more in depth than anything else And you can go through there and find plenty of really scary You know things things that could be turned into problems and there's obviously a large debate on how catastrophic some of these things can be And and what's the best way to deal with them? And that's been kind of the political debate for a long time But really that debate doesn't really exist in the science when it comes to hurricanes Specifically we have this big um hurricane that's hitting now with you know, that's really bad But we went through a long period Uh where we didn't have any that hit the the united states at least And so when you look at the actual report this just came out a few months ago Um that highlights a bunch of things here and let me give you a couple quotes from the the actual report numerous studies Towards and beyond ar 5 have reported a decreasing trend in global decreasing Triton and global the number of tropical cyclones and or the global accumulated cyclonic energy Um, so again a decreasing Here's another uh, there is a only a low confidence regarding changes in global tropical cyclone numbers under global warming Over the last four decades And finally, uh, this is uh, I mean again you hear a lot of times. Well, maybe they're gonna get stronger Well, there's consequently low confidence in the larger number of studies reporting increasing trends in the global number of very intense cyclones The opposite of what the IPCC said before No, well, the if you remember, uh, you may remember al gore's Yeah, it's a movie back in the mid 2000s where he actually put a hurricane on the the poster for the movie It was that central to the argument at that time And really what they haven't they haven't found that hurricanes are increasing. They're not they're having found that they're increasing Uh in strength, um, that good like right? Like what I feel like he should be like what I thought the world was ending Yeah, but it's not like yeah, like so i'm really excitedly through a hurricane Right exactly and this is not some right wing report right like this is like this is their source of information and it's Yeah, like we get to the point where Science is used by so many people to try to just make their their argument And you know, I think when you look at this you could see things that could be scary There are certain parts of this that could be really damaging and certain things you have to look out for it and adapt to But the hurricanes thing is just convenient. We all see that here comes a giant storm towards Uh towards the united states. We're all freaked out about it. People are going to get hurt in this I mean, this is looks like a really bad one So But this is also something that's happened. There's no increase in the trend on this actually nados and droughts and all these things And this is all in their report It's just it's just not it's not taken seriously people just want the scare the scare monger I mean the new york times just released a Report that they were covering. I think it was last week where they commissioned a photo shoot of a little toddler Sitting next to the corpse of a dead animal like a skeleton and it was crying I guessed because it was it went extinct over global warming that is not journalism like what is that? That's what you do in movies. That's not what you do in the New York times and that that just doesn't help anybody That's a good of an opportunity to pass though. Yeah Yeah, I guess I mean that does seem like what it is like when you they they will tell you if it's if it's supposed to be warm And we get a snowstorm. They'll say it's not that's that's weather that climate which is true Like you can't take one weather event and say it's climate change But yet when a hurricane hits the coast all the sudden that's climate It's constantly uses this convenient excuse to scare people and they used to call this guy Mr. Apocalypse. I mean he would go on the air and say I don't know I think I Something like let's call it ISIS might create try to create a caliphate in the middle east They call you boy were you wrong right like I Crazy and like there's nothing more apocalyptic than global warming reporting They are literally saying everyone on earth is going to die because of of of this and they then they accuse conservatives of going Too far when it comes to apocalyptic thought Can I can I bring in some pictures of the polar cap? Because I read a very compelling story and all I thought to myself the whole time is I don't worry about this because I have stew And so I want to bring it in because I want to show you the the Article I was gonna say study article That is showing that the polar cap is melting and it's going to flood and kill us all I mean there is some evidence that it is well melting actually most of the warming has occurred in the arctic So there are some issues with that but then this but the southern cap has actually Is actually growing actually been growing more ice there and and you know really that the the big scary thing from you know That gory's to point to for 20 foot sea level rises and things that would really be scary was really the entire entire entirety of Greenland Melting and rolling off in the sea There's no evidence that anything like that is even I mean the even in the study that he was quoting it said in several millennia That that could theoretically be a possibility You know there there has been sea level rise going on for a long time It goes back, you know well over the time that it's been warming I mean it's been you know sea level rise has gone up by I want to say it's you know eight centimeters per Decade and it's happened for a very long period of time. It has increased slightly in this last period of warming It's not to say that there's there's you know there are scientists who are doing this work and and trying really hard to get to the truth But like we take that and then we we you know bring it through a cycle of politics and then a cycle of Off-hyphe and then a cycle of media and by the end of it you get something that doesn't have any value at all It's interesting to me that the post-modern goal is to create chaos and and get people to Stop believing in all of the things that they've always believed in and discredit the institutions of the enlightenment Science is the number one piece out of the enlightenment and Look how It's being discredited and I don't think by design is just by human greed and and fear and agenda and politics and money It's just going off the rails and we we have we have No faith to tell us these things are eternally true. We have no science that tells us these things are true We have we have no government that will say this is right. This is wrong We have we're losing all of these institutions What does the human race do when you don't believe in anything? I mean post-fact era. Yeah, Nietzsche, you know, he wasn't celebrating God is dead. He was warning Hey, we've just killed God What will humans replace him with because You don't just abandon that you You channel it some other direction at that time he didn't know it was Taylor Swift That's right wound up being Or social justice because I think for people who are not religious they I would say I'm an atheist But some people will find their God in social justice I have a quick question for you. So I have a lot of really good liberal friends who I'm trying to like Move along to say like I know you're better than this. You're not just about You're not we don't start with that. Sorry. No, not their liberal liberalism But the anger the fear politics the the smearing that all this stuff like that I'm like you you can call it out even though you're liberal. I promise Are you seeing any pushback like from your inner circles of of you know liberal people Are there enough yeah in a positive way is there is there is there enough people who are like As liberals were better than this you know what I'm saying? Yeah, I would say so more people I would say that's almost the mid Why wouldn't say that I can't speak for everyone But I would say there are more people who feel that way than people who are on the fringe Because the people who are on the fringe are extreme They are the loudest and they get the most airtime. They are the ones who seek out media attention That's why speaking out like oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely because then you get called far right you get called you know Yeah, yeah, and like look at Dave Rubin. He's he's liberal He gets called alt right all the time. Oh, yeah, no, I know and it but it's on both sides Yeah, you don't fall in line with the fringes and you're a traitor to whichever side that you were supposedly on watch my twitter feed one day It's incredible and it's I hope that It's going to end but it will only I think it will only happen. I'd love to hear your point of view on this I think it will only happen when there are decent people on both sides because As a conservative Where am I gonna go? Where am I gonna go? Nobody's talking common sense. Nobody will talk science. Nobody will talk fat. Nobody will nobody's saying Yes There she is. There's a group of people that are saying who are saying look I'm really smart and I am on the other side and we disagree but I'm with you And the same has to be on the other side conservatives. This is why I'm just why I wrote the book addicted outrage You have to change the phone call that came in this morning You have to change the tactics this just launching Just launching Names at each other calling each other names and going down further and further in the mud No one will come to either side And you're just going to be stuck in place and you'll eventually just Go over the cliff with everybody else because you have no place to go Uh speaking of that I apologize, but I may make your heads explode. Oh boy With this one. So don lemon had a panel on last night and they were discussing Kanye West. He's a real sellout, right? Obviously he's mentally ill apparently yes now Now he is before he was just eccentric German that is so 1930s Germany So I I watched this and my jaw about hit the floor. Uh want to get your thoughts on it watch Kanye West is what happens when niggros don't read Um and and we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it and pervert it And he's going to have somebody who can stand with me take pictures So it's lemon he can't lemon can't even taste this looking at his thoughts So Listen Kanye West and the racial draft okay They've had it with him and he's an attention whore like the president He's all of a sudden now the the model is so person He's he's the token Negro of the of the trump administration. I know Tara. That's not terry used to work for us That's I'm I've met her. Yeah, that's she was she was not making his point She was saying this is what they're saying about him now. She said no She said we're we're ready to trade him in the racial She was agreeing Up chair. I mean she doesn't she doesn't like trump and she doesn't like kanya west right? I mean that's that's certainly a defensible position There's statements are so racist Yes, I would say that the funny part about that is the guy on the other side like trying to just like No Just stare at the camera. Do not react to it. I'm a white male. I'm saying nothing I'm not working. I can't I just not hear but I just don't I don't get it I mean if you look at african-american unemployment numbers Why why are they so dead set against trump? Well, I mean it's going the other way It seems like his approval rating is is rising. No, I mean it's the The host there. I don't know. I mean, but you know if all got insane It's just I mean they called me and I I will tell you that Many of the things that we feared did not happen with obama. Thank god. Thank god But I was nowhere near this nowhere near this we were at least based in fact and transcripts and Provable things. Here's what you said about Marxism three years ago Where what what happened? Okay? They're insane. They are just making things up out of whole cloth Imagine if blen would have gone on and said Kanye west is what happens? That's it. I mean it's like It's just what's your take? It's so patronizing but I see this a lot and I especially the left likes to lump all non-white people and call us people of color Yes, POCs. I cannot stand that term. I think it's extremely racist. You don't like pop. Oh to think I mean The way I was brought up was everyone is an individual doesn't matter what you look like And nowadays that's considered racist It's considered racist to not assume that the way someone looks should influence the way they think So I think it's a very typical argument that just because a black man doesn't think the way he's supposed to think then he must have internalized Racism or he must really be all those other awful things that they're saying about him now in their defense I do think Kanye is a little Before He was an artist he was flamboyant he was this he was a genius too. Don't look at that and he may be all of those things But when you when you start to say people are I saw a study and I don't know if you've seen this I saw a study that came out. I don't know from Jack in the box that said that you can now You are born a conservative or you are born a liberal Who else would have written that I don't remember who wrote it But it was I read that I'm like okay first of all how second of all That is so incredibly dangerous Now what is it? Should we remove that part of you? I mean you are I might steal that and write that as a book. It is a Terrifying idea that I can look at you now as a baby and know who you're going to be That's nuts I wanted to bring up for you dr So get your take on Colorado state just issued a Warning that Students should now you not use gendered emojis right they should use the yellow ones correct Yeah, right which I was like that's not Could also be equally offensive right so use the yellow ones or use objects Instead of the building really kind of male Great point But so they want to make sure that they're more inclusive so just from your background I just wanted to get your take on that this insane I mean it's to the point now we're arguing about emojis really and even someone who was interviewed from the university said This is purely virtue signaling no one actually cares the university doesn't really care and they're contradicting themselves because apparently the week before they were saying that the yellow emojis were actually white people because it's the default one so I mean this Typical they change their definition the left changes their definitions every week playing into it. It never ends There's no like finish line where they're like, okay, we're good. All right always more. I will tell you it does Trigger me the poop emoji could I didn't know poop had eyes And when I saw that now I thought how many poop people you can't unsee it you can't unsee How many poop people are you for? Pooper people too. They've got eyes. I mean just saying For gender I Ask we should ask we should ask Dr. Humor Hi bro, let me show about Kanye West were racist let us know at the blazes twitter that is at the blaze Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you so much for having me awesome to have another female on the show And you are way smarter than this doctor though. That's true. Thank you. No, thank you. She said it And Jason.
