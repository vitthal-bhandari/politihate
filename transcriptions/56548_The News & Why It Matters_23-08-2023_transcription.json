    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at BlazeTV.com slash The Blind. Today, COVID is back, or at least the left wants you to think so. Trump and Tucker will compete with the GOP debate on Fox News and Rudy Giuliani turns himself in in Georgia. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez and today the media continues their push to make COVID a thing again with headlines like COVID infections have doubled in the US amid rise of two mutant variants or San Antonio bracing for COVID-19 surge, 30% spike in cases alarms health officials. You know, even though the news strains have been widely reported to include symptoms such as sniffling, sneezing, sore throat, well, you know, a cold. And with this renewed sensationalism comes renewed irrational panic. Morris Brown College in Atlanta, Georgia has now become the first American university to bring back mask mandates. Yay. As a precautionary measure, they say, even though no new cases have actually been reported at the school. The new mandate will require staff and students to mask up for two weeks, you know, to slow the spread. Huh, where have I heard that before? But it's not just them. Lionsgate movie studios in California has just reinstated mask mandates, public health officials in Seattle are pushing to bring masking back and CNN posted this on X today. If you are at high risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19, it's time to dust off those N95 masks. Now, don't let it be lost on you that the picture just happens to be a child, someone who is and has always been the least likely to have any serious issues with the virus. And with the latest reports, stating federal agencies are already buying COVID-19 equipment and PPE and hiring consultants to help enforce pandemic era safety protocols, I think now is a really great time to ask yourselves, are you willing to do it again? I mean, I wouldn't know because I didn't do it the first time in odds are if you're a long time viewer of the show, you didn't either because a little over three years ago, when they tried to shut you down and force you and your children to suffocate on your own carbon dioxide, I sat here and told you, don't you dare give them an inch, not one. But enough Americans said, but the doctors were the experts and who was I just some dumb TV host with too much access to Google? Hey, that turned out for you. Not well. But I'm sure it's just as strange coincidence that we are once again entering another presidential election season as this new super scary mutant virus happens to be emerging. Here to discuss this and more, I am so excited we have Seth Dylan, the CEO of Babylon B along with the Babylon B's managing editor Joel Berry. So this is a Babylon B takeover, I guess. I want to play for you guys a clip of Anthony Fauci back. I believe this was August 15th and he was in the middle of of an interview and I want you to listen, not just to what Anthony Fauci is saying about us not being done with COVID, but I want you to listen to Dr. Tina Chopra talk about wearing a mask on planes watch. Our immunity has been waning after the boosters and hospital eyes hospitalizations are slightly up. There are no masks I see in the community and when I we are one, you know, when I'm at the airport or in the flight, I see people laughing at me. What are your thoughts on that? And what do you any thoughts on what to expect in terms of, you know, the flu, RSP, COVID moving into the fall? Well, first of all, you had about 70 questions there, but that's good. I'll try to, I'll try to succinctly answer. First of all, we are not done with COVID. We know that. I mean, if you look at just the last couple of weeks that the number of cases last week or 12% greater than the weather week before and 25% greater than there were two weeks ago, we have an uptick in cases and hospitalizations and deaths. It isn't anywhere nearly as bad as it was a year, a year and a half ago. So we're not saying we're in an explosive surge. Right. So if you have a an uptick in hospitalizations, because it was one, and now it might be like six, right? And that's really bad. But Dr. Tina Chopra, very upset that people are laughing at her for wearing a mask on a plane. This clip was from August 15th, 2023. Yeah, thank you for clarifying this year. Yes, this month even. It's so wild. That laughter, though, does give me hope for America and the fact that people are wearing it. That's good. That's good. That is good. That is good. Yeah. The whole mask, people are done with that stuff. They don't want to go back to that. And it's actually, that's a powerful thing too. If you get laughed at, like, a lot of people I hear people say, bring back shame, bring back shame with a lot of different behaviors that should be shameful and somehow aren't. I think that's effective, honestly. Yeah. I am so... I'm going to go around pointing and laughing at people, but I might snicker over it. Well, you don't have to point. I think laughing is entirely appropriate here. But so we're talking about mask mandates with cases. And they always, I remember back when they, we went through this before COVID 1.0. Now this is COVID 2.0. And they always would talk about, well, there's enough to take in cases. There's enough to take in cases in the community. And it's like, well, I mean, we've always had colds in the communities. And guess what? It's always going to be, there's always going to be an uptick when school starts and kids start interacting with each other. And they pass each other bunch of colds. And then everyone's fine. And they seem to forget that, well, maybe they don't, that's not forgetting. They just choose to selective memory. Well, yeah. This is essentially a cold virus. And it mutates an infinite number of times. And it will continue to mutate until the end of time. And this gives this whatever you want to call this conspiracy of interest, whether it's corporations who profit from this politicians who profit from this, like this, this forever excuse to whenever they need to, they can pull out. Remember, what was it just a few months ago? Jimmy Kimmel, you know, on his show, XBB 0.1.5, you know, there's always going to be an variant. There's always going to be an uptick if you compare it to another month before. And so it's just given them something that they can use. And they'll continue to use it until they're completely ignored. But the bizarre thing is that the tactics to deal with it are exactly the same as what didn't work the first time. It was like, let's go back to masking and social distancing. Are we going to see all those stickers on the floor again about where we're supposed to stand and, you know, supposedly close environments that aren't well-ventilated? I think this is a test run. I think that they they're hoping to pull this out in a major way for their November elections of next year when the president is elected. This is going to give them the ability to, you know, to do all their things with mail-in ballots and drop boxes and whatever they need to do to push their guy across the finish line. And I think they're testing it. They're going to see how we respond, how effective it is. I think the flight attendants just want their power back. Remember the power trips the flight attendants had? I flew a lot. I don't know why I was flying so much during COVID, but every time I was on a plane, man, it was my mask would come down to here and it wasn't quite over the bridge of my nose. And they'd be enraged about it. Sir, sir. Could you eat your pretzels quicker? Yeah. You're taking too long. Which actually was a very solid strategy of just like, do you remember the guy that had the fries? Yeah. And he was just like eating one fry at a time so slowly that it lasted him throughout the entire flight, even though they were soggy fries and they were cold, it was totally worth it. So, okay, so on this COVID topic, I want to throw in just one more story here for you. Rutgers University is facing some backlash for their COVID vaccine mandate. Now, they're not the only one. There's like 100 schools that still require students to be vaccinated COVID vaccine in order to attend in person. And Rutgers told incoming students that they must abide by a COVID-19 vaccine mandate. There will be no exceptions. And you know, it's just, it's interesting that we're still talking about the vaccine mandate. I get it. We know masks don't work, right? But it's very, it's much harder for the medical experts to admit that masks don't work, even though you can show them study after study after study that shows that masks don't freaking work. But with the vaccine, you had the CDC administrator, the top CDC official, saying, well, it's become clear to us that the vaccine does not stop the spread, does not stop you from contracting it, does not stop you from transmitting it. And yet still inexplicably, it seems, we have these colleges that are requiring it for their healthy young students. Right. Who have more of a risk of heart problems if they get it, then they would have had otherwise. Right. Right. Yeah, that it's very clear that if you just get the vaccine, you can still spread the virus. Right. And that was, that was originally the reason why the mandates were necessary is because the virus will stop with you, right? You're a dead end for the virus. And that's not the case anymore. So what's the justification for a mandate? Right. What is it? I think, I think these leftist universities, in from their perspective, it's a smart move because they, we know that these universities are not there to educate students. They're there to create a certain kind of person they're there to indoctrinate. And this is really kind of a way of filtering out the free thinkers from their application process. Yeah. If they can, if they don't want show, yeah, vaccine mandate, we're only going to get the people, the, the, the NPCs at our university, which is what they want. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting. That is true. My work. Yeah. I mean, okay. So on that note, what's going to happen to the college system? Because I'm like, I don't see, I don't see it lasting another five years. I feel like it's going to have to implode. Who is, who is going to send their children to Georgetown, to Rutgers, to Yale, to all these places where you, they can't even afford it. So you're paying an arm and a leg to send your kids to be indoctrinated. It has to collapse. It has to. It's subsidized by the government forever, which is what they're trying to do. Yeah. That is, that's really the aim of this. It's more affordable by making everybody pay for it. Right. Right. Right. Which, and then consequently does not make it more workable. That might be the only way it could possibly survive. You can get a full education on YouTube now, you know, a better education. Yeah. That's true. Okay. I want to, I want to switch gears here and talk about the presidential debate that's happening tonight, which by the way, if you guys haven't heard, we are doing debate coverage here at Blaze. Now Fox has made it very difficult for us to like bring you any sort of coverage, but it's okay. We're smart. We're creative here over at Blaze TV. And so we will give you a pre-show. We're going to do a live chat in the middle of the debate only exclusive to Blaze TV subscribers. So make sure that you're subscribed. And then we will be giving some analysis and reaction after the debate has ended. You can go to blazedebate.com and use promo code debate to get $25 off of your annual subscription. But I don't know if you guys have heard the devastating news. Doug Bergham has suffered an injury before the debate. Yes. Are you, I was waiting for you to say who is this the person who's not supposed to be there that somehow got in there? One of them. Are you saying there's only one? This is North Dakota governor. Doug Bergham has suffered a horrible leg injury in Milwaukee. Yes. Last night while playing a game of pickup basketball with his staff, he is one of the eight that is expected tonight. And he says he is unclear if he will be able to stand at the debate and he hopes to make ongoing debate stage walkers, but he just doesn't know. He just doesn't know. So I just I wanted to break that news to you guys. Is this is is this okay? Well, I was kind of rooting for him because I heard he the whole reason he got onto the debate stage was by selling $20 gift cards in exchange for small donations. Yeah. It was just enough to get him across the finish line, which I was like, you know what, that was clever. It was. Yeah, you got to give him points for creativity and cleverness. Maybe this is an excuse. He's like, I didn't know it would actually work. I'm not prepared to debate. My, my only got an injury. So, so Tucker has confirmed on Twitter, I'm sorry, on X. I'm never going to get that right. He has confirmed on X that he is going to air this Donald Trump interview at the same time as the RNC is having their debate on Fox News. He released this short video watch on Sunday. Donald Trump announced that he will not participate in tonight's Republican candidates debate hosted by Fox News in Milwaukee. Whatever you think of Trump, he is as of tonight, the indisputable far and away front runner in the Republican race. We think voters have an interest in hearing what he thinks. So when Trump approached us about having a conversation for a far larger audience than he'd receive on cable news, we happily accept it. That interview will air tonight in this space at 8.55. We hope you'll watch. Uh oh. It's getting tense up in here. What are your thoughts? I personally think Trump should be at the debate debating. I wish they was. Yeah, I wish they would. First of all, it would be much more entertaining. Yeah. Because he's the one they're all going to be attacking. Right. Not have him in the room and responding the way that he responds. I love Trump's responses to people coming at him. I don't know. I think we all lose because of that. But I think it potentially hurts him too. Because it leaves an opening for some of these other candidates. Yeah. And he's so good at shutting people down in these debates when he's not there. You know, I don't know. We'll see. But yeah, but he's trying to one up them and yeah and go to a bigger audience at the same time as them. So he's still trying to try to get him to himself. Yeah. Over them, which it may or may not work. I don't know. As long as the audience is indeed bigger, if the numbers of Tucker's Twitter are smaller than Fox News's broadcast, then he'll never hear the end of it. I just can't imagine that it will be that it will be smaller, especially because I mean, again, you could point to the previous presidential debates, but that it those included Trump. Yeah. Right. And I mean, look, I understand why I understand the position. Trump's not going to go because why would he he's pulling so far ahead? He doesn't need to give the time of day to these people blah, blah, blah. Like I get it. I agree with it. Selfishly, like you said, Seth, I just want him there because I want the viral clips. I want him to call people names. I want him insulting people. Like I just want to watch that for myself, for my own personal benefit. And I'm really mad that it's not happening. I mean, I feel like you could make both cases. I believe your case as well, Joel, that like, it's like, come on, you're really good at this. Yeah. Just just show them up. And they don't stand a chance. So I don't know. I'm torn on that. But he will be sorely missed. And we'll see what the numbers do the next day. I mean, imagine if you think of like a sports analogy, like a team gets the finals, let's say LeBron's Lakers gets the finals and they're up three games to nothing. And then LeBron just sits out the last game or something like that. It's just weird to just like not even show up because you're ahead. Yeah. Well, and I also, I understand others' concerns who have said, well, what if the Biden campaign uses that tactic against you in the general and they just say, Oh, well, we're, I mean, we're pulling ahead. So we don't need to debate. I'm the president. I'm the actual president of the United States. Why should I need to debate? It just seems like a weird. Yeah, we're precedent to set. Okay, let's go ahead and take a quick break. We'll be back with more, but we want to think our sponsor even pure.

All right, Rudy Giuliani arrived in Fulton County in Georgia today to turn himself in. Honestly, I feel like I say this every time we talk about it, I cannot believe that I am saying the words that I'm saying right now. I still can't believe it every time we talk about it. My mind cannot wrap itself around this. So Giuliani is surrendering himself at the same Atlanta jail where two of the 19 defendants charged in this Georgia election denialism case, whatever you want to call it, turned themselves in earlier this week. And I want to play a clip of him addressing reporters as he left his apartment building this morning watch. Georgia, I'm feeling very, very good about it because I feel like I'm defending the rights of all Americans. As I did so many times as a United States attorney, people like to say I'm different. I'm the same Rudy Giuliani that took down the mafia, made New York City the safest city in America, reduced crime more than any mayor in the history of any city anywhere. And I'm fighting for justice. I have been from the first moment I represented Donald Trump in this man who has now been proven in this in several times. I don't know how many times he has to be proven innocent and they have to be proven to be liars. Actually, enemies of our republic, we're destroying right sacred rights. They're destroying my right to counsel, my right to be a lawyer that destroying his right to counsel. It's not accidental that they've indicted all those lawyers. Never heard of that before in America. All the lawyers indicted. Now, whether you dislike or you like Donald Trump, let me give you a warning. If the kid it comes for you, where's the lie? That was a great statement. Yeah, I'm glad he's here to take him seriously when he didn't have hair dye. Yeah, I know. As a strong statement. As a strong statement. Well, I mean, you bring up a good point because he mentions everyone says I'm different. I do think that there was this sentiment that like, oh, he's gotten a little bit crazy. He seems a little crazy. He didn't sound crazy to me at all. It's not crazy there. No. And he sounded cool. He sounded cool as well. He sounded confident that I think he knows what a bogus case this is. And the fact that I love how he brought up his time as mayor of New York, fighting the mafia, that's really what this is. Our legal system, our lawyers, our judges, have become the mafia. It's a tyranny of judges and lawyers. And they have abdicated their responsibility to enforce or to rule out the law in a fair way. I saw somebody post a picture of Hillary Clinton and saying, look who's not currently being indicted and turning herself in right now. And it was this picture of Hillary Clinton. I'm like, but that's the point is that, you know, if if we're going to treat everybody equally and we're going to actually go after people who break the law, then she should have been the first one who was indicted and actually held accountable for what she'd done and said. Yes. Now, I will also say, I love Trump. But he said that he was going to do that. And then he didn't change his mind on that later on. And I mean, you have to wonder how badly he's kicking himself on that now. Talking about great debate moments. He's like, you can jail that. So good. It was so good. That was a moment he wanted. I was like standing and cheering in my living room. And then what? Nothing happened. Nothing happened. Right. I know. Well, because I think that he has this proclivity to just want to be liked all the time. Like, he wanted to work with the Democrats. He wanted to believe the best in them because he just wants to be liked, I think, at the end of the day. And he doesn't think the way that they think, which is we've always got to be 10 steps ahead of our enemies. And they do believe that we are enemies. I'm not saying that. I'm speaking for them. And so, you know, we've got to go for the jugular every single time. We're not playing by the rules. And unfortunately, I think that Republicans are so slow to learn that like they're not playing by the rules that you have set for this game. So you think Trump's going to be different this time around? If he's elected, he'll handle things a little differently than the first time? I do think that he will feel a certain level of like, I need vindication at this point. Now, whether or not that's good, I don't know. I don't think that that's like a good way to run the country. But I do think that he certainly has learned his lesson after four indictments that he did not train the swamp. I have talked to some people who are in his cabinet who they say are going to be part of his administration. And if he is elected again, who are already laying the groundwork. And this is what they tell me. I don't know. They're laying the groundwork for day one to shut everything down. Really? When it comes to agencies, the deep state, the problem that they had in the first administration is they ran into all these, you know, these legal battles and these delays for four years. And they kind of learned their lesson. And I think over these last four years, they've been doing their homework and laying the groundwork. So the hope is that they'll flip the switch day one. And that's what they're telling me anyway. Right. Well, I mean, Joe Biden has shown us even if, and I'm not saying what they would do is unconstitutional, but the Constitution doesn't really matter because you just do the thing. And even if a court comes back later and says, you can't do the thing, you've already done the thing for like a year. And it really is kind of a moot point at that point. You've proven that you can just do whatever you want. Do you think that Trump is going to go to do you think he has a likelihood of going to prison? Not to prison. I don't personally think he has, I'm not the best person to ask. We just make jokes on the internet. So it's weird that you're asking us. But I mean, I don't think Donald Trump's ultimate feeling. We probably get a few jokes out of it. As an expert, I can say, I have no idea. I don't think you'd go to prison. But, you know, they might they might do everything they kind of try to prevent him from being eligible to be elected, whatever that might be, whether that's constitutional or not, who knows, find out after, you know, it's too late. I don't know. I think they know these cases are bogus, but it's it's a tactic to interfere with his campaign. Yeah. And I think they know they'll most likely be thrown out. But yeah, if they can if they can do as much damage as they can in the meantime while he's trying to run, then we'll do that. Which I saw a truth social notification, I get notifications from them that pop up frequently. And one of them this morning was that Kevin McCarthy had said, it was it was all like a wording that was like, might that the Congress might be looking at an impeachment inquiry after they reconvene. And I'm like, Oh, that's right. You guys need your vacation. I mean, it's not like they're, you know, indicting and politically persecuting the front runner of your party. So please don't lift a finger yet. Make sure go get your vacation. Don't call anything special. Don't do an emergency session. It's totally fine. And then once you get back and reconvene, you might think about an impeachment. Right. Right. It's not very aggressive. No, it's not. And I just wish that they would have the balls to just be like, we've got all of this evidence here. You guys impeached him over a phone call, which by the way, isn't again, I like to point out to people the impeachment over the phone call in Ukraine was asking them about the corruption in Ukraine that we continue to get more and more evidence of every single freaking day when it comes to the Biden crime family. So I love how he calls it a perfect phone call. It was a perfect phone call. And most perfect phone calls. He still refers to perfect phone calls. I've seen a couple truth posts recently with perfect phone call and all caps. You did it like yesterday. Yeah, he did it yesterday. It was like, it was a perfect phone call. It's amazing. How is it? I was just a real person. I love it. So good. It's true. What you say, though, if the shoe were on the other foot, the Democrats would have indicted the president two times. They did it for far less. Yeah, they would have had them impeached already. They did it for far less. And I feel like the Republicans constantly are like, well, we don't want to stoop to their level. We don't want to do like, okay, well, they're gas lighting you because this is actually a reason to impeach. And now they're making you think like, it's just, oh, well, we don't want to stoop to their level. Well, my question is, is can Biden actually make it through another term? And are they really going to run him as if he can? He's, you know, he's fading so fast. Like we're watching it unfold. And it's in it's, on the one hand, you know, a lot of these gaps and whatever, they're comical. On the other hand, it's kind of sad. And the people who say this is elder abuse have a point. Yeah. How long can that go on for? And how serious is it that Biden is actually a candidate for this election, which is still over a year away? I know, I know. Well, you keep wondering with every single bit of evidence that comes out in all of this, the Ukraine scandal with Burisma and everything that that the committees are finding out, I keep wondering like, is this going to be the moment where Democrats go? Because you've got to believe they're on the edge of their seats. Like, okay, all right, we got to bring in Gavin News. Well, how do we get Kamala out of the way? Because we got to bring in Gavin Newsome. And you got to believe like every single day something new comes out that they're like, you go is, okay, is this the one that they're going to finally pull the plug on this campaign that we all know is not happening? You've seen hints of it too. You've seen a couple people on the media, even on the left in the media talk about his age. Yeah. And you know, some of the issues with aging candidates with, they're like kind of posturing and positioning for maybe we will have to pull the rip court on it. Right. Yeah. You've seen it. I know, I know. And they're doing it more and more every single day. The control room set put that up and said, what do you mean to tell me this guy is not with it? No, in fact, he is not. Which by the way, now that you guys are playing this clip, the breathing is what I was going to say. What that heavy breathing while you're sitting is a problem. Yeah. Yeah. That is doesn't look healthy. No. I mean, I genuinely, I would hate that this would happen. God forbid that every time he stands up to give a speech, I'm like, is he going to make it? Right. Is he or is he just going to collapse and have like some sort of event? And I don't mean the tripping and falling. I mean, like, he just does he looks half dead. Right. All right. Let's go ahead and we got to take another quick break. And we will be back with more. But we want to thank our sponsor, this segment, First Liberty Institute. So there has been a seismic shift in the legal system, an oppressive legal precedent in place since 1971 was recently overturned by the Supreme Court. And the Americans who benefit the most are people of faith. So First Liberty wants to get the word out. This happened because a high school coach Joe Kennedy used to take a knee in prayer on the field after games on the football field until praying in public got him fired. But now the legal precedent that got him fired is gone. And to celebrate the victory, my friends over at First Liberty Institute created the First Freedom Challenge. So they're asking people to fill local stadiums and pray after the game, just like Coach Kennedy on his first game back. This is Friday, September 1st. If there are three things you can do to promote the first freedom challenge, one, you can sign up at rfia.org and commit to praying on September 1st. You can also record a short video message challenging people to take a knee in prayer with Coach Kennedy and of course share that video on your social media. Let the world know that the freedoms intended by our founding fathers are back, baby. Join me and take the First Freedom Challenge. You can sign up at rfia.org. Phil Robertson here. They told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come. But it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen. But when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. Own The Blind today at blazedtv.com slash The Blind. All right, I want to play this clip of parental rights advocates and far left. I would say far left. LGBT activists who were kind of at each other in Los Angeles. This is the group Leave Our Kids Alone. They organize a pro-parental rights event, which you can't do these days. Guys, you can't listen. They're not your kids. They're the government's kids. They're the teachers kids. They're the community's kids. They're your kids. They're not your kids. You don't get the rights. So you can't do things like hold signs that say Leave Our Kids Alone. And you can't do things like stand up against the sexualization of your children in schools because that's not fashionable these days. So I want to play this clash here between the parents and I think this is Antifa if I'm not mistaken, bunch. So I just I'm really glad that I have never been caught up in something like that because I go to a lot of these events. I lead some of these events and I got to tell you if Antifa actually started like messing with me, I probably would be in jail. So I'm just really glad that that hasn't happened to me. I'm just gonna let them swing first and say self-defense. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Go with them. Yes. And well, and a lot of cameras are out. So I'm like, there will always be evidence exonerating me that will show that I will not be the first person to get physical. But I got to tell you, I'm kind of there once someone starts something with me that like, these are my kids and I will fight for them in any sense that you want to take it. These people too, they like they act tough because they're in a mob. Yes. Yes. But one-on-one, like these are just like total losers, these people. They really are and they'd be frightened and scared if they were singled out. It's just they have this courage because they're in a mob. It's the same way the Twitter mobs work. Everybody gets all, they feel the safety of the anonymity and and how they have the numbers. But yeah. It's been really heartening to see kind of the uprising of these parents over the last year or two, especially the moms, the mama bears, protecting their kids. And you'd think that these people would recognize that it's kind of a bad look to oppose a movement called leave our kids alone. If you don't want to be called a groomer, but yeah, it's just these people are really given over to us. No, we will not leave your kids alone coming for your kids. I just chant that in the streets. They try to own it and it's like, no, that is not the way to go about this because it's not just going to be far right extremists who are upset about that. There's going to be plenty of people well to the left of them, even left of center who are like, you can't come after our kids. We don't want you to come out for our kids either. Right. Well, right. Exactly. Well, and I think that it was so telling when the movie sound of freedom was released and you actually had them trying to make the case like you need to be pro sex trafficking because not be far right. Right. Right. It's like thinking kids shouldn't be mutilated or sexualized or groomed is an extreme far right position. Right. That's insane. I feel like you had at that moment, you had a sum of the maybe the few sane Democrats left who went like, I guess I'm far right then. I don't know. I guess I just became far right because certainly as they continued that messaging, the movie only seemed to get more popular. Yeah. So maybe that is a positive backfires on them. It does backfire. I think this, honestly, that's the answer to this whole thing is just continue. Like if you just continue to defend the truth and basic reason and parental rights, simple things like that and they attack it. How bad does it make them look? What does it end up doing for their own? You know, like, what kind of numbers are they actually going to have when those are the tactics and the messaging that they're employing? Yeah. And it reiterates the need for strong families too. I mean, you have to know what your kid is into and who they're talking to. You have to have a good relationship with them a good relationship with your spouse. This movement really thrives on praying off the kids who are either fatherless or who are from broken homes. And so I try to talk to my kids once a week. Yeah. Got to stay on top. At least. Oh, you're a good dad. That's really nice. Well, and I mean, also get your kids the hell out of public schools because. Yeah, exactly. We just saw what Libs of TikTok had released the, I forget which school district it was, but the art teacher for elementary school students who apparently had posted all over his own Facebook page that he like had violent tendencies and was mentally ill and all of these things. And he was an elementary school art teacher and a Satanist or something. Yes. All of it wrapped into one. Right. And you know, you go like they're really not doing the vetting that they should be doing before they put these people in front of your children. Where they are. Maybe that's what I was going to say. Maybe it's intent. Maybe it's intentional. Maybe it's intentional. I don't know, but I had a a former school and it was not up just a public school that my children or my child at the time went to that I experienced firsthand. I had a teacher who just something was off. Like it was, he was just weird. And I just, you know, you get the parental like red flag and you go, Mm. My gut doesn't feel right. And I started looking at his, at his social media, at his Facebook and turns out he was into all of this like anime porn that was like the little girl porn. Oh my God. All over his Facebook page. Wow. And I found that as a parent and I'm like, you guys are real. And I mean, I'm sure the audience knows I don't have to tell them like, I am heavy mama bear involved in everything. I mean, I vetted the hell out of the school. And still I was just like, you're not checking their social media pages. Every single teacher that you hire, you should be going, you should be scrubbing through their social media pages. But you know what? It's on parents to do this stuff. We had it happen at our school too. We had parents bring to the attention of the school that they had just hired somebody who had questionable social media posts like that. And the school didn't know about it. They're like, Oh, we're overwhelmed. We didn't have, we didn't do adequate checking. We're sorry. They were apologetic. But it's on the parents. You can't leave it up. You can't just trust that the school is going to catch all these things. Yes. They're going to pay enough attention. And again, even out of private school. Yeah, even out of private school, even out of private school, they could be a not paying attention. Everyone's busy or be indoctrinating your children anyway, which by the way, leads me to just go ahead and hold this up right here. Finally, I thought we'd never get to this. This is the news of the day, actually. And I want to, what I want to do is take a quick break. And then I want to, I want to talk about the Babylon be guide to gender. We'll be right back. All right, gentlemen, tell me about the Babylon be guide to gender. This has the comprehensive handbook to men, women and millions of new genders we just made up. And there is, of course, I was telling them off air that the bearded man with the dress, which I actually see quite often in my line of work. It never, it never sits well with me. I feel like it's a year. They're not committing to their character as a drag queen. They don't shave the nasty beard. Tell me about it. Well, this is a book that I paid jolt right. Yeah, Seth came into the office one day and started throwing chairs and said, we need more books. You know, write something. So that's what we know. So last year, as you know, we got kicked off a Twitter for misgendering Rachel of this. Yes. How dare you? And it was a, it was a, that is a beautiful woman. How dare you? Exactly. We, we not only use, use Rachel Levine's proper rank, but we misgendered her. And so it was a time of soul searching and we educated ourselves. And we, we decided we were going to be better. And so we took all of the things that we learned in that, in that dark time in our lives. And we put them into this book hoping that it helps other people too, because you know, you need to subscribe to gender ideology all the way to be a good person in this world. I did notice that it is the book is dedicated to Rachel Levine, to the Babylon bees man of the year, Rachel Levine. And it has a quote from Rachel Levine is very insightful. It says, I am a woman known biological male Rachel Levine. So I want to, I flip to this page, What Men are Good at? Video games, true, driving, mostly true. Opening pickle jars is my personal favorite. Keeping the power on you guys are really good at that. Like, I mean, I am, I'm doing laps around my house constantly, just turning off the lights after all of the males in my house. So that one is true. All sports, yes, breaking stuff. Absolutely. Dying in wars. Yes. The you guys are good at all of those things. So really, you guys are just basically saying screw you guys, we're going to be as offensive as possible. Absolutely. Yeah. When you look at our website and you look at the headlines that we publish, I say that that is us at our most restrained and mature. And the why we love writing these books is because we just get to unleash our immaturity. And there's no, there's no guide rail whatsoever. So it's all in there. It's it's this it's the stupidest stuff that you've ever ridden your life. But building on that immaturity, I would say they started it first. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, they did. They started the immaturity first because if they didn't go around saying that you can choose whatever gender you want to be or children have the ability to consent to chopping off their genitals and all of the other crazy things that they come that they came up with, you wouldn't need to write the book. So much the silliest parts of this book are the true part, like the actual opinions of the left that we're mocking. Yeah. And you can just quote them and it's insane. And so I don't know. I think you don't have to do much work. Yeah, you don't have to do a lot of work. It's when we write these books, we're we're really just okay, let's think like a leftist for a few months. Right. Right. Right. This and we write a leftist book and it turns out it's really funny. Yeah. Well, and it, you know, you guys on social media have just done so much good work that you read it and you're like, I don't is this a Babylon Bee Headliner is this real life. I don't like you have to double check who it's coming from. Right. Because or it's a Babylon Bee Headline and you're like, wait, that did that happen already in real life? I can't remember if it did. Well, people criticize us for that. They say that our jokes are too close to reality. And I say it's exactly the opposite. Reality is too close to satire. And that's why you can't tell the difference between the two. You see real headlines all the time, the most ridiculous headlines about how shark attacks are being renamed as negative incidents or something like that. Like, I'm having a negative interaction when a shark is attacking you because it's offensive to the sharks to call it an attack. That's real. No. Real headline. You haven't seen that one? No. It's that kind of stuff that like, you know, you can't you can't make it up. Yeah. And it's in the world every day. And so I don't blame people when they can't tell the difference between Bee Headlines and Real Headlines. It does happen all the time where we're in the writer's room and we're kicking some headline ideas back and forth. And something will happen in the news where we're like, okay, we have to be more absurd because this just happened. What we're writing right now just happened. Already happened. We've thrown out headlines because because the news beats us to we have to buy a couple of have to write jokes that are funnier than what Democrats are doing in real life. And that's hard. That's hard. That's why I give you guys all the credit in the world. How do you do that? Like, John Fetterman, how do you that is a parody in and of itself? I mean, God bless the guy. I think he should be home, you know, like, I don't know, doing speech therapy or something. I certainly don't think he should be in the Senate. You're talking about 100 people in the entire country who are supposed to be so like prestigious and esteemed that they belong in the Senate. And we have people like John Fetterman and Diane Feinstein, who's not even in control of her own finances anymore and Mitch McConnell and all of these. Read a script of a Kamala Harris speech and tell me that that's not parody. It's not from Veep. Like, this is real. It's unbelievable. That's why I don't buy the argument that, you know, you hear it all the time. Republicans need more quality candidates. We'd win if we had more quality candidates. Democrats can win with debt people. We have no excuse here. You're exactly right. And they were hoodies. And it really pisses me off because if you're going to get elected dress up, I mean, at least wear a button up shirt for God's sake. You can get nominated and confirmed to the Supreme Court not knowing what a woman is. Right. The Supreme Court, the highest court in the entire country. You're going to make decisions about women's rights without being able to even define what a woman needs to recuse herself from all cases involving women. Seriously. That's a great point. She needs to do that immediately. Okay. We'll tell everyone where they can find where they can find this banger. Yeah. So it comes out first week of September. 19th September, second week, third week. Yeah. It comes out in September, ladies. Roughly about circa September. Yeah. Okay. You can get it on Amazon.
