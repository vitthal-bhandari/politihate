    "text": " All right, Black America, you're really testing me this week. It's not really how I wanted to end the week. We started with Juneteenth being ghetto and made up. People were upset about that. And now we're moving on to this viral clip, which obviously we're going to have to discuss if you haven't seen it of this young woman named Kadiah Amman, who was at her college graduation, decided to essentially, I would say, assault a white administrator. And yes, there are Black people applauding her online. We're going to discuss it. And let me just general disclaimer, if you're into Hoodrat Antics, this episode is just not going to be for you. Plus later on, guess what? The nation's first elected transgender state rep has been arrested on child's porn charges. That is very shocking to me, very, very shocking. All that and more today coming up on Candace Owens. All right, so let's just start from the beginning. This clip started making the rounds. Yes, she online. It's got millions and millions of views. It's a young Black girl. Her name is Kadiah Amman. It is alleged that this clip was taking at Queen's College. We've not yet been able to confirm that. It's a graduation ceremony. Nonetheless, and this is what was shared online. I want you to actually just watch her behavior and see what your gut reaction is to it. Take a listen. Okay, let's go. You never let me get my moment. So I want to say my name is Kadi Jatadiano, and I'm graduating today. Oh my God. You smashed the mic out of my hand. So today is going to be all about me. Oh, drop the mic. Congratulations. A lot happening in that video. Very clearly she just wrestled that microphone out of a white administrator's hand. So the mic said the day was going to be all about her through it on the ground. Miraculously, someone in the background is like, you go girl, congratulations, because that person is Phil. And you would think that any person watching this video, if we lived in a normal society where there were any moral standards, if we agreed upon behavior that was immoral and irrational, every single person would be condemning this girl. Forget what she says. Forget even if she was telling the truth, and that woman didn't let her have her moment, whatever that means at a graduation ceremony. I don't think I've ever been allowed to speak at any of my graduation ceremonies, unless you're maybe the valedictorian or there to give a speech. Whatever that means, her behavior would be unacceptable, right? You would say, even if something went wrong, the correct way to deal with that and to remedy that would not be to snatch a microphone and wrestle it out of the hand of one of your administrators, take the mic, cause this bizarre situation in front of all of these other graduates that are surrounding you, and then to throw it onto the floor and to walk off. In a normal rational world, we don't live there. That's not where we are in America. So shockingly, this video hits the internet and immediately people are saying, well, I just want more context. I want more context you'd need to this behavior. Well, they got more context because Kadiah herself then went on to TikTok to explain why she did that. Hear her version of events. Take a listen. It's my story time. Basically, what happened was, I was walking on and we had to announce our names to say our name before we get on the stage. So I was saying my name and she literally, my name is Long. My name obviously, I have like three syllables of my name. I'm not going to say exactly my name right now, but okay, just so you get a point. So I didn't even finish getting to say my name. And then the people that went before me and everything, they all got to say their name, their major and even extras. And me and another girl noticed that she was putting the mic, she was putting the mic down super fast for some black people. I don't want to be that person, but that was the team. So I mean, I just couldn't let that happen because I just feel like I worked so hard to graduate and went through so much s*** to graduate that I just felt like I had to reclaim my moment. I'm sorry, I'm not a problematic person. I don't want to ruin no one's day. I don't want to violate anybody, but that's what she did. She didn't even let me finish speaking. She put the mic down, cut me off. And that was the only time I was able to speak. So I just feel like that wasn't right. Sorry, I must understand. I'm assuming racism, that's why she did it, of course. It's a 20-30. I'm assuming whatever she did is because of racism. What did she say there? So she's at the graduation. Who's buying this? Again, we believe it took place in Queens, but we do know it took place in 2023 in America. So we are supposed to believe that in 2023 in America, following BLM rotting our entire society and rotting the minds of young people, there was this white administrator who just couldn't help herself this graduation. And she was tasked with holding this mic and allowing kids to say their names. And she decided every time she saw a black person, she just wasn't going to let them do it because she's like, you know what, I'm one of those good old dirty racists from the South back in the 1940s. So when I see a black person trying to say their name, I'm going to stop them. You would think that obviously a version of events like that wouldn't pass a sniff test. But what do you know? People were applauding her in the comments. I couldn't believe it on Twitter. You go, baby. Yes, sometimes black people just need to be heard. Of course, this is the true version of events. What else could happen? This happens all the time. There are just white administrators that are stopping black people being allowed to speak at their graduation. Again, I don't know why anybody is expecting to speak at their graduation, aside from being the valedictorian. So obviously, this girl was lying. But obviously, it takes a modicum of common sense to be able to do that very quickly. We don't live among people with common sense anymore in America. We live among race hustlers. We live among people that are emotional and irrational. And so they rushed to her defense before her other classmates, who also happened to be black, said that she was lying. But actually, that's not what happened at all. Now, the audio in this next, I'm going to show you is not really great, but don't worry, I'm going to reiterate what this girl says, who also attended this graduation, who also, despite being black, was allowed to say her name in the microphone. Take a listen. I was in the graduation. I graduated in my graduation. Basically, there was two sections, section A and section B. And within those two sections, there was two long lines. And we're so too, say our names when we approached the ladies in the video to say our names, I didn't like. But she didn't know any of our names to know whether or not it was long short, how many symbols XYZ she didn't know to hold it a certain way, how long, and that. So, we just really told her say our first and last name. I also have said other things extra than my first and last name, I said I love my mama. And some girl performing, who was also a chocolate girl, said, big opportunity maker. So, I don't see where this, because we're black and all of the other things that's coming into play. I also believe that she did that because it wasn't a little white old lady, it wasn't anybody else. I don't believe she would have done that. She would have took her out and would have walked away. That was the case if that really happened. Also, the mic was never handed to us for it to get snatched. The lady was going back up off to each line, because remember there was two lines with a person and going back and forth, going to each person like this to say their names. So, it wasn't no pause for somebody to hold mic to say their names. So, essentially what she's saying is that Kadia is a liar. And by the way, footage from the graduation backs up exactly what this young woman is saying, that actually Kadia was never even allowed to hold the mic. When you watch the graduation video, there are two distinct lines and there is that white woman that you see in the first clip, holding it, going back and forth, allowing people to say what was just supposed to be their names. But as this woman, young woman has acknowledged, nobody was able to do that. They had to add things. Big up Jamaica, I love my mama. These kids really just couldn't follow simple instructions. And I guess Kadia felt that she deserved the entire mic to say something. And when that wasn't given to her, she went absolutely crazy. So, those are the true version of events, aside from this other classmates that attended the graduation have been commenting, saying how much of a lie this is. Now, you would think that Kadia would have some shame, right? This video has now gone viral. She has been violent towards an administrator. Frankly, Kadia should have been arrested for the way that she behaved. They probably should have revoked her degree. But I know that's going to happen in post BLM America. So, rather, she's going wild. She's getting attention. People are telling her that what she did was wrong. And what does Kadia do? What does Kadia do? Well, Kadia apparently has stage four BLM in her brain because this is what she shared on her personal Instagram page. Kadia wrote, to everyone saying, I should be embarrassed or I'll never get a job. I'm a black woman in America. I am always in the right. He will not gash like me into thinking I'm the bad guy. I did it for the girls that look like me. Love you. It's just that's right there. I'm a black woman in America. I will always be right. That is what we call stage four BLM. That black people, a certain sector of the black community, believes that they no longer have to listen to rules. They no longer have to abide by the laws. They can do criminal things. They can smash up a McDonald's because it's June, teeth and we're celebrating our freedom. They can twerk on top of a pizza hut despite paramedics being all around. They can do drugs in the middle of the street. They can disobey police officers. And I have a list of police officers says they can swallow fentanyl and leave the doses and die after they swallow fentanyl. And still statues will be raised in their honor because I'm black and BLM has rotted our society. This girl is absolutely despicable. She behaves like a hood rat. There is no real future for her. Maybe somebody will see her and hire her and put her on the board of a stupid DEI initiative because she's under qualified, obviously extremely uneducated and utterly irrational, which makes her perfect for a DEI initiative. Other than that, it's not going to be good for a DEI, which is why, at least according to reports, she's already an only fan. Yeah, she's already an only fan. She already knows the route that she has to go down because she has absolutely no respect for herself. She is a symbol of cultural rot and shame on every single black and or white American or American period who jumped to her defense and believed this ridiculous narrative that she in 2023 is a victim of old school Jim Crow racism. Give me a break up. And that is all I'm going to say on that. Okay, now it's time for some topics to shore. Obviously a very sad update regarding the Titan that was the name of the submersible that was going down to visit the Titanic with five people on board. It went missing on Sunday and the entire world watched with essentially baited breath hoping that there would be some miracle. Honestly, I was refreshing the page reading everything that I possibly could read about it. The individuals that we assumed were trapped on board. We now know that they died in an implosion. Father and son, Sulman and Shazada Dawood. There was a French diver, Paul Henry, Nargilay, British businessman, Hamish Harding, as well as the Ocean Gate CEO Stockton Rush, who were killed. Just want to first generally say, this is such a horrific tragedy and that there were people that were mocking this online. Oh, this is what rich people do with their money. How could we just how would become this heartless as a society that a 19 year old boy loses his life? Now the backstory we know is that young boy didn't even want to go on the trip. He was actually very fearful, but he did it for his dad who was very into adventures and because it was Father's Day. And he was just a university student, just a normal kid, and he's dead. And there are people that are laughing and mocking this. Is it fair to level some critiques? Absolutely. I definitely think that the Ocean Gate CEO Stockton Rush, who unfortunately perished as well, everything that's coming out about him ignoring all of the signs that his submersible was not built to withstand that sort of pressure. It's disturbing and it's disturbing because he sold these tickets to people that were unsuspecting like this 19 year old boy. This wasn't just a group of adventurers who were taking risks and exploring the underworld. Maybe he was taking those risks, but I would just my heart absolutely breaks for this wife who has now lost not only her husband, but her son and all of the other people who are related to these victims. Safety issues that were with the Titan sub, while the hull was made from carbon fiber, the material that's normally used with planes and yachts was being used. Instead of materials that they recommend for submersibles, the materials that were used weakened under extreme pressures, including extreme water pressure. The sub-shape was shaped like a tube and not spherical, as is the standard with subs, to ensure even distribution of pressure all around. And the one X Ocean Gate employee said structural integrity has not been properly tested, which could result in extreme danger. Engineers called the Ocean Gate sub experimental and said that it could result in catastrophic outcomes. And obviously this is in fact a catastrophic outcome. So we're going to show you guys this animation video of what happened to them under the water, obviously, that has been created since. And obviously, I can't say it's the best case scenario because the best case scenario would be that they were all healthy and alive and returned to the surface. But given the circumstances of us believing that they were perhaps being trapped in that strong submersible with oxygen running out to learn that it was an implosion that they wouldn't have even known had happened is better news. So you can take a look at this animation video that we have right now. So it just it literally looks like if you're holding a can in case you're listening to this on audio and not watching it, if you could just picture an aluminum cam just being smashed instantly, they said that it would have happened in the millisecond and the brain can't even comprehend that quickly what's happening. So there was no suffering. And I think that is the best takeaway because I just kept thinking about them trapped in that small space. And it was horrible, which is absolutely horrible to think about. James Cameron, you guys are familiar with him. He directed the 1997 film Titanic. He was from the very beginning saying on Sunday that they knew about this implosion and that they were keeping this information from the public. So let's just listen to what James Cameron had to say in an interview. We got confirmation within an hour that there had been a loud bang at the same time that the sub was that's comms were lost. A loud bang on the hydrophones. Loss of transducer or transponder. Loss of comms. I knew what happened. Sub-imploted. I sent emails to everybody. I know I said we've lost some friends. The sub is imploded. It's on the bottom in pieces right now. I sent that out Monday morning. So on Monday morning, James Cameron knew based on intel that the sub had imploded. And yet we all watched for four or five days thereafter to see what was going on. This is obviously leading to a lot of people reporting that the information was intentionally withheld. It is true that the United States Navy sonar detected the Titan sub implosion hours after the submersible. The submersible lost contact with the mothership. And as people are trying to figure out why would they keep this, people are saying, and of course we can't confirm it, but it was because it was being used as a distraction. Obviously a lot of stuff is going on right now with the Biden administration, the Hunter Biden probe, and everything that he's pleading guilty to certain things more information is coming out about his willingness, dealings overseas, and that they were using this to distract from all of the pertinent information that was hitting the media. Again, we cannot confirm that. If it is true, they are absolute filth and scum of the earth. I mean, I can't even imagine withholding this sort of intel and watching the entire world so that you could distract from the heinous crimes that your family has committed. So it's important for us to make sure that we do stay on the Hunter Biden case that everyone does know what is going on with that case and all the things that he is now pleading guilty to. And it seems to be never ending. I mean, it's just unbelievable. I just read this morning that he was trying to get tax deductibles for prostitutes. It's never ending. It truly is a Biden crime syndicate. All right, guys, we don't have much time left, but I really want to get to the story. Obviously, you guys know I was banned from YouTube for a week. They put me in timeout because they didn't like the way that I was talking about the topic of transgenderism specifically. And by the way, I've been reform since I'm just recapping here. A lot of conservatives like myself used to suggest that people should be worried about transgender men wanting to be around children and dresses. And that's not typically a good sign. And I used to say that I wouldn't allow my children around a transgender man that was wearing female underwear or dressing like a woman because to me, that could seem like a red flag. Well, a little bit of unfortunate news to report today. The nation's first elected transgender state rep has been arrested on child porn charges. This individual's name is Stacy Marie Lawton. Of course, Stacy Marie Lawton is a Democrat who previously resigned twice from New Hampshire State House and is now facing four counts of distributing sexually explicit images of children. Lawton was born Barry Charles Lawton Jr. And I'm just going to allow you to listen to Stacy. Now this is Stacy. So at some point Barry became Stacy. And now we have to acknowledge obviously that Barry is in fact Stacy. So take a listen. Good evening, everyone. I am Reverend Stacy Marie Lawton with the National New Hampshire Kindness Project Ministry. And I'm so pleased to be able to come to you again tonight with some prayer. And another installment from the book What Is Faith is part of our series on faith. That is definitely a woman. Stacy is definitely a woman. And Stacy is now facing child porn charges. You can take from that information what you will. I'm certainly not allowed to comment on it. It's into YouTube. So I'm going to offer no commentary. I'm just giving you guys the news. And we will leave it at that. All right, guys. In that same vein, I saw this story regarding an individual named Christian Jeffers still going by a male name, but now identifies as a woman. I hope I'm doing this right. YouTube Christian Jeffers is 49 years old and was found guilty of attempted assault criminal possession of a weapon menacing and aggravated harassment after Christian battered a Chinese man on a New York City subway in a brutal hammer attack. So let me show you a picture of this lovely lady Christian Jeffers. Obviously that's a woman. I mean, you guys have been thinking, that looks like Joanna, man. I've seen that movie. No, that's a woman. Christian Jeffers is now a woman. How do you know Christian Jeffers is a woman? Well, because when he, I mean, when Christian was beating the Chinese man on the New York City subway, Christian was wearing a black wig and purple lipstick. So that's all it takes. If you wear a black wig and purple lipstick and you say that you are a woman, then you are one according to YouTube policies. So we're going to show you a little bit of that incident. Take a look. Police said that Christian has a vast criminal history that stretches back to 2007 and includes 47 prior arrests, charges of prostitution, grand larceny, public lewdness, theft of service, and drug possession. Christian was released in prison in June 2021 after serving six years for second degree robbery. And just a week after release was arrested for larceny. Christian has yet to be sentenced following the guilty verdict, but assault in the first degree, a classy felony, which an individual has intentionally caused serious physical harm to another person using dangerous weapon can carry a sentence of up to 15 years in prison. And I'll ask the question that we're all thinking is Christian with Christian's black wig and purple lipstick going to be allowed to stay in a female prison. Because that's how it works now, right? If you say you are a woman, then you are a woman. And it is therefore cruel and unjust to put a person like Christian who has 47 prior arrests, charges of prostitution and grand larceny and public lewdness into the hole with other men. It probably would be the right thing to allow him to stay with women, right? It does. All right, guys, let's jump into some of your comments. These comments are opportunities yesterday's episode where I talked about the bait and switch of people do. Again, I was trying to be very specific, not people that have been married for 40 years. You're like, oh, I've gained 25 pounds in 40 years, 50 pounds, since then I'm talking about people that literally get married. And then in one or two years, they just completely blow up and let themselves go. And it feels to me that that's very unfair to your spouse. It almost feels like a scam. So I asked you guys what you thought about this. Here's what you had to say. Selco Rogers, 7662 writes, as a woman, I had a similar thing happen with an ex-boyfriend of five years. When we first started dating, he was in great shape. He didn't drink too much or smoke weed. By year three, he was an absolute couch potato, a chronic pot smoker drinking every day and eating garbage and spending all of his money on weed, beer, and takeout. We had conversations about being healthier, and I would try to have him do things like go on walks or go swimming with me and he hated it. He only ever wanted to go out to restaurants or the movies where he could sit and eat and be stoned beforehand. I tried to give him time to get it together. He didn't. By the end of five years, I left. That's not what I signed up for. We weren't married, but I'm glad we didn't get married because it wasn't just something superficial. Like, oh, he gained a bit of weight and lost some muscle. It was about gluttony and sloth and an overall attitude that I found super unappealing. That is so true. It is about what you are saying your virtues are, and you're talking about these deadly sins. It's gluttony. It's sloth. And it is something also that impacts their mind, which is another element of this is why I really didn't like that. That woman trivialized his position. You can't be. It's like when we talk about Lizzo and other artists that are glorifying obesity, you cannot feel your best when you are so overweight, and it is an effort for you to even get up the stairs. I know it when I'm nine months pregnant, it's the closest I'll ever come to obesity. Hopefully, I hope they don't get sick or anything like that. But it's just not a good feeling. Once I finally have a baby, I'm like, oh, I feel like I can breathe again. So it's impacting their psyche and impacting their mentality. And to say that, well, you married me, so you're just going to have to deal with that and love me no matter what, because we've been married now for six months. And this is the real me doesn't really feel fair to me. Karen frees into 80 rights. I am close to 60 and have been married for 35 years. I think it's important for both spouses to try to make themselves attractive to their partner. When I read comments about accepting one another no matter what, I think they are from young women with fairy tale views of life and marriage. As you both age, it becomes even more important that you are both taking care of yourselves physically. And yep, that does mean not packing on weight. It is a kindness to your spouse to maintain health and fitness because it is that person who you will likely rely on if things go sideways, which they may, despite your best efforts. No physical appearance is not everything. But if you want your marriage to last, it matters if your spouse is attracted to you. I so agree with that. And congratulations to you, by the way, being married for 35 years, you don't hear about anymore. And I know a couple of us have married for 40 years since the same thing. It's not about Botox and plastic and trying to look like you're 20 years old, but it's just showing up and showing that you care about your health and you're in this relationship for the long run that you care about your children that you want to be here for a long time and that you're just not giving up on everything. Marriage should not represent for people a finish line. And I think that's some people's perspectives. Marriage is a finish line and then nothing else matters. And really, for me, I think it's the starting line and how you're actually supposed to grow together. Sarah smiles and creates rights. I remember I jokingly told my stepdad that I gained five pounds the first few months of marriage. He straight up told me to not let myself go. It was the first time I've ever heard a man say that and it totally stuck with me. I've worked hard to stay active and after three kids and 15 years of marriage, I try to stay within a few pounds of my pre-pregnancy rate. It's hard work. It is. Yeah, and you're not going to get it perfect. That's why I had one woman. I was live chatting with you guys yesterday on the episode. And one woman said, I gained 15 pounds. I'm like, I am not talking about 15 pounds. I wouldn't even notice 15 pounds. My husband gained it. That's like for me, winter weight. I've just eaten a little more in winter. I need the extra blub around me. I am talking about that the story that was shared was in two years, 50 pounds. That is just not a good trajectory for any relationship and it's not cool to make it seem the person that is concerned about that or saying, hey, I'm not really attracted to these aspects to say that there's something wrong with them noticing that you're not heading, treading in a healthy direction. Lastly, grace writes, I'm sorry, Candice, but I strongly disagree with you on this. I'm 24 years old and I'm not married. That's interesting because the woman prior said people that are not married and have fluffy ideas about marriage might think this. So let's see what else you said. She wanted to say, but my parents have been married for over 25 years. My mom has been overweight for as long as I can remember. My dad has never once strayed and I know it because he loves her not just for her body. Reading the answer Jen gave, I thought it was a perfect response. She told the husband to figure out what he likes about her that isn't superficial and ask her how she feels so she can work on herself. James also writes in saying that the wife probably isn't happy with how she looks either and wants to change. Saying James advice is horrible, is just ignorant and judgmental. It doesn't look good on you at all. When the wife gets older and her skin gets saggy, would he still love her? Can the wife control her aging or would she have to turn to cosmetic surgery so look attractive to her husband? The sooner her husband finds what he likes about her, more than her outward appearance the better. I don't support being overweight. I don't think it's a good thing but your partner gaining weight should not be a huge obstacle in your marriage. I am sorry but I very much disagree with you. As I said earlier, the mental and the physical is connected and it's not an extreme and people always feel the need to argue in these extremes. If you say, oh, is he not going to like her wrinkles? We're not talking about that. We never said, if he had written an article, written to her and said my wife is starting to get wrinkles and we're 44 and I don't want her to have that, I would say that guy sucks. She should have never married him because he wants something that's impossible to attain. You can't control wrinkles on your face but yes, you can stay in moderate healthy shape and it's actually very low standard. You mentioned that your mother has been overweight for as long as you can remember. Well, maybe she's been overweight for as long as your dad can remember too and that's why it's not anything in their relationship because she was honest about who she was. We're talking about people that changed the dynamic of their relationships, pretend to care about their health, pretend to care about their physical health, and then dramatically change as soon as they get married. As I said, they regard it as some sort of a finish line. It's just not fair. I am happy that your parents have been happily married so I am not at all trying to say like, oh, your dad's getting it wrong or anything like that but I do think that when you come together in a relationship, you make an effort that both of you will try to maintain your health because it's good for your relationship. So we'll see when you get married, maybe it'll change your mind. Like the woman said, who's married for a very long time, you might have different rationale, especially when you have kids and you're like, I want you to stay alive forever. That's how I see my husband. I'm like, you have to stay alive forever, or I would have been raised all of these kids all by myself and I need you healthy and so go to the doctor. That's what I say to my husband at least. All right, guys, that is all the time that we have for today. As a reminder, Shot in the Dark is available now on Daily Wire Plus.
