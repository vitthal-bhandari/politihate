Tune in and join the conversation with Drink Champs on the Interval Presents Podcast Network wherever you get your podcasts. Welcome back to another episode of Keep It. If you see me walking down the street and I start to cry each time we meet, could you walk on by? I'm Louis Fertel. And I am Iron Madison III and I am positive that birds do not appear every time on the year. That is a clinical issue. If that occurs in your romance, it has nothing to do with luck. It's a hygiene thing. That is a scary song, Karen Carpenter. Okay, I burn suddenly appearing every time she sees this man run. Yeah, I'm going to get you. Hitchcock, is he a credited co-writer on this? What's happening? So Bert Bacherak died this week at the age of 94. Honestly, I did not know he was still alive. It's pretty remarkable he was still alive because also Hal David, his main songwriting partner, he had a few over the years, including Carol Bayer-Sager with whom he won his third Oscar for Arthur Steem, the best that you can do. But Hal David also died at 91, but that was some time ago. So you would assume that Bert was like his age and that he'd be 114 now. But he's not. But Bert was on my mind recently because there's a new Dion Warwick documentary out on HBO Max. And a couple of things. Is it about her tweeting? Yes. It's called Dion Warwick Touchgrass and it's about how she used to go up here. The tweet that she sent out about Bert's passing was like so sweet and moving. And I was like, oh, this feels like the first tweet that Dion Warwick has actually tweeted herself. Right. Well, yeah, I don't know what in living her name is. On her Twitter. Yeah, it's very shocking. But I will say about that Dion Warwick documentary. I wish it had come out 20 years ago because so many of the people that populated her time in popular music are obviously gone now. There are a couple of, at the time, Bert Bakker acts in the documentary. Barry Gibb is in the documentary. A couple of relatives are like Sissy Houston, I think makes an appearance. But I really wish we had gotten this entire documentary years ago because Bert's story with Dion is so integral to pop music. They have such an amazing relationship. You can YouTube videos of them literally working together on songs where he's like, Dion, I've got another humding around my hands and she goes, well, if it's too hard, you can just sing it. And like, they have this fun back and forth. It's impossible to pick a favorite song of theirs. It's crazy to be still that American Idol would have Bert Bakker act weeks. This was a this was a an American sensation. And they would put on these, you know, lilting melodies for kids in like Charlotte Roost crop tops to say, it's still mind boggling. Okay, that is the thing that I was going to bring up because I feel like Bert Bakker is a name that is it if you don't really know everything about him for people our age, you know that name because of American Idol. And it's so weird. I like, I watched the season to like top five do what the world needs now is love. Like I watched that clip and it was like a mind but watching like clay acre walk out first like Ruben back there. I was like, where are these people? And we watched it every week. And people were screaming. People screamed with like someone like hit a note. Right. No, I don't know how they brainwashed us into, you know, into this like kind of Eurovision thing that we were all obsessed with. And I guess still are it's still like a popular network TV show. But the amount of fabulous songs I had tweeted when he died that nobody made sentimentality seem sophisticated like Bert Bakker. It wasn't just syrupy balance. There was like some wit to everything he did. And a part of that is how David his lyricist writing a lot of those songs I'm talking about walk on by I say a little prayer. Anyone who had a heart don't make me over which is also the name of that DM Warwick documentary. My favorite, do you know the way to San Jose which is secretly the bleakest song in existence because it has this light melody. But it's about how I failed at LA and I'm moving back to San Jose where I have get ready lots of friends. Oh, what could be bleaker? Oh, I've got lots of friends in San Jose. I'm going to go back there now and live in live in live in my failure. Make way for D.R. Warwick is such a great album. And it's like it like even looking at the cover, it's like it's not even like the D on that we even remember from like when we were kids. You know, like she had such a transformation after that. You know, and the music is great. I like, I know that a lot of people who are millenials probably were introduced to Bert Bakker either from American Idol or through Austin Powers. Yes, his sort of kitschy appearances in the Austin Powers movies. Yeah. But let me tell you some play. You know what song I really love? What's new pussycat? Oh, please Tom, Tom Jones, I feel like we still are due for a little bit of a renaissance for how well how he has a powerful voice. But it's also just a kind of like party. There's a hardiness about Tom Jones that I think is not replicated much in pop music nowadays. I'm always shocked with like I was at a gay club like a few weeks ago, Shocker. And sex bomb played and like everyone do the lyrics. And I was like, I know all of you were not watching the one season WB series gross point like I was. Where did you get your dollars? The theme song. So how does everyone know this song? That is really puzzling and good for you for being at whatever club that was. Yeah, I truly think it was like just I think it was flaming saddles in New York. I guess it could be nowhere else. Yeah. Yeah. That's really fabulous. You know what else I want to say about Rebecca, I mean, he wrote close to you for carpenters, he wrote for Dusty Springfield, Tom Jones, as we just said, I think something I really love about their songwriting apart from the the wit of it and just the the lightness of it is they wrote for vocalists who were rarely belting. It was really about like people who interpreted a song and you they have an awesome voice, but you're literally listening to what they're saying in addition into listening to their voice. They really had a good storytelling quality. And I think like, for example, just to talk about walk on bias on we all know that the sweetness of the melody and the hurt of that song, I think what resonates with me about that is what could be more relatable to life like you feel a certain way, but you still have to put on a brave sing song face to get through life. So that like juxtaposition of sweetness and sadness is, you know, how to be a person, how to how to like deal with things, how to go on with your life, how to walk on by so to speak. So just second to none, he and Hal David are definitely up there with Lennon McCartney or Carol King and Jerry Goff and just the absolutely essential songwriters that everybody should be somewhat familiar with literally the D on Warwick's first greatest hits, which is I think exclusively Birkbeck or rock songs, trains and boats and planes. Are you there with another girl? There's fabulous songs there. I actually have a quick story about that. My friend Andrew and I, my friend Andrew is about 15 years old than I am. And I lived behind him in his guest house for seven years when I was in LA. And on the weekends, we would go put on Dion and go to someplace like Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale or something where you can like walk around and talk. And one day we were driving to the Reagan library with my dad in the car who was visiting. And of course, Andrew and I are like fagging out talking about Dionne Warwick. We put on, are you there with another girl? Just about Dionne suspecting that her man is cheating. And he goes, she goes to his house. And anyway, Dionne's talking him is what's happening in the song. It's a creepy song. And at some point it gets to a song where she goes, are you are you there with another girl? And then this other vocal comes in that's like, it's like a loud high pitch noise and we're kind of making fun of it. And my dad goes, that's the voice they hear on her radio. Are you there with another girl? And she's talking about, I can hear you're playing the radio for us some girl. Anyway, I just want you know that I did not expect my dad to read us fucking faggots for filth about the dramaturgy of a Dionne Warwick song. And it sits poorly with me even. Not your dad gagging you over Dio. I didn't think it would ever be me. Yeah, I mean, truly, Birdback Rack is like, that is the epitome of the the Whitney meme, you know, like songs like that tell stories that people can identify with. Children were singing the song, weddings, graduations on their way to the Ronald Reagan library. Which is a funeral to me. So yes. Also, I have long wondered, what the hell sparked your fascination with wandering around cemeteries? Because you love doing it. I did. Oh, during the pandemic, I would go to forest lawn and look for Clark Gables grave. I guess it was just mostly a way to like, you know, be outside and walk around and have something to look at as opposed to just like, you know, running down the streets, which by the way is deranged behavior that I can't believe people still do. Yeah, I love a cemetery. You know, there was there's truly a cemetery across the street from my house in Milwaukee growing up. And so I, you know, I used to hang out there all the time. You know, people would jog there. In high school, I filmed a, I filmed a short film there. I also did that in high school because I grew up in a town, I has a ton of churches in it. And therefore, there are a ton of cemeteries there too. So you're always like walking by one or something. In fact, Diablo Cody, who was from where I'm from La Monta, Illinois said, you could, you could almost judge the, the class of somebody by how close they lived to a cemetery in La Mont. Like, the further away you got the more, you know, maybe you were ritzy or something. We were like, we were smashed up against tombstones. Both of us. Love those sock hops at the cemetery. Sure. Yeah. Never stumbled on any mysteries though. Rarely. No. Yeah. Great pumpkin never appeared either. Yeah. Well, we have got a packed episode full of a lot of music chat. Rihanna is back. Made walking around. Yeah. She's walking around. I saw that. Walk on by. She did that. The Super Bowl happens and we're going to wait through all of the takes on Rihanna's big return to music. And then we're also going to get into another device of topic in pop culture right now. Sex scenes in movies and TV. And is it really all of Gen Z that's upset about this? Or is it secretly six people? I need somebody to do the hard journalism on this. It's six people and badgely. Okay. Right. Oh, yes. Very stirring statement. Yeah. So we'll get to all of that plus icon model trans activist Monroe Berg dwarf is here with us this week to talk about her new memoir and also continuing the keep it trend of getting boots on the ground information about award shows that we did not attend. She was just at the Brits recently and we're going to get the tea on that as well. Was she was she injured by the helium machine that inflated Sam Smith's outfit? We'll say we'll be right back. More. We're excited to announce the return of stuck with Damon Young, an original podcast from Crooked and Spotify on this show. Award winning author Damon Young has returned for more off the cuff conversations. Despite it by today's most culturally relevant headlines and roundups of Damon approved listeners admitted questions. He's joined with some of the brightest minds and bold voices of the black community, including Kia se layman Roywood, Jr. Elaine Walter off Nicole Hannah Jones and more. The trailer is live right now and the first episode drops on February 16th. Listen to stuck with Damon Young for free only on Spotify. Super Bowl 57 aired on Sunday with the Kansas City Chiefs, ultimately defeating the Philadelphia Eagles 38 to 35. And for most of our listeners, this is probably the first time you've heard any of that information. Oh, no, I absolutely predicted that the Kansas City whomever's up against the Philadelphia, you go girls. I absolutely knew it would go down this way. Super Bowl 57. How many Oscars have we had? We're now at 95. Okay. So the Oscars have been going on longer than the Super Bowl. It's the Super Bowl is a surprisingly recent development in American culture. Like the Super Bowl began in 1967. It's very strange. The sixties, what was going on in the sixties where they were like, you know what, we did a bigger game. Yeah, I guess people got sick of what were they have been watching then baseball and golf, I guess. But we don't care about that shit anyway, because let me tell you something as soon as Rihanna finished her concert, right? We started playing all the Super Bowl halftime shows, which I feel like is what every gay viewing party does. Right. Well, I actually made the mistake of watching all the other halftime shows in the days leading up to Rihanna, not doing the math that of course I'm going to be watching these afterwards too. But by the way, I don't know that that was brilliant math on our part anyway, because when you compare the Rihanna show to almost any other show in recent memory, you will be coming up short. I'm sorry. Look, again, it's like the woman's pregnant. She hasn't performed regularly in a million years, you know, she's like, like Gene Hackman at this point, which pops out of her shell once in a while with like some weird book you don't want or whatever. She has a little Willy Walker esque. Yes. Yes. Okay. Everyone. I can imagine her having a thing where there are golden tickets in like Fenty makeup cases. And then she invites five people to the Fenty factory. I need her to not get ideas like that, because let's let's put her back on the billboard charts. I'm getting nervous. But look, I mean, she gave you the utter like ab-a-gold of Rihanna hits. You know, there are there are a couple of notable exclusions. Like, I was surprised not to hear SOS at all, but I guess she's probably just sick. No pun to replay. No pun to replay. No, if it's love and that you want, which you know, was one of my secret faves. If she played that, I actually would have fallen out. That would have been great. But I would agree ab-a-gold is a apt description of it, because I will say this was more of a medley that I think we've ever gotten in recent memory for a Super Bowl performance. You know, even like Madonna, Beyonce, you know, like Shakira J. Lo, Katy Perry, like there's at least one big song that feels like it gets more than 30 seconds with the centerpiece of it, you know, like, and Beyonce, you know, had the, that's the one we put on first, after it, you know, you had not just the Destiny's Child appearing, you know, but like there were different set pieces. I will say that visually this was gorgeous. I like love the camera work. I love like it was beautiful. I love the dancers, but I would also say that like it was an indifferent areas. No, it literally went up and down. That's what happened. Yeah. Like there were different set pieces. There were costume changes. She was really just vibing. And listen, I'm not saying I expected anything more because Rihanna has always been vibes. Sure. No, she's like the, she's like the premier vibe. Yeah. Yeah. Like she comes, she hangs out and we have a good time. You're not expecting to be wowed. You're not saying she's the best pop star ever. She's never been the best pop star ever. Music has always been great and it dominates the charts, but she has never been like a performance beast. No, she's not somebody who's like jumping in the air and landing in a split or anything like that. That said, I do feel like her fans went off the deep end defending this performance, generally speaking, because they're like, like I just don't think it's an amazing defense to be like, well, if you're not used to being underwhelmed, you're not a fan of hers or whatever the fuck they're saying. It's like, well, that's that's not good news either. I don't know, because also, she's done plenty of great performances before. You know, like she's, you know, the amount of AMAs performances, she's been great or VMAs. The VMA vancard is my favorite performance of hers. Yes. It's just like three different, there were three different components. It felt like it felt like amped up. There was a lot of energy. I've rewatched it and I enjoyed it. But I will say upon rewatch, like I was ready to turn it off before it ended. Yes. I've watched it twice and the second time I wasn't finding new and interesting things to look at or anything. But it's like you said, like if you look at Madonna's halftime show, all together, including two snippets, like of open your heart and express yourself, there are only six songs in that. You know, it's like she does like all of give me all your love in which she will pay for her crimes eventually. But like in this reality, you got way more than that. And so I was talking to a friend of mine and he said, what songs do you think will like top the iTunes or whatever? The album, you was like charts, Spotify charts after this. And I actually didn't know. I guess that diamonds because it ended the medley would be the big one. I guess the biggest percentage jump was bitch better have my money, which makes sense because it's probably the least popular. Yeah. And also I think that no one was really expecting that song. Right. Just because it's the Super Bowl and they're always angry about anything. You know, but I thought I thought that was a great opener. I thought that that grabbed us all. And I was like, Oh, this is going to be hot. Right. Because like the lyrics also work, you know, like don't act like you forgot, you know, like turn up to Rihanna. Like that feels like an anthem for her. The one I was shocked about too was not because the Kanye of it all. But like I was shocked about all the lights just because I was like, Oh, she remembered that song. Well, it also was a little bit harrowing at that point because there were no features yet. So you were wondering like, Oh, is he going to come front hand springing on out, you know, with a shout to Jesus or whatever? But I knew Jay Z wasn't letting that man anywhere near his Super Bowl. Right. Yes. No, Jay. I think Jay Z was walking the perimeter making sure yeah, that's why Jay didn't jump on for any of his features with Rihanna. He was making sure Kanye did not show up. He was in the lighthouse. Yeah, look it out. Overall, I'm excited to have Rihanna back, but it didn't feel like a return. It felt somewhat described it as a retirement. Oh, no, not a apology, not the RuPaul universe. But did it feel like like she was like elder state's woman. Like here's some of those hits you love. Now goodbye. I will say she did look sensational. The minute she hit the stage, I'm like, I absolutely I love the sartorial shout out to Andre Lee on Talley, which loved it. And he was so into her too. So that's such a fun little pop cultural moment. But yeah, I mean, it just she did enough. She didn't do anything on stage. I didn't know she was capable of. And again, I'm not saying she has to like jump through a ring of fire or anything, but it didn't even it didn't feel like there was a moment of real ingenuity there. Like if you look at like the Shakira JLo performance, and I don't mean to compare the performance styles of like Rihanna to Olympic to Catholic JLo, who will fully, you know, like pole vault over whatever Cuba or Bionic woman Shakira. Yes. Oh yeah, Bionic woman Shakira. But like in those performances, they both found like weird moments to like JLo suddenly do a really Spanish oriented dance or Shakira like doing a shout out to Led Zeppelin does just like interesting artistic pangs in there. And I also want to say about that performance. Having two performers is I think a pretty awesome mix because then they get to volley between each other. And so you're always caught off guard a little bit and there's like a fun suspense to whatever's going on. Not that I don't like the Katy Perry or the Beyonce years or whatever, but just the idea that there's something a little unique about the moment that it's two people who've never been together on a stage before. And of course, once upon a time, you'd see more of this at the Super Bowl with like Janet Jackson and NSYNC swinging in. But I think just two performers is a pretty ideal thing. I want to throw back next year to sort of like the Aerosmith with in Saint Brittany Mary J Blige and Deli, like give us like, you're just a bunch of people. Yeah. Because I sort of feel like we have a lot of pop stars right now who can't really carry Yeah. A show with like the mass amount of hits. Like maybe an usher. And I will say, fuck the people who were sort of trying to like discredit Usher after the show being like, he doesn't have the hits to do the Super Bowl. Are you kidding? Excuse me? Who does then? It's been like 25 years. He's got nothing but hits and like so many number ones. Right. I'm trying to contrive what I believe will be the medley coming up. Like if it's, first of all, it feels strange that Pink has never done it. One, because of the amount of hits. And two, I just feel like she has beaten up a cheerleader at some point. So I think she belongs at the Super Bowl. I think pink culturally though, I feel like if pink is there, it's with someone else. Yes. I wonder who that would be who would bring out pink, you know, Usher and pink that that does it not speak to me. Yeah. I feel like someone like a, I mean, I don't know, I don't know her vibe with Taylor Swift, you know, but I feel like I try to think about who would fit with Taylor. And I'm like, if Taylor filed and I know they recording Taylor for this Super Bowl as well. If Taylor took the Super Bowl that year and pink came out, I think that'd be a little electronic. Could be could be. Taylor, I feel like we'd inevitably do it on her own though, right? I know she loves women empowerment. I think that she would have like some other women on stage with her for at least one moment. Oh, I would love it if she did like a night of 100 stars, like introducing woman after woman like she did on that old tour, like here, come by as again or whoever the first lady Smith, Black Baba's over here. Oh, my God. She's going to take us to Grace Land. So, but also this is such a weird year too, because I didn't really give a fuck about any other commercials. I think I'm over Super Bowl commercials. Well, it is just that weird feeling of, do you think because you spend $200 million that the commercial will suddenly be funnier? I assure you, that's not the case. It is always a puzzling mix. Like you can see like, like, oh, they're going to put who, Alison Brie or who is it Brie Larson and John Ham together and say Ham and Brie. It's like, yeah, is this supposed to be iconic? Because it's words, it just doesn't add up to anything from me. I mean, it's just the grossest, most corporate moment in popular culture that we all are find a way to be obsessed with via one form or another. For the, you know, for the queers, it's the halftime show, but everything else just feels like loud and, and they used to be fun. I will say Super Bowl commercials, like I've always been expensive, but they used to be fun and, you know, not to be one of these old people, but like, you used to not see the Super Bowl commercial and tell the Super Bowl. Oh, totally. Right. Everything's leaked beforehand. Yeah. And then they really started like dropping them online before and then I'm like, who cares? You know, and none of them really, really feel as fun and innovative, you know, as like throwing some Doritos in a dryer at the laundromat, you know, like that's fun. Also, I think just the, because commercials are sort of like a lost language now, if it doesn't have the same impact to watch commercials anymore, like what is this show and between, it just, it feels old hat, you know, I said, I should drop like a music video during the Super Bowl or something, you know, like a commercial. My brother Jim acquainted me with the fact that once upon a time during the, in the middle of the Super Bowl, we wouldn't watch the halftime show. We would go and watch the new episode of In Living Color on another now. Yes. Okay. Yes. I do remember that like Fox or like other networks like used to drop like a Super Bowl, a fake mid Super Bowl, and also Lost is the art of debuting a show after the Super Bowl, who like the big alias episode where they made a point of like she was doing spy shit, but like in lingerie on a plane this time, because it was like, Oh, we got to lure in the men. Right. Right. Tits out for the boys at Saturday. No, something that always blows my mind is that the wonder years, which is among the like quietest, dramedy sensations of all time, but it debuted immediately after the Super Bowl. What a crazy thing to watch like, Oh, we're going to, it's a 12 year old in 1968, whose crush loses her brother in Vietnam. Like that's what we're watching after the Super Bowl. It's so bizarre. I mean, now speaking of like Super Bowl commercials that really got me horny. Uh, like they always, you know, they got a court men. Um, Jesus. No. Oh my God. They had all these commentators on the Super Bowl, but nobody was more opinionated than Jesus. Oh my God. Jesus opened her purse. Okay. Yeah. Let me tell you something. I like, usually I hate when people are repeating the same take on Twitter or it's like, okay, this is an original thought and you're just like writing it when people kept saying, well, if the church could afford this much body for Super Bowl commercials, they can afford to pay taxes and everyone like posting that. Um, like it was an original thought. Yeah. Right. I do agree. Mind you, this is some like weird organization, right? Yeah. That has like anti LGBT ties, even though the messaging of some of this was Jesus gets everybody not just, you know, the same people you think he gets. Well, he got Josh Bassett this week. I am upset because Josh Bassett has caught in God's butterfly net and I need him to get out of it. It's kind of gag worthy though, getting baptized by a megachurch. Megachurch. You can hear the words, right? They're horrible together. It's just like, it's apocalyptic sounding. He's been, you know, he's been running, running, running. Ever since that after Jim Soul coming out, you know, and it's hilarious. I love how all roads always lead back to Harry Styles. But literally it was like him saying, I'm like, a live interview that he thought Harry Styles was hot. And that's how he outed himself. And that will never not be funny to me. Right. And now maybe because of that, we will always see Harry Styles in Spangled vests. No, it will also never not be funny that the next day he canceled his appearance on Keep It. All right. Oh, that's totally forgot that. Yeah. Well, he came out the day before he was supposed to appear on the show. And then that ended. It's almost like he doesn't think we're inviting queer mentors, which really bothers me. What the fuck else are we? He did not want us to be all up in his business like a windy interview. Okay. Oh, wow. Yeah. Because certainly we would have bullied him. You know how that goes with us. How we treat our guests. By the way, I got the Mariah Lyric Rourke is the 2009 Harvard graduating class from her song that I referenced last week, you know, not 2010. So shout out to the person who bothered me about it in my mentions. Oh, oh, which by the way, Mariah Carey has never done a Super Bowl halftime show. Wouldn't recommend it now. But that would have been so out of time. I would definitely recommend it. It'd be so funny. I mean, I would hope she would first of all never stand up. Just fully sitting on a tough at the entire time, you know, carried around, you know, people feeding her grapes, Mae West style and all that. I mean, but by the way, all the Super Bowl is lip syncs anyway. So she'd sound great. That's true. That's true. By the way, though, how much of Rihanna's thing was lip syncs? Well, per NFL policy, all halftime rehearsals are rerecorded and played back during the show as a safety net. So the performer sings over as little or as much as they like. But like when people were accusing Queen Shirley Ralph of lip syncing, I'm like, baby, Whitney Super Bowl performance was lip syncs. She sang a recorded track, you know, because it's cold as fuck out there. Right. No, even I believe when the Dixie chicks did the national anthem, that was lip syncs, which it doesn't look like that at all. So, you know, you have to open your eyes and your minds to think about how the acoustics of these things work. Also, people need to figure out people also need to learn exactly what lip syncing is, because like, there's a difference between Millie Vanelli, right, and like you're singing over a track that you've already recorded. Right, right. Can I just say, by the way, about Millie Vanelli, the haters are jealous because the box, I'm sorry. Baby, don't forget my number. Well, excuse me, that you're in the car. It's a good time. And blaming on the rain, etc. Girl, you know, it's true. I could go on and on. Millie Vanelli were. Actually, I couldn't. They don't have that many hits, but yeah. They were ahead of their time is what they were. Okay. Yeah, right. Right. Who would give a fuck about two people lip syncing right now? Also, do you know what I want to say is actually secretly the funniest thing about Millie Vanelli? Like, so okay, they couldn't sing. So you would think, oh, it's in the service of, you know, incredible showmanship. The dancing is so fucking bad. The dancing is hilarious. Like, for instance, like Paula Abdul, that's somebody who would lip sync almost any time she got on a stage. Paula is like popping and locking and, you know, puts on the blazer and leotard and gets down with it. Millie Vanelli, I believe they had hats. I that's that's a biopic I want. Honestly, like the fact that someone was like, we're gonna put these two up here. They're like, just sparing as they put it together. Like, I guess it's these two. Robbing it. Yeah. It's almost like it's almost like the producers. It's a hit that it's like, well, we got to keep this going. Yeah. I continue to be confused about their downfall because the way it legend says it precipitated, they were doing some live performance. The tape they were singing to started skipping. Like, you can look this up on YouTube. Like, and it goes like, girl, you know, it's girl, you know, it's girl, you know, it's and they eventually just leave the stage, like trying to get away from it. And but tons of people lip sync, you know, like the Madonna VMA performance of Vogue is lip sync. If that started skipping, I wouldn't think, oh, Madonna has no merit whatsoever. So I don't, I don't know the exact moment. You know, they decided. But I feel like the real person had to have come out because the thing about Millie Videllia is like, it wasn't even their voices. No, not even close. Absolutely. It's very singing to the rain. Okay. Yeah. That'd be amazing if they talked like Gene Hagen, you know, just like, give this back. Yeah. The girl, you know, it's true videos actually, what Diego Calvo watches at the end of Babylon. No, it's why it's cried. Yeah. It's so good. And he's right. Yeah. Hollywood is magic. All right.

She's a contributing editor to British Vogue and rose to prominence in 2017 after becoming the first trans model to front a L'Oreal campaign. She's beautiful. She is a genius. You know her from every single magazine cover in existence and her memoir transitional in one way or another. We all transition is out next week. Please welcome to keep it the row. Burtor. Hi. Thank you so so much. I always feel so strange when people do introductions with me right there. It's like your Lydia tar. It's like here we go. This is everything that you've done. It's a lot. Yes. So before we even get into this, I have some questions because you were at the Brits this past week. I was. I was. Yeah. In full latex. Tell us. Tell us all about it because we cover so many awards shows are keep it. And I feel like the Brits is still the one that sort of like foreign to us. I mean, it's literally foreign to us, but also, you know, like what the hell goes on at the Brits? It's pretty scandalous. I won't lie. Brits when we party, we party and the music industry in the UK is notoriously quite scandalous on Brits night. Like all rules go out the window. It was pretty amazing, actually. There's like no shame about being a little drunk on stage. So it just feels good to see everybody letting their hair down. People were kissing, people were partying. The bathroom was lit. Yeah, it was good. It was fun. It feels like the Brit Awards, if I'm going back through time, like that's where I get the really gay Kylie Minogue performance or something. You know, just like, I feel like they have a little bit more flavor and like they're more uninhibited over there. I think so. I mean, if you look back throughout history, the Brits has so many amazing queer moments, even if it's not by queer artists, it's still like very queer, like the Spice Girls iconic moment with Jerry Halliwell in the Union Jack Dress, Kylie Minogue coming out of a massive CD player. Yeah, Jerry Halliwell as well did a solo performance where she came out of a giant pair of legs. So it's very queer. Yeah. Well, the two queer questions about the Brits, one, just out of curiosity, like, what did Sam, what did their outfit look like in person? And did they change before they had to sit down? I didn't see the red carpet look, but I was living because I saw on the screens as I came in. I think they arrived after me, but I know a lot of people were talking about it and I was living for it. I was also wearing latex. So I was like, yes, I'm not the only one. Yeah. I was like, okay, this is a moment. I'm horrible. So yeah, it was, it was great. I think that everything that Sam's doing right now is very exciting and obviously it's getting people's backs up and I live for that. So yeah, I think more drama, isn't it about time that theatre came back? Things are so boring for so long. True. We need some drama. You know? Right. Now I feel like award show performances are like scandalous and racy and exciting again. And you know, all of this, you know, it's getting the evangelicals back stuff and we live for that. So I have one more question about the Brits and sort of the best artist award because that's such an interesting thing to me because I know there's been a push in so many awards ceremonies, you know, for like the genderless categories, you know, I know specifically an actor dropped out of Tony consideration for Anjuliet because there wasn't a category, you know, for non-binary actors. They didn't want to put themselves into best actor, best actress. But then you have a situation like the Brits where it's genderless for the first time and then no women are nominated whatsoever. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think, you know, that's really down to the board who nominate the artists. If you're going to have genderless categories, then you need to ensure that it's a fair split and that the people being nominated, that it's representative of the industry as it actually is. You know, the Brits, that category isn't nominated by the public. So the nominees you know, it's picked by a board and I think that there's no excuse really in that case. It's not that there just wasn't any women that were voted by the public. It was that women just consciously weren't included. So I think it's really important that there are genderless categories so that non-binary people can be included within the ceremony. But I think that, you know, it's really down to the process of nomination and ensuring that if you've got genderless categories, then just think about how you nominate and who is included. Because there's really no excuse to have a genderless category and then just not have women in there when there's been so many incredible albums from women artists. Like, where was Florence in the Machines album? Yeah, Florence says where was Crash. Like, these were the albums that like dominated the year for me. Yeah, I was reading it. I wasn't thinking about the men. Exactly. And, you know, people were like saying, like being annoyed at Harry Styles for winning so many awards. It's not his fault. He didn't ask me when he was here. He's not going to turn down an award. It's, you know, it's the people who pick the winners and who nominate the artists. We need to look at like these boards are formed. It's no. I think people don't know who to look at when it comes to like who makes the awards possible. And so the instinct is always to turn at the artist for getting the award. It's like, well, they literally are just invited, you know? It's like your plums. It was like when Harry won best, was it best album at the Grammys? It was like, well, yeah, for him. But also it's not him that picks the winner. You know, he didn't pick himself. We know Harry's spinning Renaissance. Okay. Yeah. It's not a bad album either, you know? I think that they're both great albums just for very different audiences. And yeah, I think that people need to just, you know, think a little deeper. Don't just lash out at the person that's getting the accolade. I think it's really about, you know, looking at the processes that overlook marginalized talent rather than, you know, just lashing out at the people who get the most shine. In talking about your memoir, which is awesome, by the way, there are so many, you go through so you go through so many like harrowing autobiographical tales. And as in, it's like, it's a pleasure to hear your perspective on it. Just like told, I would say for the most part, diplomatically, actually, given how much like people seem to brand you one way or the other is like being like a flyer brand, basically. But my question, my first question for you about the memoir is, were there and what was the most pleasurable part of writing it of just actually sitting down and being like, you know, possessing your story in this way? I think the most pleasurable part of the experience was finishing it. That speaks to me. You are a writer. That's your story. I mean, if you've read it, it's a tough read. It's hard. And it's been a tough life. I don't, you know, I know means have had the hardest life, but it's been tough. And I think really that is, you know, the crux of the book is that everyone's life is tough. And we all have moments of transition through getting through it. And I think the best part of writing it was being able to revisit moments from a younger years as an adult, and looking at it through different eyes and being able to hug myself as a child. And, you know, just like look at it from a different angle and also be able to root it in things that were happening at that time. We had a piece of legislation in the UK called Section 28, which basically is the Don't Say Gay Bill, where you couldn't talk about, you couldn't promote in the words of Margaret Thatcher, you couldn't promote homosexuality in schools, which basically sanctioned homophobic bullying and basically fucked an entire generation of queer people up. So I went to school during that. And it was hellish, but it doesn't just stop there because it really filters into your young adult years. And it kind of pushed me into harm's way in regards to child abusers and all of that. You can read the book, but it was a really tough, it was a tough road. And I, you know, we're seeing a resurgence of that. So I really wanted to just reinforce the fact that we've been here before, and nothing good comes of it. So, yeah, and also just wake people up to the fact that this doesn't just happen in a vacuum, it has real world consequences. So when people advocate in anti-trans ways, they're advocating for people to lose their lives and livelihoods and become disenfranchised to the point where some people lose the world to live. And unfortunately, I think, you know, if you know you two have trans friends and, you know, we've all seen so many things happen just within like the lives of our friends and none of that should happen. We should be able to live a life of dignity and a life where joy is central rather than trauma. Yeah, I mean, even thinking about this week, you know, I mean, you were the first person that I saw the news about Brianna Gay posted, you know, about her murder this week. And it brought to light a lot of the fact that legislation, I guess, in Britain is you put it in your book as well, you know, like it's a lot of bad legislation there that really mirrors like America. But it seems like even more in an intense way, you know, the idea that even on her death certificate won't even be able to list her own name, you know, and then you sort of have all this, I don't know, I feel like J.K. Rowling is just like lurking the streets of London every day being in the news. It really feels like it's sort of intense anti-trans sentiment that's growing in London, in the UK. I mean, does it feel different than when you were younger? Does it feel like things have improved? I think things have improved for the LGB community exponentially. And I will also say, you know, I live in London, London is probably the best place in the UK that you can live as a trans person. We have got an incredible mayor who's absolutely trans-inclusive and runs multiple campaigns throughout the year with regards to Trans Safety March as a pride, accelerates trans pride. So, you know, I'm very, very lucky to live in London. I'm very, very proud to be a Londoner, but the rest of the UK is like Bedlam. And it's a mess in all honesty. And anti-trans rhetoric is growing, it's being seen as a legitimate response to things that people don't understand. Anti-trans pundits and commentators are being centralised instead of actual trans people when talking about what it means to be trans. And just like the 1980s, I mean, we will remember the 1980s and early 90s when gay men were being painted as child abusers and, you know, potential threats to the safety of the public at large. And we're seeing the same thing happen with trans people. But I think with the book, I wanted to make people aware about who gains from that. And why are we accepting a government weaponising its own citizens? That should be a crime. It's a human rights violation. The UK is slipping down massively when it comes to our human rights record. So I just wanted to kind of contextualise it and also, you know, reframe it. And so many of these people that are fighting for, you know, the disenfranchisement of the trans community are really going to look back in like 10 to 15 years and really cringe and try to and basically struggle to try and justify their behaviours because it doesn't, it doesn't serve anybody. And it's also not in accordance to the law. There's laws that are protecting us, but we're seeing the prime minister, which is wild. We're seeing multiple conservative prime ministers because they can't seem to hold on to one. Basically, go against the law, what the law says and go against what medical health care professionals say to send to their own opinions on who they think should have access to trans trans affirmative health care and what spaces we should be in, even though the law says what spaces we are allowed in and our health care system and scientists have said what is and what isn't reversible and who should have access to what medications. Absolutely, my point, I just want to say like the gay community in general, I feel like has done a pretty good job of like ironically calling people mother who are generally villains in real life like characters on TV and movies, for example, we'll say Lydia Tara's mother. One person we have never even approached in this way is Margaret Thatcher. It will never be Margaret Thatcher ironically is rad or whatever. Like not 1% ever. I just think that's like very interesting for someone of that. It's definitely not mother. She's just like transphobic on to grandma. Right. She's the movie mother. Yes. Mother estimation point lowercase mother. That's as much more like the Babadook to be honest. Listen, in the Wikipedia page, other Babadooks. Yes, Margaret, listen first. I want to talk about just your interest before you were a model in modeling. Like it seems like you took an interest in it almost not just from a representation point of view, but almost like intellectually. There's a certain power and being a model and a certain voice you can give via that line of work. How did you feel once you basically became a professional model? I don't know because I honestly didn't really see myself as a model because I wasn't conventionally attractive. I didn't come at modeling from the perspective of I want to feel beautiful. I want to look beautiful. I want to, you know, that from that kind of thing, which I think a lot of people associate wanting to be a model with. I really came at it from the perspective of really enjoying like what I was seeing in magazines with regards to being creative and storytelling. I was obsessed with Alexander McQueen. I was obsessed with Nick Knight. I was obsessed with the way that fashion could make people feel things. I was also massively aware with the fact that fashion was really one of the only industries where women and gay men were centralized. There was room for people who were different. There was an element of storytelling that I really connected with. I thought, you know what? I want to use fashion as a way to talk about my experiences and maybe open people's minds that way. It was really before there was any of that really in the industry. Of course, people spoke about their experiences, but the idea of activism, especially trans activism, being merged with modeling, I hadn't really seen that. So it excited me and it was great for my drive and it felt like I was doing something purposeful. I does feel like I'm doing something purposeful. It's great to see how the industry since then, obviously not just because of my impact. I think that there's been a real turning point within the industry and the industry really does stand behind causes, champions, marginalized groups. There's been a lot of conversations with regards to diversity and inclusion to a greater degree than there has been in other industries. So yeah, it's been a really big honor to be part of the change and we're not done. There's always another conversation to be had. There's always much more representation to be explored. So I think it's, you know, I feel really proud to A, B trans and B, to be a voice for people who don't have my platform or access or privilege. Yeah, we had Edward on the show too. You know, seems like y'all are really like shaking the table more at least than American fashion is. He certainly is. I call him Uncle Edward. Like Edward is just, I've got so many nice things to say about Edward, but I don't even know where to start a lot of the time because when somebody takes a chance on you and brings you in in a largely unprecedented way to, you know, be a contributing editor of British Vogue is beyond my dreams, you know, to even be, I mean, I remember the first time that I shot the Vogue. I just couldn't believe that I was there and then I've done three Vogue covers. So I've done Teen Vogue in America. I've done, and I've done two British Vogue covers. One was internal and the other one was a print cover. So yeah, it's just incredible to have these opportunities and to, you know, call Edward a friend as well as a mentor. As you were crafting your memoir as well, you know, it's so exciting to be getting new just sort of trans stories out there. I know, you know, we're talking about your memoir now, and I know my friend Raquel Willis just did her cover reveal today. Yeah, and it's as more voices are, you know, appearing in the memoir space sort of who did you look to sort of for inspiration for this memoir where there's some favorites of yours or where there's sort of non trans authors to who you were sort of like wanted to emulate. Honestly, I didn't. I tried, I really tried not to make this book like anything that I'd seen before. I really wanted to just merge my experiences and almost like use it as a case study rather than just a straight up memoir, which I'm sure that we'll be seeing more of because trans bodies are so politicized. It's hard to break it apart from, you know, policy and being involved in a culture war. You know, we don't get to live outside of that. We are politicized to the point where it is, you know, it's impossible to break that apart. But I'm really, really proud to be in this position. And I think it's incredible that we're seeing many more trans people share their stories because ultimately, that's the way that we change things. And also, that's the way that people who aren't trans see that there are so many different kinds of ways to be trans and so many different experiences within the umbrella, under the umbrella. And also, if we all don't share our stories, then it just keeps happening. And that has been a big part of the problem is that people have died with their stories to incite them. And there's been so many different, you know, stories that could have changed the world that just didn't see the light of day because of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, or be murdered before your time, or all of the different things that can happen as a result of transphobia and systemic failures. So I think the more opportunities and the more visibility that our community is able to grasp onto, the more chance we have of having future generations of trans people who don't actually need to live within these parameters of trauma and pain, and can live the life that they want, which is what we're fighting for. We're just fighting to live, you know, which is really, really hard. But also, we're fighting for a better future for people who maybe aren't even born yet. Yeah. One thing you've said before is that Twitter is an awful space for trans people. Yeah. Like, you know, on random days, you may have to deal with some unspeakable horror from somebody you have no idea who they are. Maybe you do know who they are, you know, just for example. And I was thinking, what's the most ideal social media experience for trans people, or like, where they can go? I don't know how else to put it. I don't know really. I think that it's really down to the individual and your personal relationship with social media. What is great for one person will be really terrible for the next. Personally, I can't think of anything worse with regards to having social media than having a TikTok, just personally, because it would spin me out, because I don't have that kind of personality type. You know, I'm quite introverted, and I like to live in the real world and not, you know, have to really deal with validation or, you know, numbers and views and going viral and all of that kind of stuff. It just seems like a never-ending quest for virality. And I don't know. I think that that's going to play eventually with people's sense of where they get their validation from. So personally, it's not really for me. Twitter is great for some people in terms of how they get their news, but then if you're of any marginalized experience, mainly trans people and black people is just kind of exposing you to harm in terms of trolls. So I don't know. I think also you just need to think about how you use it and what are your expectations. So yeah, I think just be mindful about how all social media platforms make you feel and don't just feel that you need to just endlessly give and give and give to these platforms that really are just public, you know, privately owned businesses owned by billionaires who are feasting off of our data and conflict. So yeah, just be mindful of it, really. I think all of them have their positives and all of them have their negatives, but you just need to make sure that it's a good space for you and that you're using it in a way that's healthy. One thing that was really interesting in the book, which I don't think I knew about it, was that you, when you started out DJing. Yeah. And I sort of want to know, what was that experience like for you then? And sort of like, what were your favorite things that you used to play? Your favorite songs, you know, or like genres? Like what kind of genres did you spend? Well, I say DJ loosely because he was playing the gay bars. It was fun. I had a really good time. I had a really good time. But it was, yeah, I was playing like largely pop and dance and, you know, just like the queer bangers really. But yeah, I had a really good time. I think it was just the years where I found myself and what better space to find yourself than in a club. And, you know, it was great at times and it was really awful at times. You know, there's nothing worse than being in a nightclub when you really don't want to be out. Kind of want to like, I don't know, I just stood behind the decks with a screw face just pressing the play on Britney Spears. It works. I'm sure all gay club DJs can relate to. But yeah, it was, it was fun. I had a really good time and I got to meet so many different kinds of people and plug into my community and just feel really free with how I express myself. You know, I didn't have to have to worry about what my co-workers were going to think about changes within my appearance. Or I just, I didn't feel like I had to really censor myself, which I think a lot of trans people do in the workplace. So yeah, it was, it was great. I had a really, really fun time. It was fun until it wasn't. And then I knew it was time to hang up the heels and the headphones and just yeah, focus much more on fashion. I will say, is there British pop music that you are? I guess you don't, you're not in America, so you don't, you're not concerned about this. But for example, like, I was at a pregame recently and like somebody put on sugar baits, which is like unprecedented here. Like it's pretty rare you would fucking hear sugar baits at a pregame. Is there music your frustrated is stuck in the UK that like seemingly like you guys are only celebrating and you know, over here we're like blind to it. Music's pretty universal these days, but I'm really glad that you guys got onto Charlie XCX. Okay, we did do a good job there. Finally, finally. Did you really forget her now? I feel like it was, it wasn't really until you guys got onto it. The other guys jumped on her and made her a superstar. So thank you for that, American guys. I'm sure Lewis was tired of me talking about Charlie XCX last year, but I saw the crash door like, I don't know, like seven times. I was following her like the Grateful Dead. Okay. It was festivals. It was New York, LA. Yeah, she's great. I was actually at the Brits. She was, she's a great time. She was walking around with a bottle of Dom Perignon in a T-shirt saying real winner, because she doesn't win, but she is the real winner. She's Charlie XCX. So, you know. Yeah. Oh, listen, I'm glad I wish I was at the pretty endless because Sugar Baze, I'm also the only person who were put on like, I put on the Saturdays. I'll put our girls alive. Oh my God. Have you seen that drag queen called Bailey J Mills? No. Oh my God. So this is maybe a British thing that you guys could get into. It's a drag queen called Bailey J Mills, and they, it's just so, sorry, they're non-binary. And they, it's the humor is just so niche. It's very, very strange. It's like, sometimes you don't really know what you're watching, but it's just the funniest thing ever. And they do this sketch where they're Frankie from the Saturdays with the swoosh haircut from the new game. And, um, Frankie from the Saturdays, the actual Frankie from the Saturdays just stitched it and they do it together. And it's the most arranged thing that you'll ever see, but also completely genius. Okay. I'm obsessed. I'm going to have to find that. That's good news for us. Okay. Great. Uh, well, bro, thank you so much for being here. Of course. Thank you. I love your podcast. Oh, we love you. Oh, Jesus. That's a crazy compliment coming from you. Your book is so awesome. So thank you so much. And you're awesome. Up next, Lewis and I are going to talk about sex. Baby. Yeah.

Which you were in as a documentary on yourself. Yeah. You know, my greatest role. Michael Moore, I would argue Michael less. I was still waiting for the actors on actors invite, you know? You in a net betting. She's like, who the fuck are you? Penn broke his silence this week about how sex scenes in movies have sort of ruined the sanctity of marriage. Oh, that's true. Yeah. What would encourage someone to be so brave? Listen, he basically said to you, show writer Sarah Gamble, who we've had on Keep It. I love Sarah. She said, he said, can I just do no more intimacy scenes? And Sarah, who's a lovely person, of course, said, yes. She's not going to force an actor to do sex scenes. I don't know many show writers who aren't monsters who would. Unless you're a Sean Cody model, coming to the director and being like, you know what? No more sex scenes. I'm married. And you get agreeing with the actor. But I still feel like that is a normal decision that was then compounded by weirdness of him saying it was to protect the sanctity of his marriage. Right. I saw one comment online that I felt was most true, which is, did he get caught cheating? And now he's doing these extra steps to, you know, really be in the relationship show he's committed. And this extra step is, you know, sort of compensatory. It feels very compensatory. Yeah. I mean, listen, I am thinking about when Melissa Reeves on Days of Our Lives had an affair with the actor who played Peter Blake. And her husband basically removed her from the show. Wow. And she eventually came back. But that actor has never been on the show since. Wow. Real life soap dish, going on here. Yeah. Kathy Moriarty, show yourself. So that's what it sounded like, you know, but this brings up a bigger conversation that is being had online. And as we said in our intro, this could just be like six people having this conversation. Right. What happens is a Gen C person with like 500 followers will tweet something and then someone with 100,000 followers will retweet it and argue with them. And then they'll blow it up. Right. It's a quote tweet based anger. Yes. Yeah. But there is this sort of conversation happening now about whether or not sex scenes in movies and TV are invasive. Or yeah, essential to the plot is I feel like something people argue a lot to which I say, you know what else isn't essential to a movie jokes? You know, lots of things that aren't essential to understanding the narrative of a movie. Make the movie what it is, make the movie the thing you want to watch. Guess what's actually boring? Most stories we've heard every story. I don't need to service the story and the story alone in order to be entertained. It's like the frills and the, you know, the artfulness of whatever else is being done. That's interesting. And routinely, that's sex scenes. Yeah. You know, I feel like the one thing we could actually use less of in movies is plot. Yes. Oh, please. Again, I mean, like I've talked excessively about the movie Metropolitan, but basically there is no story. It's people hanging out and then people get mad at certain people and then people have crushes on other people and then we move on from there. It's all vibes, you know, and that's what we need more of in movies and less of this reintroduction of, I guess, like the haze card. It felt like these people really were like, Oh, I love when we finally regulated content, hardcore and, you know, deleted all the race these shit. We're going to put people on TV back to sleeping in separate beds like Lucy and Ricky. Oh, yeah. Real Mike and Carol Brady shit. Yeah. People who don't own toilets. Depane out of a toilet. It's I forget what show was the first to show one, but like the movie Psycho was the first movie to show a toilet, for example, it literally showed a toilet flushing. And Psycho, by the way, is a fantastic film, maybe my favorite Hitchcock and the things that Hitchcock does in this movie to break the haze code specifically is fantastic. Like every aspect of that movie is about fuck you to the haze code, which was a self imposed code of conduct that Hollywood inflicted on itself in the midst of people feeling that, you know, like sexual mores were like out of control, etc, like very like Babylon era. You know, we came out of the jazz age being too sexy. And then people were like, dial it back. But it's the toilet. It's it starts literally with Marianne having an extramarital there, which is a no no. Right. Please don't do that. She's gently is naked in the shower. You can't even show women in their underwear. She said her underwear on the poster for the film too. Right. Right. Right. Tony Perkins has a gorgeous pencil neck, which is essentially queer character is not. And yet no ass, which is essentially not queer. So anyway, he's breaking boundaries left and right. Yeah, stealing money. That's a crime. You know, anyway, Gavin and that movie so hot. Anyway, honestly, I do enjoy the ways that the movie sort of like steps outside of what was allowed in cinema than I think we need to bring some inventiveness back. But you know, that would that makes sense to me. Yes. Yeah. Otherwise, every movie is just going to be Jordan Firstman giving a blowjob on camera. Shout out. Right. So Jordan Firstman, who's a queer comic who I guess has not been on keep it. Am I wrong? No. No, he's like gay, guy, me now. Yeah. Yeah, we'll get with him. He's in a movie at Sundance where he gets like a real life blowjob. I'm sure you're now thinking of that Chloe 70 movie Brown Brown Bunny. Yes. Vincent Callow and the absolutely scorching review from Roger Ebert. But yeah, that's because I remember also when I was in college that movie Short Bus coming out, which had some real sexuality going on in it. And I guess what's unusual about that movie is that we didn't end up seeing a lot more like that. Yeah. That it still became too risky for people to really, you know, embark in crazy sexual situations. Jordan Firstman gave a quote about it being like, one, my gay guy, if there's a dick nearby, I put it in my mouth that it doesn't mean much to me. It's not precious to me or whatever. And you know, confrontational take, maybe not everybody's take. But at the same time, you would think there would be like maybe four movies a year that were like that, you know. Yeah. I feel like there was a period to where like gays were making like independent films that were sort of like story, but also porn. I feel like there were like one or two of those that came out like a few years ago or something like early like 2013 or something. But it really feels like that is a thing that you get to the brink of. And one or two people do it. And then you move on from it because it's just sort of like, it's not really marketable. You know, yeah. And maybe it's not even sexy either. You know what it kind of reminds me of? Do you remember that Brian McKnight album he put out where he's explicitly singing about sex? Yes. I forget what the words were, but you just realized after a while, like, I do not need to hear you saying anatomical terms for things that are going into other things during sex. To get to the song. Unless it's little camp. Right. That's different. You see, but that's like, attitudinal. Yeah. I mean, like, yeah, like you're getting around like kind of abject sincerity with that. Yeah. I mean, I personally think we're in the market for one great, I don't know about unsimulated gay sex scene, but a memorable gay sex scene. I still think the one in bros last year, where like Billy gets it on with I think a couple of people, there's a very funny three way scene in that was a step in the right direction. Because there are parts of sex that I feel like we don't have a lot of conversation about literally the moment to moment things in sex that occur that are sometimes funny or sometimes, you know, leave somebody out or whatever. There's like lots of things to explore in those moments that I don't think we've seen much of. So I'm interested in that. I think sex is just kind of boring on TV right now. You know, TV and film. I think that there's hasn't like, when with the white Lotus rim job scene is maybe like the most exciting thing we've had in like years. What are we doing here? Yeah, right. And also that's exciting because it's just a reveal behind the door, right? Like, I don't expect to see it and then like, bam, nudity. But like, it's more a gag than a scene. But remember how unsexy the 50 Shades movies were? Oh my God. Imagine thinking about those movies. I felt like they were first of all lit like a Panera. And then second of all, the unmistakably non chemistry chemistry between the two leads. Okay, not too much on Panera. Nothing wrong with Panera, please. I was in some random American city. I don't remember which one like a couple years ago or so. And there was a Panera around. So my friend and I got lunch there. And as we were paying, I was like, Oh, wait, I still have a Panera membership. Can I get my phone number? Oh my God. Not you scanning into Panera. All right, when we're back, keep it. And we're back for our favorite segment of the episode. It's keep it. I'm going to go first because my keep it is very pressing. Please do. Valentine's Day used to mean something. Okay. Okay. Like remember in school, the heteronormative task of writing a Valentine to everybody? Oh, yes. Me sending like a Daffy Duck themed Valentine to my bully. You had to make one for everybody. Yeah. Like here you go. Jeff love you. I think one year actually, I, I read Drew Goosebum book covers and made personalized valentines for everyone in my fourth grade class. That is amazing. As in you would trace the font on the cover and stuff? Yeah. I, I, I used to draw and I used to draw like, like, all like little comic books and things and like fourth and fifth grade. And I would, I would hand them out to people as gifts. Oh, that's very adorable and thoughtful. What happened to that instinct? Do you think it was just squashed by the cruelty of life or? Probably. Probably. Yeah. You know, or I found drugs. Yeah. Oh, that's right. Yeah. You became satisfied. Yes. I was a sixth grade tweaker. You know, my favorite Arnold Stein book. Yes. Go ahead. What happened to the importance of Valentine's Day where it felt like novel expressing your love for someone, you know, um, this morning I woke up and obviously I am inundated with Instagrams of lovers, you know, being like, this is my husband. I loved him for several years. They're like, uh, the best year with this man, etc. Um, pointing this guy, all that. Yeah. Here's the thing. If you post like that 265 days a year, then it's not special on Valentine's Day. Okay. Yeah. That is true. That is true. Like if so many people posting, um, a series of photos with their boyfriend or with their girlfriend or whoever, it's like, okay, you do this every day. Right. Unfortunately, if people participate avidly on social media and their interrelationship, inevitably their relationship is a big part of their brand, which means that any expression of sincerity is unfortunately wrapped up in the whole thing they like to promote about themselves. It ultimately, sincerity is going to feel schmaltzy and false always because it's what they produce. It's their content. Mm hmm. Was love always a brand? I don't mean to feel like Carrie Bradshaw here, but, you know, like, was it, was it always a brand or was, you know, they like, celebrity, but it's like, uh, celebrity gossip and, you know, one like the brandification of our personalities through social media turned, um, dating someone into a personality. Right. I think I only appreciate these kinds of posts from celebrity couples where they're both truly celebrities. That is fun to see. This is a day for Ted Danson and Mary Steen virgin. It's not a day for this person I follow because he does CrossFit tips. And then his boyfriend, you know, maybe we'll get into acting someday. Yes, you know, or, um, the boyfriend who you've definitely had sex with before and the husband who you've never met. Yes. I had a whole bit on Kimball about this. There's the one with the abs and the one with the job. But the Ted Danson at Mary Steen virgin thing is very apt because I feel like a lot of couples that, you know, being a couple is their brand online is, um, there's not much going on with either of them individually. No, I don't know what job either of you do. I don't know your interests. You seem to just do think you seem to just appear together. Right. Your whole relationship is a play for a platform, which, um, enjoy that. Hope it lasts. Bet it won't. Yeah. And you know what? The difference is that you and I were simply not born. How do we tell people how hard it is to be fascinating? How do we move on being these people? Louis, this is my longest relationship. Yeah, I know Jesus. You know what? I don't hate the ins. I don't hate that, uh, observation. And it speaks to me because guess what I'm not doing dating. And you know what? Listen, we've you and I have tried some polyamory before we've had some on the show. Some are selfish than others. Yes. And now we're strictly monogamous. I love it. Right. That's true. No, that's we we found a resolve. Yes. I'm the more domestic one, ultimately. There's always one. Uh, we're just saying that. So people start talking about our relationship on Reddit. Like they talk about the pot. Say it, boys. Oh, right. Guys, they're nice, straight people. And then John, you know, uh, love it is gay. That's all that's going on there. I mean, it's not that fascinating. I know them well. They're like the nice cousins. You see it Thanksgiving. Yeah. All right, Louis, what's your keep it? You know what? This is not going to make me look good. I feel bad about this. But this, you know, stirred up a lot of controversy a couple months ago. And good controversy. I was happy it happened. But I unfortunately have to give my keep it to Gene Dealman, uh, 23 K do commerce, 1080 brook cells, which is not how you say that. It's a French movie. But as you it's the Chantal Ackerman movie that came in first in the site and sound all time pull, we decided it was, you know, better than citizen Kane and vertigo and all the movies that dominate this list. So I saw it recently in, uh, the arrow, uh, here in LA, great theater ran into some of my favorite critics, Alonso Duralde was happy to see him. Christie Lemire, whom I've followed since the, uh, she momentarily took over for Ebert and Roper. Love talking with them. This movie is, do you know what this movie is about? Mm hmm. It's a three hour movie of a woman basically doing day to day, moment to moment tasks. It's, it's not a real time movie, but it's supposed to feel real time. Um, and she's going through her life, you know, making food, chopping, um, feeding her son. And then something at the end occurs that switches everything up. Uh, you're watching her routine fall apart very, um, slightly, like, there's, there's some slight decay going on in her day to day life. If this movie were an hour and 45, I'd be like, all right, this is a player for, you know, I don't know about best of all time, but like a four star movie. I understand that the monotony of the movie is the point and it's artistically satisfying in that way. Like what it goes for, what it, what it establishes about the rhythms of life and why one would need to interrupt that with, you know, maybe a, a shocking surge of some kind. But man, it is fucking tough. I mean, it is just like, you, it's also like you get it. You, you get the point and you, it's fun to talk about afterwards, but beyond that, I don't know that it plays with any of the things that makes cinema typically great. And I feel like even if there was like, some amazing dialogue or some amazing, um, other character in the movie or something, I might be more willing to sincerely consider it among like, in all time classic or something, but it's just not the best movie of all time. It's a, it's a crazy thing to say about this movie. Now, what did you say that the monotony and there being no jokes and no other interesting characters is what women think every day when they're working in the home? Yeah. And maybe that, maybe that Lewis is the point of the film. This comment, what you just said right now is why Chantal acriman isn't with us anymore. She's like, I have to get out of here. What do you think about it? Uh, Jeannie Dealman is the, um, a simple favor of the 1970s. Wow. I had a kid trick doing her monotony on Instagram live, you know, and the disruption at the end is Blake Lively. I can't believe I never thought of it that way before. Sorry. I'm not on serious hard drugs. So I, of course, never thought of it that way before. Delphine Sayrig gives an affectless, excellent performance. It's, I think my friend Chris also put it well about this movie. It's basically a trick that can be played once, which is, you get the point of it afterwards and you receive it and it sits with you, but ultimately, it's one long gimmick. I would call it a gimmick of a movie. Um, I would actually say what's interesting about the film is that, um, it's the slice of life thing from the 70s, right? And, um, you know, um, David Litch plays with this a lot, uh, in, you know, Twin Peaks and his films, you know, playing on sort of like old soap operas of the time. And I feel like the original, like original soap operas, which were, which women would watch in the household, right? Um, from like the 60s and 70s, when I watched like old clips of like, taste, where I was from like 1967 or something, they are really boring slice of life stories. Oh, yeah. It's like it is taking this to like a cinematic exploration of that. Um, do you know, I was watching clips of recently, the TV show, Peyton plays, which had, um, Mia Farrow and Ryan O'Neill. And it's fascinating because they're going to obviously turn into much different actors over the next years, but to see them in sort of conventional TV form is so surprising. Because Mia became one of our, you know, most interesting movie stars of the 70s and 80s. I think also something that bothers me about it is it's a movie you do want to talk about, but it's a short conversation. I don't think it's, it takes you in a bunch of different directions. You say the one thing that needs to be said, you received the point. And then that's it. Maybe that's enough for some people. It's not colorful enough for me. You know, it's so interesting about Peyton plays too. Uh, it was created by Grace Metallis who, once there was this interviewed John Waters gave of like his icons and like his books and like, like his literary people, it was like her, like Lillian Hellman, Fran Lee, but whatever. And he said that like, um, Grace who did Peyton plays like her stories amazing because like, as soon as she got fame, she left her husband, took to martinis, became an alcoholic, bought Cadillac and moved to the Plaza Hotel in New York and committed suicide. Perfection. Finally someone gets it. Jesus Christ. Oh, speaking of Fran Leibowitz, do you know what I am obsessed with right now? Now, Fran Leibowitz from time to time appears on like a morning show, like CBS news, this, you know, the shows that are called things like that. Every fucking time, whoever is responsible for introducing the interview segment says something like this. No matter what happens, Fran Leibowitz is talking. Or it's always some like, at the end of the day, whether you agree with her or don't agree with her, she'll be speaking. It's just like, it's also like, it's one of those things where she doesn't have a lot of biographical information you can really talk about. Like she only has the two books and you know, like she worked for interview magazine, whatever. But ultimately you have to be like, there she goes again with one of her opinions. It's so funny. Who's doing these interviews? Sarah Polly? No, this is. Bradley, but what's talking? Yes. In this case, it was Mo Raka, who by the way, I sometimes forget, has led my ideal life, which is he was a daily show correspondent. And now he does things like interview actresses for a living. I saw Mo Raka interviewing Brenda Viqueira once about an afternoon she spent with Barbara Streisand and Sandy Dennis, bitch, that's my look. I actually do foresee a future for you where you talk with older actresses just about like, an afternoon in their lives. Right. And then, you know, somebody responsible who has the patience adapts that into like a 90 minute film stars don't die in Liverpool type movie. Yeah. He's really what I always remember about Raka just because he's one of the people who we sort of our generation sort of grew up with via like VH1. Right. Yes, because those talking head shows needed the one, you know, queer-ish guy. When you think about it, we are sort of the best week ever hosts of our generation. I mean, that is the nicest thing anything will ever say about me. And I understand you're talking about us ourselves. But I'm going to go ahead and accept that compliment we gave ourselves because I don't aspire to anything else. I would feel like who are like the original best week ever host? Like, who would you and I be? Was it Paul F. Tomkins? And who else was on that show? But you're talking about just the talking heads and like all those I love the TV shows. Like Michael Ian Black and stuff. I think I might be Rachel Harris, who wore glasses and had a sort of like, groffalo light vibe. I think I sort of have like a Gary Cole thing about me. Just sort of like, maybe angry all the time. But it's kind of sweet. I forgot Gary Cole would be on that. Yeah. Everybody did like, I love the 80s. It's truly fascinating. I feel like you can even get like you even got like be I'd say to do it at one point. Right. Yeah. Yeah. They had footage of everybody somehow or they'd ask him about, yeah, you remember a Rubik's Cube. Don't you get in the studio? But no, for a moment, you would in the summer, you would go crazy with your friends because yes, Hell Sparks is talking about whatever Duran Duran. What a crazy moment we all have. And now we have TikTok, which is the Wild Wild West. And let me tell you, we need like VH water, somebody get on TikTok and give us some official, you know, things like that again. I don't want to hear someone, some random teenager talking about what a Rubik's Cube is because they'll probably be describing something else. Right. Right. Miss information. It's on fact checked. Wow. You're right. Now in retrospect, I love the 80s feels like journalism. Like actually, like it has more sources than the average, you know, BuzzFeed article. It basically does count. All right. Thanks to Monroe Berg to our for joining us this week. She really did fucking rule. Yeah. We'll see you next week. Deep It is a crooked media production. Our senior producer is Kendra James.
