Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Our three of the Clay and Buck show starts now. Buck gonna be doing this one solo. Sorry. That's me. Buck. I just realized I was speaking to the third person by accident. Clay on his way up to New York City. We're gonna be in suited together the next couple of days here. Obviously the biggest story in the country right now by far is the situation of Hurricane Ian. Landfall is imminent is the headline that's getting blasted all over the news media right now on on TV and all the cable channels. This is a massive storm. 155 mile an hour winds. There will be gusts that might reach up to 190 miles an hour, which these are true tornado force winds. These are winds that could pose serious dangers to not just anybody who's outside, but even danger to to structures. So you need to make sure you are doing everything you can to be as safe as you can. Please make the decisions right now. Always air on the side of caution for those of you who are still making decisions. I know there are people that are currently in shelter in place down in the Fort Myers area, Captiva Island and that West Coast of Florida. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of you right now and we are going to be watching and monitoring this hurricane during this hour and certainly tomorrow and the rest of the week here on the show. Also worth noting we had Joe Bastardi on last hour and he was giving us a historical perspective on where this hurricane Ian where this ranks in the country. In terms of ferocity, the winds, the storm surge compared to what we've seen in previous hurricanes. This is the worst likely the worst hurricane when it comes to wind and storm surge that has occurred in many years, perhaps many decades. So it needs to be taken as seriously as possible. Governor Ron DeSantis, the rest of the authorities in the state of Florida are doing what they can right now to help prepare for both the baton down the hatches phase and then the need for immediate assistance and rebuilding where required. Residents according to the New York Times here of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina need to also really monitor this closely and and take precautions now because it may well be that this storm gets all the way up into Georgia and along the coast of the Carolinas and still be a very serious problem, very serious challenge for those areas. So please everybody take this seriously as it sounds right now. Believe all the reports that you're seeing if you live in Florida and take due preparations and we will get through this. Governor DeSantis is certainly being tested right now. There are going to be people that no matter what is done by the state of Florida, the authorities of Florida. They're going to be critical of it. Here's just an example of some of the stuff that, you know, he just has no time. This is this is not a time for any cheap political points to try to be scored when it comes to climate change or what it comes to anything. This is all hands on deck. And so I think it's highly appropriate for the governor of Florida to say when he's when someone's already criticizing the response before anything's even happened yet that it's nonsense. That of Florida's as we said, lacks response to the storm so far and that give me a break. That is nonsense. Stop politicizing. Okay, stop it. We declared a state of emergency when this thing wasn't even formed. We've had people in here. You've had counties doing. They've done a lot of hard work and honestly you're trying to attack me. I get. But like you're attacking these other people who've worked very hard. And so so that's just totally false. I don't think we've ever certainly since I've been governor declared a state of emergency this early. You talk to the people at the counties when they've needed something stuff gets there very quickly because of what Kevin and his team have done. There are a lot of people right now, thousands and thousands of them who are ready to deploy as soon as it is safe, whether by air or by boat to areas that are going to be very effective state of Florida. And one thing it is important to get get on the record now for everyone to know because I'm sure there will likely be people who tried just like that reporter there. Oh, someone who worked at FEMA said this, this has been, there's been preparation underway for days. There's been coordination between state and federal authorities in Florida and they're doing it seems at this stage, everything that could reasonably be reasonably be done. And in it well in advance of when the actual hurricane is making landfall, which is right now. So keep that in mind. And then there's, you know, on a much, much different front up here in New York City, there was a moment yesterday that did get a bit of attention. And like I said, we're going to be monitoring Florida for the rest of the hour and certainly updating you more and tomorrow we'll be assessing where we are in the effort to make this storm as well to have the best response we can to the storm. But back up here in New York, we had a moment yesterday where I think you heard something that raised a lot of eyebrows from the mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, who I'm just going to say, he came into office and I was rooting for him. And I was, I was hoping for the best year. I was saying, I would love to see this. And yeah, he's a Democrat. And yeah, you know, if he turned New York City around, Democrats would say, see, we could be serious on crime and maybe even Adams would have presidential aspirations beyond that. You know, I get all that, but I live here and I want it to be safe and I want it to be the city that it can and has been in the past America's largest city, which went through a real, a real golden age. I'd say from around the year 2000 in terms of public safety, maybe 1996, 1997, you could say it really started, but around the year 2000, until about five, six years ago, until the de Blasio administration managed to start destroying everything. And then you had the Adams administration start and so far it is not, it is not good friends. Unfortunately, they are not doing a good job with this city crime continues to be out of control. We're going into a midterm election where crime should be a top three issue for voters really all across the country. I mean, I just saw today the Minneapolis Police Department, for example, Minneapolis Police Department's down almost half from the George Floyd, from the George Floyd incident to present, just to give you a sense of what has occurred in these places. Here is Mayor Eric Adams, though, who is saying, well, New York has a brand, whereas Kansas does not. You have a brand, New York has a brand. And when people see it, it means something. You know, when we go there, it's not it's Kansas doesn't have a brand. When you go there, you're okay, you're from Kansas. No, you know what? But New York has a brand. It has a brand. Yes, New York does have a brand and Democrats are destroying it. That's the point here. Democrats are taking what was a city of tremendous history, culture, concentration of wealth. Yes. And they're just ruining it just like they've ruined California. You know, I know there's still a lot of great stuff in California and we've got tons of people saying Californians now listening all up and down that that state. But New York is heading the way of California as a place that had a lot going for it. And then Democrats came in with bad ideas, essentially nullified and and started to erode a lot of those advantages with poor decision making. And one of the fastest ways to destroy a city with policy is this whole defund the police movement. One of the one of the ways that you can ruin a place like New York City is this whole defund the police movement. One of the one of the ways that you can ruin a place like New York City is to not back law enforcement. Eric Adams says that there's a brand for the city of New York. Yeah, that brand includes. I saw two clearly mentally disturbed vagrants. One was totally shirtless in broad daylight throwing. And you know, his pants were kind of fallen off to throwing trash cans at each other. The police right across the street didn't do anything. I mean, I mean, lifting trash cans up and using them as weapons hitting each other. It was right near Times Square. I've had family members harassed by lunatics. It happens now on a regular basis. Just walking down the street. They might have a stroller. Doesn't matter. Shouting profanity crazy things at them. There was just video yesterday that came. I keep telling you, the video makes it really hit home for people on the crime issues. The video is really visceral for people. It really it hits you in the gut. You see what's going on. Just yesterday, there was a drive by shooting on a motorized scooter. You know, one of those vespa-like scooters in the Bronx. People are doing drive-bys on scooters here. I mean, this is not the first one, by the way, that I've seen. This is what is happening. So, yeah, New York has a brand and they're destroying it. They're destroying it just as they happen so many other places. Look at San Francisco. San Francisco. San Francisco is as a physical location, one of the most beautiful cities in the United States. The city of San Francisco is amazing. It's a little cold and rainy sometimes there, but it's generally got some, it's got a mild climate. It should be an amazing place. It was an incredible through the 90s. It's an incredibly expensive place to live. Really one of the most. San Francisco, New York City, were probably the two most expensive per square foot in the country in the 90s and the early 2000s. And San Francisco is now just turned into a place that people are fleeing. They're just trying to get out. It's just a question how quickly they can get out because they've had enough of the crime and the decay and the Democrat party needs, needs to be held to account. Just making the case, and this is why I keep bringing this up. Just making the cases in enough. They need to be pushed out of power because a lot of them are going to keep doing this. A lot of them are going to keep doing this. And for the people listening in Kansas too, you're probably sitting there saying, yeah, we actually do have a brand. It's a brand where people are overwhelmingly safe, where if you go into cities, probably cleaner than at least the parts of New York City that I'm spending time in these days. I don't think the mayor of New York City should be pointing out the deficiencies of any in his opinion of any other part of the country right now because bad leadership is having a real cost in all in the major cities of this country. Bad leadership is something that we are all suffering from. Unfortunately, if you live in a major city, there are some exceptions, very few exceptions right now. I mean, I'm hoping that he turns it around, but I don't think he will. I think he's way too obsessed with his own celebrity. I think he wants to, I think he gets excited about paparazzi and he likes social media and lots of clicks and lots of likes on his posts going to zero bond here in New York City. Ugh, all this stuff. It's ridiculous. That's a some fancy club, by the way, where people go. It's like the private membership club for the stars and the elite in New York City. Anyway, the whole thing, my friends, it needs to get better here for sure. It needs to be improved. We're going to come back. We've got landfall imminent here in Florida, come back to the hurricane and then we'll be joined. Uh, coverage of the hurricane and we'll be joined by in the next segment after that, Rand Paul and Riley Gaines on how do we protect women's athletics. Republicans need to make this a bigger issue going into the midterms because it goes to a lot here. Yeah, it's, it's a cultural issue, but it's also fundamentally a fairness issue about what's decent, what's true, what's right. We'll talk to the senator from Kentucky about that and Riley Gaines coming up here in just a few minutes. So team, stay with me. Tell us how this foundation is an amazing organization. Honestly, I have friends who just ran in the 5K producer, Ali here, ran it at my friend, Raheem Kasam. I sponsored Raheem. I probably should run myself next year. Um, the point here is friends, it is such an important organization doing amazing work with each mortgage free home.

Yesterday, I spoke with Governor DeSantis for some time. My team has been in constant contact with him from the very beginning. And the mayor's at Tampa, St. Pete's and Clearwater. We discussed what we've done to prepare for the hurricane. That includes the capacity of hundreds of FEMA personnel and activating thousands of National Guard members. I've also developed a search and recipe team and deployed them to multiple federal agencies and they've already on the ground and ready to help as we speak. So President Biden has had a conversation with Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida. And that is all in trying to coordinate here and in preparation for a storm that could be the worst hurricane to hit this country in many years, perhaps many decades. Right now, the latest updates here is we're watching this. You have over 600,000 are without power in Florida. You do have a lot of news coverage going on right now that is showing really hard to believe until you see it yourself. The storm surge that's already gathering the winds. This is it looks as though you have tornado force winds alongside a tsunami of storm surge. So you have a massive wall of water that is going to be flooding along the coasts and winds stretching out for many, many miles that are going 150 miles an hour. And this is this is rare for there to be a storm that is at this category for really four plus level. It's just shy of being a category five hurricane and part of the challenge here for for everybody who is hunkering down and just for the state of Florida. And perhaps Georgia and the Carolinas too, if they get hit substantially, it's going to be the duration of this storm over these areas. It's a slow a massive powerful and slow moving storm. So a major, major challenge going on right now are thoughts and prayers go out to everybody in Florida right now. And a lot of you are listening and some of you may really only be able to listen on radio because of power going power going out, which is going to affect Wi-Fi.

And then to get everybody in Florida back on their feet and get that state up and run again. So we're going to keep a very close eye on all of this.

This is Buck here at NYC. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is with us now and University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines, who tied with Leah Thomas in the 200 yard freestyle of the NCAA Women's Championship. Riley Gaines also with us. I thank you both for joining us. Appreciate it. Thanks. Thanks for having us. Senator Paul, let's start with you. What is this initiative that you're pushing here or just this campaign? I know we're going to have an ad you've released today up at clay and Buck.com on just the fairness of allowing only women to compete in women's sports. What do people need to know? You know, my wife and I saw Riley Gaines on television being brave enough to stand up for women in sports and that really only women. I know this is a radical idea, but that only women should be in women's sports. We thought, my goodness, what a brave young woman who swam at University of Kentucky, my home state, all American and this great champion. And she's brave enough, despite all the sort of silent threats of bullying and repercussions if you do this, she's been brave enough. And there haven't been that many have done it. Most of them have been cowed into silence. But the thing is, is somebody has to stand up. And so both my wife and I said, you know, we want to endorse what Riley Gaines is doing. And as a consequence, Riley Gaines said, well, she wanted to endorse what we were doing. So it worked out very well. Riley, I want to ask you, how has this been for you in terms of, first of all, how did the University of Kentucky? How has it been handled by your school? And also, have you gotten a lot of other female swimmers or just female athletes in general, who have reached out to you privately to say thank you for what you're doing? Yeah. With the University, I have had so much support from my university and a really across the state of Kentucky. I think this speaks volumes. I didn't realize initially when speaking out that so many girls across the country are silent. So what I'm dealing with is truly an anomaly. And so I'm so grateful for everyone in the athletic department, Mitch Barnhart. Oh my gosh, I can't say enough good things about him. But in terms of getting other people messaging me privately, that's exactly what it's been. There's been a lot of messaging privately. And of course, it's because people are scared, especially girls, you know, within the Ivy League. They are so emotionally blackmailed. People at their schools within the athletic department are telling them that they will never get into grad school. They will never get a job. Their school has taken their stance for them. And if they so choose to speak out at any harm comes to any sort of transgender athletes. They are solely responsible. And so these girls are silent. They're intimidated and feel like they're in the wrong for thinking. Can I ask you, Riley, just in that moment when you were in the NCAA women's freestyle 200 yard championship and they're telling you you've tied with a six foot four male now goes by Leah Thomas. Did people like were they expecting you? I mean, the people that were really there at that time, the officials running the race and the other team and your team, they were expecting you to be okay with this? Well, I initially didn't even want to swim the race. I know, you know, there's great movement behind striking something. And so I thought to myself, I'm not going to swim this race. I'm going to stand on the block. And so I went to an official and told them, Hey, what happens if I don't swim? You said, if you don't swim, it is next person up. He said, we will not reserve your spot and there will be someone swimming in that lane. And so at that point, I don't want to sacrifice everything I've worked for to give it to someone else and not make a difference. And so I told myself, okay, final swim, but I'm not going on the podium. But then, of course, we tied and I thought to myself. This is all happening so quickly. But I thought to myself, maybe if I get on that podium with Leah Thomas, people will see the direct comparison between a 6'4 biological man and a 5'5 woman. Can I just say, I mean, you must be a heck of a swimmer. It's amazing that you tied with a 6'4 man. Who's a college swimmer? I think there's some speculation there in terms of if Leah Thomas was trying as hard as possible. Because if Leah had been going time, that Thomas went earlier in the season, it would have been Thomas would have won. I see interest interest. Well, you're still the best female swimmer in the country in the NCAA 200 yard freestyle. So you're actually the champion on that event. Senator Rand Paul, can I ask you, is this a matter of what happens here with this? I mean, yes, you're running this ad. We're going to have it up at clan buck.com. People should know more about this. Riley is speaking out. But is this a matter of federal legislation? What has to happen now to show that this isn't normal? This isn't acceptable and it's not fair. I think we have to win the public argument. But there's also other avenues. I mean, the NCAA makes rules. The Olympic Committee on Swimming makes rules. The amateur committees make rules. And people have to push back. If they don't push back, they're just going to let men take over women's sports. Imagine if there were five of these Leah Thomas that showed up that were former men's swimming, you know, been on the swimming team in college on the men's team and switch over to the men's team. And switch over and they take all the first top five places. Can you imagine what happens? Well, we have to win the argument. I think the arguments on our side, then people need to, it needs to be mothers and fathers of daughters who are swimming saying we're not going to let this happen. Protesting the amateur rules, the Olympic rules, the NCAA rules. And then is there a possibility government gets involved? Maybe. I mean, different state governments are looking at this now. A lot of these universities receive state funds. That was the argument for Title IX in the first place is that if they're receiving state funds, the state funds from taxpayers equally, maybe men and women should have to be treated equally in sports. And there's some logic behind that. And so the state legislature may be a recourse and ultimately maybe the federal government. If people know me well, they know I'm hesitant to do anything that begins with the federal government ought to begin privately first and locally then state, then maybe up here. But I'm open to all avenues, but I do want the argument to be had and I don't want people to be shamed and to quietly just sit at home and say rumble, rumble, rumble, this is unfair, but not actually speak out. So I'm proud of Friday Games for speaking out. And I want to see more of this. I'm hoping she'll be an example to another generation of young girls coming up and also to other, you know, world class athletes competing at that level that they shouldn't just give away their sport to men. I mean, Senator Paul, I've also got to ask you, you're a doctor. We often have you on the on the show to talk about Fauci and the COVID. We said the COVID madness. Now I really just think the COVID wrongness. I mean, they've effectively been wrong about everything. And a lot of doctors were mobilized in that effort to be wrong on a matter of many matters of public policy. I see a lot of MDs now popping up here and there saying men and women, not really a lot of biological difference actually. It just feels like there are people who are destroying the perfect the respect and the credibility of medical professionals in pursuit of a number of things. But this is one of them pretending that there isn't a biological difference between men and women that matters in sports. It matters in a whole range of things. Yeah, I think when they say things like that that are so clearly refutable by just by looking at people and looking at the sheer size. But also there's all kinds of statistical evidence. It's like, you know, I think at the top 400 boy runners of the 200 meters are faster than the fastest girl college 200 meters. I mean, it just is. It's not something, you know, to denigrate women. It's just there are different sizes, different sides of muscles, different sides of lungs. And to say there isn't is just to be anti science to be, you know, a flat earther. And so I don't think they can win this argument. That's the problem even with the COVID people. They come out with things that the common man has read enough to know that they're not being honest with us. It's the same thing here. They're going to tell us. Leah Thomas has no advantage being six foot four. You know, and so that's just nobody believes that. And so they lose their credibility. I don't think they win the argument. I think they lose their credibility, but it still requires people to speak out and point out their hypocrisy and inconsistencies. Riley, for people who want to support you or any initiatives that you're doing to try to get the word out, where should they go? So I am co-chairing a new federal pack called nine pack. The website is www.ninepack.org. It mentions what this pack is in place for. And of course, if people are willing to donate and give back, that's a great way to help them. I'm going to try to help protect biological women in sports. Senator Rand Paul and Riley Gaines, both of Kentucky. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thank you.

We are really focused in here on Hurricane Ian in Florida. There's already very troubling video circulating of the damage that is already underway in the Fort Myers area. We certainly hope that everybody was able to get to a place of safety. This is as big a storm as we are likely to see perhaps ever. It is a major hurricane four plus and you add all the different factors into it. This is going to be a very difficult few days for the state of Florida and it may move up into the South East Coast of the U.S. as well. We are watching this closely. Michael in Mariana, Florida has some thoughts on what's going on in his home state. Thank you for calling in. We went through Hurricane Michael, October 10th of 2018. Everybody I know my friends, most of us were here, went through the storm. Now granted, if that storm had been coming to us, most people I know would be fleeing and leaving because everybody has some level of PTSD from this. We watched houses destroyed our neighbors. We watched trees fall. They literally measured in our county. Just my county trees down in the billions. Okay. That was a category five, right? Well, here's the deal. See, we're Florida residents. Let me tell you what happens. A category four and below Florida law provides that for the insurance companies, they have a 20% deductible on all hurricanes. Okay. And here's the fun part. We found out in, I think, 03 when they had multiple hurricanes, like 04 came through, maybe 04, they had forum come through. They add that 20% on top of if you have another one come. If you don't get the things fixed yet, they're going to add it to another 20%, another 20%. I know of a lot of businesses and churches that went out of business because of that. But anyways, so here's the deal. If the hurricane comes and well, obviously it's hitting. If it's a four, everybody's going to have a 20% deductible. However, if it gets rated as a five, that deductible goes away. Except if they come back like they did with us and nine months later, rated as a five. Oh, I'm sorry. The time periods passed. So, yeah, you still have your deductible. Interesting. So you think that there's a, there's some fudging the numbers with the four plus, as I've been calling it, hurricane versus the five because that. I mean, this is going to, there will be billions, perhaps tens of billions of dollars of claims attached to this one storm. I would imagine. I grew up in Clearwater and interesting, your last story. I was a swimmer in high school. And yeah, I completely agree with what you guys had said before in Title IX, a huge deal. But yeah, so I was from that area. I still have friends and family down in that region who are going to be affected and are being affected. But yeah, that's part of it is the insurance and FEMA. Up here, we were frustrated because FEMA spent a billion, literally being billion dollars in administrative costs. We were rather than state of Washington and just shared the money with everybody who went through the storm. Well, Michael, thank you so much for your perspective as a Floridian who has been through a severe hurricane in recent years. We're going to continue to watch this one very closely. And we're just, we're thinking about everybody down in Florida. I know it's, it's a very tense. It's a scary time right now, depending on which part of Florida you're in. It's really unnerving. And we are with you in spirit and we're continuing to follow this. We had started out earlier in the program talking about how Joe Biden had said that, well, he essentially called out at a press conference for a member of Congress who had died in a car crash just at the at the end of this past summer. And now the White House is being asked questions really that the president of the United States, did he not? Did he just not recall that this had happened? And Karine Jean Pierre is being asked to weigh in on this. What happened in the hunger event today? The president appeared to look around the room for an audience member, a member of Congress who passed away last month and seemed to indicate she might be in the room. So the president was, as you all know, you guys were watching today's event, a very important event on food insecurity. The president was naming the congressional champions on this issue and was acknowledging her incredible work. He had he had already planned to welcome the Congresswoman's family to the White House on Friday. There will be a bill signing in her honor this coming Friday. So, of course, she was on his mind. She was of top of mind for the president. He said, Jackie, are you here? Where's Jackie? She must not be here. No, I totally understand. I just I just explained. She was on top of mind. She was top of mind. So he didn't know that she had recently died. This is what the White House is saying. Now, look, I understand that the job of the White House press secretary is people say it's information. It's propaganda and the defense of of the White House. Really? Well, that's that's a tough one to try to tell people. Oh, well, he was really he was just thinking about her, but apparently didn't think about her in the context of she had recently died in a tragic action accident. So he was wondering where she was in the room. It's the commander in chief, folks. And when you think about what's going on with certainly what's going on in Florida because that's going to require a massive federal response to assist. But also you look at Nord Stream and Russia and we are in we are in perilous times and we we've got somebody at the helm who just is just not all there. It's very obvious. And, you know, the media used to run these whole news cycles on the 25th amendment of the removal of Donald Trump. There may have to be as much as Democrats pretend like it's never going to happen. If he runs for a second term and I think he will, there may have to be a 25th amendment invocation because it becomes that clear, that are a futable. I mean, the recklessness of it all my friends. Look, thank you for being with us today. Clay will be here with me in New York tomorrow. We're all going to be watching thinking about and and following as closely as possible this storm in Florida. This is the focus of the nation is on this right now. So that's what where our minds and hearts are. We're with you are fellow Floridians. We are thinking about you. And we're going to be talking to you, you know, hopefully taking some calls from you and checking in as much as we possibly can in the days ahead.
