    "text": " So a lot of people ask me what types of music I like, especially when I work out in the morning, I'm always posting on Instagram my morning workouts. And the truth is I have an eclectic taste when it comes to music, but I gotta be honest, I listen to a lot of Michael Jackson, because who doesn't love Michael Jackson's music? Hey, pretty baby with the high heels on. Yeah, you wanna dance that right now. If you listen to it right now, putch, putch, putch, that nice beat in the background, which brings us to the question of the day, guys. Should we throw out the art with the artist? I'm gonna give you guys my opinion on that. Plus, quick little update for you. The Cambridge Dictionary has officially changed the definition of man and woman. Yep, all that and more today, coming up on Candace Owens. I'm starting with the man in the mirror. Yeah, I know you love that song. It's cool. You wanna sing the rest of the lyrics? I have to admit, I grew up on Michael Jackson's music, which is like a big thing in black households in particular. I feel, and by the way, I know you're gonna say, oh, Candace, I grew up differently. Don't discriminate. A lot of white people in the 80s grew up with a lot of Madonna's music, her entire catalog. She's a disaster today. I grew up with Michael Jackson's music in a black household. We watched the Michael Jackson movie about his upbringing and his terrible father. So he meant a lot, and also his music is great, and his dancing is just fantastic, was fantastic. And so this brings us to the question of whether or not we should separate the art from the artist. And I was thinking about this because I do. I do separate the art from the artist. I still listen to Michael Jackson, despite the fact that he had a bunch of charges brought against him before his death. And people immediately think, when you have any charges or when you get into trouble, we should be dumping all of his music. This tends to be the way that people think today. I've had a lot of people. In fact, a couple of years ago, as I was finishing up my college degree, we had to write a paper, the professor wanted us to weigh in on Kevin Spacey. And we had to give our opinion and create a sound argument for whether or not we should throw out Kevin Spacey's art, meaning all of his movies, should Netflix get rid of all of his movies, should they all come together and say, no more Kevin Spacey because of all of the allegations against him. And by the way, the allegations are plentiful. I'm gonna take you through some of them. It's been alleged that Kevin Spacey made a sexual advance on somebody, the last name, rap, when he was just 14 years old. An anonymous man also accused Spacey of grooming him when he was 17 years old. Justin Dawes claimed that Spacey gave him alcohol and played gay pornography when he was just 16 years old. An anonymous American filmmaker said that Spacey sexually harassed him on a movie set. Filmmaker Tony Montana said Spacey, quote unquote, grabbed my whole package at a Los Angeles bar. British bartender Chris Nixon claimed that Spacey, quote unquote, grabbed my penis during an after party. So yes, a lot of men and there are more have come forward and basically said this guy is a creep and it's been an abuse of power. And this is what our professor wanted us to debate, whether or not that means we should throw out all of his movies. And I argued in favor of keeping all of Kevin Spacey's movies and the entire catalog of all of his work on Netflix and every other application because the truth is, is that if you punished Kevin Spacey, I mean, what a slippery slope we would have. I think a bear question would be, would there be any art remaining if we judged all of the artists based on their actions, but also the slope is slippery because then you penalize other people that had nothing to do with it. How many other actors were involved in Kevin Spacey's movies? What about the producers, the interns that were on the sets, the other actresses that were involved in these movies, the writers who received awards because they wrote amazing things, right? You're gonna punish all of those people because you will want to condemn, rightfully condemn Kevin Spacey and his actions. I don't know if that really sits right with me. The answer is that it doesn't. At least I argued that in a paper. And these aren't the only two people that this debate keeps coming up with, R. Kelly in particular. Now I'm gonna be honest, I did not watch the documentary pertaining to R. Kelly and I've heard that it is absolutely hideous. I also know that a lot of the women that were in that documentary who made allegations are now going back on their words and saying that they were told to say certain things, but I think there's been a consensus that R. Kelly is at least kind of very guilty in terms of his actions against young women. And he was sentenced to 30 years in prison in July of 2022 following his conviction last year on federal racketeering and sex trafficking charges, stemming from his efforts over the years to use his fame to ensnare victims that he sexually abused. Now, over the weekend because my phone was on shuffle, my music was on shuffle, an old R. Kelly song came up. It was a duet between him and Celine Dion. I listened to it at no point while I was listening to this music that I think, oh, I should stop listening to it because R. Kelly is a really bad person. It was just a really beautiful duet that they did that sort of actually maybe nostalgic because I was younger when it came out and it made me think about my childhood. And there is something special about music that it brings you back to the place where you actually were when you first heard that song. Maybe the person you were dating, when you were thinking of that song when it first came out, that there's something very beautiful about music. You don't really think about the artist ever actually when you're listening to that music. You somehow apply that music into your own life. And you go, oh yeah, that reminds me of when I was in high school and we were drinking under age and we were all outside. A lot of old country music brings me back to those moments. And so no, I didn't cut away from it. I listened to the entire song and I enjoyed it. By the way, in case you haven't seen this, this is also why the topic has been on my mind pertaining to Yay, formerly known as Kanye West, the world Jewish Congress recently came out and urged the music streaming platforms, Apple Music and Spotify to remove Yay's music catalogs from their platforms due to his anti-Semitic remarks. The world Jewish Congress president, his name is Ronald Lauder, wrote a letter that both companies continuing to offer West music on their platform means that they are profiting off of Jewish hate. And so he wants the entire catalog removed. And I thought that is absolutely the wrong answer. Of course, that's the wrong answer. If you yourself do not want to listen to Yay's music, you have every rights removest catalog. I've done that to certain artists. And I said, I never wanna hear their music ever again, right? Usually because of some horrible political perspectives that they had and I've never listened to their music in the first place, but you can tell your Apple catalog that you don't wanna hear it as it shuffles through and suggests music to you, right? But the idea that other people shouldn't have the option to hear the music, the idea that there should be any organization that should establish who we have a right to transact with, what music we have a right to listen to. No, I always go back to the individual. We have to have the ability to discern by ourselves and to make individual opinions and to say, I as an individual no longer want to listen to our Kelly. And the truth is, by the way, he's recently released a new album from prison, which is suspect to me. The truth is that I wouldn't listen to our Kelly's new music because of his charges. But his old music feels like a piece of my childhood. So yeah, I can transform. That maybe is a very nuanced opinion. Yeah, I listened to it in the past, but I wouldn't listen to it going forward. That's my perspective, right? There's a lot of, by the way, Alec Baldwin. Alec Baldwin actually killed somebody. And it's absolutely despicable that he hasn't faced any charges because of this. And it really is a sign of his remarkable privilege. But if I was watching an old film and Alec Baldwin was in it, I wouldn't suddenly turn it off. I don't think I would. No, in fact, I'm pretty sure recently I watched a film and I didn't even realize Alec Baldwin was in this and it was an old film and I just allowed it to play. Same can be said, by the way, for a lot of people who are feeling rightfully passionate against Balenciaga, I will never purchase a Balenciaga product in the future. That is just the truth. But I own a pair of sweatpants from Balenciaga and I don't see the reason why I would just throw them in the garbage. They were actually expensive. I'd rather give them away than to throw them into the garbage because I paid for that product. But yeah, now Balenciaga to me is something that I wouldn't purchase into the future. So anyways, I'm having this conversation because I do think that when we start saying that we should just no longer just completely associate the art with the artist, I think the slope gets very slippery and I think that it penalizes people that are around that person who have nothing to do with them. Kanye wrote a lot of Beyonce's music. You just Beyonce get punished now because of things that Kanye West said that doesn't really seem right. Alec Baldwin has been in so many movies with so many actresses and so many great directors and musicians involved in those films. Do we penalize them? I don't think it's the right solution. I think we again should be able to make those decisions on an individual basis. And yeah, I'm starting with a man in the mirror. It's just, it's a banger and it's gonna stay on my phone.

[\"The Top of the Year\"] All right guys, so you know we've been following this Sam Brinton story very closely that he is from the Department of Energy, where tax dollars have been going for him to have a position and he's a nuclear waste official in the DOE. And obviously just by judging by his Instagram, you know he's on a table, he's half naked, he's wearing a thong, he dresses up in dresses in his spare time in lipstick and heels, he's posing for Playboy. Obviously this is a mentally deranged individual. And I guess not after the first piece of luggage that he stole from a woman at an airport, but I guess two separate incidents of him stealing women's luggage, probably because he wants women's panties, was enough finally for the Department of Energy to fire him. So that is the update. Sam Brinton has been fired after his multiple luggage theft charges and the post reached out to the agency for comment and the agency actually came back and said we don't normally comment on issues pertaining to personnel. But yes, I think it was actually too much pressure. It's the most ridiculous scandal ever obviously because like I said, if we had just obviously discriminated against somebody who looks crazy, you know, if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it probably is a duck. If it looks like a crazy person and it acts like a crazy person, it probably is in fact a crazy person. And for some reason as our society keeps wanting to aspire to some idea where we just accept everything, it's just all about acceptance and we should accept everybody and we should no longer discriminate against anything. And as I told you guys earlier this week, I discriminate. It's important that we continue to discriminate against crazy people and especially crazy people that are receiving our tax dollars. So goodbye to Sam Brinton. My director had a good joke. He decided that Sam Brinton was too much baggage for the Department of Energy. So there you go, nice Sam Brinton joke. Moving on, you guys, I can believe this has happened. Something that has driven me crazy. I don't know if you guys have noticed this as well, just in terms of the websites that I normally read. They are starting to use the desired pronouns of individuals. So I'll be reading an article and rather than saying Sam Brinton, they'll say they said referring to Sam Brinton, which is completely ridiculous because you should say he said. And that's how it starts. It's a small corrosion. It means that we start getting on our knees for the crazy people and this should not be allowed. You should not work for any organization that is telling you that you have to use pronouns like they, them, Zimz or Zizor, whatever it is, whatever people are calling themselves. I don't like it whatsoever. It's happening and it's even worse guys. Cambridge Dictionary has officially changed the definition of man and woman. They could have updated. We knew that this was coming and it has officially arrived. Now, the definition of a woman now states, an adult who lives and identifies as female, though they may have been said to have a different sex at birth. I'm sorry, what? You just actually eradicated women. You just said, you know longer there's nothing different or special about you now a person can put on heels and say they're a woman and they're the exact same person as you. Where on earth are the feminists? The feminists that were, where are the people that showed up at the Brett Kavanaugh hearing, right? And told us that him being confirmed would set women's rights back, the Yale University that busts down to all the women who are screaming outside of the courthouse that were interrupting his confirmation process. Where are all of those rabid women now? Where are they? Are they going to be marching at Cambridge University presumably? Are they wherever the dictionary comes together, whatever printing press is taking care of the Cambridge University which are they going to be marching and saying, no, actually this is the erasure of women. It's actually here, feminists, you know, that moment that was bubbling up when you kept talking about the patriarchy but you called everything a patriarchy and it was a ghost that you were chasing, well guess what? Now the ghost has actualized. It's actualized. They have decided that you are no longer special and that a man can put on a pair of heels and some pantyhose and some lipstick which is of course just a caricature of what it means to be a woman and they can decide that they are you. They did it. The men won this. If you're talking about the invisible patriarchy, it's transgenderism, okay? It is men believing that they are women, openly mocking women by frolicking in the woods and heels and going on a TikTok and being awarded awards that should go to actual women. These are people that are essentially in Halloween costumes, right? Who have maybe watched Clueless on reruns for too long and decided that this is what all men must act like and therefore I'm not wearing some wearing a wig and I'm saying like totally like cool, like oh my God, I'm like afraid of bugs, like whatever. Yeah, they won. So I am just asking where are all the feminists at? Let me guess, you're not gonna say anything because you were never actually feminists at all. In fact, everything that you ever fought for, in fact helped men. When you told women to take off their clothes to be seen. You might have a problem with that. You think men care about taking a woman that says, I'm just gonna be naked, it's freedom. Yeah, I think they're cool with you having your boobs out that tends to be okay with men. They don't care about that. When you said, oh, it's the, it's about sexual freedom and women can have tons of partners. Yeah, I think men were cool with that. Yeah, they're happy to sleep with you and have no further relations with you. Feminist, who were fighting for that. Oh, it's all about my booboo, you know? And me being able to sleep with who I want just like a man. And then when you guys fought for women should go to work too. Yeah, I think men were cool with that. You just earning money and allowing them to sit on the couch. Yeah, I think that was something that you guys fought for that they thought was pretty chill. Yeah, and then of course you guys got on board with the transgender, the transgender is actually a perfect way to say it. I misspoke there, but yeah, the transgender you guys got on board with everybody can be a woman. Now the definition of what it means to be a woman is gone. It's been edited, which means the women no longer exist. So kudos to all of you feminists who are probably going to be quiet now because everything that you have ever fought for is exactly this moment. If you owe back taxes to the IRS or have unfiled returns, now is the time to take action. The so-called inflation reduction act is funding $80 billion to the IRS.

That's taxnetworkusa.com slash candace to learn more. Moving on from the story, I've been noticing this weird thing. That weird thing are people that are losing their jobs for ridiculous reasons. I guess I should call this bizarre hills to die on, right? If you're like, I'm gonna die on this hill, it should be something that is just so poinley ridiculous. And there are two stories where people have in fact died on weird hills. So there was a Pennsylvania school board treasurer who openly said that there was an excellent candidate for president of the school board, but she wouldn't vote for him because he was a SIS white male. You guys know the truth, right? Obviously, everyone's talking about racism everywhere, except for where it is, right? Just like the Trent agenda. Everybody's talking about the erasure of women everywhere except for where it actually is. And this is a similar story in the exact same vein. We talk about racism, but we refuse to talk about it as it pertains to white straight men who I think are treated hideously in society. There's something wrong with you if you're white in your street and you're a male. So you better problematize yourself by saying that you're gay or that you're trans or something like that. Well, this woman just came right out and said it. She's like, you would be perfect for this job, but for the fact that you are white. Take a listen to her in her own words. Having said that, I believe that Mr. Delia would make an excellent president. However, I feel that electing the only SIS white male on this board president of this district sends the wrong message to our community. A message that is contrary to what we as a board have been trying to accomplish. I think that it's important that we practice what we preach and that our words have strength when they are spoken, whether we speak them from the neighborhood sidewalks or from behind these tables. Mrs. Stainback has done an exemplary job as president these last few months. And the strength of her performance has earned her my vote tonight. You know, I like so much about that clip. Is that she can tell she really worked on that? Like she thought this was her MLK moment. She thought this was like her MLK. I have a dream speech. She's like, I think it's important that we practice what we preach. And what we preach is racism. And I'm going to explain to you why I'm going to do a racist thing and judge him by the color of his skin and by his gender. And instead vote for somebody else, even though he is overqualified and he should be the person. And so yeah, she voted for Ms. Stainback over Mr. Delia. Mr. Delia, by the way, is a father of three who previously served as an area school director. And during previous races, had the backing of area Democrats eight to one. And then this woman realized that he was white. And of course, after she gave this, I have a dream that people should be more racist speech. People were rightfully upset and they called her sexist and racist and called it a tirade, which is in fact what it was, even though it sounded nice. It's just a racist attack on this man. And they called for her to resign. And guess what? She did. So that woman's name is Jennifer Sollett, by the way. Jennifer Sollett, that was a very weird hill to die on. And I bet that that speech will haunt you. And then it is funny that you took time to write it. Moving on, this is even crazier. I saw a story, I just went, wow, this person has fully lost their mind. Could you imagine a debate that divided the town about a Christmas tree going up at a library? Could you just imagine that? It's so ridiculous. I can't even imagine now that people are like, no, we cannot put up Christmas trees because they're offensive. This is where we've been at for the last, I almost, I feel like since Obama was in office and he was like, we shouldn't say Merry Christmas. It's offensive. It's like, why can't we say Merry Christmas? I don't understand this. If you're somebody who grew up without Christmas, do you really care? And it's like when I see a manorah, I'm not offended. I'm not like, oh my God. But I don't get eight days of Hanukkah. And I'm so offended that you just would put a manorah up in the way, I don't care. There are people that have a lot of significance for them. If you are Jewish or Christians, Christians has a lot of significance. I don't care if you celebrate Kwanzaa kind of because it's not really a real holiday. But whatever it is that makes you happy in the holiday season, let it live, right? And this is how I feel about Christmas trees. Well, in Massachusetts, a Christmas tree going up at a library caused a lot of drama for a woman named Diane Loud, right? And she basically said that it was offensive. And then somebody else of the library named Lisa Desmond said, no, this is not offensive. This is Christmas. And I feel like you're canceling Christmas and we should be allowed to have a Christmas tree. And then Diane Loud lost her effing mind. It's the only way that I can say it. She lost her mind and started yelling at Lisa. She referred to her as a selfish effing BtCH on Facebook. And accused her of putting the lives of the library staff in danger because she complained about the tree not going up, which led to the library being harassed. And you want to know what else she said? This is what she said, Kwanzaa, not even kidding. For a tree, for a mother effing tree, you have put people's lives in a lot of danger. A lot of danger. Is this what you think your magic sky daddy wants? Wow, James referring to God as a magic sky daddy. Yeah, this one just hates Christians. This is just obviously there. I don't know if there is a word for being anti-Christian, anti-Christianism maybe. And she clearly hates Christmas. She hates Christians. And she has decided to refer to God as magic sky daddy. By the way, sounds nice. Magic sky daddy, yeah, I do believe in the magic sky daddy. I like my magic sky daddy and I believe in him and I pray to him. So if that makes you good, if you hate Christians and you're going, ew, look at you and your magic sky daddy, I'm chill with that. You know what I mean? God bless your soul honestly. Obviously this went viral and she wrote by the way, I hope the fact that you who claim to believe in Christ and Christmas or whatever happy horses that you're trying to hide behind are the least gracious, most hateful, most disgusting trash in the world. In closing, I would like to add a FU, FU seat, she actually wrote it out. You pieces of trash, I hate each and every one of you. And I do wish great suffering on you. You are a terrible, terrible people and you did it all because you didn't get your way. You are despicable. Yeah, that is some anti-Christianism. If I've ever heard anti-Christianism, I can't imagine by the way that this person was working at a library. I love kids at libraries. You can imagine that this person with a quiet rage like this just being like, you're all pieces of trash, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. I'm just happy that she's been removed from the premises and yes she has lost her job or quit or resigned. I don't know what happened here, but I do think that once you go on a rant about Magic Sky Daddy, it's over. And I just wanna say this to you, Diane, loud, this was a weird hill for you to die on. And I'm gonna say something that's really gonna annoy you, I'm gonna pray for you. So I'm gonna do Diane, I'm gonna pray for you. And that's all that I have to say about that.

So go check out FrontPageMag.com today. All right, now it's time for the daily comment roundup where I dive into your comments and read them out loud and respond to them. So let's see what you guys have for me today. All right, this comment is from Linda Lee on the topic of discrimination. You know, earlier this week, I just came right out and said that I do discriminate against people and I reserve my right to discriminate against you. This is a lot of people who are very much in support of this monologue. And Linda Lee says, I would rather call it personal discernment. I practice law for 30 years, primarily representing victims of discrimination, usually in the workplace. Having preferences and using one's discernment is not discrimination. I view discrimination as hating or disliking someone for their skin color, religion, political beliefs, medical choices. In other words, the discrimination is based on preconceived ideas or agenda perpetuated upon us by society, family, friends, etc. We have certainly seen much of this and it seems to be getting worse. I believe love is the answer. Always has been, always will be. Love one another and we shall have peace. That's all I have to say about that. Love you, Candace. I love you too, Linda. And I do like calling it personal discernment, but that feels like a euphemism for me because I do discriminate. And if it's based on disliking someone for their political beliefs or medical choices, etc. Yeah, I discriminate. If you put up on Instagram, just got my fourth booster, I think you're an idiot. And I know that I would not be friends and I think that I just think that you're not a smart individual. So yeah, that would be a medical choice that you made. I discriminate if you are purple hair based on appearances you have here, not liking someone. Like when I see someone that looks like those old school trolls and they have like fire red hair and they've got, you know, those huge, their earlobes are expanded because they have those earrings in that make them super big. And they, I don't know, I just go, mmm, liberal. It's a liberal and I don't like it. So yeah, I actually do discriminate against people on those bases. I don't discriminate against people because of their skin color or their religion. But I do also believe firmly and I can maybe do this another day that stereotypes, by the way, have been proven to be real. Stereotypes don't come from nowhere, right? So you can have exceptions to rules, but stereotypes come from number. It's like the idea that if you see a Korean that they're probably good in math, yeah, people in Korea have the best math, the mathematicians in the world, right? They're as a country in terms of mathematics, they are excelling. They are the number one nation for math, right? Their children are passing these tests way more and often than people in America are. So yeah, these stereotypes don't come from nowhere and people can have, just give me a vibe right off of the bat and I use my personal discernment or my discrimination to say, I don't want to be around that person. So call it what you will, but I love you too, Linda. Next comment is from John. John says, a man sat next to me on the subway recently. I've learned to be on the alert at all times he gave me the heebie-jeebies, so I moved away. Not even a minute later, he was up punching windows, kicking people and generally being violent and threatening. He was a big guy, the kind that could kill you with one blow. I shudder to think what would have happened if I had not listened to my gut. It wasn't long ago I would have stayed next to him so as to not hurt his feelings or look discriminatory and that's exactly right. People do this consciously. They're like, oh, it must be my unconscious bias that makes me not perhaps want to be next to this person who is maybe just homeless and going through a bad time and talking to himself and saying I should go up to this person and I should offer this person money or something and have a conversation. And it's like, okay, well, sometimes you'll end up dead if you do that, right? So you're unconscious bias, these terms that people use to describe the fact that you are built with a system that gives you a gut instinct, right? You are able to exercise that discernment to use a word, but you are something that's telling you your bells are going off and something's wrong with this person. And it's not because they're homeless, it's because they're maybe talking to themselves, right? Sometimes people just have a look in their eyes, they look crazy and I don't want to be around them. And people will say, oh, maybe they're just hard on their luck, all this up. As I said, you can do that. I'm going to get up just like this person did and move away from the person into the next car as I did many times all of it throughout New York City where there is just a high population of crazy, especially in the subways where I'm like, especially if I'm alone at night, I can go into a whole story about what happened with me in a homeless guy in an apple one time in the subway station, but I won't do it today because I want to get to more of your comments. This person is Betty Smith and she is commenting regarding the Kim Klasek lawsuit, as you guys know, Kim Klasek sued me for $20 million and she lost really decisively, so she has to now pay me $115,000. Betty Smith says, I am so glad that you called Kim Klasek out. I saw her ad and fell for it too. Wow, what if Rochester, how did you think that she would get away with this? People would eventually find out about her shady past or perhaps present. Thanks, Candice. The truth is, I don't think people would have found out if I did not bring it to the forefront and it was incredible. We all fell for this video and I think it's because you want to believe that no person would, I don't know, deceive so many people, like how do you sleep at night? If you're taking money from well-meaning individuals who are giving you this money because they believe in you, even when they don't have it, that was what was so frustrating about it. It was throughout COVID, the end of her campaign in 2020 and people were hard on their luck at that time because of lockdowns and they were going, I'll give you $5, $10, $15 and it amassed an $8.3 million campaign fund for her. And you would think, and by the way, I want to be clear because I know a lot of people commented and said, it's okay, there's only stripper in the past. I don't have a problem with strippers in case you missed it. It was a stripper that came forward and gave me all the information. She's openly, but she talks with the fact that she's a stripper if she wants to change her life. That's a part of your story, that's great. But when you are still involved in that strip club and when your husband manages that strip club, as it said on the address book, that he was a manager of a club and that is what the stripper told me and you're running on family values, that's problematic for me and people deserve to know that truth. The next comment is regarding my bunny slippers. You may have seen this in case you haven't. I don't know. Somebody had bunny slippers and I wore them because they're really comfortable and because it means that I'm walking on the bunnies and I hate bunnies and I just think bunnies are creepy. If it's dark out, their eyes glow in a way that lets me know that they guard the underworld and I want nothing to do with them. Samira Delilah Rose says, you have the blessing of many followers and the opportunity to share anything with the world and this deliberate, unethical, unnecessary, and un-ethical. Unnecessary hate toward innocent life. If even in jest is disgraceful, disturbing, and demonic, please do some prayer. This is not like the level headed smart, stoically, integrity driven kenis that we admire. Animals are not here to be slandered. We should be protecting and respecting them allergies or not. Sorry, Samira. I think they are of the devil and I think also you should lighten up just a little bit, just a tiny little bit. No bunnies died in the making of those slippers, but I would wear a bunny hat. I do actually think I do have some fur made of bunny. I just don't like bunnies. I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I'm letting you down. I don't like the little creatures. They're weird looking and I'm definitely allergic to them. So, I'm sorry. Next comment from Sweet Pieces. She says, I've always been terrified of bunnies. Always look like they're plotting the extermination of humankind while looking sweet and fluffy. Don't trust them at all. You're my girl. You are my girl. That's how I feel. I'm just like, going back to that gut instinct. I'm like bunnies. It was a good marketing campaign. I get it. I totally get it. Bugs Bunny. Everyone liked bugs. Lola bunny. She was cute. And it was a marketing campaign, but really they are demonic. And I'd like to apologize again to Samara for telling the truth. All I can do is tell the truth.
