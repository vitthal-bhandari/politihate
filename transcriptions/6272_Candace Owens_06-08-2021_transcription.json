One, because I've watched you growing up. So like everybody knows you're like America's doctor, right? So like what you're saying is I'm old. No, no, no, no, no, I'm a young person. I was three years ago was what I meant. Oh yeah, I've grown up watching you. And you feel like you are America's doctor. The second thing is I love psychology. I want like a doctorate like Joe Biden. I want to be Dr. Joe Candace. Do it. Yeah, I love psychology. I see psychology in everything. So I've just always been naturally fascinated by it. It's an experience. There it is. So I'm going to ask you a question to start off. Let's start with COVID. Yeah. I'm convinced it's more of a psychiatric disorder. COVID. Is it more of a virus or more of a psychiatric disorder? It is both. When this thing came on, the mental health component is what scared me the most. I was telling the press just to shut up. Because I could tell that they were going to create a panic. You guys were talking about porn in the last segment. It's panic porn out there. That's how they attract eyes now. And they're clearly going for the same phenomenon with the delta virus, which is a serious issue. Pandemic suck. It means excess death. They are terrible. But we've been through many of them. And we didn't close the whole world down because of them. And I saw this coming. And I just thought, oh my god, we cannot fashion what we're doing after the Chinese Communist Party. That was not an intervention by an infectious disease team. That was a government intervention of some type. That was saving face or that was rehearsed in case something got out of it. Something. It was nothing in any infectious disease textbooks. And that's what scared me. Well, they went ahead with it. They locked us down. Isolation, mental health, depression, anxiety, 93,000 overdose deaths, alcohol up. It's all bad. So it's both. It is both, for sure. Yeah. And I think about that because I always talk about the news stations. One of the most beyond odd things that came out of it was them doing the death ticker. And I said to people, you've never seen a death ticker for anything. If there was a death ticker for car accident, you'd never get in your car. It was like every second. A person's gotten a car accident. Of course, you would say, I'm not getting in there. Because suddenly, A, you're home. So you're trapped and you're looking at a screen all day. And that screen is just counting deaths for you. Like, why did the media do that? Because it worked. Because it attracted eyes. And it still felt like we were in some sort of weird, post-Trump kind of hysteria. Like, it seemed like our personality shifted into a histrionic direction during the Trump administration. It went from narcissism, which is definitely where we've been at for the last 10, 20 years, to sort of histrionic, which is swinging the brains with idea, emotional superficiality, victim identification, and delusional thinking. There was a frank delusionality. And an extraordinary thing happened to my profession. I want you to think about this. In my entire career, I've been practicing medicine since 1988, okay? I spent two decades in a psychiatric hospital and a general medicine or in a general medical setting in the hospital. Never the FDA, the AMA, the NIH, the NIMH, you named the CDC. They were not involved in my decision-making in any way, except to give me a little information, they'd send me some publications and things. Fauci was a leader that I admired greatly through four previous pandemics. I watched him and listened to him and I would adjust my decision-making based on the data they gave me. But they were not involved in the decision-making. This pandemic, my profession became scared to death. The primary care people froze in place. All the craziness around Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine caused them to freeze. And I discovered something. They're mostly employees now. And they were afraid of losing their jobs so they'd shut up and they seeded all their decision-making to bureaucrats. So the FDA, for the CDC, they're not designed for that. This is not organizations designed for making healthcare decisions. They don't know how to make risk-reward analysis. They don't have anything to do with the one-on-one between a patient and a doctor. They don't change directions. They can't admit when they're wrong. And that's the requisite of good medical practice. Beyond that, they're no longer in the business of saving lives. And so I mean, I had- It's not their job. I mean, they're job. And that was my job to save that person's life. Doctors are scared to do that. If it's my elation. They're scared to say anything because they're gonna lose their job. And they're afraid of the mob. And they're afraid of social media. And they're afraid of saying, you know, let's talk about these alternative practices. Let's talk about vitamin D. Let's talk about it. I am in YouTube jail. I just got out. For somebody mentioning I have remectin on my, I do a daily streaming show called Those of Dr. Drew, it's at Dr. Drew.com. You can find all that there. But I got put in, I got for somebody else saying, we gotta think about these things. We know there's some data out there. And let's talk about it. Boom, YouTube jail. Yeah, I really realized what was going wrong with doctors and nurses when they became terrified to do their jobs just to save lives. And I, during lockdowns had to go to, I have an actual asthma clinic, because I have asthma. And I was having an asthma attack. And it was, you know, pretty bad. So I went to the asthma clinic where they administer a nebulizer on the spot. And you better find, get into there. And he says, he can't give me the nebulizer in the room because the CDC says I'm not allowed to breathe in the room. I'm like, this is an asthma clinic. This is where the breathing takes place. And he said he couldn't do it. Ended up calling the paramedics to give me a nebulizer. That's crazy. In, outside of the asthma clinic. And then it was just, and I went, wow. So you were willing to let me, because obviously you know, an asthma attack, it's life or death, right? Yeah. You were willing to let somebody die on the ground because you were afraid that your medical license would be revoked if you had administered a life saving treatment to someone who was suffering from asthma and not COVID. I've never seen anything like this in my talkery. It's stunning what happened to my profession. We're scared. They got scared. They're afraid to do anything. Sending people home with an oxygen monitor. And no treatment and no, I mean, that's unbelievable that we did that as a profession. And then waited for the CDC to tell us what to do. That is seeding our responsibility to bureaucrats. And wonder, those numbers will never seem. How many people actually died in a scenario like that? Why did the paramedics, you have to come? Because the doctor that's in front of you with the medicine won't do it because of a CDC guideline. By the way, I had terrible COVID. I was sick for months. Monoclonal antibodies kept me out of the hospital. They're free. They're able to infuse you in your home if you meet the criteria. And the public health should be educating people about how do you tell them medicine, how to stay out of the hospital? That should be their job. Not invoke panic and fear and isolate where you are. God forbid you have contact with another human. Nothing is more unhealthy back to your psychology sort of preoccupation. Nothing is worth for human beings in isolation. We are social animal. It's the worst thing to do. And we are bearing down on the consequences now. We will get right back to the show in just one second. But first. All right, guys, in the age of technology, blue light glasses are a must. Blue light damages our eyes and can lead to blurred vision headaches and dry watery eyes. Blue blocks was created to fix this problem and block out the damaging blue light with high quality lenses. Unlike other types of blue light glasses, blue blocks are evidence-based and made under optics laboratory conditions in Australia. The founders were unhappy with the quality and lack of science behind leading blue light blocking glasses brands. Blue blocks was created to change this with high quality lenses for daytime, nighttime, and for color therapy, all in line with a suggested peer-reviewed academic literature. They have over 40 stylish frames for every need, prescription, non-prescription, and readers. Blue blocks is also giving back in partnership with restoring vision. For each pair of blue blocks glasses purchase, they will donate a pair of reading glasses to somebody in need. So go to blueblocks.com slash Candace and use coupon code Candace to save 15% off.

I don't want to be, I love my profession, I love my peers, but man, this has been an experience that we need to really do a post-moronemone because our behavior, sending people home essentially to die, and then when they're in extramos, bringing them to the hospital, that is disgusting. That's a mess. Yeah, and it's scary that experience at the hospital, even recently, I had to bring my, and fortunately, it ended up being nothing, but I had to bring my son to the hospital, and before they want to treat, and I'm thinking if he had actually been accidentally poisoned, they want you to first go here, first, Mitch, and come like, this is life savings. Your job at a hospital is to save a life. And now, all you're thinking is, I don't want people to get COVID, even though 99% of you will be fine if you get it, so I'm willing to let an infant die, I'm willing to let its mother die of an asthma attack, because all that matters is that we don't spread COVID. It is such backwards thinking in terms of doctors who take a Hippocratic oath. It's not a risk-reward analysis. Yeah. I've always been doing risk-reward analysis. Listen, Kathy Griffin just announced that she has lung cancer, and I hope you heard this. I didn't. And it was a reminder to me that, thank God she was getting proper care. I mean, she's had a stage one, she's probably gonna be okay, but she was getting proper screening. Think of all the people who haven't been getting screening. Right? I mean, there are other things out there than COVID. COVID's a mess. It's brutal. I went through it. It's brutal. Don't get me wrong. I'm not being denial about it. And I've been vaccinated as well as head COVID. And so I believe that we should get the FDA to fully approve the vaccine. I think Nova vaccine needs to be rolled out. And I think a lot of people that have misgivings about the vaccines will then kind of move forward, and they should be transparent about the data. The reason you don't get the vaccine, I bet, is because you don't know who to trust. Because they won't allow an honest debate. That's it. It's exactly right. Yeah. And so we don't know who to trust. Right. When I talk to people about it, they're like, I don't know, I don't know. Maybe I'll trust you, I mean, me. I'm like, look, let's get the data. Let's get the full approval. Let's get Nova vaccine. And then you'll feel more comfortable with it. Or people said, you know what? If there was an honest dialogue, what they've downplayed it for months and months and months, and then they come out with the truth six months later. Correct. And that's problematic. If you're not being honest, there are side effects to everything. You say there are no side effects to the vaccine. You're asking me to be an idiot. There are side effects to Tylenol. Look, we need. I mean, no matter what you take, and they're good drugs, it should take if you have an infection. But you cannot tell people that this is perfect. We finally have perfected it. It's perfect, just get it, get it, get it, you know? Yes. I was raised by a family practitioner, and he always said, medicines are bad. Medicines are dangerous. Only when the abs we have to take, I remember I took my first antibiotic when I was like 14. And he was like, all right, here we go. You know, it's like, this was a big moment to take an antibiotic. Here's the deal. We're just physicians. Can I swear on the show a little bit? You can swear on the show a lot of it. We do bad shit to people to prevent worse shit. That's what we do. And to prevent the bad, do not be honest about the risk. Our first ethical responsibility is to give you informed consent to tell you all the data. And if we don't have access to all the data, we gotta tell you that. And right now I'm a little unsure about all the data. So I can't fully reassure you yet. Also, unnecessary medical procedures. That's a massive ethical violation. I had COVID, did I really need the vaccine? That's how I was just gonna ask you. And this is kind of the biggest question. First, I told us everybody's getting it. These numbers, look at the infection rates. They're crazy. By those infection rates, you would think everybody's had it by now, right? The way that they were climbing every single day. What is the argument for somebody who has had COVID to get the vaccine? They refuse to have this conversation. Yes. The argument is I had to go through Germany to get to Greece. I had to have the vaccine. Okay. And so that was it. They would not take my antibody profile, which was enormous. I was fully fine in terms of my broad immunity. I did it because I was coerced. All right. And that's the problem is that there's too much. And so I'm fine. I took it whatever had a bad reaction and whatever. You know what I mean? But if you were my patient and I'm trying to get you to take it, it's harder for me to make you do it. Because I don't. I don't. I'm healthy. I'm young. Well, it's an echo. I've got studies. There's no studies out right now regarding pregnant women. How it's gonna impact her. So they can't possibly know it. There can't be a study. And there are, there are, but maybe not to your satisfaction. Yeah. And it's like, I'm just, I'm happy to wait. I feel, I trust my immune system. Careful. It's brutal. It's something problematic. You don't want to trust me. Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm, listen. But I'm older. I had a, I'm older and a risk category. My husband had it. I was nine months pregnant, traveling the world during lockdown. My husband had it for him. For some people, it might be brutal for him. It was nothing. You know, he did lose his taste. He was sweating and I literally slept in the bed next to him every single night. He had it being like, yes, I'm gonna get it. Didn't end up getting it, which then defied their whole six feet. Social, I was like, well, that doesn't make sense because how did I not have this? There's something you're missing. You've now said social distancing. Don't breathe next people. Don't touch surfaces. And now I have this experience in my home and you're saying, your experience didn't happen. I'm going, okay. Again, not an honest conversation. Correct. And that's their biggest mistake. They believe, it seems like the, the powers that be out there believe that if they are honest, you somehow will be less persuaded and less likely to do the things they want you to do. But this resistant group right now clearly will be more compliant if you give them the data. And by the way, don't kind of, we've known about public health messaging forever. And it's not about giving answers from on high in a box, right? Me in a box going, you gotta do this. No, get a narrative out there. Tell stories, use a little humor. Let people arrive at their own conclusion, but show them what, didn't you say you interviewed a teen mom here? Yeah. Teen mom is that. I knew that would work that way. Just listen to their stories and you won't want to do this. And it worked. It worked. Yeah. This teen pregnancy started declining. Tell the truth. Teen pregnancy started declining the very quarter that that show started. I watched it and you are so right. When you watch that, it was, it was really brilliantly done because you realize this is not some fairy tale, you're, he's not going to stay with you because you had the baby and it actually just tell the truth. And people will then be more inclined to do whatever it is you're trying to get them to do. And the exact opposite effect occurs when you're being dishonest. At least with the group that becomes resistant. I want the information. Yeah. I want to stick on Teen mom because you are correct. Yes. And I want to show how to great conversation with her. You know, she's definitely made some changes in her life. We asked her about you. She was complimentary. She said she had a good experience with you. You're lucky you're all. She'd be in the hot seat right now. But I did. No, I love Janelle. I love Janelle. Janelle really struggled. There was a lot of stuff that she went through that the show did not show appropriately. Yeah. And by the way, helped fund and helped to refer and she got a lot of treatment along the way. She was very honest. She talked about, yeah, that the, you know, the addiction and there were times where she was nodding off on set and social media is creating a different kind of disorder. I feel so blessed that there was no social media. I was at the end of high school when Facebook came out, you know, and it was like, not what it is today. You weren't living every single moment on Facebook and Twitter came out either right before or at the same time. And I feel so grateful that I got to just be a child. And I look at these girls now and they're getting plastic surgery when they're 13 years old, getting lip injections when they're 13. And I feel so sad for them because it's just not what you should be thinking about. I had braces, you know, an underbite running around outside. I've got scraped knees from constantly bashing my knee on this men. I got to be a child. Yes. And we're taking that away from Children Out with social media. Yes.

Now back to the show. You've mentioned a couple things to me and you were talking about something else too that I want to bring up which is narcissism. Narcissism is I watched the narcissistic turn happen in this country and certainly if you are defining yourself by what other people are saying and seeing it's a very empty inside and humans can be very happy with what they have until they have to compare it against somebody else and then unhappiness starts to go up. So this is baked into this situation. The other thing you'd mention is also pornography too. I mean they are being exposed to pornography at 9 to 11 and we don't know the full impact of that. We have no idea what this is going to do yet but it's not going to be good. It's certainly not something we welcome. Yeah my kids just not going to have social media. Listen you know all the at home schooling with the there was data collected on that and the increase in porn exposure and sexing went through the roof when kids had their iPads in front of them for their home schooling. That's what they were doing while the teacher was talking to them. That data is out there and it is scary when you really look at it. And you mentioned Simone Biles and I actually want to get to her and kind of talk about that because there is also a phenomenon that's happening because of social media which is and this is actually more appropriate discussion with Naomi Osaka. I actually think that they were kind of thrown into the same boat and they're different but everyone wants to be a hero. Everyone wants to be a champion of a cause on social media which to me again I'm not a doctor but I should be one. Falls under the same sort of umbrella of narcissism or it's like actually I don't need to hear your opinion about this but you feel so compelled to give it. And you have Naomi Osaka who hit the tennis and she's wearing black lives matters. Everything she says is about black lives matter. She is expected to give a press conference. Actually I'm not giving a press conference with the fact that even one press conference is a form of oppression and I shouldn't have to do this. And it's like what are you doing? Why does everyone want to be a champion of a cause? What was your take on Naomi Osaka and Simone Biles should I think are kind of different? I mean I have very few nuanced feelings about both of them. Naomi I felt like take care of your mental health that's fine but you signed a contract. Contracts exist. You know one side doesn't just get to go sorry it's not my thing. I mean it's sort of I feel like people have lost track of things like that and frankly I don't want to get too grandiose here but it goes all the way down to how the states are functioning together. We are supposed to be a more perfect union of states. Not a bunch of individual states doing whatever the hell they want. They are supposed to be a union of states. And the same thing with Simone Biles I thought good she's taking care of mental health. Takes a lot of courage to do that. I feel bad for her. I think she's doing the right thing. I think though she's going to get so much heat in social media it's going to be just heart breaking to see what she has to withstand. She's done a lot. She's proved herself. I think they're very different things. Yeah yeah they're different. Naomi to me in my opinion it was just so bratty you know like to yell at us because you have to do something and there's also the irony of like women can do anything men can do but it always seems to be a woman that's dropping out and making a scene about something and saying why should I even be required to give a press conference we're already under so much pressure. You're not required to be a tennis star. You could just go teach tennis lessons. And then you make it to know if there's something wrong with us because these people that are sponsoring you use these clips to make money you signed a contract. That's the problem. You shouldn't have negotiated that earlier. When you agreed it's a contract. A contract is a card. You don't get to just sort of. Taylor Swift also notoriously. And again they keep hiding behind these big things like feminism and Taylor Swift when she was she was young granted when she signed a contract probably her parents may sign that contract were maybe betting against her with big machine records and and and forgetting the guy who runs that label but then one day she wants to decide that she wants to own her music and she doesn't own music and she realizes it and she goes and a tear against the execs at big machine records and she basically says you know I was being manipulated when I was young all the stuff and I'm like going hold on hold on in case you guys don't know if Taylor Swift wasn't just famous she was only going to be incredibly rich and wealthy her family is very connected but it's way for them to get out of their responsibilities to shirk their responsibilities and say you know what feminism says that these big bad men are making me do this and I don't want to do it and I think that is so weak. Yeah it's it's weak because it's not well you this is sort of been a theme for the show today it's not steeped in reality. We have moved off reality truth is sort of doesn't exist no truth exists reality exists and you know one of the things about mental health is accepting reality on reality's terms right and reality has a way of asserting itself and if you you know keep assuming that things aren't real in your discussion about I don't want to get deeply into this but one of the things that worries me about some of the conversations about transgender identities is you know one of the goals of maturation is develop a solid firm cohesive identity not one that's shifting around so I don't really objection on people having identity whatever they want it's all fine but this idea that you can shift wherever you want whenever you want that doesn't smack of health to me I think you need a cohesive stable identity however you might conceive of it you don't care let them conceive however they wish but I to pretend that it's it's real and healthy in certain settings the reality has a way of asserting itself and it reality will come back reality will will assert itself and it comes back in the worst way you know I sat down with the man his name is Walt Heyer and formerly trans as in he went through with the full procedure and to become a woman and then woke up one day and realized he made a terrible mistake and you don't really get to go back and he now we fortunately runs a charity and to address that issue because so many people are going through it but again that's my profession that's my profession again some I've talked to many many transgender patients who had the right treatment the right time and they're great and I've seen ones like this gentleman that were didn't turn out so that's my profession's problem finding the right treatment for the right patient with the right condition we don't get that right gonna end up with with things like this where people are extremely unhappy right I want to get to this clip it's actually a clip of you ten years ago discussing Britney Spears condition on extra the whole world watch this Britney Spears spun out of control Britney had severe mental illness I thought she was gonna die Britney's only alive because of the actions of her parents and never imagined that the parents would do what they needed to do that way it's unusual I was spot on yeah you have a different opinion oh maybe no no it's actually the same opinion for that time for that moment is that is that you she was on a 14 day hold in a psychiatric hospital that's a status you have to actually appeal to a judge to get the 14 day hold that's the sickest of the sick psychiatric patients then she was put on a tough conservatorship and parents rarely step up and take those conservatorships because they're fearful of disrupting their relationship those kids when they don't do it they die kids die so I've seen that more times than I can count it's rare that a family member steps up takes the conservatorship and that saves somebody's life that psychiatrist and that father did an amazing job in the judge that issue the conservatorship now that was then she does well for ten years she's entitled to try some time outside the conservatorship you're entitled you have a right to destroy your life that's you want to do and they have so many safe stop gaps they can put in place you know she has to follow up with her treatment she has to check in they have to get letters to the court to make sure the court doesn't occur any liability they're going to want to do that but the fact that they're not going to that is a hint that things are not good for her psychiatric there may be neurological stuff we don't know all the stuff she's saying about her father is it real who knows I mean there's something wrong going right now because she should be able to get out of the conservatorship if things were going okay yeah and to me you know I watched a clip of her went loosely through her Instagram page and I watched a clip from a while back before she came out and said that she's in abusive conservatorship where she was answering questions and somebody said what's your dream car and she was like my dream car would be a Tesla I've never had one or maybe should a BMW I'm sitting here thinking you're worth 60 million dollars how would you make your dream a reality and this is once I understood and they kind of detailed what our conservatorship has looked like they haven't given her any freedom I think the worst part is the blackmail of if you don't do this you won't see your kids like that's that's doing something under duress in terms of making her perform she's either to me she's so crazy and diluted that she can't go on tour right yeah or she's got some capacities and like you said she should be given a trial when outside of it and then my last question is you're saying Britney Spears is too crazy to live her life we literally have people walking around society that think they're men and women and they're like a man who thinks he's a grown woman I'm not gonna go there what I'm gonna tell you is I know I'm gonna tell you we let people die on the streets you know who are delusional right you have a right to be crazy is the question well we certainly leave that right to a hundred thousand the Los Angeles are out on the street dying right now why not give Britney a little change right I mean seriously if somebody suffered from gender's warfare I don't want them locked down to not be able to live their lives I think there are tons of people walking around with various psychological issues whether it's bipolar disorder I don't think that that means that every facet of your life could be controlled unless you are a danger to others right if she was like every time we let her out she tries to kill so you know then that's a good thing you start to lock it down again but how what country we living in guys it's sort of weird right it really kind of bothers me too because we need more conservatorship for all those people on the streets yeah we need to be able to access the service for those folks and this is not a good look for conservatorships yeah I totally agree with you and I think they should be explored more thoroughly yeah we will get right back to the show in just one second but first are you like me a small business owner then I'm willing to bet that you did not start your business because you

show you have a new book coming out I do and I heard you talking about consent earlier it's from my daughter and I wrote this book on consent and it's very woke book it's very woke you'll love it it's well my daughter super woke there it is it's called it doesn't have to be awkward by Dr. Drew and Paulina Pinsky what's it about it's about it started the book about consent but so my here's the real story my daughter has a preoccupation with Elvis Presley she did since she was a little little girl and she has a TCB tattoo and a TCB necklace and we started thinking about using TCB as an acronym for something with that trust compassion boundaries we can use that as a sort of a structured understand relationships and consent so we're just talking about how to approach relationships in a healthy way and a respectful way with boundaries and then how then to think about consent in that context yeah I mean that doesn't sound too woke it maybe to work for you I don't know it's like my daughter's very woke and I'm very moderate and I'm coming along for the ride to see what I can learn it's really designed for parents and their sort of mid-teen age kids and who seem very confused about things so we're trying to address everything we possibly can yeah well I think the only thing that my opinion is in terms of relationships again I don't know what this book specifically explores but we are seeing a backlash from women against the I guess conclusions of the Me Too movement which is people women that are going men now won't ask us on dates men now won't say anything because men are terrified because they're like can I can I hit on you can I say to you like do you want to go on a date or are you going to be like oh my gosh you tried it on me and he's a pervert we've made things that were really normal between the sexes a form of perversion and it is actually really in my opinion really harmed productive relationships 100% and we actually put a bunch of scenarios in there to try to address exactly this to try to give you a little kind of a script and a structure and a back and forth so you don't have to feel quite so scared of this but it's not it's not been good for relationship I completely agree with you look we see you know what happened to this is a kind of interesting story when back when I was still doing a love line we would get frequently get calls from these men that would go I am Sam I'm 24 and you know I met the one I met the one and you know she was 22 I was 22 and she wasn't really interested then so I became her friend and I've been waxing her car every weekend and cleaning her carpet and now it's three years later and now it's time you get this chill like time for what he's been that is simple stalking that is stalking me they no mistake about all of you have their your 20s that have that great friend out there just be careful they're they're they're waiting for this time and it's like because they don't have no skill with dating and asking and breaking and forming relationships and they really get obsessed and they cling and then they that's stalking yeah that's what that is I would say not healthy not to speak on behalf of all women I can tell you the majority of women do not like to see men walking around with their tail in between their legs or there there is a bio a biological component to that you know women do want men to stand up tall even the ones that are demanding it don't like it okay okay I always have a game we have to play a game we have to play a game where this game is called snap diagnosis with dr. Drew I'm gonna show you a clip of not actually rendering diagnoses we're clear about that this is called no it's real whatever he says it's real right okay I'm playing along exactly to tell us what is going on with the individual in the clip we will start with our loving vice president Kamala Harris how do you how do you define what you hear well full disclosure I kind of like that but but but be that was my it's defense that's defensive strategy to knock you off the track right kind of thing and buy yourself a little time little time will defense maybe a little more self-awareness you understand how that appears and looks and so people like you might put it on TV later okay this one we might need you to interpret perhaps but I think it deserves a diagnosis let's go cardi b I love cardi b for the record everything about her I love I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with her and I wouldn't want to be her yeah because I'm there's a lot of chaos and she is funny I totally agree she was a pre like this phase like I used to watch her on love and hip-hop she's actually very funny she's very much you would pull stuff out there was like really insightful and honest but she wasn't aware of why it was insightful or honest but like she would say things you'd be like yes yes you're almost there and she'd be like okay never mind we lost her we lost her again okay maybe she's take a bird calling bird calling that is the diagnosed a snap diagnosed a way of a career of vocational rehab vocational rehab okay this next one I will I will preempt it by saying this individual was not at the event in which they are talking about so this is AOC regarding the January 6 capital riots that she was not at let's show that clip many of us nearly and narrowly escaped death so by the way just to add to that she also famously tweeted that Ted Cruz almost killed her and neither he nor she yeah was present but she has been going with this narrative that she almost she talked about how she was afraid that she'd never have children and just so you know her and I were about equidistant from the action I lived in DC at this time I was nine months pregnant I feel like if this is would you afraid AOC was gonna kill you no I feel like I should have a right a right to say it but this is an interesting true psychological phenomenon to me it is and I don't think she is alone I mentioned it a few minutes ago there's been a histrionic turn that is history you know read about histrionic personality disorder you will see the traits of histrionic you'll recognize them everywhere it is it's a narcissistic disorder so there's a lot of emptiness inside a lot of emotional dysregulation lack of empathy but there's blowing in the wind and extreme ideas hysterical ideas nearly delusional quality to the ideas and that when they get into that delusional thinking they really believe it they really do believe it and I think people need to calm down let's hope this is a temporary state and we can just return to straight up narcissism right because that's what we've been for the last 30 years please so I think for the last one we have to show and get a diagnosis for me interacting with my co-workers at the Daily Wire here we go so a little unregulated aggression maybe hypomanic but but but healthy expression of that of those feelings yeah I'm okay with that diagnosis you know what I would say a lot of successful people are hypomanigos thank you know what I was really doing was being mystique from X-Men and I'm shocked you didn't get that I was clearly being mystique from X-Men and none of my co-workers knew who mystique was so I showed them so so I'm not sure the thinking you're actually a superhero is gonna cause me to think differently of the diagnosis but I might be I might have some more concerns let's say but I'll take that explanation I'll try to get back to just narcissist yes yes we all were all familiar with that now we're used to it well guys that is all that we have thank you so much for always speaking the truth to Dr. Drew Princeki even when it is difficult you guys Dr. Drew"
