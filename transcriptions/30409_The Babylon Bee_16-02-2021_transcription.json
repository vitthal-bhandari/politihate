What do you think about feminism? Do you like it? Taking you to the cutting edge of truth. Yeah, well Last Jedi is one of the worst movies ever made and it was very clear that Ryan Johnson doesn't like Star Wars. Kyle pulls no punches. I want to ask Kyle how you're able to sleep at night. Ethan brings bone-shattering common sense from the top rope. You find me? How double dare you? This is the Babylon B interview show. Hello everybody. Welcome to the Babylon B interview show. This is our first one that we're recording when we're back from Christmas break. So we're having a lot of fun here. Oh yeah. High energy. Super high energy. Today we're talking to Spencer Clavin. Yeah, son of Andrew Clavin, but that's not his first title. That's just, you know, yeah. That would be at the very end of all of his titles. Undergrad at Yale, classics and classical language, grad of Oxford, Doctor of Philosophy, Sang Kwire in Oxford, a host of Young Heretics podcast. He wrote a book called Music in Ancient Greece, Melody Rhythm and Life made into a film starring John Travolta. They changed a lot of stuff. Greece. Greece. How do you use the joke in the interview? You use it in the notes so I accidentally started saying it. Anyway, this guy's a really smart guy. He knows a lot about classic literature and western civilization and he has a lot of deep thoughts about gremlins and die hard and stuff. Yeah, and interestingly, he's a, where we decide was the right term, he's an out of the closet, Christian. And so yeah, our more sensitive listeners might be upset. So deal with it. Just snap my fingers. I can't do that. I'm too white. That was very gay. Okay, we are moving on to the interview. So welcome Spencer. Here he comes. Hello everybody. Welcome to the Babylon B Interview Show. I'm Kyle. I'm Ethan. This is my buddy Ethan. Today we are joined by our favorite clavin. Hey, wow. That's the first time I've ever been introduced as clavin major. I'm usually clavin minor. Well, we did interview clavin major. Oh, you did? Yeah. Okay. So I'm all ready to get him first. So that's, thanks. I know now that that's why I'm already your favorite clavin right? Because we talk. Because we did talk to him. We're not impressed. I'm incredibly disappointed. And I'm a blank slate, really. I can only go down from here. I can only disappoint. Well, we talked to him about Hollywood screenwriting. Oh, and we were talking about what we were trying to get him to like rewrite reboots of Graham Lynn's and reboot ideas and I don't know if he got what we were trying to do. He didn't pick up what you were putting down. He didn't pick. It's funny. That's all we ever talk about. My dad and I, when we hang out, we just talk about rewrites of Graham Lynn. So I don't know why it must have been an off day for him or something. That's one movie. I don't know why they don't reboot more. Graham Lynn? Yeah, it's great. I love Graham Lynn's. That's why they don't reboot it. Don't give them any idea. I don't want them to be a straw throw that out there. Now you're going to get some like feminist remake of Graham Lynn's. It's so simple. It's just much a little puppets. Yeah, but they would be CGI. You really are. You're just really in a spait. You're just putting this out there for some like woke. Well, I'm not saying I want it as much as like if I'm thinking like a Hollywood executive. Why don't? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's got to be something there. Some behind the scenes. CGI all voiced by Leah Dunham. It's because the original Graham Lynn. They're all female. They're all female gremlins. It's because the original Graham Lynn Actors in rehab now, they don't want to dredge up that non-scrap. I know. It's a problem. Some scenes are called their die. All the Graham Lynn's already. Yeah, they're all the getting over their water habit. They're like they're having it. And it is absolutely a Christmas movie. I watched it and I was like, oh wait, no, this is like absolutely a Christmas movie. People actually take place to act Christmas. Well, I mean, Christmas is all over. There's Christmas songs like the Graham Lynn is a Christmas gift. I mean, the whole thing. We were trying to get into this. Santa Claus is covered in gremlins. We were trying to get into it in our Christmas special of what is the ontological definition of a Christmas movie. I'm saying, because these in philosophy and stuff might be able to help us. I think there's a difference between setting and theme. And so that's where it gets mixed up a little bit like just because the setting is Christmas doesn't mean. Right. So I have. But in any other holiday, if it's Halloween, is the setting, it would be a Halloween movie. So I have been pursuing a related question. I think an analogous philosophical inquiry, which is if one grows a beard during the pandemic, like during lockdown, but not because it's lockdown, is that a pandemic beard? Or is that just a beard that you have? Because like, I'm going to keep this beard, I think, for the foreseeable future. But I don't want it to be like, oh, he just is just cope. Like he's just doing it. And so the ontological question is profound because like you want like versus just kind of mere semiotics versus just like this is a word that we apply. And like, I feel, I kind of feel that the roots of human motivation are so thorny. And like, our positive motivations are negative motivations are so intimately intertwined. And every individual choice that we make that like the we don't have the epistemological standing to make the claim like this is or is not a pandemic beard. Like it's just a beard. It's from the pandemic. We leave it at that. So so this is a movie with like many Christmas themes, but also many other themes. And like, how can we pick apart, right? The intimately entangled motivation, right? It's integral. It's integral. Yeah. In some way. And what's a movie that's an absolute Christmas movie would be. But I guess with like, Dinehart, could you take Christmas and just swap it out for Halloween? Like they have a Halloween party. Right. And would that be? Or would that take something away? It changes wife's name to like cobwebs or something because her name is Halloween. Okay. So now that we're, well, this is like, now the relevant question is like, is this fat? Is like essence versus accident, right? Like, so is Christmas an essential element of Halloween? Or is it accidental? Like the color of a man's hair is not thought to be essential to his being a man. That's an accident. Whereas his being a reasoning being is thought to be essential somehow to what to what he is. So Crazippus, the stoic philosopher would potentially have suggested or some later stoic to my suggested that there is no such thing as essence in this regard, like all characteristics, if removed, fundamentally alter the item in question. And I kind of, I feel in this, in this dimension, that's true, right? Like it may not be the case that Dinehart is about Christmas, but you couldn't take Christmas out without altering like the essence, something about the field, the tone. Right, exactly. Yeah, but like, and you can't know if you would have grown that beard if there wasn't a pen, no, I can't. I can't know if I would say that, but you don't. Yes, there is no counterfactual really to like compare that with. Fascinating. So I'm going the hard issues here on the Bevall and Bev. So our very best guests can take a really stupid question. To do a good answer. And so yeah, you pass. I will, I will know in passing, by the way, before we move on to this topic that Aristotle would have like severely disagreed with Crazippus, like certain elements of a thing. That's where this like, you know, to like it. Are you saying Crazippus? Crazippus. Crazippus. Crazippus. Crazippus. Yeah. Crazippus. No, I know. I know that crackle and Crazippus. Yeah. I know who that is, this Kyle served. Not wishing to reveal his knowledge of stoic philosophy. Why did you say that was such like, sort of like looking over your shoulder like, you know, guys? I don't know. I have an impression to make to you, my brothers. I don't know. We have you're asking the question. Who's asking the question? Where do we ask the questions? Yeah, very well. You're an undergratit Yale doctor in philosophy at Oxford. So are you doctor? We call you doctor? You can actually, what you mean, call me is Dr. Jill Biden. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, I am. I'm a D Phil, which is technically, I guess, the like, D. Friddish. Yeah, doctor of philosophy. But that sounds like a nickname for Dr. Phil. And he's still what up, D Phil? Hey, D Phil. How you doing my man? But I will say that I'm not actually my D. Phil is actually not in philosophy. It's in classics, which is Greek and Latin, language and literature and some philosophy. I studied ancient Greek music just to really be as obscure as I possibly could. That's the goal really with the P.A.D. Yes. As useless as possible. That sounds the John Travolta movie with the musical? Correct. Yes. Which is like way back before the musical even existed. Yeah. Like, I heard that movie. It's that Greece is based on ancient Greece, but it's... It's true. They changed a bunch. Right. Right. But the leather jacket is really good. You talk about essence and accident. The leather jacket is the essence of that. Yeah. Whole. So yeah. But this is of course a whole subject in classics. It's like the field of what constitutes the movie Greece and how... No, this is not actually the... I never saw Greece. Really? Really? My wife makes me watch it often. And Greece too also. You're kidding. Which is... Have you ever seen Greece too? No. It's horrible. Like Greece is painful just as you know, you don't really like that kind of musical or whatever. And Greece too is just horrible. It's like a shelf library. All different characters and random. Hmm. I was in the stage version of Greece in high school. Oh, nice. I played... I don't know. Like this shows you what a formative moment it was for me. I can't remember the name of the character that I played. But I played the guy that sings... Greece Lightning who is not John Dravolta in the movie. But it's like a random person. Yeah. Yeah. I know who he is. That dude. So it says here that you sang in choir at Oxford? I did. Yes. And at Yale as well. So could we like dim the lights and could you sing bridge over troubled water into the mic? Okay. Another philosophical distinction is that between could and should. Right. And so... Can you do like a full set of... Can I... Can one... Can like... Is it possible from everybody can do a full set of? Well, yeah. And like a nice crystal lee one. Like a nice pretty one. It steals your heart. It's really... It's not for me to say like the quality of my full set of I feel. But I can do a full set of... Well, all the good... What I actually am is a bass, right? So I'm the lowest voice part. Oh, okay. And like Oak Ridge Boys. Yeah. Exactly. I'm a bass two. If you have eight parts, you have bass two, bass one, baritone, volum. Or I guess bass one actually is baritone, the tenor one tenor two. And then either you have like lady parts or you have... Or you... Which are soprano and alto. For anybody that is confused about what I mean when I say lady parts. I mean soprano one soprano two. I'll tell you what I mean. How do you... You've got lady parts. How do we get something in this part? I can't remember. Yeah. So the... But or you have... You're the thing that am boys choirs, or boys sing that part, or you have guys, basses usually. Basses have... Do have the best falsettoes. And then you have basses who are trained to sing. It's like elaborate. And if you go on YouTube, you can find what they used to do instead, was just to cut people's testes off. They didn't accomplish this task. Rather than, you know, having women sing, which seems like a simpler solution for me. But... But yeah, you can go on YouTube and find the last living castrado does have a record. There's a recording of his voice. So rather than dimming lights and having me sing, I thought I was gonna go look like... So like, legitimately makes them sing higher when you remove the... Yeah, because if you do it... Especially if you do it like a... The testy band? Like... Like what the test... The band is... Yeah, it's kind of like how they used to cut out people's stomach, but now they just put a band on there. Oh, the band? I was like, I thought you meant the band. Like you meant the band. Oh, yeah, the testy band. Yeah, exactly. I thought that would be a good metal band named Testa Kill. Does this come from your... You guys have that guy on you talk to him about how bowls at Rodeo's. Yeah. They have the band on their testys. Yeah, the... I... No. I don't... I don't... I don't think so. Yeah. Yeah. I want to test out your bass singing voice real quick with this test, right? Yeah. Yeah, I can eat you back. Don't talk back. Not bad. Okay. You better... You just gotta nod that. I gotta nod that. Just give him a nod that. Don't go... Oh, you just have to go... Yeah, I don't really love voice. Don't talk back. Yeah. It's gotta be lower than that. How about that? I don't... Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. That's pretty good. That better. All right. This is all I did in college. This is just like how... Sing this, not on the piano. Sing this, no. This is your alarm. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You just go down. Can you do that thing where like, you know what note you're singing without a piano? No. Perfect pitch. I did not have that. I've always been very envious of it. If you sing, you can kind of like, get into a headspace where like, you know you listen to one song over and over and over and really into the song. And then you can kind of know where it starts, but it always goes away. Like, people say you can train it. I feel this is wrong. This is like people who can paint or draw. They're always like, you absolutely, you know, it's easy. You can learn. It's like, first of all, how would you know? Because you obviously have this innate gift that makes you feel it's easy to learn. And people who have perpipit are like this too often. Like, oh, you can train. You can train a perfect pitch. But no, I do not have it. It's a gift given to them. I'm going to draw some kind of figure out if I have fit into your category. Do you feel? Oh, good. Well, do you feel like do you go around telling people if you study enough in practice? The hard thing I think is that, because what is talent, right? Like, what really is it? Oh, you got, you know, the smart questions. Yeah. Right. Because I mean, I read this book. I can't remember the name of it, but it was about what is talent, you know. Yeah. I think it was called talent is overrated, actually. It looked at a lot of people we consider insanely talented people. Right. And a lot of them had a parent or close adult figure who was training them from a very young age. Yeah. And when I look at what talent was in my life, it was a fascination for sure. A drive to just draw like crazy from the earliest days I can remember. So during very formative years, I was developing skills that people never thought of developing. Right. You know, it was like my, my when I am mom put me in preschool, the preschool teacher called her and said, your son's drawing and I ate your old level. He's three years old. He's drawing things that, yeah, I'm drawing fingers and facial features and things that like usually a kid isn't thinking about drawing yet. Right. And so I guess, I don't know, but it's because I'd drawn, you know, I had that. So what is it? Is it the desire and the, because in high school everybody drew like all my, I had all these really talented artists friends, and then some got their girlfriends pregnant, and then some were stoners and a lot of the drugs and like, so a lot of them could have been amazing artists. Okay. This actually is a really profound question. No, you're absolutely right. I'm fairly perfect. You'd like to have a three now. Yeah, that's true. And the person that I think is really, wonderful on this, because it also speaks to, you know, a long, standing philosophical question about free will, right? Like to what extent do we choose our actions and what would that even mean? Given what we know about the material world and how our brains are constructing all this stuff and then. Aristotle, the Greek philosopher, Aristotle. Yeah. I knew that. I knew that. It was like, I know about Aristotle. I know that. Yeah. And you know, has the sequence of text that goes from the Nick and McCain ethics just about like how to be good at being a human into politics. And the politics was obviously about how to form a community, a political community in a way that is conducive to the common good and so forth. And to me, kind of one of the neglected aspects of that sequence is the reason Aristotle puts it in that way. And he says something like this in the Nick and McCain ethics that like. The people who are trained in childhood to have certain inclinations. We all know that in childhood, right, we sort of our souls are shaped in certain ways. You come to, you know, even just something as simple as like, well, you were raised with a healthy diet. And so now you don't actually have this like taste for sugar, but you know, too much more from around than that, you sort of culturated into virtuous habits and discipline and things of that nature. And then those kids grow up and enter into political life and form institutions, which will then go back and do the forming of the new generation, right? It was fairly simple. I was raised, but it's this kind of Gordian not, because if you have a problem in that cycle anywhere, it's very hard to know where to go and try and fix that. So analogous and Aristotle analogizes this at one point to drunkards. He says that drunkards don't choose, drunk people don't choose their actions. So they're not contemptible because they do the thing that is idiotic or bad when they're drunk, but they chose to get drunk. Well, you may say they can't choose to get drunk if they're an alcoholic, but they chose the sort of course of actions that like encoded this alcoholism into their life. And it's a very thorny problem that we still grapple with today about, well, is this person good or bad because of innate gifts? Did they have certain advantages growing up and so forth? And there is a going, a philosophy going around, the town is overrated philosophy, which I think in some respects really goes back to Malcolm Gladwell, this guy who writes the 10,000, I think it's 10,000 hours, this book about, you know, you can actually, if you invest 10,000 hours, or I'm getting that number wrong, maybe, you know, this certain amount of, vast amount of time into a thing, you can become just world class at it. If it's basketball, if it's guitar playing, if it's languages, whatever. I feel, and Gladwell, I think has walked this back a little bit because of research that came out, post that book, like I feel this is deeply wrong, like it's vastly oversimplified, let's say, you know, and kind of an elaborate form of cope, like, you know, like the, the simple fact of the matter is that the talents are very unevenly distributed. And this is one of the things that we, I feel, can no longer countenance in our culture really at all, because it's this weird sort of metastasization or perversion of our true philosophical belief that all men are created equal, meaning that in the eyes of God they are, you know, they do not sort of, of greater or lesser value than one another. Therefore, in the eyes of the law, they should not be, right, all of these things which are true, as actually our old pal, uncle, ourself would have known, right, they have, they kind of ballooned out into this sort of desperate urgency to flatten out the natural, but like, obviously, I will never be the basketball player that a seven foot tall, like, kid is, you know, that seven to 12 in the age of 15 and has been, but of course also, you know, and this impresses itself upon me all the time is I am a writer, and so I live in this world where not only is your talent sort of the only thing that you have and your voice, right, the distinctiveness of your voice and the way that you present yourself and so forth, but it's also kind of subjective, in the sense not that it's arbitrary, right, which is a way that we overuse that word, but in the sense that it has purely to do with the way you're writing affects people and is therefore very, very difficult to prove, right, like, you're not a mathematician who can be like, yes, I have actually done proven this theorem made this advance, you're actually somebody that's trying to do something, feeling out this and coate thing in the world and whether or not you've succeeded is in some sense is even just up to posterity. At the same time, I know many, many writers who are much more talented than I am in the sense of, in the sense that you're saying, right, drawing at an eighth grade level from third grade on, but they don't wake up at five o'clock in the morning and pound out at their craft, you know, and so there's obviously, I mean, and then of course, discipline itself is like a certain form of talent that you may or may not, you know, be born with more or less of it, but I, you know, these things are very, very intimately tangled together in, as you indicate, profound way. Yeah, yeah, sure, I got it. I think it's probably true that in a lot of areas, you could spend 10,000 hours and become really, really good or something, but the difference is that the person who has grown and formed with that motivation and that talent that innate talent, whatever you want to call that is the person who's going to invest the 10,000 hours. Because you're saying, I don't know if that's what you were saying when you said it's a cope, but it's like me saying, well, I could be a really good violinist. I say, if I just spent 10,000 hours, yeah, I could do that. I don't want to. If you missed it being ingrained into your childhood, you probably missed the bus, at least on like, to some extent. There are some things especially that are like that, like ballet dancing, for example. And I've known people who, you know, either, and this is one of the most, you know, we live in a tragic, fallen world. And so this is one of the most heartbreaking versions of this. You know, either you meet somebody who feels called like their vocation that they're discerning is to ballet dancing and yet, as a whatever two year olds, they were not forced through like classes and being on point. And so therefore, it is simply the case that like their muscles have formed in such a way that they won't be able to do this thing. That's tragic. Also imagining like what would happen if Fred Astaire were born today is tragic, right? Because like tap dancing and that ballroom dancing is just not, you know, at the center of our culture in the way it wasn't, he was born and perhaps like some new Fred Astaire exists in like Oklahoma teaching a dance class to toddlers, right? Like that. So these things are very tragic. But then also you meet people who it's like, you know, they hate ballet dancing, but they were they did receive that training. And so now this is their life or at least a big part of it, you know, people who dance like for the Met or whatever will say this. No, it's very complicated. And it's it's wrapped up as you just sort of, I guess, suggested with with vocation, right? Because everybody goes through the process in life, I suppose, of prayer and thought and discernment or whatever you want to call it, in which you sort of say, well, what like, what am I shaped for? What's the whole into which I as a key and mentor, you know, or whatever, I'm a puzzle piece, where do I fit? And there's something there's something profoundly teleological about that, but there's also something accidental about your history and your life. And like, you know, we muddle along as best we can, but I sort of feel I feel that A there is something right now that you personally are very deeply called to be doing. And that like aligning yourself with that North Star is all the source of joy, really, especially actually in a man's life. I think this is made, you know, women may view this slightly differently, but for men, occupational alignment with that purpose is so urgently important. And at the same time, you know, because if we haven't infinitely forgiven God, like you miss certain boats, and you find that actually the, there's been some adjustment made for you and there's something else that you can do. It's very mysterious. Yeah, that was one thing that growing up I, because I look back and I know that like, I had the fascination with drawing, I was good at it. And then also, I think one thing that happened was we moved a lot. And it was my way of making friends, because that's my way of standing out, because you go to a new school, all these kids know each other and you're, you don't know them. Oh, yeah. So it's hard to stand out. So I always wonder if I was raised differently. Maybe I wouldn't be able to draw. I don't know. So all these things kind of come together. But anyway, I do reject the idea that you're just born with this ability. Just draw amazing. I don't think it doesn't work quite like that. No, that's right. But there is definitely like a thing in me that's just not in a lot of other people. Right. No, and this, like, it's, I think, important, actually, to hold on to that sort of thing, because as you indicate, right, with that story about moving around, like these things are also very intimately bound up with your identity, is it in Revelation that God gives everybody a stone with a name written that only God and the individual? No, I mean, again, I may be sort of, I'm pulling this out of my hat. So I may be getting this somewhat wrong with there is some secret between God and every, every saved person in Revelation. And it's nicely counterbalanced with the observation that Lewis makes. I think in the four loves, he talks about the fact that in Isaiah, in the vision of the temple, right, the angels are calling out to each other about God that that even in conversations such as this, or in friendships, groups of friends, you know, you don't just have Fred and Joe and Chris, you have like the part of Chris that Fred draws out. And so there is this way in which, you know, this kind of fractal line, this infinitely iterative way in which God's glory is sort of refracted through people in their relationships. At the same time ads, you want to preserve this thing that is kind of, and I was just thinking about this in the context of, you know, Twitter and even coronavirus, I feel that all of our personal choices have been made very public all of a sudden. You kind of want to guard these sort of features of your identity that you can't explain that you don't really have a good reason for why you're drawing. And yet, like they are central to you. You know, there's something very precious about that, I think. Have you ever done DMT? What is DMT? You don't know what DMT is? Nod. You do. Ayahuasca. Oh, why do you feel that that would be? Do you feel it? This would be just the job. Well, you just you DM. We're trying to be successful like Joe Rogan and he knows people that. So we just deal his question. Yeah. That's a Joe Rogan. Oh, interesting. You're just talking so deep you sound like you're on drugs. I'm sorry. No, we have to actually if you guys want to truly do the Joe Rogan, then we have to actually be smoking blood. It's true. Yeah. Yeah. Let's be scatter all over the table. We have cigars in that room. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I brought some cigars because I'm moving and you know, the experience of moving is like you get tapped out of the last handle of like scotch or whatever handle of vodka and you just have to pawn it off on people you have to like go or like guzzle, you know, like I'm using this is like gross, but I'm using all my beard wax. Like I'm just like every morning. It's like slather wax all over my beer. This is maybe TMI. I don't know if that's too much information. Never. Never. Okay. Good. So, um, should we take the Odyssey out of school curriculum? Oh my gosh. I was just looking up that story because I was like vaguely remembering that somebody said something stupid about the Odyssey and this has become my beat now whenever anybody says some some dumb nonsense about classics. Somebody tags me in it. Somebody like. Are you talking about adventures in Odyssey? Yeah. Yeah. Done. Yeah. Christian. The SpongeBob movie. Yeah. Sorry. Go ahead. And I think this is an Odyssey is the biblical. That was the yeah. Show. It was the Christian. It was like set tapes and VHS tapes of this. Right. These guys who were at some crazy professors now, something. I don't remember. I don't remember. It was a cartoon we grew up. So I'm I missed this all of this because I was not raised Christian. So I like veg details is totally new to me. I've been discovering veg details. I have a lot of thoughts about veg details, but that's from perhaps from the day. It's like, wait, but the Odyssey, we have to give that. Sorry, the Odyssey. Yeah. We're not adventures in Odyssey. Not. No, but the original. Yes. The original source material for the Odyssey. From the movie Greece. From the movie Greece. Everybody knows or maybe not everybody knows that the original source material for the Odyssey is actually the SpongeBob Squarepants movie. If you watch or many parallels. And also, O'Botherward though, these two great texts of Western civilization come together. Honestly, you'd rip off O'Botherward. Exactly. Yes, it's like the New Testament ripping off the Matrix. Correct. Exactly. Exactly like that. Yes. And not just the Matrix, of course. Yeah. All sorts of things. All sorts of movies. Yeah. Okay. So right. They in Massachusetts, was it that somebody was congratulating herself? The teacher was congratulating herself or having gotten home or something? Heather Levin. Yes. There she is. I'm very proud to say we got the Odyssey removed from the curriculum this year. Mwahaha. Yeah. That's right. I think that can be read as the Wicked Witch of the Wives. Oh my gosh. Well, that's great. Great joker-esque. Yeah. I mean, this is like pride in sucking information out of people's brains. Like the scooping people's brains out with a melon baller is now the point of pride among certain set of academics. And in some senses, this is kind of the whole premise behind like my own podcast. Was just basically somebody was like, you can plug it. You can plug it. Oh, okay. Yeah. My podcast is called Young Hair Text. And I will shame. I will shamelessly plug it because it's I genuinely come by it naturally. Somebody, so a couple of people were like, you should have a podcast. I was like, I don't know. Like everybody has a podcast. Even the Balambi guys have a podcast. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And like, what would I talk about? And then I was like, okay, so the point of having a podcast, right, is just to talk about the weird, like arcane, boring stuff that nobody wants to hear about. And they just like, it has to be there, has to be in the air. And then for me, that stuff genuinely is the great text of the Western canon, formerly conceived and sort of traditionally understood. Like I'm not really big on like, oh, actually, like, you know, this random thing you've never heard of as part of the Western canon. Like I'm talking about, you know, Homer is a good example, right? A foundational text of Western literature without reading which nobody can count himself, I think fully educated or even fully self aware. I mean, it's so written into, I joke about, oh, brother, Rata and about Spongebob Squarepants. But of course, like those things only exist folded into this vast fabric of illusion, you know, 2000 years worth of illusions, exactly to Homer to the Odyssey and the Iliad, these great epic poems. And so I just, you know, as you can tell, like we'll go off ranting on tangents about this for a long time and sort of, I thought, well, that will be my pocket. And Marcus will just be like, all these idiots who are saying like, we've got to cancel it. It's too racist. I mean, Yale, my alma mater in 2015, there was this big petition, like remove the white men from the English department, which the white men being like, you know, Shakespeare, Chaucer, Milton, like, you know, these big, big, again names, names without which you can't count yourself, I think to really have read English literature. And like, and so I just thought, you know, a lot of people are out here screaming about how that sucks. And it does suck is very easy to get very angry. You hear somebody gloating about kicking the Odyssey off the curriculum. Really, really easy to get oneself worked up into a culture war froth about it. But we spend so much time doing that so much time, like, arguing about Homer that we actually, there actually isn't a lot of content there. Like, let's just read Homer, right? Like, let's actually, which is actually a better, I think, a better approach, really, because the truth of the matter is that in all of these debates, like, our side, which I count our side is sort of like, the right or whatever you want to call it. We come from a place of strength, like, we always act as if we come from this place of defensiveness and weakness, like, oh, we have to fight back against these cruel people. It's like, no, no, no, like, we have, we are now essentially the party or the group of people who are just invested in the vast riches of our cultural heritage. And so the show is basically just that. It's basically just like, well, what actually is in the audience? And it turns out it's like, there are a ton of people out there who just, like, at this point, for decades have been deprived of this stuff. And they're so hungry. Like, it's the bliss of the show is like, you get these messages, like, I just, I didn't even know. Like, all I knew about Machiavelli was that like, the word Machiavelli in meets scheming, just like, we do this hour long. It's just an hour long thing. I'm like, well, actually, who was Machiavelli? Like, essentially, the founder of modern Western political theory, this stuff is rich food. It's like that come by without, you know, have bread without price, come drink. And there's just like so much in it. So it does break the heart to sort of like, see people just thrilled as if there's some virtue, essentially. The idea, I guess, being that you then make more room for people who are more sort of ideologically demographically appropriate, right? I think that the theme was it's called something like, um, disrupt texts. If you just search the hashtag disrupt texts, which already is just such a tortured hashtag that you know, it's going to be a mess, right? And like the two Ts next to each other, like, at least you, you would at least. But again, like, prosody aside, you know, the point of it is all of these sins of prejudice and omission have been committed over the course of Western history. There's this inherent chauvinism inherent jingoism in celebrating the West because the West just means white people, which first of all is, you know, itself profoundly untrue, right? That actually the Western culture is a hugely, you know, trans racial trans ethnic endeavor, trans historical endeavor, encompassing vastly different societies. I mean, Tertullian already in antiquity was saying what has Athens to do with Jerusalem, which is a fair question, right? You talk to like these sort of fifth century BC Greeks next to these thousand year old Jews wandering around and they come, they sort of meet in the Roman Empire and it disseminated out through Europe. Like this is a hugely multiracial story. And so it's sort of laughable on its face to say like, well, this is actually all about cutting out minorities. But then of course, what it really is is just using, you know, one cultures or one set of cultures sins as if they were unique, right? It's, you know, you hear all about the evils of Columbus, you never hear about the incredible violence that was being perpetrated between clans and tribes in the Americas before any Westerners ever arrived. You know, all of this stuff is, it almost doesn't bear arguing about because it just seems profoundly obvious to me. Really, what we have is like an in a, at root of all this. I think it's like an inability to deal with the fallenness of man, which is actually really, really ugly, right? Like wasn't it? Chester Timing saying you have to hear the bad news before you hear the good news, right? G.K. Chesterton. And like, probably at some point. Yeah. This is, I'm playing very fast and loose with my illusions here. Somewhere in revelations probably says like, wow, stone ray. Yeah. Fair. But, um, I think Kirk Cameron says that actually. Yeah, that's right. But it's a sponge, it's a sponge movie. It's all, it's all gone back to sponge. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, this is the thing, and the coronavirus thing is the same thing. It's just like, there's death. It's not fair. It's, it affects different people at different times unexpectedly. You can like gather grain into barns and that very day your life will be taken from you. Like this, this stuff is like, is tragic. I mean, this is one of the central, actually one of the most formative experiences and memories of my life is throwing a tantrum as a small child when I asked my mom, like, wait, so if you don't get like hit by a car, you don't die, right? You just sort of keep living. And my mother explained as I assume parents do generally to kids at some point, like, no, actually, like, you just eventually you just die. And like the profound injustice of this to be like, I was inconsolable for like a full couple hours in one of those little kids and I still feel that way in my heart, you know, like, I think that like coming to grips with that is really what this is about. It's like the West because it's purely Western phenomenon, by the way, also to be kicking Odyssey off the curriculum. It's not as if, you know, like in Saudi Arabia, they're conducting deep soul searching about like Muslim culture or whatever. This is a Western thing to self critique and it's now spiraled so out of control because in some sense, we've sort of lost Christianity as our load star and therefore we're like looking at ourselves with this horror of unrecognition. Like how can it be that there are there's bloodshed and rape and terrible things are slavery in our past? I felt like so much of the coronavirus responses have been people just realizing for the first time that they're going to die. Exactly. And you have governors like freaking out and like shuffling things around and making all these, you're like, oh, you're just changing these kinds of deaths to these kinds of deaths, you know, when they're just freaking out because they can't control that. It's so weird. They're throwing the tantrum that I had a little kid like they never had it. So now they have to have it like in public in this very like destructive way. But yeah, that's so we shouldn't get rid of the Odyssey. No, don't get rid of the Odyssey. I don't know. You just got really excited. I don't know if you answered the question. It's like my wife hates SpongeBob. So if I tell her that you got rid of the Odyssey, then it gets rid of SpongeBob. She'd be on board. Oh, wow. Well, this is bad. No Odyssey. No Paul Blart, mall cop too. It's a good argument. It's very, very compelling. So I've tried to read the Odyssey on the Iliad in recent years. I can't do it. I'm just am I just dumb? I mean, what had you, yes, obviously, but no, you're not just dumb, but you're asking you like how do you, how do you do how does it what's the best way to do it? Yeah. I mean, so this actually, I'm glad that we started out talking about the like complexities of talent and the like discomfort of it because inherently when you go around being like, yeah, Western culture, you there's something a little bit of lead us a little bit snobby about it. And like, I get this all the time. I think that it's really easy to be flippant in the same way that some people are flippant about. Oh, you can just draw, you can just learn to draw. Right. It's really easy to be flippant about this as an actual challenge. Two things. First of all, you don't have to like everything. Right? Like, this is a kind of unapologetic, hard and fast, like old sort of British school arm way of regarding this that we've kind of lost is like some things you just like should have read, you know, and so like if it just feels like taking your medicine for a while, I kind of feel like that's okay. And there are and there are things which you have to like struggle through and then be walking down the street one day and it's like it's been in the back pocket of your brain for all that time and suddenly you're like, oh, that's how that works, you know. So I guess, you know, and I feel this way, for example, about T.S. Eliot, who is not somebody that I particularly liked very much until I sort of came to understand his Christianity. But good translations and good editions do help. I mean, did you read like the introduction to the, just cracked it open and read it? Yeah, why not? Yeah. I sort of feel like there are gaps in time, culture that you have to bridge with the audience. You have to know like, what am I trying to get out of it? Like with the with the audience in the earlier, especially, I often tell people like, it's it's not I'm actually C.S. Lewis writes about this in his Preface to Paradise Lost. He says like, you can't come to an epic the way you come to like a ketz poem, these finely constructed, you want to underline like the every word like, oh yeah, this was the good, good way of saying that, like, epics were not actually like that. Like it's this kind of rolling wash of sound and words and ideas like this. You know, I like to think of it as like, you know, as a sort of a movie. And it's like, if you tune out for like a couple, you know, 10 or 20 lines, like that's okay too. It is there's something like people don't know how to use these texts. I don't know if any of these things like this. Like a dangerous movie. Yes, a lot going on. The closest thing in our culture, I think to Epic is the Marvel Cinematic Universe, because there was, I mean, we lost a lot of this now, but there was what's called the epic cycle, which was like all of these like fanfics and spin offs and they were all kind of gathered together into this big store. The cycle was itself like, well, this epic fits here and this one fits here. And this is where like, itapis fits into the story of it. It is, you know, whatever. And I mean, in some sense, we're kind of reviving that mode of storytelling, all this world building and universe building and stuff. But you're watching a Marvel movie and you go, who the heck was that guy? Exactly. And you just go, whatever. Nobody's sad about that. I don't think you should be sad about like, I am personally at least not sad about that when I'm reading. I mean, look, I've read the earlier like, an uncountable in my own mind number of times. And I like, every time some great scholar comes out with like, well, actually, like when the death of your rimadon in book, whatever, it's like, no, I do that person is like, and don't like care very much. And I'm sure that if I went and like, followed this argument and like, you know, that's another great thing about these vast texts. I mean, this, they did kind of the Greeks did in some respects treat these texts like they're Bible and you don't read your Bible in one sitting and you come back to it and you're like, Oh, wow, I never noticed that like in Joshua with this thing, like there's there's an element of that to these poems to. I think people just like, again, like, you're sort of nodding along. So I don't know which ones are these things. It may or may not be true for you. I just do it. So you think I understand all the words. Yeah. Just case the camera down. Good. Yeah. It's good. It's epistemological. Yeah. I do my best at all times to make people uncomfortable in exactly this way. Still a lot. Like, yeah. Do you read the elite or the Odyssey first? Which one's the sequel I can't remember? Odyssey is the sequel. Okay. But it's also easier and shorter. So hard to say, it just depends kind of where you're coming at it from. If you're like, already, you can read them out of order. You can add an order. You can read them out of order. Yeah. It's like watching Iron Man 3. You don't need to have seen Iron Man 2. Exactly. And much like Chris's creator of Iron Man 3, the creator of the Odyssey took great pains to make sure that you could just pick it up. I mean, I guess listen to it. Shane Black? Shane Black? Is that the creator of Iron Man? He wrote Iron Man 3. Yeah. Much like Homer, I would say. Yeah. It's a Homer of our day, really. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, that's the other thing about these is like, they actually were at some point. This is one of the thorniest questions in classics. So like, you know, without trying to resolve it. Like, scholars have debated about how these things came about. And like, one going theory is like, there were a bunch of sort of songs, shorter songs going around the people would sing and recite these tales. And so that you actually have to be able to like lift certain pieces out and not really know what's going on in the rest of the story. Yeah. I guess I would read the Odyssey first. Actually, what I would really suggest is reading the Ineid first, which is the Roman, like one, as Virgil, and not the only Roman. Is that like the DC Comics? Yeah, exactly. It's the alternate universe. Yeah. I don't know which between DC and Marvel, which one is like more of a rip off, would you say, of the other? Is there one? They were constantly ripping each other off, but I think DC was the first, was the original. So I guess then DC is the Greeks. Because Romans, Virgil, like the great accusation of him is that you know that meme where there's like somebody drawing a cat or like, no, there's a girl with a cat and she's tracing the outline of a cat and the cat goes away. And it's like this like weird gross picture. Like that's people accuse Virgil of that with Homer. Like he just takes the Iliad, which is 24 books and shrinks it down into six books and the Odyssey, which is 24 books and shrinks it down into six books because they're 12 books, it'll be like half the length. And it's the one that everybody like quotes and sites sort of throughout the tradition of epics, like it's big for Dante and all this stuff. So it's like probably the one to start with is actually, it's actually the annead. Annead. Annead. Yeah. Okay. Exactly. Okay. Sure. Why not? I'll get right on that. Not, not, notting long. Yeah. So in big bold, underlined letters on my notes, it says, Spencer Clavin said, C.S. Lewis is the most important 20th century intellectual. I did say that. And it's in bold, so you know, it's very important. It was true. Yeah. So do you want to defend that? So not Neil the Grass Tyson. Not Neil the Grass Tyson. Do I want to defend? No, I don't want to defend it. I just want to make that assertion. That's the end of this. I just read the abolition of man. Yeah. And exploded my head a little bit. Good. In a good way? In a good way. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, I saw you reading that and I, it always boggles my mind that C.S. Lewis is so famous. And then like people who love him haven't read a lot of his on fiction and though that was me because I growing up, I had read all the Narnia, I read Mirka Shianity and great divorce, screw tape letters. Yeah. And then I would like pick up anything else. And it was, I don't know what he's talking about. Yeah. Yeah. Right. And then just coming back to it, it's like the same style, but I'm now understanding these arguments. And it's like, what changed do you think speaking of like, you know, how do I get into complicated texts? I mean, I think I just have a little more experience now where I'm actually seeing what he's talking about. It's also becoming more and it becomes more relevant. It's becoming more and more relevant. You know, he's kind of doing this argument about like super ultra literal scientism. Yeah. You know, and he's got this great comparison between magic and science and the abolition of man that I was just like, you know, I was, I was fainting on my fainting couch with how good it was, you know, that, yeah, I don't know. I guess maybe it has become more relevant over the last 20 years or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, because this is, this is a perfect example of what I'm talking about, right? You pick up a book at one point in your life and it just doesn't speak to you. And then something clicks along the way. I mean, the, my case for him is the most important intellectual of the 20th century is kind of based on this, essentially, that his whole life, he was like shadowboxing with Freud, like Freud, and he kind of mentions this a little bit and surprised by joy. I think he says that at a certain point, we were all very into debunking, like the new psychology sort of made us think that all myths were just this kind of emanation of our, of our animal natures and we had to explain away why there were stories about gods and fairies and all this stuff. And in some sense, I think he zeroed in on that as what would become the madness of the post of post war Europe and America, the post war West, like, and that was exactly right, essentially. I mean, Freudianism, I, I, I get, I like knock on Freud, I think a little too much in general, because like, he was, he was a great thinker. He, in many ways, established a discipline that has been like incredibly helpful for many people, namely that of psychotherapy, you know, and, and, and yet, you know, if you really chase him right down and, and haters will deny this, Freudians will deny this, but like if you, if you really chase him right down, he is a materialist, you know, he does believe that in this whole id ego, super ego thing, like your super ego is, is kind of an emanation of your ego is kind of an emanation of your id and like, in the end, it's difficult for psychoanalysis not to veer into like debunking into scraping away, like, oh, you feel love for this person, but that really is, and we still talk this way. This so profoundly changed the way we talk like, oh, I had an adrenaline rush instead of like, I felt excited, right? Like we still think of ourselves as bags of chemicals. And that is, I think really the root of that philosophically for us is Freud, you know, and, and Lewis like, kind of saw that. And so all that stuff in abolition about explaining these way skepticism, right? Like the whole text is a, is a sort of argument for not being able to reduce things down to, to their atoms all the time. And so in that sense, because this materialism has only spiraled more out of control, in that sense, abolition of man has like the answers to all of our problems and is so perfectly described, like so many things that are going on. So I don't know, I think it wins. And also it's like, it's kind of easier to read than a lot of other stuff, which is so one, it's one reason why he doesn't get enough plays because like people think he's simple because he's so good at writing is so clear. Yeah, I mean, I think like in high school, maybe going into college, I had this natural like debunking attitude, like the cynicism of being like, oh, I can explain all this or someone comes up and like, I'll had an experience with a demon, you know, you're like, actually, that's probably just, you know, blah, blah, blah. Right. Even though I was a believer, it was like, you just have this natural skepticism towards everything. I don't know if that was cultural or what? Sure. You know, but I think, I think since then I've kind of rediscovered this child like wonder for things and to be able to be like, he's got a line to in Narnia where one of the kids is talking to has a line about the stars. And it's like, this, you know, he says, well, stars are actually burning balls of gas, you know, billions of miles away or whatever. And see this or in aslant says, that's not what stars are. That's what they're made of, you know, and I think I just read through the Narnia's again, everything else, you know, I had to stand up. It's great. I mean, he has, he's so wonderful at that this moment. This like hits you over the head. It's perfect online. Yeah. By the way, I think burning balls of gas, I think that's, I think that's, that's from a similar figure, a much like aslant in the canonical literature. Yeah, no, this is the funny, like, I really think like in college is the time of one's life when one should be sort of debunking a bunch of stuff. Like that's the appropriate time to go around. And I'm like, well, really, man, like there's no such thing as good and evil. Like it's all. And then like, you know, like so many of our like professional philosophers like stuck in college, like stuck in that mode, you know, you grow out of it, you grow out of it because it's not real. It doesn't describe your experience of the world. It doesn't describe anything important. And so either you continue to view the world that way as like, you know, just kind of an illusion, basically. And like, as we've seen in our streets this past summer, right, like you just, your life becomes empty, meaningless and angry. And how could it not, you know, or you sort of put that away, sort of say, well, at a certain point, like, how do I know that this table is really here instead of not well, and just I just know, like I put nobody who doesn't believe it's there, won't put a coffee cup on it. Like it's there. I thought abolition of man would be really relevant because it sounds like a feminist book. Yeah, the feminists love it until they open the title, the cover, which they never do because they don't read so. Mike would drop. Well, you're so you identify as how do you identify as a same sex attracted Christian? Oh, yeah. Right. It's like the right way to identify. Like, I don't know what I like. What do you want to say? Yeah, I mean, I use the word gay to talk about myself. Okay. It's one of those moving targets. You're gonna know what's the right way to say it. Yeah. And so you can tell us. Yeah. I know I like, I hate all that stuff personally. I mean, you can probably tell like, I don't know, like, I think, call it what you want to call it, first of all, and second of all, like, the politicized battle over sexual preference was the recent one, right? The Amy, can't say preference though, right? Yeah, yeah, that's right. It was preferences off the table. Except you can, but you can't really because like, as recently as five minutes before she said that, there were like articles on like whatever, queer tea or whatever the like, gay rag is, you know, like using the term queer tea, queer tea, T-Y-E-E-R-T-Y. Like, right? Second only to the Babylon B is a source of comedy and entertainment is to watch like, like, you have subscriptions delivered here. I tell you. Yeah, yeah. No, I just follow them on Twitter and they're just like the endless source of dunking, you know, endless dunk material on queer tea, you know, and so they like got all up in arms about Coney Barrett having just published some article about like, and now they're doing, they're running these pieces like, oh, oh, Pete Buttigieg will be the first openly gay cabinet member, which is the same article that they ran about Richard Grinnell, who's Trump's openly gay, actual first openly gay cabinet member. And they've just like, they've just like, undertaken to erase him from history, essentially. So this is very, this is all very amusing to me and fun to dunk on. But anyway, I'm often attention now. So yeah, so the like, the politics of it, I guess, have to do with either implying that whatever it is that is going on with me is something that could be changed or not, right? That's kind of, I think, at the root of like, because there's a lot of history, obviously, of trying to train gayness out of kids or whatever. And so I guess some Christians, for example, prefer gay Christians and, you know, sort of non affirming straight Christians. Regular Christians. Just Christian. Normal normal people. Normal people. Normal people. Yeah. But actually, it's a good example. Like normal is an excellent, homosexuality is abnormal, right? Like, it's not the norm. And so like, that's another good example of a word who's been completely like, just like stripped of its meaning because we want to like insist that this is okay and good in the same as everything else. Right, you can't call anything abnormal. It is just abnormal. It's like the very least at bare minimum, you can say truthfully about it, that it is not how most people like experience the law. Anyway, um, yeah, so like, I guess, like normal Christians, like straight Christians sometimes want to use same-sex attracted as a way of conceiving of this as like a sin that you struggle with, like rather than an aspect of your identity. And I am like, certainly of the belief that this, you know, whatever sort of genetics will be discovered to have been involved in this and whatever, like, a mount of nurture was involved in exactly the same we were just talking about with talent, right? Like, however, it was that I got to be this way. Like, it is my firm conviction that it's like immutable. Like, it's not a thing that is ever going to go away. Um, and, and others, including some games were celibate, like, um, washed from waiting. This guy Wesley, um, I'm going to forget his last name, but the, you know, one of the best books on this topic is, uh, by a solid Christian, it's called washing waiting. Um, and like, you know, there are many people on all, on all sides of this issue who, and the research seems to basically confirm this that like, for a small number of people, like probably 4.5% or something, it's not going to go away. So I, I believe in that, I also believe that there's like a really hideous and pernicious, uh, tendency to make gayness into an identity, into the center of an identity. And of course, a Christian is obligated first and foremost to identify as Christ's right, to identify as like a, as a, as a child of God and in Christ. Um, and so that's, to that extent, it's entirely salutary to say like, no, I'm not like gay is not what I am. But of course we say I'm X about ourselves all the time. I'm a blonde. I'm a comedian. I'm a writer. And, and, and Christians do that without thinking except in this area where there's like, this really intense debate around. So I just like, I'm not interested in engaging. I'm interested in engaging those questions. I'm not interested in engaging in like acrobatics of language. So I'm gay. And I also love using gays at pejorative because that's a good one. Super day. And arguing about like whether sexual preference is the right term or not is very, very gay. Let me tell you this is like a super gay. You ever watched that Silicon Valley episode? Where the guy is like, he's a gay guy, but he's a Christian and he's totally fine with him being out of gay. But it's when he's outed as a guy who goes to Bible studies. They don't want to talk. It's very, very funny. Did you like it? Well, like that. I like that. Sure. That was my only question. That's the whole reason I aren't about it. I haven't actually seen it. I'm afraid to say I've seen some episodes, but no, I'm not like a completed since I've come, but I will say like, there's, there's a whole, well, somebody really cool. Just somebody's awesome. That sounded gay to me. That's how you know it's pretty gay. Well, he's compensating for something. I drive a Camaro gay or non-gay. Well, I once, so one of my favorite games on Twitter is to like, how many degrees of Kevin Bacon, how many degrees of homosexuality, right? Like, like, so, so I once drove a Camaro briefly before I got in a car wreck and it was totaled at IM gay. Therefore, driving through his gay. Yes. Wow. There's two degrees. It's really easy. It's not like red or anything, but there is a whole, there actually is a whole debate about like, you know, because people publish these articles, like, hot take articles, right? It's harder to come out as a conservative or as a Christian than it is to come out as gay. And it's like, like, to me, that's like very hot takey because it really depends. Super depends, you know, like what culture you're in. Depends if you live in LA or Nashville. Exactly. For me, it's definitely true, right? Like, to say I'm gay in most contexts. Like, you know, this is an example of like, one of the only contexts ever where if you guys didn't know, I would think more about how I was going to tell you that than about how I'm a Christian or how I'm like, conservative, you know. Most of the time, it's much, much easier to simply say, oh, like my boyfriend or, oh, like, whatever, than it is to like, you have to hedge your bets. You have to be like, how can I explain this to you without you, like, kicking me out the door? Like, but of course, like, you know, for example, like, many of my friends come from like, very, very, as you might say, non-affirming backgrounds, like places where they would have been kicked out of their house or whatever. And so, like, it's kind of, it's a dumb hot take, but it is a statement on sort of where LA culture is, for example, as our most hot takes are about like, urban culture and on the coast. So you're sure? Yeah. Yeah. So like, are you seeing this, like, self-oppressing? Because you, oh, yeah, taking this, like, self-hating, internalized, and I, to me, of all the terrible things that people say to and about me, self-hating is the most obviously untrue. Like, if anything, I'm like, my ego is like, vastly oversized. And so, like, and like, you know, if I have, if I struggle with anything, it's like, like, obvious, probably. And I like, you know, so, so, so that part is, is always amazing to me, especially because when you engage with people on this stuff, when somebody says you're self-hating, somebody says you, whatever, are racist, somebody says you, and often I'll get like, oh, like, I'll say some disparaging thing about the LGBT left. And then the next comment will be like, oh, look at this, like, straight white dude making a comment about the LGBT left. And so then I'll just like, you know, I do sometimes like to sort of just pop into the replies and be like, no, actually, like, I am gay. I like happily partnered for a long time with a man. Like, it's like, it makes no impression. So they should move on to the next accusation. It's just like, you know, now you're well, well, but you're a racist or like, you know, and the latest one is like, being gay doesn't excuse you from homophobia because it's internalized and stuff like that. Which is a good, like, people need to like really grasp this that like, it's not actually about anything real about you. Like, you may, you may be a homophobe. You may be a racist person. Like, all of those things are true. Those things exist. And we should all like go about searching our souls to ask whether like, we are, you know, doing bad stuff in any sort of systematic way. But like, that's not what that conversation is about. Like that conversation is about you have a political view that I disagree with. And my only tactic for like encountering that is just to call you nasty names. So you'll get scared and go away. And like, the only response to that is, well, like, jump into like, you know, let's go take a long walk off a short pier, like, you know, and people that like, conservatives are really bad at this because there's some nice, you know, or something. So you didn't become gay just so you could own people and arguments with that? I can neither confirm nor deny. That would be nice. I mean, that used to be, by the way, is actually really fun. I mean, that part is super fun. Yeah, it doesn't work as well anymore though. And now you have to be yeah, something more. Yeah, you can transfer something. Well, but like, for example, my dad, whom we mentioned at the beginning, like, I'm sure that anybody's listening to the nose that, like, my dad is a conservative podcaster. And he got one of these hit pieces by Media Matters, which is the, like, you know, I think it's Soros back. It's like, they just full-time watch Daily Wire videos. They watch so much more Daily Wire than I do. They're like 15% of the traffic at the site is just Media Matters. Exactly. Like, Josh, my boyfriend is now working, like, reason we're moving is because he will become the general counsel of the Daily Wire. Media Matters will still watch vastly more Daily Wire than I do. And they always, they tweet out, like, you know, Matt Walsh said that men aren't women. Like, and then it's like, everybody's like, correct. Like, this is what Matt Walsh believes. This is what the vast majority of people believe. So yeah, so they, when they first started doing this, they put this whole thing out about Clavans homophobia, like the evil of, like, Andrew Clavans homophobia, because nobody knew who I was, nobody knew that I am gay, like, any of this stuff. And Dad never talks about it, but he's also, you know, if any human being alive has supported and encouraged me in my life, it's my father, you know, he and I have a phenomenal relationship and, like, I owe to him any success that I have, and not, by the way, because he, like, puts me up for stuff, but simply because he is, like, a really great dad. And so I'm just like, that was really fun. He and I got in, like, a vast Media Matters brawl, which was like, my first viral tweet ever was, like, high media matters. I'm Andrew Clavans gay son, and like, you are self-satisfied clowns or something. And you remember the tweet word for word delightful. I remember all my tweets were for word. I'm very self-hating. Yeah, exactly. That's right. Well, do we want to move to subscriber portion now? Yeah, you want to get in there? We'll get in a little deeper on all this stuff and, uh, yeah, have the, uh, we'll get it really, we'll dig in. Oh, yeah. Awkward. We're going to get super awkward. We're going to sing and do it base. We'll sing base. I think I might have the lady part. Somebody's getting his balls. I think I'm probably the highest. Well, you're now a little bit too high. No, I do. Yeah. You need to calm down. All right. All right. Here we go. You know, I believe in God and Jesus Christ and also I am a gay person. Like, everybody will naturally want to ask you, like, how do you reconcile? What is the, uh, what is the gay agenda? Are you guys, uh, are you in that? Do you like weekly meetings or? Well, I can't actually read the details of that. I'm unitying in this soul. I'm gonna describe her for a minute. So how do you, how do you get ripped? How does one get swole? How does one get swole? Enjoying this hard hitting interview?
