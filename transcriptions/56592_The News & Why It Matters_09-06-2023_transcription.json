    "text": " Today, Donald Trump is indicted in the classified documents probe, gap throws $25,000 to trans the kids, and an update on the Nashville shooter, manifesto. We've got all of that coming up and more in our All Starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. Happy Friday. Former President Donald Trump has been indicted yet again this time in the classified document probe headed up by special counsel, Jack Smith. Trump now faces charges of violating the Espionage Act as well as obstruction of justice, destruction or falsification of records, conspiracy and false statements. He's scheduled to appear at a Miami Florida courthouse on Tuesday where his own appointee, Judge Eileen Cannon, will preside over the matter. And shortly after receiving the news, Trump released a four minute video on truth social maintaining his innocence. Here is some of that lunch. Very sadly, we're a nation in decline. And yet they go after a popular president, a president that got more votes than any sitting president in the history of our country by far, and did much better the second time in the election than the first. And they go after him on a box, his hooks, just like the Russia, Russia, Russia hooks, and all of the others, he's just been going on for seven years, they can't stop because it's election interference at the highest level. There's never been anything like what's happened. I'm an innocent man. I'm an innocent person. Former attorney for Trump, Tim Parlator also told CBS News that he himself witnessed what he called blatant prosecutorial misconduct on behalf of the special counsel team watch. The Trump attorneys have raised questions about prosecutorial misconduct in this case. What did you witness? I witnessed a lot of misconduct. What did that look like? So I, as BIM report, I went before the grand jury myself. I was not subpoenaed. I went involuntarily as in the place of a custodian of records. And I was really stunned by what I saw in the grand jury room by the conduct of the prosecutors. They made many attempts to try to get it privileged communications. They would ask me about conversations with Michael Iann. They would make improper references to the jury trying to mislead them about that. At one point, it got to the level where they're asking me this again, and then they'll turn to the grand jury. So you're refusing to provide this information. No, I'm not refusing to provide. The ethical rules prohibit me. Even if the answer to this question is helpful, I'm not allowed to give it. And I turned to the jury and I said, and she knows it. She knows that it's an improper question. It's an improper inference. That then led to an exchange where she tried saying, well, the privilege has exceptions. It could be waived. Yes. Well, if the president's so cooperative, why won't he waive privilege and allow you to tell the grand jury about his conversations? Why does that cross a legal red line? That that cross a major red line as far as implying guilt to a jury based on the invocation of a constitutional right. It's the kind of thing that if that had happened in a trial court, the judge would have immediately stopped everything, probably declared a mistrial. And it's the kind of thing that, quite frankly, an attorney, a prosecuting attorney who willfully does that type of thing would potentially face discipline. And I think that they probably will when this case comes out. But that shouldn't be surprising if you're paying attention. Blayton unconstitutional misconduct has been occurring at the federal level in practically every alphabet agency that exists. And trust me, there are a lot of them in 2023. The constitutional republic, the United States purports to be, is just an illusion at this point, a mirage, a farce, and one that they're not even trying to hide anymore. They don't care that you know that there is a two-tier justice system. They don't care that you watch them handle Joe Biden with kid gloves over the same classified documents issue. You see, they have yet to even interview Biden in his classified documents case because they're still leisurely negotiating the terms with Biden's lawyers, even though Biden, who, as a reminder, lacked the ability to declassify anything as vice president, had boxes of classified documents sitting next to a Corvette being driven by his crackhead criminal son. But don't worry, Joe said back in January that the documents weren't a big deal because the garage was, of course, locked watch. We're going to get a chance to speak on all this, God willing soon. But as I said earlier this week, people, and by the way, my Corvette's in a lock garage, okay? So it's not like you're sitting out in the street. But anyway, yes, as well as my Corvette. Oh, meanwhile, Trump, who was actually president, endures an unprecedented rate at his residence, also presumably locked, and he gets indicted on espionage charges. It cannot be overstated how dangerous this is true, banana republic stuff. The president has given his bureaucracies the green light to indict his political opponent directly interfering in a presidential election. They impeached Donald Trump over over phone call, just as a reminder. But again, should we be surprised? This has been happening for a long time now. Black Lives Matter protesters looted stores, rioted, burned down cities causing record amounts of property damage. What happened to them? Well, largely nothing. And many of the ones who did face charges ended up having those charges dropped. Meanwhile, conservative protesters who were let into the capital by capital police themselves and taken on a guided tour were thrown in jail and deprived a due process. Pro-life activists across the country saw their homes rated were handcuffed and thrown into the back of a car while their children watched, traumatized, and yet incredibly still no leads from the FBI into who committed the fire bombing of numerous pro-life crisis pregnancy centers across the country. Some people worry we're heading towards a civil war. By my account, it sounds like we're already in one here to discuss this in more. We have Eric July Blaze TV contributor and founder and owner of Ripaverse Comics, also the beautiful and lovely Lauren Chen, host of pseudo-intellectual with Lauren Chen. Thank you for being here, guys. I would say a special thank you to you, Lauren, because you are from out of town. And we see Eric far more. And it's nice to have some estrogen at the table. I love it's nice to be here. Happy to be in Dallas. Happy to be with the Blaist crew. Yes. Yes. We're happy to have you back. So I, you know, sometimes people accuse me of being a little dramatic and they might be right. But I really don't feel like I'm being dramatic in saying like this is really scary and dangerous where we are. I don't even want to say where we're headed, where we're at right now. No, you're absolutely right. I mean, essentially what they're trying to do, let's not miss words, is that they're trying to control the outcome of a presidential election through trumped up charges. So this isn't just wrongfully prosecuting someone or having a double standard of what they will or will not prosecute over. It's they're actively trying to sway the outcome of election by making him ineligible to run. So I don't think you're being dramatic when you say this is serious stuff, but you're right. It's been going on for a long time. This is just one of the most heinous cases, I think, of the alphabet agency's run amok. But this is something that Donald Trump, when he was president, he knew of because they were being fishy with his campaign, he should have done more to stop. That's my one biggest criticism of Trump is that he knew a lot of this was going on, but he was, I think a little bit too willing to surround himself with the swamp creatures he previously had said he was going to drain. Yeah, I don't think that you're wrong in your criticism there. He did. He did run on drain the swamp, drain the swamp, drain the swamp. Maybe he just couldn't root them all out. I don't know, but it's hard to understand how he didn't just fire Chris Ray and so many more of those swamp creatures. Yeah, I think what this is is just another example of how the justice system certainly in this country, it's always been something that, well, we treat it like not we, because I've long known it was a sham. I'm not part of this. It means no mistake. But what I mean is we like to look at sort of like politicians, but actually I would argue that be it judges, be it the court systems, we actually hold that a level above even politicians as far as well. We expect better of them. And that's where you go to try to root out sort of problems. What happens now is what has been happening at a lower level where people are getting screwed over by prosecutors. And I think this is the most boring example of it because it was a former sitting sort of president that is basically having a justice system. If you want to call it that or lack thereof being utilized against him, it is so painfully obvious that this is an aspect or the angle that they're taking is how do we punish our political enemies, right? And that's when you always end a dangerous territory when you start doing stuff like that, because there's always going to be this struggle of power. And then people feel like they have to be reactionary. And it's like, all right, well, you did that to us. Now it's going to be our turn to do it to you. And that's when you start getting into the banana republic, sort of stuff. So this is, I think, at, if anything, I guess what America can take from it, from a more micro level, this type of stuff happens all the time when the, when the brother was talking about like how prosecutors used this sort of rhetoric to say, Hey, you should be able to say this. Why won't you say this? And we're trying to have you admit guilt. That stuff happens to regular Joe blows every day, every single day you'd be surprised and whether it is against the Constitution or not, they're still going to turn around and do it. So now we're seeing it again at a level that I'm being completely honest. I don't know if I'd ever thought that I would see something like this happening to a former president, more importantly, someone that's like running his own campaign and has aspirations to finish out these next four years. So again, that's intriguing by itself. I feel like if you ever want to know what the Democrats are planning next, just look at what they are accusing the right of doing. Because again, I go back to the phone call. It's so telling when you think about the fact that they impeached Donald Trump over a phone call, who was the phone call to Ukraine? What was he asking for? Right? Like, oh, now all of a sudden we're getting this coming back to us. It becomes a very full circle moment because we're learning about all of the corruption that was happening in Ukraine. Well, I say we're learning. We hear the blaze knew about it and we're doing chalkboard specials. Glensium was doing chalkboard specials on it three years ago. So this is not new news to us, but it comes very full circle of like, okay, they just impeached Donald Trump over a phone call because they claimed that he was trying to interfere in a presidential election. Clearly, they don't actually care about that. They were just telling on themselves that that was going to be their next move because here they are interfering in a presidential election over, I would say, much less serious things than all of the things that Trump was trying to uncover about what Joe Biden was doing. Oh, you're absolutely right. And what's really frustrating is that when I look at this happening, I know that if you were to sit the average person down and explain what's going on, they would think this was a nothing burger and they would actually think it's more telling about the establishment, the alphabet agencies, and you know, Joe Biden's corrupt administration than anything to do with Trump. But if you listen to the media reporting on this, they are holding this out as if it's some smoking gun. This is confirmed Trump is a criminal. He's an evil person. He's trying. I've heard him be referred to as what is it like a turncoat, things like that, because you use the word espionage. It makes it sound like, oh, Russian agent confirmed, right? That must be what this is all about. So they're trying to spin this way out of proportion. But I think for anyone in the know, all this does is actually confirm that Trump is onto something because otherwise they wouldn't be so afraid of him. I'm really interested to see once poll numbers come out, whether this is going to affect his support amongst his base because so far, after everything they've thrown at him, you know, these frivolous sexual assault allegations, none of it has actually hurt him. The people that are going to get him to the general election. I doubt this will be any different. I can't see any Republican primary voters like, what? Oh my goodness. He's actually been indicted. Now I'm not going to support him. But you know what? I think this probably will be successful in drumming up the Democrat base, right? They're trying to once more scare them, like with that Trump hysteria. Yeah, I think you're right. I do think, you know, I read this and I'm like, are they? Do they just really want him to get the nomination? Because it feels like they do. And then it's like, yeah, they probably do because maybe they're thinking, well, you know, you might get the nomination, but then you'll lose in the general because we are galvanizing all of our people against you. Democrats hate Trump. Exactly. Exactly. They're not going to cast a vote for Joe Biden. They're just going to cast a vote against Donald Trump at the end of the day. That's what pretty much happened this previous time, because you look at who we have in the White House there. He's not the best and the brightest. You don't think? Not quite. Not quite. I saw this compilation the other day of him his falls. And I mean, that was, I don't know, it was intriguing to me. I'm like, have we ever had a president that was just falling around like that? But it was like a three minute long of him like at least tripping and stuff like that. That's a long time. That's a long time. So I was, I didn't realize there were not any. So yeah, obviously people to the point were voting against someone as opposed to four that guy. But on a serious note, I think this does speak to what I talk about on the show all the time about how, you know, Democrats in general, leftists in general, this is why they want control of media. They don't care about what is truthful and they don't even expect their constituents or the people that would generally look to them for the truth as people that are, let's say, they got it all upstairs. If they can present something as if it's far more dramatic than what it is, that's good enough for them because they're expecting the average person or the brainlet, if you will, to just take it for what it is at face value and think this is the worst thing that has ever happened. So that's just part of the course for them. Yeah. All right, let's go ahead and take a quick break. We'll be back with more when we want to think our sponsor freedom project education. So look, if you have your kids in public schools, please, please, please, please take them out. Okay, they're, they're getting inundated with like pronouns and sexually explicit books in their school libraries. And you know, I mean, they're not going to come out learning, reading or writing or arithmetic, but they are going to come out learning that they are non-binary to spirit drag queen. So that is why I want you to talk to my friends over at Freedom Project Academy. They have perfected online learning. They offer live on demand and homeschool courses for K through 12. And they were built on Judeo Christian values and classical curriculum, which means they're going to teach your kids how to think not what to think. Critical thinking is key in society right now because we have lost it. That's why we are as crazy as we are. We got to get that back. You can save 10% on tuition when you enroll today at freedomforschool.com. That is freedom F O R school. Dot com freedomforschool.com. So this is the part of the program where I tell all of you who are watching on YouTube. I'm just as a reminder. I don't mean to give you a sob story, but we're literally making zero dollars on YouTube right now because you know, it turns out when you speak truth, the overlords there don't like it and they demonetize your entire channel. So we would just ask that you make sure that you are subscribed to the channel. We're almost to 100,000 and hit that thumbs up and comment. Let us know what you think of the news of the day. So I want to get to this look. It's Pride Month. And so in honor of Pride Month, I feel like we need to expose some level of how bad it really gets during Pride Month. That's how we honor Pride Month. And today, GAP has pledged to donate $25,000 to Gender Cool Project. This is an organization that seeks to, you know, just normalize child transgenderism by promoting positive media coverage for children who identify as transgender. I mean, not children who identify as transgender, but children who are being abused by their parents and their parents push them to be transgender, of course, is what we know that that is. They also help pair children with what they call gender affirming healthcare partners, which, you know, I don't think that I need to fill in the blanks of what those gender affirming healthcare partners actually do because we talk about it ad nauseam on this show. And GAP's 2022 ESG report shows that they teamed up for a one year partnership with Gender Cool. And this is GAP. These are all the GAP brands, GAP Old Navy, Banana Republic, and Atletta, excuse me, donated a combined $100,000. Oh, and by the way, for good measure, they also hosted a denim diva's drag show at their corporate headquarters in San Francisco. You cannot convince me that this many people actually like drag. You just can't. I just like you can't. Again, I don't even want to, I don't want to focus too much on the drag part of it or on drag shows for adults because at the end of the day, I don't give a crap if an adult does want to go see a drag show in an adult club that is clearly like not for children. But I still don't like I don't get the appeal of this at all. Am I like, it's the equivalent to blackface, but what it is, you know, later, none unless. Look, man, this whole trans kid thing, which is again, child mutilation, sterilization, let's call it exactly what it is. The fact that it has seeped in pretty much everything, every corner, every pocket of whatever it is that we consume is entertainment, retailers, all this sort of stuff. I think pulling a plug on a lot of this is customers. It's the only way that we're going to get on the other side of this. Folks start to get acting right once you try it. Once they start realizing that, I don't know, you're not owed their money or they're not owed your money more accurately putting it. So that's what's going to have to happen. So when you see stories like that, there's one thing, first of all, I don't know why these companies take all of these different social political sides. Anyway, I think that's stupid. But once they've made it abundantly clear that something out there willing to fund is specifically pertaining to something like child mutilation and sterilization, I think that's enough for me to be, I'm good. I don't wear a gap like that anyway, but either way, I think there's a line, right? You can get a like something like, I ain't with that. Why are you doing that? But I can at least that's nothing. Child mutilation, I think that's where the line gets drawn. I'm like, okay, if you're on that, I don't want any sort of part of it. So what I expect for Americans to do is to act accordingly once this information has been provided to you. Oh, you're absolutely right. And the average American is not on board with this type of thing. The average American hopefully doesn't even know what this is referring to. But if they do, they do not support it. But what's happening is you have these activists who've inserted themselves into positions of power on marketing teams, HR teams, investment teams, this whole ESG things, their investment bakers, they are trying to basically from the top down and act social change. This is astroturfing social issues. And so like you said, we need to make our voices heard as customers. They're not owed your dollars. It is very easy to simply shop somewhere else. You don't want to go to Target. Don't go to Target. They're not owed your money. Don't want to buy Bud Light. There's a billion other beers out there, better ones, by the way, not to mention. But basically every type of products you can think of, there is a non-woke alternative. And you have brands that are now, I mean, basically aggregators that are letting it be easier for Americans to shop places that have their values. It is like, okay, if you want kids clothing, if you want makeup, if you want whatever industry to be political, okay, we'll make it political. And they are pissing off around half the country, if not more, they don't even know it. Well, they need to find out, thankfully. Target has found out, Bud has found out, but all these other places need to find out too. And I'm really happy that people are starting to vote with their dollars because we need to keep going. We need to keep pushing because I want it to be as unpopular, as socially suicidal for these brands to do anything to do with trans kids, pride, whatever, as it would be for them to outright come out and say they support the KKK. That's the level of stigma we need these brands to follow. I agree. And I mean, that's where I've been trying to convince non-left these conservatives, whatever you want to call yourselves, for the better part of the last decade. It's like this is what a war, if there is to be fought. That's where it's at. It's that stuff like the cultural stuff. It's not necessarily tied to just the political stuff, Breitbart even understood this, that that's on the downstream, man. You changed the culture, you changed that. So if we want to enact change, instead of relying on some, I'm gonna say the word, a person becoming a politician and trying to shake and move and legislation and all that, vote with your dollar. And we talked about it off air. You look at guys like what I've been able to do over the last year. There's a market for it, people. There's absolutely a market for it. We're out there competing with the big dogs, just because we said it wasn't even that I was like trying to be the antithesis of them. It was like, I'm just like, I'm not gonna do that. It's really that simple. And people gravitate it towards it. So once people start acting accordingly, I don't know what the other side is gonna look like. I'll be completely honest. That uncertain to actually intrigues me a lot. Maybe the day of the mega corporation is gonna be over. You're gonna see a lot more smaller, very, very successful companies that are in clothing and in entertainment and all that as opposed to these mega corporations. But to me, I think that benefits everybody. Yeah. It's been striking for me going into these events and seeing the amounts of sponsors that Eric has you pointed out, something that you're doing is just not getting involved in it at all. And it's just fascinating to me because I don't, I mean, I get the ESG stuff, but it's like, you guys could just not get involved in it at all. I don't need you to pander to me. I just don't want to hear about it from you. If I'm, there's like, at the Pride Festival video that I did, there's like Honda and Toyota. And all right, I'm like T-Mobile. You know? Yeah. Yeah. Well, Pride, Cracker Barrel, you think Cracker, your audience supports right. Right. Really? Right. Really? Yeah. It's just bizarre to me. Like you've, you've gone out of your way to take this position to alienate half of your customers, presumably, or if you're Cracker Barrel, probably more, right? Like 99% of them. Yeah. And instead of that, you could have just chosen to like just not do it. Like you're, it's not that you're speaking out against it. You just could have chosen to just not do it. Well, that's, that's what I say there. It's a lot of stupid people that work for these companies. I think we often get to give them way too much credit. And we do point things like ESG and all that, which I'm not saying that isn't a part of it. What I'm saying is if you understand who works for these companies, they're getting terrible information. They got a bunch of blue-haired weirdos that are in their marketing departments that are literally telling them that this is what people want. Looking at the quote on the TikTok numbers and Instagram and all this. These are the type of individuals, even though they don't got money like that, they don't even got capital like that. I don't know why you're even catering to them. They make it seem like this is what you should do. And it's often economic sort of self-deletion, if you will, when you do do it. And I guess if nothing else, they're making our way or making the way for people like myself, because you got your brand, Sarah, we're all trying to be part of this sort of parallel economy and just provide an alternative to this. They told on themselves, and this is what it's, why it's on us as customers, us as creators, entrepreneurs, all of that, to look at that and what are we going to do? We can sit there and grab a complaint and hope that they're going to change, or we can say, okay, let's just actually be a part of it. And then people are going to start reinvesting into something else or reanalyzing situations and say, you know what, I'd rather spend my money here as opposed to giving my money to someone that either despises you or worse, for whatever reason would think, yeah, the topic that we're going to take the side on is on the side that wants to mutilate children. All right, whatever. Right, right. Okay, that's your... Just the hell you want to die. Exactly, that's your hill to die on. All right, I guess we ride it dawn because that's the hill I'm dying on too. All right, let's go ahead and take another quick break. We'll be back with more, but we want to thank relief factors. So relief factor is there for those of you who maybe you're just living in constant pain, maybe you've reached the age where everything hurts when you wake up, maybe you're like me and you had some sort of, you know, I was in a car accident many years ago and it screwed up a bunch of discs in my spine, which is not fun as it turns out. So what relief factor does, it's all natural and it targets the inflammation in your body, which oftentimes is the root cause of your pain. So you're not taking something that's only going to work for a little bit and then you're going to still be in pain and you're going to rub a cream on your, you know, wherever it hurts. And then in 10 minutes, you're just going to need that cream again. It's not like that. It can actually get rid of that root cause of your pain. And oftentimes it can be life changing if you're just living in pain. So try it if you would. They have a three week quick start. It's 1995 and 70% of the people reorder it because it's working for them. So it can get you out of pain, the odds are in your favor. You can go to relieffactor.com. That is relieffactor.com. So I want to get to what's going on with the Nashville school shooter. This is, of course, a covenant school. And the manifesto, the story of the manifesto is has kind of been ongoing. So originally, the police said that they were not going to release the manifesto, I think. It kept going back and forth. They said that they might then they said that they weren't. And then now they're being sued. So they're involved in a lawsuit. And apparently the attorney for the parents of the school shooter notified a court yesterday that they intend to assign rights of the manifesto to the families of the victims. So they say that the documents should be the property of the family. Law enforcement took it from them, but it should be their property. And that ownership should be transferred by the end of the week. And it still remains to be seen whether or not that is going to be made public the manifesto. But it is very, to me, alarming that law enforcement who seemed to be so transparent from the beginning, I mean, they released that body cam footage that we saw. They seemed to be very quick to be transparent. All of a sudden said, oh, hold on a second, we don't want to actually release something that I would say is probably the most important piece of the puzzle, which would be why did this happen because children were murdered. And so it's just, I mean, we'll keep up with the latest, but it's been fascinating to watch them backtrack from that. And I just have no trust in law enforcement these days anymore. And so I mean, Lauren, I know you live near there. I would. I live around 15 to 20 minutes from where this shooting happens. So I mean, when that did occur, obviously, every like, hearts were broken is such a tragedy, any shooting, but especially when involving children. And I think, I mean, the entire national community feels the same. And the issue with the manifesto is it's very strange, like you were saying. So I've been following it because I'm very curious. They still are very hesitant to officially assign a motive to the attack, but you have a manifesto. Okay, so that pretty clearly would indicate a motive in there. But for some reason, they are backing off. And I think Glenn Greenwald, it is has tried through several attorneys to actually kind of probe and get them to release it. Attorneys have been unwilling to work on the case, even if initially they said, oh, yeah, I'll take it a little bit down the line like, oh, actually, sorry, we can't do this. So I think when it comes to that, and also, like you're saying, there's almost a double, it seems inconsistent national PD themselves initially seeming very transparent and then not so much so. I think there are outside forces, maybe alphabet agency, the feds who are trying to keep this down. We also see, I know one of the parties that did not want to release was the Covenant School. They claimed that it had schematics that would compromise the security of the school. I think I speak for everyone when we say, okay, we'll redact that. That's not what we're interested in. So the fact that if this had been a right-wing shooter, that manifesto would have been online within, I mean, a few days, if not sooner. But now weeks and weeks and weeks are going past, and it's still not yet released. I think it absolutely speaks to the fact that there is something they believe will be damning to their side in this, which is exactly why we need to keep pushing to release it. Yeah, such a bizarre story. I think when you get people that are hands-on, they act like they're transparent and then out of nowhere they're pulled back, something's guaranteed that there's federal agencies that are somehow involved in this. This has to have some sort of implications. You don't just not say Jack Dittley or have people have to go through all of these different hoops just to figure out what was in the manifesto. If it was a nothing burger, you would have got it released. The fact that if somebody's being criminalized or a certain side, maybe made to look bad, that they don't think it's certainly worth that. And it is what it is, but I think if anything, not just the families, but look, how do you prevent an issue or address a problem if you don't actually get to the source of it, why did this person do exactly what it is that they do? Now, I'd make the argument and I think a lot of us, everybody here would agree. I think there's certainly a cultural issue that would have someone carry out something that's so atrocious. Something is fundamentally wrong, but I want to get it corrected. I would want something like this to never ever happen again. You think the police departments wouldn't want something like this to never happen again. So you have to get to the source of the issue. What turn... You're all, you're back crazy, back crap crazy, if you are going to do something like that regardless. So let's figure out why you did it. The people shouldn't know. So anybody, because this is something like you may be having a ticking time bomb that is near you, and maybe you can get to that person before they take that step, but you have to be honest about it. And this is what frustrates me so much about problems like this, because everybody wants to talk around it, right? Because they're afraid of who it might demonize. And it's like, that's not how problems get addressed. In any capacity, it doesn't matter what it's about. You can't just scurge around it and say, well, it's a problem. I know it's blowing up in my face, but we're not going to actually get to the source of it. Well, to me, it sounds like you don't actually want to prevent crap like this from happening, which is why they go to the guns and everything else trying to point to these external factors when all that was was just a tool for an insane person to carry something out. So what happened culturally that had this person go as crazy as they did? And if it demonizes someone or a side or something it is that they're doing, so what? But we want to prevent it. So we got to get to the source of it. Yeah, I, it just is so frustrating. It's not just, local police departments, but it just seems to be the overwhelming mentality in law enforcement is like, no, we should be allowed to withhold documents that I think should be publicly accessible. Case in point, the FBI, I mean, I realized that they backed down eventually, but they were about to hold the House was about to hold Chris Ray in contempt of Congress because the FBI, they just flat out refused to turn over a subpoena document. And again, here, it's like, you guys, you like you're supposed to report to the people, right? Not the, not the other way around. And I think that they've just lost sight of that when they were busy, you know, arresting families for eating in restaurants during COVID. And moms who took their kids to the park to let them get fresh air and weren't wearing masks or whatever or business owners that decided to take it in their own hands during the summer of life in 2020, right? Get rid of these looters. Yeah. And then who they imagine police are like, you got to be scummered earth to sit up there and go try to, oh, I'm going to arrest you from, I don't care. This whole, oh, we're just doing our jobs. I'm tired. I know I'm an anarchist at the table. So I'm always going to grab about this. But maybe you shouldn't. If your job requires you to go against the will of the people that you're supposedly serving, protecting, you don't get to fall back on, well, I'm just doing my job. Maybe you shouldn't at that point. Right. Well, I mean, just like the man, did you see the man in Philadelphia who was arrested at on public property because- Putting a Bible verse. Absolutely. And I think, so obviously conservatives have a tendency to back the blue. And if you guys follow me online, you'll know I have never tweeted out back the blue. And it's not because I'm anti-cop, but it's just ultimately police are agents of the state. And we have to understand that I know conservatives like law and order, but we need to understand that politicians and their laws are only as good as the people who enforce them. And that is cops. And the same goes with the FBI who are really just fed cops. All of those agencies. So I'm actually happy that over the last few years, especially with COVID conservatives are kind of waking up to that, because I feel like for too long, there's been this almost like, oh, well, we can't question the police. It's like, no, they're basically just doing what the politicians are telling them to. Right. That's especially the case with the Nashville shooter, because it just doesn't seem organic, right? Because we're talking about an actual PD. They were handling the- I think I think was on the same page that they were doing a great job. But then it feels like there was definitely outside interference. I bet it was a feds FBI or someone like that. And it's just a reminder that these people are not your friends. I mean, it's like, if they're not busy trying to entrap some people, then they're trying to, I guess, hide information that makes their side or someone look bad. It doesn't seem like they're actually doing much to protect the everyday person. Yeah, I totally agree. Oh, and by the way, just as a caveat, because I feel like someone always gets mad whenever we talk about the police or teachers or whatever where we're talking about a group. Like, I'm sure you or someone you know is a good cop. Like, Ned, you're not all well, he might say you're all bad. I mean- Hey, you're wrecking towards me. Don't direct towards therapy, man. I would not say you're all bad. I would not say you're all bad. There may be some people who do. I don't. But I'm tired of people, you know, like, Sarah, you're saying all teachers are bad or all cops are bad people. I'm not saying that. I am saying that about teachers. So like, you can go after him. We got it all covered. They come after both of us. Don't attack us. I'm good with all of that. All right, I want to get to the story really quickly, you know, for personal reasons before we have to take a break. Three men who peacefully protested at an all ages drag brunch on April 23 in Fort Worth, Texas have sued the local Dallas Antifa group that attacked them with pepper spray. The lawsuit states that the violent extremist group created a dossier prior to the attack and knew who they were targeting, which I know to be absolutely true because I have been at these events and they know exactly who we all are and try to taunt everyone who is there to protest children being sexualized. And so the plaintiffs were across the street and Antifa approached them. I know we played the video, but for those that didn't see it, Antifa approached them across the street and approached them to harass them and then later, of course, spray them with pepper spray. It was all on police tape. These people got arrested. It was Samuel Folks, Christopher Gillitt, Meghan Grant, and Benjamin Hennill Song, who were some of the members of Elm Fork John Brown Gun Club, they call themselves, who were congregated nearby. And can you throw up that picture of the three of them again really quickly? I didn't know Danny DeVito dyed his hair blue, but that is just not a good color on him. So they are being sued. And I would say more of this. I know our friend Alex Stein goes on these little excursions and gets pushed and shoved and spit at and all of that. And I'm like, any time you are a peaceful protester exercising your First Amendment right, and someone does that to you, sue the s*** out of them. Sorry. Hey, how's this about the good? Go ahead. Usually this is reserved for me. I know, I know, I know. Thank you. I just, I can't like, just sue the crap out of them because it's the only way that you will make them stop. Is it the only way though, because think about this, this is an organized group enacting violence across state lines and teeth is everywhere. If only there were some type of agency who would have it under their purview to tackle this type of thing. I don't know. They're probably busy going undercover at PTA meetings though. Yeah, so bigger fish to fry. Well, there are a lot of parents who are domestic terrorists. So they only have so many resources. How much of our tax dollars go to those organizations? Too much. Let's just say that. All of it's too much to be fair, because they're still in front of us. But man, I don't like these little weirdos. I mean, I go out a lot. I've never had that experience. I'm not saying I'm welcoming this experience by any means. And I advise if you do, if I'm around, right, and I go to a little events and stuff like that, and I haven't had that experience. But I just could imagine just going somewhere peacefully protesting and getting pepper spray by some of the blue hair. I just be, I be more disrespected by the fact that you have blue hair and dead that to me as opposed to like the actual pepper spray. Like I'm like, how the fact that you had the audacity to do that with that colored hair. I mean, but it's true. Like the people we saw their photos, I mean, physiognomy check never lies. And the thing is, these people, they're so cowardly, they only ever attack in groups, right? Because you know, like if I- Their face is covered by it. Exactly. Like I'm alone, but I know if I was in a room, you know, with one of those alone, I mean, they'd try to molest me because they're male feminists, let's be real. But it's like they would not have the courage or the, you know, anything to just be upfront with their views and try to just say it straight to my face. They would never. They always go underhanded. They try these dirty tactics just so representative of like the core of their movement. Yeah, it really couldn't have happened to a more deserving group of people in this case. All right, we got to take a quick break. We'll be back. This is the part of the show where we answer your questions that you guys have been sending over at dearceraatheblaze.com because Dear Abby's dead. So we're Eric Hanks, a set in shame whenever I say that. Okay, all right. So make sure to send in your questions and we will answer them. This one is Dear Sarah. I listen every single day and love this show. So when you say to your audience, get your kids the hell out of public school, we have the perfect person here today to answer this question because he is of course the the ones who so famously says that every time. Get your kids the hell out of public school. I know I need to and I want to but I need your advice on how to. One of my children is for it but the other who is eight hates the idea. My husband is against it because his mother was a teacher and has a different view of public education than me. He is non-political and doesn't see it as a problem. When I bring up the examples that you talk about on your show, he asks, did you hear this on the blaze? Oh, boo. How do I get him on board? He doesn't think what is going on is indoctrination. I know homeschooling and the logistics of working from home with two kids will be tough. I'm willing to make sacrifices but my husband isn't. Sincerely, hopeful homeschooling mother. So I would say number one, I think you should have a little bit of like a little bit more pull because your mom, I'm sorry the dad's out there are going to be mad at me but that just is kind of the way that it is but right? Kind of percent. You're mom and you need to flex that whenever whenever necessary which I think this would be in a time where it is absolutely necessary to flex but what I would also tell you is as much as it pains me to hear that your husband says, did you hear this on the blaze like it's some sort of conspiracy theory? I would get it in front of him. Go to the local library, find the books that we're talking about that are actually available to kids in schools, show him the pages, right? Show him the videos of the drag queens going into schools and twerking for them or whatever you are seeing. Don't just tell him about it. Get it in front of him and show him so that he sees that you are actually talking about something that happened and we're not just a bunch of tinfoil hat wearing people talking about things that don't exist. I think the more that you can get the actual evidence directly in front of his eyeballs and have him answer for whether or not he wants his children to be exposed to that, I think we'll sell it far more than saying your favorite blaze host or whatever like said a thing happened that he doesn't think is true. I don't know. Let's say you guys. So there is absolutely no advantage that public school has over homeschooled none. None. Let's look at the things that people say like oh well your kids not going to be able to read. Okay public schools, one talks test scores, public school children are there struggling to keep up with what they're supposed to know. Consistently we see that homeschool kids excel in basically all areas of academics that public school kids do not. So there's that argument gone. Second oh there won't be socialized. Socialized to what become trans or non-binary is that the socialization that you're sending your kid to school for? No absolutely not. There are homeschooled co-ops, church groups, you name it. There are so many people who are homeschooling now that the whole socialization thing really doesn't apply and don't forget not only are you getting socialization in public school, it's the wrong type of socialization. We're talking about bullying, exposure to drugs, sex, you name it not just from teachers but from other students as well. There's curriculum online that you can go to. You don't need to be an education expert in order to do this and I think you're right. The examples that we talk about about you know sexual books or LGBT stuff it's not just in theory. Odds are yes it is at your local public library, at your kids library so yeah go go check it out because I guarantee you Odds are it's probably there. Yeah all right what we're going to do is we're going to take a break and then I want Eric to answer. We'll be right back. All right I want to make sure that the get your kids a hell out of public school guy has a chance to respond to them. Well I think it's important because you did bring up the fact that well this is something that you're willing to do willing to sacrifice and all that stuff and this is that's the that's really the more difficult thing to convince other people of and I'm always like if not for your kids then for who would make a sacrifice for anybody if you wouldn't if you wouldn't do it for them but you understand how right now agree with everybody here put it into their faces and show them this is exactly what's happening but the public school unfortunately the education we talked about this a little off air they've convinced a lot of people that it's unaffordable and it's like out of reach and you just be so surprised definitely with co-ops and all that that this is very very doable and right now it's more doable than it ever ever has been. And I would say I mean there are local little everywhere local homeschool resource centers we can go look through the curriculum I've used Saxon I've used the good and the beautiful I've used so many that I would highly recommend they're very easy. I was going oh yeah yeah yeah and you know we were talking off air we were done oftentimes with my son in what third grade an hour and a half it's not it's not eight to five it's not eight to three thirty or whatever school makes you think that it is it takes much less time when you're teaching your kid and then you can also teach them cooking at lunch and other things that they're not going to be getting from school so I appreciate you guys being here by the way everyone make sure you go to Eric's Twitter he's got some really fun announcements I saw him too Monday that's so exciting Lauren thank you for being here stream and subscribe to more Blaze Media content at the blaze.com slash podcasts"
