Salem News Channel has the greatest collection of conservative minds all in one place. People you know and trust, like Dennis Prager, Eric Metaxas, Charlie Kurt and more. Unfiltered, unapologetic, truth. Find what you're searching for at SNC.TV And on local now, Channel 525. Dear friends, you know me. I love listening to radio have done since I was a little boy in especially long form radio. The likes of, you know, John Batcher and others who have amazing guests and get to really talk about the issues beyond the usual two or three minutes one has on usual interviews, especially on television. I'm always excited because of the guests we have on our show. But sometimes certain guests are more exciting than others. There's a wonderful lady. We've been trying to get back on this show for months and months. She's too busy hanging out with the likes of Jordan Peterson and writing new books. We're so excited to have her back. Dr. Marian Grossman. It's been far too long. Yes, it has been Dr. Gorka. Thanks for having me. So I haven't seen the podcast yet. I don't know if it's out yet. How was your interview with Dr. Peterson? Oh, it was it was phenomenal. Very, very special to have an opportunity to speak to somebody who's so so brilliant and you know, can really dig deep into the ideas. It was a it was a great experience for me. Not just somebody who's brilliant, but somebody who is outspoken and courageous. That is one commonality you have with him because you are a very, very brave woman. We're super excited to hear about your new book. It will be out officially in a few weeks time in July. Let's put it up on the screen. It is incredible title lost in trans nation. A child psychiatrist's guide out of the madness with a forward by the one and only Dr. Jordan B. Peterson. I'm ordering it in the break right now. I'm going to pre order it before we get to the subject of the book. I have so many questions to ask you, but for those who missed prior discussions here on my radio shown on my Newsmax TV show, would you just take a moment to introduce yourself and what you have been doing in the health sector professionally? Sure. Well, I'm a child and adolescent and adult psychiatrist. I currently, my practice consists of young people who are distressed about their sex bodies and their parents. So I got into this many years ago. I was about 15 years ago began to look into what kids are being taught in sex education. And I was quite shocked to discover that kids even 15 years ago, even 20 years ago, were being taught that disembodiment or to be completely divorced, to have your mind, your identity divorced from your biology, from your sex body, was a totally normal condition. And this has been taught to young kids for many, many years. This is to use the vernacular. This is the justification that's used for quote unquote transitioning. The idea that a child is quote unquote born in the wrong body. Is that what we're talking about? That's exactly what we're talking about. The idea of being born in the wrong body and that it is just a variation of human expression to be to have the mind of a male and to have the body of a female. And then therefore the body we're told the kids are told has to be aligned, so to speak, with the mind. These are the ideas that I'm trying to warn. You know, we have we have a dire situation here. Yeah. This is this is a 911 emergency in the homes of every single home in this country. Must be prepared for the possibility that your child either tomorrow or next year or in five years or in 10 years will come home and say, mom, dad, I'm not your daughter. I'm your son. I'm asking you, I'm telling you to use this new name and these new pronouns. Make an appointment for me at the gender clinic. I need hormones and PS. If you won't go along with this and support me, I will find another family who will. Yeah, I want to dive into eventually how we got to this state of affairs, to this, you know, this 911 situation, as you call it, but we have the luxury of having you here with decades of experience. Could you just give us a diagnosis or a snapshot given everything that you practiced in that time? How much has the medical environment changed? How much of what you are witnessing today is the antithesis or a bizarre upside down version of what you've seen for decades because it seems to me as if we're witnessing something that we've never seen the likes of before. You are correct that we have never seen the likes of this before, meaning we have never had the mental health field. The entire mental health and medical and educational systems and the authorities within the government and legal authorities, we've never had a situation where they're actually endorsing a belief system, which is what I consider it. A belief system, not based in any sort of medical or scientific foundation, a belief system regarding gender identity, which in and of itself is a very vague, non scientific concept. Right, we've never had a situation where all these establishment parts of our society are all in joint effort promoting these ideas aggressively to our youth. And we just to respond to your question, in my profession in psychiatry, it was always considered a disorder. If a person comes in your office and they have a severe sense of discomfort with any aspect of their of their of their bodies, including their sex. So until 10 years ago, we called this gender identity disorder. It was extremely rare. To the point that 20 years ago, Dr. Gorca, there were only two clinics in the entire world. In the entire world, there was one in Toronto. And there was one in the Netherlands in Holland to help individuals, both young kids and adults who had gender identity disorder. I never expected when I was, I learned about, I heard about it in medical school or in my training to become a child psychiatrist. I never expected to see one case because it was so very rare. And now here I am. And that is all that I do. So yes. Is it right? I think this is Jordan Peterson's observation that this is the only disorder psychiatric disorder that we quote unquote affirm. Yes, you are right. You're a girl who is in fact a man. We don't do that with schizophrenia. We don't do it with multiple personality disorders. We don't do it with bulimia or anorexia. We don't we don't confirm the person's mental state and say, yes, that's correct. Is this the only one that medical science says, yes, we agree with the patient's disorder? Well, certainly if someone comes and says I'm depressed or I'm anxious and they show evidence of that, then of course we agree with them. But what you're speaking about is a belief in a falsehood. Yes. So we affirm something that is not the case. But if somebody comes in who weighs 80 pounds and she says, I'm fat. Doctors don't say to this anorexic. Yes, you are fat. Well, of course not. So that would be that's a delusion. Right. And you know, that's the patient is mixed up and misinterpreting reality. It's not that she doesn't actually think of herself as being fat because she does. Correct. It's a distorted thinking. It's a distorted perception. It's a distorted belief. But of course we're not going to agree with her. Right. It is the doctor's job not to reinforce something that is a distortion of reality. But to help that patient, we're talking to Dr. Miriam Grossman Miriam Grossman MD dot com is the website.

It's one of the most beautiful things you can do today or any day. Remember what Jesus our Savior told us. Come on to me the little ones better. A mill stone were wrapped around the neck of someone who harms a child. Well, let's help those who are most vulnerable over a million girls and boys in America have a parent behind bars. They are vulnerable. They feel guilt for the sins of their parents. Let's get them to a safe place this summer with the prison fellowship. It is called the angel tree camp. Two hundred dollars per child provides them a Christ centric safe summer camp. That could be you donate as little or as much as you can go right now to said Gorka.com and click on the angel tree banner at the top. You could be literally saving a life. You can call in your donation as well on 888-206-2794. That's treble eight 206-274 or just go to said Gorka.com in the angel tree banner. Dear friends, I want to share with you the incredible impact your donations to the prison fellowship program are having. Every year we ask for your support for the angel tree summer camps that take children, young boys and girls who've lost a mother or father to the prison system to a safe Christian summer camp. Just listen to two of the responses. I have them written out. This is in the children's own handwriting. Let me read to you two of what the campers have to say about your support. To me, the prison fellowship is an oasis of spiritual nourishment. Another one. The prison fellowship is a friend in a friendless place. Incredibly powerful words. These are vulnerable children. There's more than a million of them in America and they feel guilty for their parents' crimes for no through fault of their own. Sadly, more than 70% of them will end up incarcerated themselves. We want to break that cycle. We want to help them. Please donate to date. Cost $200 per child per summer camp. But whatever you donate will make a difference.

Dr Grossman, for those who haven't seen it, I strongly recommend the What is a Woman documentary by Matt Walls, where people of your profession, medical doctors, MDs, make some quite startling statements. Two of them I would like to run past you because I just don't believe them. I know what they are. I think you probably know what they are. Number one, which is the ideological justification that is used most commonly for the transitioning of minors, is that if you don't do this, if you don't agree with that 14-year-old girl that she should have a double mastectomy, should be given hormone treatment, that she's going to commit suicide. So this is a suicide prevention intervention. The transitioning saves lives, number one. And then the second one, which it just takes literally 30 seconds on a search engine to disprove, that the hormonal therapy, the use of Lupron and other drugs to delay puberty is 100% reversible. In the film, in Matt Waters film, a doctor, I think ahead of one of these clinics, actually says it's analogous to pressing the pause button on a tape player, on an iPod, and you can just press play again whenever you want, and that child, five years later, ten years later as an adult, will magically start puberty again. Can you address the suicide prevention aspect and the pausing of puberty? It's all reversible. Yes, I'm happy to do that. In terms of threatening parents and telling them if you do not support your child in their new fake identity, your child is at increased risk, vastly increased risk, they're going to tell you, of committing suicide, that is simply the worst emotional manipulation that can be done to a parent, and it is unfounded. It is simply unfounded. Yes, these kids are at some increased risk of suicidal thoughts, suicidal behaviors, and completed suicides. But listen closely. These are kids who already have underlying psychiatric problems, which puts them at the same or close to the same risk of increased suicidality. And many of these kids are gay or lesbian, and that also puts them at increased risk of suicide. And finally, and most importantly, the kids who are quote unquote transitioned socially and or medically transitioned are not at any decreased risk of suicide. If anything, they're at increased risk of mental health issues. So, the idea that you use chemicals and then surgery for a full transition and create as a result an adult who cannot have sexual pleasure and who is sterile, the idea that the mental health of that individual is somehow strengthened by being in a state that is clearly faux is fake. It just seems beggars believe that anybody and I think the figures are what between 35 and 45% of suicidal ideation for those who actually go through transition. For people that go through transition and we only have a few good long term studies. Because like I said before, this used to be a very rare phenomenon. So we don't have a lot of data and the data that we have is actually poor quality. But the studies that we have the long term ones. Yes, they do show that people who have been through the transition hormones and surgery continue to be in need of psychiatric care and continue to have vastly elevated rates of suicide compared to the rest of the population. And these are untruths. And the idea that you can temporarily pause puberty and just started again in three years time, four years time. Listen, I'm very baffled by my colleagues saying things like this. They know that biological systems don't work like that. We are complex, unbelievably complex biological systems. And if puberty is supposed to happen at a given time in life, it's not supposed to happen when you're four. It's not supposed to happen when you're 20. It's supposed to happen when you're 11, 12, 13 years old. That's when your body is expecting puberty to happen. If we delay that puberty and block that puberty, we're not only blocking the development of the sex characteristics like breasts and body hair and so and a lowered voice. We're blocking total development of every system in the body, including the brain. Do we have any evidence that blocking that development for two, three, four years and then, and then initiating a synthetic puberty of the opposite sex, which is what's happening in these kids. Their organic natural puberty is being blocked. And then 98 to 99% of them go on to cross sex hormones and a synthetic puberty. Is that going to be the same puberty as if they had gone through an organic natural puberty? Of course not. We don't know the answer to that question. It is an experiment. It's an experiment on vulnerable kids. It's we we you know, hanged people. We've sent people to prison for life. We hunted down those who experimented on children in the death camps of the Third Reich. Now we are doing it in a free society. That's how perverse the current situation is. I'm Sebastian Gorka.

First things first. I think John Peterson, Dr. Peterson talks about this as well. The idea that we have gender and sex and they're completely different. And one is socially generated and artificial and the other is biological, but irrelevant to your identity. This has to be in a Christian. This has to be a man made ideological inject into the medical practice because since the dawn of time, we've had men and women with different characteristics. Some men are butcher than others. Some women are more feminine than others, but we didn't separate a sexual identity from their biological sex. Was there a moment in time where the medical profession said, yes, this thing called XY chromosomes and XX chromosomes, that's just incidental to one's identity? Where did this begin? I provide all this information to parents. Parents have to understand the foundation of this belief system. And it goes back, you're asking great questions. It does go back to John Money, who in the 50s came up with this theory that biological sex is separate from one's identity as male or female. And that identity is a social construct and so on and so forth. These ideas percolated through academia and through medicine and through society. And over the decades became more and more radical. Then they were injected into sex education. And now we've come to the point where, like I said earlier, the medical field has been captured. And has been taken over by these irrational belief system, including psychiatry. Ten years ago, psychiatry, a small group of psychiatrists made the decision when they were putting together the new DSM, which is the Bible, the handbook of psychiatric disorders. The diagnostic manual. Yeah, correct. They made the decision, a small committee of people, to remove gender identity disorder and call it instead gender dysphoria. And what that essentially did was it normalized the condition of having distress over your sexed body. It normalized the desire to be the opposite sex and it no longer called it a disorder. And that was a watershed moment. And that was 10 years ago. The changes began in society and in medicine and in sex education began long before this. So when the DSM finally cave, it was because there was so much external pressure. And they caved so that transgenderism would no longer be associated with stigma. That was the main, the motivation was compassion for individuals who suffer from this condition. And believe me, it is a terrible condition to suffer from. But in making it in normalizing it, it opened the door for for kids to be educated that this is all normal and you need to explore your identity and you may have been born in the wrong body. And if that's the case, you have the right, the civil right to have access to these risky medical interventions. All you have to say is you need them. You don't, there's no gatekeeping. There's no doctor coming in and saying, well, just wait a minute. Let's look at what's going on. You have anxiety, you have autism. You know, your family is going through trouble right now. Why don't we look at those things? No, you're not supposed to do that. I am told by my professional organizations that if a child comes into my office, they could be four years old. It doesn't matter. I am supposed to honor their new name, new pronouns and new identity. Incredible. And for those who don't know the backstory, please take some time or I've actually ordered the book right now. Look, order placed. Thanks. I've ordered her book already while she was talking. It's so important. You need to get the book lost in trans nation, a child psychiatrist's guide out of the madness. These are people, Alfred Kinsey, John Money. These are people who said things like infants have orgasms. They can have up to, you know, 30 orgasms in a day who literally did experiments on young boys who both a twin, a pair who committed suicide because of what was done to them by these people.

All right, so let's stay on this question of how things were changed. We talked about the psychiatric profession, but it's far broader than the psychiatric profession today, Dr. Grossman. We have the likes of Dylan Mulvaney, who on the quote unquote, to quote him, on the 365th day of his womanhood, womanhood. This is a man who has not had any kind of surgery as far as we know, is made the face for the third most popular beer in the world. Butlide is paying a price for that, but that's not the point. It tells you the level of promotion that this concept is now enjoying, or whether it's the US Navy that's hiring a literal drag queen to recruit for the US Navy. Have you identified, and look, I've read, I bought the book, I haven't read it yet, I want everybody to buy it, who's one of the millions of people watching this show. But have you identified in lost in, in trans nation or in your work, Dr. Grossman? How is this being done? How do we go from, you said there were two clinics in the world that dealt with the original gender, this identity disorder? And now we have at least, we have 13 hospitals, 13 hospitals in America that are performing transgender surgeries. We have at least, we have at least 100 places in this country where this is going on. And if I could just make a comment, what you said about Dylan, if I could just make a comment about Dylan Mulvaney, Dylan Mulvaney, I don't care how many surgeries Dylan gets, he's still a man. It makes no, a woman, you cannot become a woman through having various surgeries and silicone put into your body and, you know, a faux vagina. That's not a woman. So I don't care how many. No, you're absolutely right. And I'm so glad you said that. So the question I have is, have you identified how this is being done? I don't want to believe in a conspiracy theory that, you know, there's a smokey room somewhere and people sit down and say, yes, we are going to create this social psychiatric pandemic and you're going to do it in the schools. You're going to do it in the hospitals. Where is this? What is the transmission belt of all of this? You know, I can speak best about my own profession. And what I can say is that when you go to medical school and you do a residency, it is, you know, you are taught. It's just understood that there's a chain of trust. You cannot possibly know everything that you need to know. You know, I'm a child psychiatrist. If I was trying to get expertise in every area of child psychiatry, I wouldn't be able to eat or sleep or there would be no way to do that. So what do you do? You trust your professional organizations. So, for example, I have the American Academy of Child Malice and Psychiatry. I would, at one time, I did completely trust whatever they were telling me on a given subject. So if I had a child come into my office who had obsessive compulsive disorder, I might go to the American Academy of Child Malice and Psychiatry and see what are their treatment guidelines. What are they telling people like myself who are seeing the kids in my office day in and day out? What are they advising me on what to do? And I trust them. I don't have the time to sit day and night and go look up every single study on OCD. So that is how it works in medicine. And what happened in medicine is that a small but very vocal and aggressive group of activists have succeeded in coming in and taking over the organizations by bullying and intimidation. I understand that. I understand how the loud minority can affect change. But here's what I fail to comprehend. And let's put up Elon Musk. God bless him. Tweeted this out recently to the ire of those activists. He tweeted out that if a doctor sterilizes a child before they are consenting adult, they should go to prison for life. And I wholeheartedly agree. For me, Dr. Grossman, I can't even imagine. I cannot put myself in a position with a son who is considering entering the medical field himself. I cannot imagine somebody who's had seven years of training, residencies, worked 20 hour days, anesthetize a 14 year old girl and take a scalpel to their breasts to remove both healthy organs. Because of some activist pressure that was put upon his profession. For me, let me ask you, thusly, for me, Dr. Grossman, that's no longer a medical professional. That's not a doctor. That's a brute. That's an animal. That's a healthy child. That is not a living for life. Am I wrong? I share your astonishment and I share your, what do we want to call it? Horror. Horror. But let me, let me say this. There are, you see, first of all, there's the financial element. Let's not dismiss the financial part of it. A lot, a lot of money to be made in these procedures. But putting the money aside, I believe that there are doctors who genuinely have, you know, they just drank the Kool-Aid and they say, look, this is a disorder. This is a condition. This is, you know, all the American society of the endocrinologist, the big organizations that represent transgender health, the American account of pediatrics, they're all saying that this is what I should be doing. So I'm doing it. Okay. So, these are educated individuals. They know that that girl's breasts, they're not disease-ridden. They're not full of metastasized cancer. They know they're functioning. I mean, I'm sorry. Believing it? Okay. Well, so did the Third Reich. So did the members of the SS believe that they were creating a great Germany. I don't care. It's evil. These are legitimate questions. And I believe that it's evil as well. I'm trying as a psychiatrist to climb into the minds of some of these surgeons and endocrinologists. These are the two specialties. The endocrinologists are giving the blockers and the cressics hormones. Okay. And the surgeons. And I struggle with the same horror that you have. How the heck are they doing this? And all I can come out with is that there's a lot of money and that this is a trend that people are buying into and surgeons and doctors and medical students. This is being, they're being inundated with this belief system that these kids are born in the wrong body and that the only solution, only one solution for them is to be medicalized and to change their bodies. And we have a, that's why I'm saying this is a dire situation and parents have to understand before their kid comes home and starts talking about being in the opposite sex. They have to start years before they have to reach their child early on and explain to their child that no one is born in the wrong body. And that is an, that is a false mixed up idea. That is a bogus idea. All I know is there are people like you who have been just as bombarded by this garbage, by these lies and refuse, refuse to be inculcated by them. That's, that's what we need. There's no excuse for what they're doing when we have people like Miriam Grossman out there. I'm Sebastian Gorker.

Less than anyone who's not of the medical profession think that we're discussing a storm in a teacup. Dr. Grossman, will you give us some sense of the numbers beyond the one clinic in Holland, the one clinic in Canada? Today, we are seeing just mind-numbing figures for children who say they identify with the sex that they were not, I'm not even going to use their language, who say they're not of the sex that they are. It is a veritable explosion, is it not? It certainly is. It's an epidemic. We have, there was a study that came out of Pittsburgh not long ago that showed in their high schools, something like 10% or even higher of the kids were identifying as something other than their sex. And I too, Dr. Gorka, like yourself, try to avoid the language. The language is weaponized. The language is being used to change the way that we think. And for that reason, I do not use in my book, I do not use, I don't do the pronoun thing. I'm not calling individuals like Dr. Admiral Levine. I am not calling the Admiral by she and her and other individuals as well. I refuse to do that. No, that's not all well warned us. If you can control the language, you basically captured free thought. So let's talk about those who are in this predicament because you are a medical professional and you are here to help those. What is your advice to parents or to adolescents? What resources could they rely upon? So if you hear this story at an early stage or if this emotional blackmail is being used against a parent, what beginning steps would you advise them? Well, I am urging all parents to be informed and to be proactive. So it doesn't matter if your child is one or 10 or 15. This could happen in your family. No family is immune to this catastrophic situation of a child claiming to be the opposite sex. And I'm not using the word catastrophic lightly. It really is a catastrophe. I have talked to hundreds and hundreds of parents and I've received even more than that emails from all over the world. For my book, I did a survey of parents who have kids with gender dysphoria, which is the term that's currently used instead of gender identity disorder. And I asked them, what would you tell what would your advice be to other families, to families who are not where you are right now? There are five years away from it or 10 years away from it. What would your advice be? And I have responses from 500 parents from 17 different countries. And I incorporate that advice into my book. And one of the number one pieces of advice is that you have to reach your child first with the proper reality based ideas biologically based effects about being a boy or a girl. And how that occurs at conception. It is not something that is randomly assigned at birth. It is not something that is a mistake. I'm not talking here about the very, very rare .02% of individuals that might be born with some sort of chromosomal or medical disorder in which they truly do have maybe a mixture of male or female or what have you. Those are those are extremely rare conditions. So I provide parents with basic biology that they need to know and they need to understand. I provide them with an understanding of where the ideology came from going back to John Money, how it developed over the decades, how it got into the schools, how the schools cannot be trusted. The schools are sad to say this. I really am. But we have to live in reality. If you are sending your kid to a public school or even a non-public school, you sure as heck better find out what's going on in that school. Okay, because they are centers of indoctrination for this ideology. You have to reach your child first. So when your child hears these ideas, they've already, they're not caught off guard and they can recognize them as faulty ideas. These are these are the important interviews. I'm angry right now because of what we are facing. Just a mere phrase that our guests just had to use introducing your children to reality based ideas. We shouldn't have to be introducing and keeping our children based in reality. Reality is reality. Those who are undermining the children's grasp of reality are the problem. I'm angry, but I'm also buoyed because Mirin Grossman is a living example of what Vatslav Havel, what Solzhenitsyn spoke of, one person speaking the truth can make a whole empire of lies collapse.

Our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. I know not what course others may take. But as for me, give me liberty or give me death. The world will little note or long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. I have a dream to do. And not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall. I can hear you, the rest of the world hears you and the people. And the people who knock these buildings down will hear all of us soon. And we will make America great again. This is America first with Sebastian Gorka. Every time our nation has produced leadership that is called upon this country to do hard things, the American people have always risen to the challenge. And we will again. We just need government as good as our people to do. I believe in the American people. And I have faith. God is not done with America yet. And together we can bring this country back at the best days for the greatest nation on earth are yet to come. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. How many times can you mention God in a campaign announcement? I don't know if that's a record there for a very, very short one. It's official. My former colleague, the former vice president of the United States, Mike Pence has declared. What is that, Jeff? Are we up to 10? How many is that 11? How many candidates have we got already? I think it's 11 of you count Bolton, but the news is in counting him. Poor old John Bolton. Maybe he shouldn't have announced his candidacy on British television. That's a little bit weird, John. Welcome, dear friends. Greetings. You are listening to America first. Hopefully you're watching us as well on your television on the Salem News Channel app. We have a packed program for you today and lots of news for a Wednesday. Lots of news. Let me just start with that announcement from my former colleague. Let me be explicit here. Full disclosure. I had no problems with Mike Pence when I was in the White House. In fact, of all the people I worked with, he was perhaps the nicest and most polite to me outside of the Secret Service officers. I remember, for some reason, because I'd be walking back and forth from the Oval Office with regularity, walking around the West Wing, I would bump into him to the vice president more than anybody else. His office is Caddy Corner on the dog leg of the West Wing, which, by the way, it's not like the TV show. You can't walk around the West Wing for an hour and a half. It's literally two corridors. It takes about 30 seconds to walk through the whole of the West Wing. But I'd bump into him all the time. Every time he made an effort, he'd be polite. He'd say, good morning, Sam, or good afternoon. On occasion, he'd stop, and he'd ask me questions, national security questions. I remember explicitly one, I think it was on a Friday night, he said, I've got to do the Sunday morning shows, and they want me to talk about Iran and the JCPOA. What are the most important things I should tell them? It wasn't just Chit Chat, it wasn't water cooler stuff. He wanted my take on issues that were relevant to my portfolio. So, that was nice. It was a great colleague. However, however, at an event just a few hours ago that's been posted online, you can see it on my Twitter feed, he said the following, and I'll play the cut later, I'll send it to Jeff. This is Mike Pence. On January 6, President Trump demanded that I choose between him and the Constitution. I chose the Constitution, and I always will. Sorry, Mike. That's a lie. And this has nothing to do with politics. And it doesn't really, because you're a conservative, I'm a conservative. We both worked for the Republican president. But that statement is a lie. And I've said so on Twitter literally three minutes ago before we came online. Sadly, Mike, I reposted the video, sadly, Mike, you are lying. You actually betrayed the Constitution by refusing to use your enumerated powers to return suspicious electoral college returns to utterly corrupt states. You are therefore unfit to serve America again. Now, Twitter is not the ideal place to unpack complicated constitutional issues, but let's be clear here. The vice president does nothing. They have no power when it comes to the everyday running of the country or to the shaping of policy. They can be a proxy for the president. They can go and launch ships for him or go to state funerals when he's busy. But they have no real power. That's why the current evidence of vice president Biden taking five million dollars to change U.S. policy is so incredibly important. Because if that evidence that chairman Coma has seen proves to be valid, then the fact that it was the vice president who received the money is interesting because he couldn't change any policy. Obama would have had to change the policy. That's why the current story of Biden corruption is much, much bigger and could implicate and must by dent of the weakness of the vice president's office. Implicate others above him. And there's only one other person above him that then president Obama. However, there is one exception to the powers of a vice president. And that is in their role as president of the Senate. That's why we've seen Kamala Harris, you know, rush breathlessly in her armored limo to vote tie breaking votes in the Senate because that is the one power they have. They can tie they can vote tie breaking votes as the the ex officio president of the Senate. The vice president is the president of the Senate. So if there's a 50 50 split, the vice president can say, okay, I choose this side. And there's one more thing. As president of the Senate. It is the incumbent vice president. Who certifies the results of the electoral college in a presidential election. And the constitution is explicit is very clear. If the president of the Senate, the vice president has any issue with the electoral college votes as returned by the states. He is fully authorized as the president of the Senate to send those specific electoral college ballot returns back to the state in question for further investigation and validation. Mike, you didn't do that. And you should have for one very simple reason. In four states on election night, your boss, the president was winning was winning until those states in cities controlled by Democrats suspended vote counts. When the vote counting was re initiated, the following day, mystically, magically, the president's lead had been rescinded. And Joe Biden was the winner. On that alone, you should have exercised your constitutional powers as president of the Senate to send the electoral college votes back to those states who, by the way, this is the most shocking thing of all. The state houses of which were run by the GOP. The cities may have been Democrats cities like Atlanta or Philadelphia, but the state houses that run the presidential elections were run by Republicans who could have investigated those magical reversals, but you chose not to. You don't know how it happened. Wisped in your ear that, oh, no, the red MAGA HADID insurrectionists are here to get you. And you caved. You became a coward. And you said, oh, no, certified. Bye bye. I'm off to my bunker. Mike, a man is tested. Is tested at exactly those moments that they must do. You did the right thing when it is the hardest time to do the right thing. And you didn't. You shirked. You rejected your duty to the Constitution. And as such, unless you have some come to Jesus, may a call in front of America and you say, sorry, you remain unfit to serve. Okay, I had other things I wanted to talk about, but I'm out of time. We shall discuss Tucker and all the other breaking news and oh my gosh, Chris Lick at CNN. Bye bye. He's out after 13 months.
