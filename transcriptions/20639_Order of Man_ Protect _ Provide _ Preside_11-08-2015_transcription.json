    "text": " More and more we're hearing that there is an attack or an assault on masculinity. Well, I don't believe that's necessarily true. My guest today, Ted Rice, shares with us why modern society is not the environment where a masculine male thrives. We talk about what has changed in the world and in men and what we need to do as guys to balance between the natural and modern man. You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears. Unbodly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You're not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged. Resilient. Strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become at the end of the day and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Welcome back to the Order Man podcast episode 21. Now I had a previous podcast and if I remember correctly, I ended it on the 21st episode. So now I'm tied with that one, but I have no plans for stopping what we're doing here at Order Man anytime soon. Now you know the drill, a couple of housekeeping items before we get rolling today. First, I mentioned last week that you can pick up the free resource and video by heading over to OrderMan.com. Skills. It's based on one of our most popular blog posts and YouTube videos and it's called the eight skill sets every man must master. And again, if you go to OrderMan.com. Skills, you can get access to that resource outlining the skills you need to develop as a man and exactly how to do it. Next we've had a couple of great reviews over the past week. So I really do appreciate that. It's hard to get reviews when you do a podcast. So if you've taken the time to leave one for me, I appreciate you taking the time to do it. If you haven't left a review yet, I ask what are you waiting for? Pause this episode, head over to OrderMan.com slash iTunes and get after it. Now remember guys, if you're working out or in the car or on a run and you need to get some of the resources that we mentioned today in this episode, the show notes can be found at OrderMan.com slash zero two one. Now I've overwhelmed you with all that information. Let me get to the guest, personal fitness trainer and fellow podcaster Ted Rice. He's worked with a ton of celebrities in his personal fitness training, including Ricky Martin, Robert Downey Jr. and Richard Branson to name a few. As with a lot of my guests and most successful men, he has overcome some huge adversities his life to get to where he is as a trainer and also the host of legendary life podcast. He's been busy over the past 16 years. He experiments with exercise, nutrition, supplementation and also methods for what works and what doesn't. And most importantly, and this is what we talk about today, he has a passion for helping men build muscle, lose fat, develop more confidence and really just go after the life that they want. So you'll hear that passion in the show today. Ted, thanks for joining us. I'm stoked to have you on the show today. I'm stoked to be here, Ryan. We're going to have a great conversation all about what it means to be a man. And I know that I've listened to your podcast, which was something former before and we'll talk a little bit about that. But you've been a big help as I've launched this podcast in the brand order of man. So I appreciate you and taking time to be on the show today. Oh, thanks. I really appreciate hearing that. And I've been inspired by other people to start what I do. So it's awesome to hear that I've passed that along. You definitely have. So why don't you tell me a little bit about and the guys that are listening a little bit about how you got into what you're doing now. And maybe before I get into that, it was the man project podcast. But more recently, you're now with doing legendary life. Is that right? I want to make sure I get that right. I got to pitch the name. And even before the man project, it was the alpha man project. And I kind of got away from that and found a name that something that I could grow into is a big reason and something that I connected to because the whole alpha man thing, I didn't. I thought it was a cool name and I'm terrible at coming up with names. It's just something I don't feel I'm very good at. And what I mean coming up with names, some people will hear that and be like, oh, alpha man project, what I mean is coming up with a name that I feel really connected to. So it took me a while to come up with something, alpha man project, that we dropped the alpha. Now it's legendary life and I really like it a lot. And like I said, it's connected with what my message is. I want people to live legendary lives. I want people to win at life. I want people to be successful in the way that they want to be successful in their life. And specifically men. So the focus hasn't changed. It's for men. I feel like as men, we are a little bit behind what women are doing in this new space of modern life, of modern technologically oriented life. Why do you think that is? Is there some things culturally? I mean, I have my own reasons, which is obviously why we are doing things that are very similar. But why do you think men and women are on a different path or wavelength or trajectory, if you will? Yeah, I think the environment today, and when I mean that, I'm talking about the US. I'm talking about Western countries. I think it's probably very different in other countries. But especially here in the US, I think the environment, the modern life here is set up for women to be more successful. Let's even be more specific in that. I think modern life really takes away from a man's power. And it does that in many ways. Number one, we don't have to be physical. And we don't have to go out and hunt for our food. We don't have to fuel dress the animal. We don't have to gather our food. We don't even have to really get into a fight anymore to protect our families or our communities or ourselves. That's really frowned upon. And I'm not saying fighting is good per se, but it brings out a certain level of internal power and physical power to being physical in an aggressive way. And that, we're an environment where basically you wake up, you go brush your teeth and do your hair or do whatever you do. You drive to work and you sit on your butt at work, then you come, you drive back home, sitting on your butt and come home, sit on your butt some more, eat dinner while watching TV. You're basically sitting on your ass the entire time. That does not do anything good for men. And it actually doesn't do anything good for women either. But to be more specific with men, we need that physical challenge for not just for our psychological well-being, but also for our physiological well-being. We're getting weaker, fatter, our hormones are getting messed up. There's research suggesting that testosterone is on the decline generationally, and that means that a six-year-old man today in 2015 has lower testosterone levels in general than the six-year-old men of several decades ago. Interesting. And there's research showing that there is a decline of testosterone with age. It's not necessarily because of the age. It's because of abuse and neglect. And the abuse comes from drinking too much coffee, being too stressed at work, working in jobs that aren't fulfilling our purpose and doing things we're not passionate about. And also feeling like we're maybe stuck in a certain type of relationship, maybe with a woman we don't want to be with, but we feel like we're obligated to be with because we're afraid of going out on our own, or we're afraid of the unknown and being single again, or we're just not doing the work to make that relationship that we are in awesome. And lack of sleep and too much alcohol, trying to drown out the way we feel with alcohol, with television, with Facebook, with pornography. And then there's the physical part where the muscles are shrinking, the amount of fat that you have on your body can actually turn your testosterone into estrogen. There's something called aromatase, which is an enzyme in your fat cells. And a lot of people think the more fat that you have, the more this aromatization, which is the process of turning testosterone into estrogen, they think that happens more often with people with more fat. And it makes sense. So there's all this stuff going on, and it's a result of the way modern life is set up. Not modern life for everyone, but for a majority of the men. Yeah, we talked a little bit just before we started recording that I just got back from a, it was three days, essentially, of hiking, and we hiked 40 plus miles over that three days. My wife and I and some friends. And it was hard, man. It was tough, especially the last 12 miles out of where we were. It was really, really difficult. But there's just something really exciting and really liberating, and just like the sense of accomplishment. And you're right, we don't get that stuff anymore. I got it as a child. I grew up in a scouting program, and I got to go out and fish and hunt and be around the guys. And then all of a sudden, I was expected to sit behind this desk for hours like you were saying. So my question is, how does a man get back to his roots, in a sense, even though modern society doesn't really facilitate getting back to your roots? Yeah, that's a fantastic question. Before I get into that, I do believe that I personally enjoy it the way society is right now. I enjoy, I found my way to do what I want to do. And I don't feel oppressed in any way. I don't feel like, you know, maybe some guy, I've seen guys say, oh, there's war on men. I personally do not feel that way. I totally respect other people who feel like they're under siege or their masculinities under siege. I personally feel that way though. And why I'm saying that is there's a way to get that for yourself. And I will say this also, I think there's two types of men out there in terms of culture, right? And we have like, like what you just said, where you grew up scouting and you were in the woods doing the scout stuff, building fires, making bow and arrows. I was not a scout that brings me to my next point is that there's these. So there's guys like you that grew up with all this survival training and being one with nature, maybe they did hunting and they're missing the other parts where they're maybe not so good at style, at going to a business meeting and pitching themselves to get hired or pitching a product. If they want to sell something, then there's the guys who are like the city boys who are good at, you know, they have their grooming down. They dress stylishly. Maybe they're a little smoother in those types of situations in business. And these are gross generalizations, but I think it's very helpful to think like this. And they're missing like the more the connection with nature. They're missing the connection with their masculine power. They don't know how to make a fire. They don't know how to feel, dress an animal. They don't know how to shoot a gun. They don't know how to do martial arts. And I really think if you want to be successful in modern life, you really have to find that balance of both for yourself or move to the woods and stay there, right? Or stay in the city and in the most upscale party town and hope you never get confronted with someone who wants to take your watch from you or, you know, let your woman run the show for you, right? Because you haven't stepped into your masculine power, so you don't step up in that relationship. So that's number one. Figure out where you're lacking in your life or where you need to maybe develop some skills. Is it on the side where you've been coddled physically and you need some intense physical experiences, you know, doing martial arts is great. Lifting weights is great. You mentioned tactical shooting, something you were going to do with the retreat, which I think is awesome, in which I've done as well. It really puts you into a moment because you don't want to have an accident, right? And there's a power with learning that skill and, you know, you got to figure out, is that what you need or do you need to work on your communication skills? Do you need to work on your empathy? Do you need to work on your compassion? Because I believe what you need to do is figure out where you're lacking and then work on that area. And so how do you find that out? Yeah. How do you know what you're lacking? Yeah. That comes with being self-aware, taking an honest look at your life. And if you're a guy who loves to fish and hunt and watch sports or play sports, but you have problems, maybe you go to work and you feel like, oh man, you know, I'm good at what I do, but I just don't get along with these kind of wussy other people. You know, if you're not progressing in your career, if you don't have a good network, well, then maybe that's where you need to spend your energy. Maybe you need to develop more of that side. So it starts with taking a self-in inventory and being self-aware. That's where it would start. And you got to be honest about yourself. And sometimes guys have trouble doing that. We don't want to... Right, I think our ego is getting away, right? Oh man, the fragile male ego. You know, I love guys and I have some great male friends, but I don't have a lot of them. And one of the issues is you got to find guys who are cool, who are comfortable with themselves. And self-aware is... Self-awareness is where that starts. I know for me, one of the things that's been successful for me is to look at what other guys are doing where I feel like, hey, that guy's really got it together and start emulating what they're doing. I mean, we're not looking at it from an envious standpoint or I wish I had what he had, but trying rather to figure out, okay, this guy's really proficient in business and that excites me or that's something I feel like I need to learn and start emulating what those people are doing. That's part of the reason you and I connected is because we were connected from other people. And I think we've got a... At least I have a respect for what you're doing and I want to emulate what you're doing. And so we need to look around and see what role models in a way that we have around that we can use some of their experiences and improve our lives as well. Yeah, I love it. Modeling people who are successful in the area that you want to improve. I love it, Ryan. That's a great one. And you can even... Beyond that would be to go and actually have a conversation with that guy without kissing his ass, without being envious, say, hey, man, I really respect the way you handle your self with women in the bar or with business. I saw you close that deal. Given honest, sincere compliment, one thing that I think guys have a hard time doing is admitting that there's men that are better than them in one area. I used to be like that and I'll tell you, I've evolved into a person who, if I think someone's dressed sharp, I'll give them a compliment on it. If I think someone's doing something awesome in any area, I go out of my way to give them a compliment. A sincere compliment, the competition that exists between men that really shouldn't be there at times will fade away. And you'll be surprised at how you can make someone feel comfortable and then perhaps even start a friendship or a mentorship or them taking time out of their day to give you some information on the thing that you want to get better at. I want to go back to... You alluded to the fact that men maybe aren't as successful or on the same path as women. Why do you see that as being the problem or why is that the problem? Are there some reasons why men maybe aren't as successful as they used to be or motivated or ambitious even? Yeah, it goes back to the thing we were just talking about. I believe that we're in a situation economically with the way modern business is going, where it's better to collaborate than to compete. And obviously there's always competition in that people are trying to do the same thing that you're doing. And a great example is us. You and me, Ryan. I have a show where I talk about very similar things that you talk about on your show. So in a way I should be like, man, let me see what Ryan's doing to make sure he's not doing as good of a job as me. And man, I don't want... No, I'm not going to recommend anybody for him to interview. I'm not going to really talk to him too much. I'll say hi, but he's my direct competition. Instead, and you can extrapolate this for anything that you may going through as speaking to the person listening, the man listening. But instead, Ryan, what we did was, hey, man, I really like what you're doing and you like what I'm doing. So what we're doing is we're collaborating. That is a more successful... Even if we had our egos wrapped up in it, which we don't, it would still be a more successful way to conduct business than if we would never work together. So I've introduced you to someone who I thought would be great for your show. You've had me on your show. I'll get you on my show. We're collaborating. We're forming our little posse, our little gang. A man who... Our tribe. Yeah, that's a better word than the other ones. Yeah, we got our gang set up. So yeah, we're setting up our tribe. We're setting up a group of people who are cool, who are all working towards empowering other men to do their own thing, right? To find their way, to do what they want, and to be happy doing it. Stop looking at other guys' competition. I'll tell you where I think that comes from. It's old biological programming when our tribes were very small. And man, if Ryan gets a head up, if a leg up on me, then he's going to get the women that I want, and there's not too many of them. That doesn't exist. That world doesn't exist. And a lot of the problems that guys have, I feel, come from this... What one author, I can't remember his name, called an evolutionary mismatch. And that's basically that our biological drives to compete with one another, to bash each other's heads in when someone cuts us off in traffic, even though it'll end us up in jail and will ruin our lives potentially. We feel that way, yet it doesn't help us in the way the world's set up right now. So get in control of that. And I know I kind of got off topic because it was asking about women, but I don't think I think women are very good at working together. I think they come together and support one another. They feel less competition. I think they feel, by the way, I think they feel a lot more competition for men in general because they... In some ways, I even think that women are more competitive with each other when it comes to that. But as far as business, they come to each other's aid. They really help promote one another. They're better socially in general than men are. We're like the guys who are like, oh, grumble. Are we going to talk about sports? Or we got to work on that and work at being better collaborators with each other and get away from that wiring that has us feel threatened by other men. Right. Yeah, I call it the zero-sum game. I mean, just to go back to what you were saying, if I kill that deer 2,000 years ago, well, then that's a deer that you're not going to be able to kill and provide for your family, right? Yeah, exactly. But you're right, with capitalism and the way that the world and the economy and the globe set up, that it's not a zero-sum game. There's always enough and new things can be created, which is why I believe collaboration, and I don't know where it'll go with you and I if it'll go anywhere, but we can create something by collaborating way stronger than we could do individually. But I also think that men have a very difficult time. So here's my next question is, men have a very difficult time being real and authentic and vulnerable in a way. And I think it drives back to that ego. Do you agree? And if so, how do we overcome that? How do we become more vulnerable so that we can open ourselves up to collaboration? That's a great question. And I think in part, it starts with the way we're taught from our fathers. And unfortunately, a lot of fathers just haven't done a fantastic job and I don't want you to blame your father because they did the best they could. Just like my dad was not a stellar dad. We got a good relationship now. But I had a situation where I didn't talk to him. I barely talked to him for a decade. And that's not that long. I mean, some people have really bad relationships, but it's bad enough to say, you know, he wasn't with the ideal guy I wanted in my life. But we have to accept that our parents did the best that they could do. We have to look at, well, okay, so if my dad told me, my dad did not tell me this by talk to a lot of guys who are like, well, you know, showing feelings was weakness, crying was weakness, being vulnerable was weakness. I don't know if that was ever true. But in this day and age, showing vulnerability, being real, being honest, and being authentic is a way to power. What that does is it's like, here's me. Here's what I've been through. Here's what I'm good at. Here's what I'm not good at. Here's where I failed in my life. Here's where I'm still failing. What that does is take away the power of anybody else to use that stuff against you. Like I said, let's say I shared something before about me being super awkward, super shy. To hear me now, I don't think I'm a stellar speaker. I'm something I'm still working on. To hear me now, it's like you would have never imagined that I was that shy, awkward kid who played Dungeons and Dragons. But I was. And then what's someone going to do? Oh, you were shy and awkward. You played Dungeons and Dragons. You're such a punk. I'm like, yeah, exactly. That's exactly what I said. Right. I just said that. I just said that. Glad you're listening. Let's keep it going. So it takes away the power from people to use things against you. And in this day and age, that's one way, that's one part. The other part of that is so many people are full of shit these days. They're lying about how much money they're making. They're lying about how important they are. They're lying about their accomplishments when you get someone who is willing to be real, who doesn't feel the need to impress other people or to make things up to make them sound more important. That is a rare person. And what is rare is more valuable by definition. So be that rare individual who is honest, who is authentic. And I don't mean going around. I don't go around and say, hey, what's up, Ryan? Nice to meet you, man. Oh, by the way, you know, I was a shy, awkward kid who used to play Dungeons and Dragons. Right. Right. That's not how you have a conversation. But if the situation does come up, be honest about something, share a story with someone. I think maybe we might be a little programmed through biology, through society, to like if someone's being vulnerable, you may want to like, man, yeah, it makes you feel like, oh, you've taken a step up in power. But yeah, this doesn't work anymore. You know, we've got these big groups of people, millions of people in the cities we live in. So that doesn't work anymore. And I kind of got off track a little bit. Yeah, it takes away the power of other people to call you out on what you already know to be true about yourself. Well, it's interesting. So I had a conversation a couple of months ago, right when we were starting this podcast with a gentleman, Brad Harker is his name. And we had an interview on how to become more influential. And to date is my most downloaded episode to date since I started this project. And I think a lot of the reason is because as men, we want to be leaders, we want to be influential. And I think sometimes we're looking for a shortcut to that. And sometimes we might believe that, hey, if I can portray power or wealth or recognition, then I'll become more influential. But what he talked about is he said, no, it's actually the exact opposite. When you can be real and vulnerable and you can let people know that you're a human being and you have struggles and things that you're working towards, that's when people start to resonate with you. That's when people start to connect with you and look to you as an example or a leader like you hope to accomplish the entire time. I agree with that 100%. And I'll even go a little, take it in a little bit of a different direction. When I was 22, I got a job as a personal trainer here in Miami Beach. I started working with some pretty high profile people in Miami Beach. And one of them was a restaurant owner, very famous restaurant called the Forge. And I met Russell Simmons and David Dukovny was there. And I've met a bunch of people there, all types of people, including celebrities that you've heard of and celebrities, local celebrities. And I used to try to get into conversations and show how cool I was and failed horribly. And I would always remember these people, they're not even looking at me and acknowledging me. So showing off in that way, it just means that you don't get it. And so what I started to do is I started listening more and I started asking more questions. And if you want to become the best conversationalist on the planet, listen to people more and ask questions that show you're really interested in what they have to say and who they are, that right there, besides what you and I have already talked about and what your guest had already talked about being authentic, it shows that you're a person who values them. And a really, really important tip right there because my whole personal training business is based on relationships. And that's something that can take your relationships, can take your network up to the next level, is just simply being willing to listen to people, being present and really listening, actively listening and asking questions in a way where you really find out who that person is. Well, so we've talked a little bit about where guys are struggling and some of the things that they can do to improve it. What are some other areas of life that you think men really are falling behind and need to do a little better, need to focus on improving in their lives? Well, I mean, I'm biased, but I got to go back to health. Men are more overweight here in the US and I believe the UK too, more overweight than ever. There's more obesity than ever. Suicide in the US is sky high. Men are more likely to take their lives. Violence is higher with men. We got this issue where it's like people aren't happy. And one of the reasons why they aren't happy is because they're not healthy. I firmly believe that it starts with taking care of the vessel that you're given, this body. And it's very much a machine just like your car, although infinitely more complex. So if you had a nice car, because that's what your body is, regardless of what you think it is, we couldn't even make a body in a lab. We could clone a body. We could do some other things. But we can't part by part like how they put together a car. It would take trillions of dollars to do that and we don't even have the technology to do it. Right. Yeah, we're not even close. Not even close. We have no idea how the brain works. We have no idea how the endocrine system works. We have ideas that we're getting better, but far away from that. So start with that. Taking care of your body, and I'm not just talking about exercise here, but lifestyle, dep hygiene, managing stress, eating good healthy foods. And I'm not a huge fan of diets, but just sticking towards the whole just the real food thing or the primal approach where you're not eating foods that have a lot of manmade chemicals where you don't understand them. And that's a huge controversial point in the fitness industry, whether you're whether you know it or not listening out there. But a huge controversial, but I would say it's a good rule of thumb to stay away from that stuff, get away from the processed food. And sleep is huge. You can lower your testosterone by going without sleep for too long. I haven't read up on this study, so I can't quote hard statistics if there is such a thing. But to give you the feedback on what the research studies said, but it's bad. It can affect your recovery. And if you're freaking out in life, if you feel too stressed out in life, there's probably something going on with you physically. And really get that under control and build from there. So sleep hygiene engage in regular exercise, engage in vigorous exercise a couple times a week. Two, three, four, we could get into a lot of detail there because that's what I do with my personal training clients. But you know, regular exercise, do vigorous exercise a few times a week. That means lifting, weights, sprinting could be a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or MMA class. Make sure you're eating those healthy foods that we've been eating for a long time. Stay away from processed food is probably the best way to put it. Although there are some good processed foods out there. We can get into that in a later day. That's for another podcast episode. So what can men do? Because I know a lot of the information that we hear about exercise and nutrition and sleep is not new, right? I mean, we all kind of know, hey, these are some basic principles and how to be healthy. But for some reason, we are just not doing it. So I'd be really curious as to your thoughts as to why we don't do the things that we know we should be doing. Oh, man, you know, this is huge. I don't think that I think one of the issues is people have men in particular have a bit of a disconnect from who they are as a person and their biology. And they don't understand, oh, well, when I take that thermogenic thing that's supposed to help me burn fat, you know what? I'm a little short. My fuse is a little shorter. Or hey, when I go without eating for a long time, my fuse is a little shorter. Or you know, oh, man, I had a really lousy day at work and they don't put it together that they stayed up too late. They drank too much alcohol and they got a shitty night's sleep. And that's the reason. So getting in touch, starting to, again, it comes back to the self-awareness, right? Start making connections between the actions you take in your life, what types of food you eat, what types of exercise you do, what types of, you know, whether you go to bed at 10 p.m. and you, whether you have good quality sleep and the way you feel. And then maybe another more psychologically oriented thing can be getting in touch with why you really want to get in shape, why you think it's important. And for most men, unfortunately, it takes us scare where the doctor says, hey, listen, if you don't change your life, you're going to die from a heart attack, you know? And then they're like, oh, wow, you know, I've been saved. I'm a new person. I'm going to start exercising. I'm going to hire a trainer. I'm going to eat right. I'm going to go to bed by 10 p.m. I'm going to, you know, if you wait until that happens, man, you are doing yourself such a disservice and I'll get even give you a deeper reason why you should be, why you should get in shape because if you're a parent and you are not taking care of yourself, your kids are going to live by your example. Absolutely. They're not going to listen to what you say. I know because I've been a kid didn't listen to my dad or me. Yeah. They're not going to listen to what you say. They're not going to listen to your lessons. They're going to emulate you. They're going to model you. So if you can't find it in yourself to take care of your health for yourself, then do it for your kids. Do it because you want to be a role model for your sons, your daughters. Do it because you want to show them, hey, this is how you express self love because taking care of, man, I see people who take great care of their cars and they treat themselves like shit, right? Right. Right. A $60,000 car, $30,000 car. You got this amazing machine that couldn't even be built by our technology today as amazing as it is. And you're taking it through the drive through a Burger King or skipping meals. Interesting. Yeah. I mean, show your kids, show your kids that you care about yourself because they'll learn self love through that. And you will also model good behavior so they'll know how to exercise. I learned how to exercise for my dad. He lost it eventually. And now he's not in very good shape at all. But I remember hanging from his bicep. He would flex his bicep and that thing seems so huge to me when I was six years old and I would hang from it and my sister would hang from his other one. I remember that vividly. And I got started exercising because of that and because he had weights around because he had Arnold's, I forget the name of Arnold's first book, but he had Arnold Schwarzenegger's first book. That inspired me to do what I'm doing today. And who knows if that would have ever happened if I didn't have that early connection with exercise and with my dad and him being such a powerful guy could hang from his arm. So get in touch with that and do it for your kids if you can't do it for yourself. I love that. I mean, that's, yeah, I agree with that. And that's part of the reason, you know, I went on, I started this journey a couple years ago of eating healthy and exercising. And I remember vividly the where I felt like I was getting in really good shape and my boys asked me to come jump on the trampoline. And I remember it was like it was yesterday. They actually got tired before I did. I like it. I was like so excited about it that I could just bounce out there for hours with them. So Ted, for the sake of time is we're winding down. I've got a couple more questions for you. And the first question I have for you is a question I ask everybody I have on and I'm always intrigued with the answers. What do you feel like it means to be a man? It means to know your values, to live by your values and to constantly strive for improvement. Simple, easy, right? Yeah. You know, we could get into long discussions. But I think these days, if you do that, if you apply what I said, you will hit all the areas. You will be a person who is physically healthy. You'll be a person who is emotionally healthy. You'll be a person who sets boundaries in their life, strong boundaries in their life and knows what they will and will not accept in their life. You will be a great role model for other people and for more importantly, for your children. I really think it comes down to knowing which value, living by those values because so many of us don't. We say we value health. Oh yeah, of course I value my health. Why did you just eat that whopper and big fries and wash it down with that fully sugared coke and you haven't exercised in six months? We don't live by our values. Oh, of course I think providing for my children is important. So why do you keep spending money on things that aren't improving their lives or not really improving your lives and your life? Know what your values are and live by them and constantly strive to improve on the areas where you need more work. Ted, how do we learn more about you with legendary life and then also with the fitness and health training that you're doing?
