    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast Welcome in everybody Wednesday edition of play and buck begins right now. Uh first up. We are watching closely as Hurricane idalia has made landfall. We've seen the footage Um of what it has done to what they call the big bend in florida that area of the state Uh, i'm down here in south florida a lot of floridines. I know are very on edge about what this is doing to the state It's also moving into georgia and going to be hitting the carolinas. Uh, so we're watching this Uh powerful storm and we'll have updates for you as they come along during The show and of course our thoughts and prayers go out to everybody who is Affected, uh, we also have a number of news stories that we'll be looking at here including Um the latest on the hunter biden victor shokin joe biden corruption axis Even more emails making it more clear than ever before if that's even possible That there was a corrupt scheme underway here and it tied directly to hunter getting all these illicit payments So we shall discuss Uh the vague Rama swami Is talked about this was on our friend glen bex program clay may have seen glenn asked trump Uh during an interview. What about the vake for vp? And he says that the vake is smart and full of talent So we'll see that would be a very interesting Turn here at some point if vake just said i want to be a part of the trump campaign I know he says that that's not going to happen, but I'm betting right now that at some point that is a conversation that is going to happen We shall see uh if i'm right on that one Uh trump said he's certainly open to it. He's open to it Uh, which i don't think he's open to that many other candidates these days as a vp So that's something that we will definitely get into This just from uh from over the weekend clay we didn't get to it, but 99 This is a daily mail headline 99 of covet deaths recently Are not primarily caused by the virus that's according to the cdc written about the daily mail We should discuss How they're they're still trying to make covet an even bigger thing than any reasonable person could but let's just let's dive into this first I saw this. I thought oh boy Uh, here's a moment and I knew clay you were going to be fired up by this one too because this is I've got it. I've got it. I was zoomed 90-10 issue. I don't know how good the polling is on this white house was asked about this A korean john p.r. Was asked about this yesterday when it comes to women and men and sports competition This should be going into an election right this should be The most straightforward obvious This is a pitch right down the middle. You've just got to put that in the upper stance. This is so easy But it's not easy for joe biden's white house. It's not easy for his White house press secretary to handle so instead when i should men and women be able to compete separately in sports Here is the non answer answer you get from the biden regime Does he care that girls are allowed to compete in sports without just a urethane iri Does he think it's fair for girls to have to compete against biological males? I just answered the question. It is a complicated issue It is truly a complicated issue with a wide range of views a wide range of views There is no yes or no answer to this. It is complicated There's a rule that the department of education has put forward and we're going to let that process move forward again We want to make sure that while we establish grog rails with this rule that we also prevent discrimination As well against transgender kids, but again a complicated issue with a wide range of views and we respect that Clay she can say complicated five or six times as she does there. It is not complicated and it is a straightforward. Yes or no So I think it's so interesting if we just go To this as a foundational issue Because if you are unwilling to say that men are bigger stronger and faster than women And that is the reason why we have a difference between men and women's athletics Then I can't trust anything that you're telling me because you were asking me to accept a foundational why? About something upon which i'm an expert and let me just kind of give people a context on this But did you see the little league world series? Any moment of the little league world series in william sport pennsylvania just ended Okay, you did not see it. I bet a decent percentage of our audience has watched at some point a little league world series game This year's world little league world series ended congratulations to el segundo california That's the south side of la county. They beat karasau To win the little league world series california team wins kid hits a walk off home run 12 year old kid And everybody goes crazy But what would happen if it came out that that kid was 15 years old Everybody would have freaked out that everybody this this happened in my new york city soccer league There was a kid who was like two years Too old to be playing and it came out after the game and they had to strike the game as a big controversy in the uh Catholic high school athletic association at the time. It also happened by the way in the new york city area I don't remember the name of the kid But he was like two or three years too old. He was a pitcher and anybody out there who knows There's a big difference between a 15 year old and a 12 year old right first of all 15 year old can have a mustache He can have gone through puberty Uh, he can he can be a flame thrower. There's a big difference Everybody out there would react with indignation if this occurred I went to coopers town, New york for a 12 you baseball tournament people remember i broadcast from up there You had to give the original birth certificate In order for your kid you couldn't even have a copy of the birth certificate In order to verify that your kid was the right age I know this because I lost the original birth certificate in the process of traveling to Coopers town, New york And let me just say Mom does not look fondly upon dad if dad loses the original copy of the birth certificate After being told make sure you do not lose this. Okay, so i Mom may have a point there mom may have a point we lost the original birth certificate We had to get a new one for my 12 year old my point on all this is aggressively You have to monitor for little league sports the age upon which the participants are Because one or two years Can make a tremendous difference in the competitive outcome Now imagine that you have and by by the way Oftentimes, especially when you get to 12 or 13 years old that's because puberty hits and puberty Changes everything in all facets of life including how big strong and fast boys are okay. So as they become men No one would argue this I don't think there's anyone out there who would argue buck. Hey, I could be trans age I i'm not 12, but I feel like a 12 year old and therefore I should be able to compete against 12 year old your age Is a biological reality just like your sex is a biological reality and the refusal of the white house to address this Is I think a foundational failure that should be attacked because it demonstrates how much of their organization and their party right now Is built on a foundation of lies Well, it's a reminder of the initial lie and this is what Consistently aggravates me about this The initial lie of the Biden administration Which because I remember the whole thing was while he was hiding in the basement We're all scared of covet and the BLM rioters are looting and destroying and burning things down It was oh good old grandpa joe. He's not an extremist He's not going to take far left positions And some of us were saying it was a common it was actually a common thing at the time to point out That he was a trojan horse. That's where we're saying he's a trojan horse for the left We all remember the ancient greek in an ancient greek mythology the homeric epic the horse comes in and a bunch of Greeks drop out and they burn troi to the ground, right? So He was meant to be exactly what he is which is oh, don't worry Joe bide good old grandpa joe Doesn't think that your 12 year old or your five year old that you know should be told that he or she is trans By pant by teachers should be able to have hormone blockers should allow a 15 year old with you know a mustache who's a guy to compete against the 15 year old girls and joe's not going to do that Of course he is yeah, and it goes to the power that the activist left has within their party Remember that there are there are whole organizations that have that raised tens of millions of dollars have tremendous power and influence in the legacy media that Need a new crusade they probably don't like that term but a crusade to push And what else are they going to do right? What is the great civil rights struggle according to left of modern day? It is to think that men are men can be women. When can be men can be women women can be men and This is effectively a state of mind here. Here's one for you klep Why is it that that? Physicality does not determine gender but to be transgender you need to have the trappings of perceived femininity What we're being a woman Why must you if it doesn't if having a penis does not make you a man? Why do you have to have the penis removed to be a a transgender woman? What difference does it make? They don't have answers for this and again, I think that this is so that this really blows up when you go. Okay Can you be trans age? I'm 44 If I felt like I was We both look young for our age to be fair So we do define the age For your age I might look old for my age but uh, but If I felt trans age and I wanted to go back to high school And I wanted to play high school football Let's say Uh, should I be able to do that? What about if I woke up today buck and I felt like I was uh, a philippino Should I be able to identify should I be trans racial and could I say to everyone? Hey, i'm philippino and by the way, it's not just me acting like it It's me acting like it and you have to acknowledge That even though it's fundamentally not true, right? I'm a light guy. I'm 44 But if I want to be why is it that you have to expect if I say i'm a woman But if I say i'm a 16 year old latino woman, you say oh, you're not 16 You're not latino, but you are a woman like why is one lie acceptable and have to be acknowledged as a truth when it is definitively a falsehood It is also goes to you know, they they got to this point the activist community of the left with the Trans issue the lgbt qia plus and they have they have truly added numerous Letters to this in recent years. I mean basically the whole alphabet now It's it's a big it's it's so big as an acronym that it no longer serves the purpose of an acronym Which is to make it easier to refer to something correct be easier to come up with some other Some other designation But as as they've done this over time a big way they've gotten to this point And the media demands this a lot of corporations demand this is they say it's a function of being polite It's a function of being nice Why can't we turn this around very simply and say let's not even we don't even have to discuss everything else that is at issue here But can we just agree that it's not polite to let a biological male destroy women in sports and to make a mockery of their athletic achievements? like it when does politeness or you know decency Become something that the other side is expected to engage in here And and I think that that's another place where they have no answer We've all seen this. I mean you see these guys You saw the the champions, you know quote champion female swimmer for you pen and we've seen now You know the I think there's like a rugby player in New Zealand or Australia It was you know like weighs 240 pounds. He's like stiff-arming all the women throwing him or I mean the whole thing is absurd Yes, it is the macho man randy savage South Park skit made real and Joe Biden It's not just the act it is this white house this democrat party that looks at the american people and says yeah, this is normal And this is why you have to attack it and and by the way credit to the white house press corps I would say keep asking this question and and I would love to hear someone ask Legitimately joe biden if he ever sits down for a An interview and and I mean I think this is a good way for you all out there to ask as well If we say that it's racist to change your race and I don't think I haven't heard anybody bucks say you can be trans age Why can you lie about your cron? Why can you not lie about your race and your your chronological age? That's unacceptable, but you can lie about your sex Why why like how do you distinguish those three clearly immutable? Biological realities in some form or fashion race is far less of a of a of a Race is actually mixed as we all know everyone has component so many different races Um and and that's actually arbitrary cultural policing that that people engage in when they say you're appropriating it You know, you can't have your hair that way or you can't you know listen to that music or whatever That's completely arbitrary. That's all based on power dynamics. Meanwhile biological gender reality is That is a penis. You are a man. There you go No doubt it's a real thing.

I think we've talked about this before artemis langford Uh, this is the capic appa gamma sorority at the university of yoming Uh, the women said they were uncomfortable having to share rooms with him They explained he watched them undress and got aroused while doing so Uh as you might expect for a heterosexual man inside of a sorority to do Um Artemis is the ancient greek goddess of the hunt. I'm sure that was not this guy's birth name. Yes Uh according to the judge he said that capic appa gamma bylaw states each member shall be a woman He claims the bylaw did not define the term woman to explain what he meant We need to we need to unpack this a little bit more because it's so absurd Uh, but he so i'm going to read more from this From this opinion we come back buck, but the end result is the university of yoming sorority sisters Have to allow a dude to live in their home And identify as a woman And this it could be impactful for sororities all over the country as it gets More and more ridiculous and biology continues to take a backseat to ideology Born from the tragedy of 9-11 the tunnel the towers foundation has been delivering on its promise to do good and never forget The sacrifices of america's greatest heroes heroes have put their lives on the line to protect our country and our communities Heroes like bristle can etiquette police sergeant dusted demonty After responding to a domestic violence incident.

That's t the number two t.org. Okay, we got a couple things here We do want to get to the story of the Colorado middle schooler who was kicked out of school because he had a don't tread on me patch a gadsden flag uh on his bag And and that's something that clade i both we both saw this one. Oh, oh my gosh Um, it's really more about the broader conversation of what history is going to be allowed or what history the left will allow without uh people having to worry that they may get Cancelled or there may be reprisals or maybe expelled and it depends on where you are in what situation but first uh over on out kick a site That you and certainly clare are quite familiar with there are some of the details of this uh situation of 6 foot 2 and Uh, shall we say robust a robust fellow as well? 6 foot 2 Artemis Langford who according to a district court judge Who has dismissed this case it is western brook v kappa kappa gamma fraternity uh some of the details in this court opinion from this judge and some of the details of what the women faced are Eyebrow raising to say the least clay. What why don't you bring our people our folks here up to speed on the uh the life and times of Artemis Langford and the kappa kappa gamma sorority So judge alan johnson is the one who dismissed this case and uh, he says again that the bylaw of the kappa kappa gamma sorority doesn't define what a woman is and uh when the women tried to point out things that to them uh Marited someone not being a woman the judge said for instance He thinks whether someone has an erection or not Does not define if they are male or female now I I I would submit buck that whether one has an erection or not Is actually a very strongly dispositive uh evidence As to biologically whether or not you are a male or female I would actually think that that is uh quite important and and by the way, I guarantee you the reason they didn't define female in the kappa kappa gamma Uh bylaws Is because they never thought that there would be someone who was a man Pretend to be a woman and everybody in the courts wouldn't say okay clearly The intent of having a sorority is to exclude men as by the way The intent of having a fraternity by their very definition is to exclude woman Uh women, uh, but yes He said whether you can get erection or not does not have any impact the complaint can we also oh go Are you gonna add the detail about how the how the erection came came up? Sorry, sorry, but go ahead Because he would watch the women Undress in the sorority house And then he would also question them and this is creepy and weird like even if you were heterosexual The complaint says that this dude pretending to be a chick Quote repeatedly question the women about what vaginas look like Breast cup size whether women were considering breast reductions and birth control like Other than birth control I can see if you're in a serious relationship. You can ask somebody about birth control This other stuff is like really creepy even if you were heterosexual, right? Asking women in the sorority what their vaginas look like I Mean this is and again getting erections while you're doing so and then the court the court Saying well, we don't know if this is a dude or a chick and therefore he can be a member This is like crazy talk. Can I also say you know on the one hand? Yes, I think it's important that the farcical nature of this which we are certainly addressing Is something that must be discussed but also back to my initial point about how The activist left on this issue and you know, I would get the I'm sure you've gotten this too on twitter or something Say why can't you just be just be nice to the people that what it's a whole hold on a second This isn't no one saying be mean to anybody here. Yeah, what you're saying is If you have a women's ice hockey team a 200 pound guy shouldn't be able to you know Skate around and and smoke them all into the sideboards because you know gender identity No, I'm sorry there are limits And this also goes to this isn't about can people dress the way they want this? Isn't about people like the people you see on the street or that you work with this is About whether women should be forced to undress naked in front of a male who is clearly sexually aroused by This process. Where is the decency that we should be able to ask for? Um for the young women here where what about if this was you know your daughter? What about if this was, you know, if I have a little sister, you know, she was in college I remember if I was told that my little sister Um who's a fierce attorney? So she would probably bring these lawsuits herself But if I was told that she had to be you know subjected to this as a guy I'd be pissed off I'd have a real problem with this What just think about this buck if this same guy Was exposing himself in the parking lot Outside of the sorority He would be arrested and he would be prosecuted probably to the full extent of the law And every single person out there listening to us right now would say yeah, this guy Is in the parking lot or he's on the the front yard of the cap cap of game of sorority at the university of yoming And he's exposing himself and he's engaging in some sort of sexual behavior that makes the girls uncomfortable As they enter or exit their house. He would be charged with a crime How much worse is it that he's permitted to do it? Inside of the house and he gets to live there This is this is Absolute insanity that this could be allowed to happen and The problem is now with this crazy judge's opinion I mean, I would love to hear from this judge. Does he have daughters? Does he have any conception of reality How in the world does the judge say a man getting an erection Inside of a sorority house isn't evidence that he's not a woman Again, just take it outside of the sorority house. This is what lawyers have to do. You have to think hypothetically What would happen if a man exposed himself to sorority members in the parking lot of their sorority house or on the front yard of their sorority house in other words outside of the home Outside of where they live he would be charged with a crime And yet if all of you out there listening to me right now Had to make a choice if you said, okay, would you rather have someone expose themselves to your daughter Outside in a parking lot or inside of a home in which she was forced to share with him I think most of you would say hey, I don't want this to happen But outside feels like less of a threat Then it occurring in doors in a place where she lives the court is allowing the indoors They would never allow the outdoors. I also think it's if you take a step back. You can see how When it was convenient for the accumulation of power the left used Feminism as a cudgel as a weapon in a whole range of you know, whether it's changing Family structure or you know society there's that's a huge conversation But the left used women for its purposes or the I should say used feminism the ideology of this advancement of of of women that was inherently somewhat Hostile to men, which is really what the modern feminist movement is Now they've thrown women under the bus. Yeah, now women. Oh, sorry You know, you're not useful anymore politically the way you used to be so now We don't even know what you are that is what the left says. Sorry women Don't even know what a woman is to borrow from the mat Walsh movie and that's where we stand now And not only that buck they're taking advantage of women's own to your point willingness to be accepting and not try to judge There are no I just I think it's important to hammer this home. There are no famous women Pretending to be men. There's no woman who defines as a man that's getting named man of the year When they tried to appeal to men with transgender stuff with the crazy Bud light ad men were like screw this. We'll just drink another beer At some point and this is important. I think it needs to be hammered home women are being taken advantage of and also this builds on what you're saying Buck, but I think it synthesizes it really well At some point inclusion becomes exclusion So it's one thing to say. Hey, if you want to identify as a chick and you're a dude go for it or vice versa Whatever else in your own private life But as soon as you require me to acknowledge the untruth that you are a woman and I think you're right, buck I think we're all this is headed people think it's crazy, but I think I think you nailed it It we are not far from you are going to be a transphobe if you don't want to sleep with a Man who is identifying as a woman. They're real women too I guarantee in five years play we'll be doing this show And we'll be sitting around saying You guys see this with the left they're really pushing this thing about how trans women are women So you should be attracted to trans women as a heterosexual guy. Correct. That is the Inversion of reality they will take us where it's also why they want to say this is an innate characteristic It's also why they're going after the children with this. It's also why they Are are so fixated On making sure that there are these physiological changes that come along with it And as I said, why do you even need that if gender is a state of mind Why do you have to have you know a lot of these trans figures? Giant fake breasts and they do all these things their lips and they don't look like women they often look like parodies of women. Why correct? Correct somebody yesterday bought sent me a message and I thought it was so good on twitter I should read it here as we get ready to go to break But the the idea was for a long time women argued hey, you don't have to be defined by wearing a dress You don't have to be defined by putting on makeup. You don't even have to shave your legs, right? And now what are the men who decide that they identify as women do They become the most exaggerated versions here. This is from jeff mnc 1900s women everywhere women are more than long hair makeup and a dress 2023 men everywhere all it takes to be a woman is having long hair wearing makeup and putting on a dress These guys are adopting the most exaggerated and oftentimes offensive levels of femininity and bok They're often doing it and behaving in a way like 10 or 11 year old girls do while being fully grown like this uh, this this bud light this dillan movani a joke not acting like an actual woman acting like an 11 year old girl Yep I mean this we all see it. We're just all speaking with the Observable speaking to what the observable reality is right now. I noticed that joe biden the biden wine house Oh good old joe.
