    "text": " Hey everybody, welcome back with us as Dr. McDonald, author of United States of Fear. So Dr. we had a break so I kind of cut you off. Talk about the impact, the lockdowns and this mass psychosis is having on the future generations. I'll give you some examples of what I've seen in my practice. A young girl comes with her mother and her mother says, my 14 year old daughter is completely hysterical. And I said, what do you mean by that? And she said, well, she is attacking me out in public when I don't wear a mask. So give me an example. Well, we were at CVS the other day and I was wearing my mask around my chin and my mother looked at my mother. My daughter looked up at me and she said, mommy, stop being Trumpy. I didn't even know that was an expression, but apparently not wearing your mask among small children. Teenage children here in Los Angeles is considered being Trumpy. So there's been a political propagandized aspect to this compliance and fear that takes over the mind of small children and indoctrinates them into a specific partisan political philosophy. I have children who are even younger in my practice who have put their fists through play-class windows out of frustration because they can't leave their homes. One of them was actually hospitalized in a psychiatric inpatient unit. Two of my patients, both late teens, early 20s, died last year of fentanyl overdoses while they were safer at home under LA Mayor Eric Garcetti's stay at home policy. They certainly weren't safer at home when they were found dead. I have never in my career in private practice lost a youth patient to unnatural causes and I'm losing them now. This is sick. This is evil. This is abusive. We the adults have failed our children. They are truly suffering. And even the children who were adults, the younger patients, the one in their 20s, early 30s, they are unable to go to school. They're unable to return to college because they have these massive booster vaccination shot mandates. Some of them can't actually get jobs. So the fear pandemic is affecting them even if they themselves are not afraid. And the ones that are afraid, like the girl who came to my office yesterday, 17 years old with her parents, parents not wearing a mask, she was. I told her to take it off. I said, you don't need to wear a mask. She said, I don't feel safe without it because this is her words. There's so much variant out there right now. And I just paused and I looked her right in the face and I said, I'm sorry to tell you this, but the adults have been lying to you. They've been lying to you for two years. You are safe. You do not need to wear a mask. You need to go back to normal life. It made her so uncomfortable to sit there in my office and talk to me without wearing a mask. She kept fiddling with it. She kept pulling it under her nose, dropping it, pulling it up, dropping it. She has become addicted to this sick, obsessive, compulsive, fear-based behavior. I don't know how long it's going to last, but I don't think it's going to go away anytime soon. Two minutes before the break, and we have a long segment where we can really dive into this. What does this mean for the future of this generation? Most medicated, most suicidal, most depressed, most drug overdose? You've never seen anything like this in your practice. I can't imagine it's going to be the freest generation on this trajectory unless big changes are made. It is not. I suspect that we are going to see an entire generation of children who are living in their parents' garages, being taken care of by mommy and daddy, scared to go out, scared to work, scared to socialize, scared to date, scared to travel. Basically, what I'm afraid of is that for the first time in history in the United States, we're going to see a generation of young people who are afraid to live, people who are more afraid of a virus than they actually love life. I don't know what this bodes for our future, but I know it's bleak, and I know if we don't stop it now and we don't develop a national recovery program for young people, we're not going to have a future. National recovery program. You're the first person to say that, and I love it. I want to explore what that would be because, and I want to ask this after the break, because I got to be careful. I get all these angry emails. You said it though, so I'm going to follow up, which is parents failing their children. When I say that, I got a lot of hate because there's a generational component of people that said we've done everything perfectly. How dare you question that. But I would beg to differ that this has been one of the great generational thefts in the history of the human species of a generation that has said, we want to keep ourselves safe and we're going to restrict the development of our children. And I want to ask you about the psychology of that, because a lot of this has been adults driven. That girl in your office, she's not old enough nor did she think deeply about the ramifications of wearing masks all the time. She did what she was told to do. The question is, why did the 75 and 80 year old leaders in DC and Sacramento develop this? And why were they okay with it? That's a psychological question. I don't have an answer to, but I think you do. United States of fear with Dr. McDonald. Everyone stay right there a lot more coming up after the break."
