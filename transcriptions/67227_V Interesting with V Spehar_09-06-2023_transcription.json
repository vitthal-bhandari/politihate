There's no legal solution for the fact that you married an asshole. Welcome to The Dough. I'm Ex Maya. We're diving into the stories surrounding the Moolah baby. The good, the bad and the unexpected. Yeah, we talking about it all. The dough is out now wherever you get your podcast. Lemonade. Yeah. Hey friends, it's June 9th, 2023. Welcome to V Interesting, where we break down the viral and very interesting news you might have missed. I'm V Spear and today the joke is on the NYPD who agreed to paint some questionable queer art on the side of their cop cars. A new docu series sheds light on what can happen when Christian extremism disguises itself as a wholesome TLC reality show. And Trey Val Anderson is here to talk about Tina Turner, pop culture and seeing yourself in media. Also, how a diverse digital content diet can improve your life. All that more on today's V Interesting from Lemonade Media. Let's be smart together. And now for some headlines. Let's start in New York City, where the largest police department in the United States made a very clumsy attempt to celebrate pride. Maybe you've already seen the photos of the new NYPD cop cars. They say happy pride month and all colors are beautiful in rainbow letters with hearts and stars and squiggly lines. The agency commissioned a queer artist to create the design, which will be on the cruisers for the entire month of June. But it seems that the artist may have taken some artistic license, if you will. People online were quick to notice that all colors are beautiful can be abbreviated to a C A B a popular anti cop acronym that stands for all cops or bastards. Whoops, I guess the New York PD missed that one. The acronym re emerged in popularity after the killing of George Floyd in 2020. No one knows for sure it's origin, but many trace it back to England in the early 20th century. And the phrase all coppers are bastards. Punk music in the 1970s helped spread the acronym internationally. And now it's on the side of the New York's finest cop cars. Let's just say that the internet is loving this. One person tweeted, shout out to the queer artist who took money from the cops to plaster a cab on their vehicles for pride month. Another wrote the NYPD commissioner tweeting out their bogus pride cop car with a hidden A cab just warms my cold heart. So far, the artist behind the design has not spoken out about whether it was intentional or just a coincidence. And the NYPD has yet to issue a response to the whole social media kerfuffle either. One other thing I noticed that rainbow squiggly line bordering the design. It looks a lot like bacon. I mean, are we alluding to certain species of swine often used to describe cops in the design as well? I mean, I don't know, but I'm not alone in thinking that rainbow looks like bacon. I find this whole story to not only be embarrassingly amusing, but also full of nuance and debate. It forced me to ask myself, what is art? What is pride art? And what is protest art? I mean, this could be protest art disguised as pride art. And what happens when institutions that have largely hurt queer people, like the police, decide that they too want in on the rainbow washing of June. Do we just welcome their bare minimum attempts at inclusion as progress? Or do we call it out as pandering? Do cops even have a place at pride? Well, in New York, they actually don't. Not since 2021, at least. Organizers of the city's pride parade have banned law enforcement from getting anywhere close to the parade route. Police are not allowed to march in the parade. And any uniformed officers must stay a block away from the celebration. Pride organizers say that cops make many members of the queer community feel less safe. And let's not forget that the first pride involved a black trans woman throwing bricks at police who were trying to raid the Stonewall Inn. So is the parade safe? Yes. Instead of uniformed NYPD officers, pride is hiring community-based security guards and first responders to take their place. So what do you think? Do cops belong at pride? Do they make you feel safe? Or do they make you feel threatened? Just like art, I'll let you interpret that one for yourself. Let's turn now to an update on an episode we did back in January when we chatted with comedian and donor-conceived person Laura High. Her work explores the Wild Wild West that is the fertility industry, and she introduced us, and I am so embarrassed to say this, to a Rochester gynecologist who was doing some really creepy stuff. His name was Morris Wertman. You will remember him as the doctor who was secretly fathering children by using his own sperm to insiminate his patients. He would then switch appointments around with the nurses to make sure that he continued to do those patients' physical exams. So creepy. Laura's good friend Morgan Helquist was one of the donor babies born into this terrible story. It was Dr. Wertman's sperm that impregnated Helquist's mother back in 1984. And that's not all. Helquist herself became Wertman's patient in 2012. Now she didn't know that he was her biological father, but he sure knew that he was her biological father, and he performed vaginal ultrasounds, breast exams, and talked about her sex drive with her. I know, this is incredibly uncomfortable friends, but I promise you, you have to stick with me through the end of the story. Helquist sued Wertman in 2021. After a 23andMe DNA test found that she had at least nine half-siblings that were tied back to him. The lawsuit alleges medical malpractice, lack of informed consent, and emotional distress. But the case, unfortunately, may never see it stay in court, because last week, Morris Wertman died in a fiery plane crash. That's right. The 72-year-old was a passenger in a hand-built experimental plane that went down in upstate New York. The crash killed him as well as the pilot. And as much as we may find some kind of comfort knowing this man who was still practicing medicine until his death will no longer be able to hurt anyone else, Morgan may not get justice if the case dies with him. Morgan has not commented since his death, but we hope that she does get justice against his estate or some kind of peace soon. You can go back to our January 27 episode with Laura High to learn more about the seediness behind the sperm donor industry and hear a little bit about Laura's personal story. Speaking of people who have way too many kids, a God complex and a closet full of secrets, have you guys been watching the new docuseries on Amazon called shiny happy people? It's about the family behind the hit TV show 19 Kids and Counting, which was huge on TLC in the late 2010s. The show featured the Duggar family, parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar and their 19 children, all of whose names begin with the letter J. You cannot make this stuff up. On the face of it, they look like this wholesome Christian family prospering under traditional biblical values. But surprise, the docuseries calls blasphemy on all of that. Each new detail uncovered about the family and their scandals reveals an insidious threat that we are still living with today. See, the Duggars were part of a Christian organization that has been described by former members as cult-like. It's called the Institute of Basic Life Principles, and it was pretty big in the 70s. It's centered around obeying authority, not just God's authority, but also Father's authority. Kids were homeschooled based on scripture, which left huge gaps in their education. Dads chose husbands for their daughters and things like dancing, drinking, dating, watching TV, even winking were considered no-nos. The docuseries shows how underlying principles of the organization allowed predators to hide and abuse to fester. Like one of the Duggar sons himself, Josh, who recently admitted to sexually assaulting underage girls, including his own sisters, back when he was a teenager. Now that's as far as I want to go with the nasty things festering inside this family. You can watch shiny happy people to learn more about all of that. What I'm concerned with is what the success of the TLC show says about the ways in which our society sometimes celebrates harmful religious extremism. Like we were all just munching popcorn and watching Christian fascism in our living rooms, wishing our kids were a little bit more like the Duggers. We thought this was also harmless. It's not hard to draw a line from TV shows like 19 Kids and Counting to the type of stuff threatening our democracy in big ways today. Like the January 6th insurrection, the fall of Roe v. Wade, and attacks on trans rights. NPR TV critic Eric Deggins said the ultimate message of shiny happy people is to pay attention to survivors and to help tear down organizations that institutionalize abuse. I'm going to tell you to take it even one step further. Think about the reality TV you watch and how it could be perpetuating harm in the real world. The content you consume may be funny to chuckle at, but it can also normalize extremism. And it did, as we see here with the Duggar show, it radicalized a whole bunch of people. If something feels yucky, or even if it feels too wholesome to be true, it probably is. Oh my gosh, babies, that was pretty dark. That was two rough little stories. But the good news is there are so many more people out there who are trying to help children, not harm them. And we've got some good news on that front. We all know that support for childcare has stalled in Congress for years. So now states are taking it into their own hands. Lawmakers in Vermont just approved an ambitious plan that would pour $125 million into the state's childcare system. Like a lot of parents around the country, affordable childcare is unattainable for most Vermont families. Vox reports that daycares can cost more than $26,000 a year, more than 30% of many families household income. And slots are competitive, especially as more and more childcare workers leave the industry and daycares are forced to shut down. This child care bill would expand state subsidies so that middle income families could afford to pay those daycares. Lower income families would pay nothing out of pocket. In turn, the hope is that daycares could stay open and actually pay their staff a competitive wage. The legislation also asks lawmakers to study how to create a statewide full day pre-K system. The bill still has one major hurdle though. The money to pay for childcare would come from a new payroll tax. And Republican Governor Phil Scott said he would reject any new taxes. That said, Democrats have a super majority in the Vermont legislature and they've made clear that they would override the governor's veto if it comes to it. Vermont's victory comes as federal pandemic childcare subsidies are expiring. President Biden had hoped to sneak hundreds of billions of dollars of childcare investments into the inflation reduction act, but the Senate didn't go for it. He's now trying to make childcare a top priority heading into his reelection campaign. But with politicians like Joe Manchin and Marjorie Taylor Greene throwing tantrums, I am not going to be holding my breath for Joe to come in and save the day. Nope, it's all about the states right now. And Vermont isn't the only one doing something. Last year, New Mexico voted a childcare guarantee into its constitution, agreeing to spend about $150 million a year on early learning. And the governor of Minnesota signed bills this year for universal school meals and child tax credits. I love seeing states step in when the federal government is crawling around like a bunch of toddlers having meltdowns. Can somebody send them to daycare? I mean, I can think of nothing better at a time like this than a big old timeout chair for folks like Marjorie Taylor Greene to have to sit and reflect on their attitude. All right, that's enough of the headlines you may have missed. And maybe you wish that you had stayed missing some of those. It was a little bit of a gross day, but that's okay, because that's all behind us. And right now we are going to go into celebrating and joyful conversation, because it is Pride Month, as I'm sure you are well aware. And today's guest is an amazing advocate for queer representation in pop culture. Trevel Anderson is on our show today. And I'm so excited for you to meet them. We talk about their favorite TV shows and movies right now, how to show up for Pride if crowds aren't your thing, and why God is a black trans woman. Stick around, we'll be right back. This message is sponsored by ColaGuard. Hi, I'm Kate Bowler, and you might know me from another Lemonade on Media show called Everything Happens. If you listen to my show, you know that a lot of it is inspired by my experience with colon cancer. So of course, increasing awareness around colon cancer screening is really important to me. In case you didn't know, you should start screening at 45. And a great at-home option to screen for colon cancer is with ColaGuard. ColaGuard is the only FDA approved noninvasive screening test that looks for both altered DNA and blood in your stool.

ColaGuard offers control of your colon cancer screening by screening how you want and when you want. In addition to the convenience and ease of use, it's also affordable. Most insured patients pay zero dollars. I really admire what ColaGuard is doing, creating an easy to use and accessible way for people to get screened. So if you're 45 or older and at average risk, ask your healthcare provider about screening for colon cancer with ColaGuard. You can also request a ColaGuard prescription today at colaGuard.com slash podcast.

Maybe I'll give you a terrible cooking tip or two. I'm a very bad cook. Listen wherever you get your podcasts from Lemonade Media. The holiday episode on Thanksgiving. Hey friends, I am really excited to share this conversation with you, featuring one of the most amazing journalists out there, but also one of the most amazing people in general. Award-winning journalist and highly sought-after social curator, Trevel Anderson. Trevel has a new book out called We See Each Other, a black trans journey through TV and film. It's a deeply personal look at the history of transgender representation in media, as well as the look at Trevel's personal journey with their trans identity. We know that trans visibility is at an all-time high in pop culture with shows like Pose and RuPaul's Drag Race, but as Trevel tells me in this interview, trans people are under attack from many sides and perhaps more vulnerable than ever. We'll chat about their writing projects, thoughts on Pride Month, how a grand-ma pastor inspired a deep connection with the church, and much, much more. I hope you enjoy this conversation. I sure enjoyed having it. Here's Trevel. Trevel, welcome to the show. You are a very in-demand culture reporter and a highly sought-after moderator. You keep your finger on the pulse of many topics. I was hoping that we could run down a list of just some recent news events and get your reaction to them. Would you be down for that? Don't do it. This is kind of like what you do on your show. I was like, let's see what we can do today. So I saw that you were talking about the new Netflix show, Survival of the Thickest. What do you think about the show? Okay. This is Michelle Buto's new show. I'm super excited about it. One, because I'm a fan of Michelle Buto. If you have not seen her comedy special, Welcome to Butopia, also on Netflix, just hilarious, right? And I also love how she talks about being a fat woman, a fat black woman, about her relationship, her kids. And so I'm excited for this show, which is based on her book, because we're going to have a fat black woman at the center of a narrative. I know it's going to be laugh out loud hilarious, because Michelle is. And I also know that there won't be any, when you watch certain shows, and they all have these random, anti-gay or transphobic type jokes that are just like, did you really have to do that? Like, was it necessary? I know that with Michelle Buto, we're not going to have to worry about any of that, right? And you can just watch this show. It's going to be laugh out loud funny. You're probably going to cry just a little bit because she, you know, gives that type of emotional energy. And I think it's going to be hilarious. And we need more funny things on TV right now. I agree. Did you watch Fire Island? I know I'm like a year late to it, but I just watched it last week. Yeah. Yes, I did. I loved it. Did you think? So good, so good. Now, you know, I have complex thoughts about Fire Island. I do love the movie glad it exists. I think it captures this like very specific experience, right? Of like being a person of color in that case, being an Asian person, right? And like going to this very white, very, you know, certain type of bodied, you know, experience that is Fire Island for the gays. But I thought it was funny. I thought shout out to Margaret Cho. She was my favorite part about the movie. And then I think it was it was a type of narrative that we had not seen in that particular way. And the director, Andrew, Andrew, on I'm a big fan of his work, his prior work before Fire Island. So I love it. It was another one of those movies and it's Pride season, right? So everybody's trying to figure out, you know, the gay things they can watch on TV. But so this, it's one of those like great like Pride movies, but you can also watch it when it's not Pride because it's that good of a movie. I loved it. I thought it was kind of Pride and Prejudice. Like it's sort of like, yes, like mirrored Pride and Prejudice with my wife was loving. And as a former caterer waiter on Fire Island, which not a lot of that means you have stories. Oh, do I? In fact, we did the rebrand. This restaurant group I was with did the rebrand of Fire Island in like 2008, 2009. And I have never been more overwhelmed by a community in my life because it really is like all very wealthy, very handsome gay men. They have a certain expectation. And then there was me and I was like much more femme presenting at this time. And they were like, girl, what are you doing? They're like, this isn't your weekend. No, well, then they would go to cherry grove. Then I cut my hair in the middle, which was the worst part of it because in the dark, when you're trying to walk home from the restaurant after working all day, you're just getting whistled at in the meat rack the whole time. And it was like, no, I'm a I'm a lady. You're like, no, thank you. I'm not what you want. I know it was so much fun, crazy, some of my life. But I definitely like one of those things where you're like, I I'm not sure. You know, you would do it for a check too. But it was absolutely I'll do a lot of things for a check, actually. Okay. Oh, it was wild. So watching that movie just like crack me up because there were so many stereotypical things that happened on Fire Island that they put into the movie that was really just like fun and relaxing. Like you said, it was a great time to sort of visit that place. Speaking of things that can kind of like get you nostalgic, though, the legend Tina Turner passed away recently at the age of 83. What did that feel like to you? I had like a personal like, you would think I knew her reaction. I was like devastated. Did you have a feeling? Same. Yeah. Same, right? And because Tina Turner was one of those people who just was like, you know, like we throw around the word icon a lot in our culture today. But Tina Turner is a true icon. You know, like an icon of icons, right? And just in terms of just like what she overcame, just in terms of her contributions to music. And my favorite part is that when she retired from music, she said, I'm going to go to Switzerland or wherever she went with her rich husband, right? When you know that like, Oh, Tina Turner is minding her business, living her life. And then you find out she's dead. It's like, Oh, no, it's just like, uh, it was, it was, I think in the broader culture and community. It was one of those deaths that make you go, damn, like, you know, um, also another opportunity to talk about and Angela Bassett's portrayal of Tina Turner and what's love got to do with it. And Angela Bassett should have gotten the Oscar for it. But that's fine. Um, but yeah, just an icon, a queen, the world is, is worse off without her. I agree. When these things happen, it just makes us think, you know, like, you look around for, like, who's going to replace that figure. And there just is no one, you know, like with any of these folks, there's no like legacy down ballot, if you will, for them. Yeah. And, and you know, one of the things I've loved in this particular moment, because, you know, a lot of the kids may not know a lot about Tina Turner and about her impact. And so I've loved in this moment of all of us, like giving her her flowers that like you have Beyonce, right? At her concert, honoring Tina Turner, right? You have Lizzo at her concert, honoring Tina Turner and telling people that if you like me, then you're going to love Tina Turner because I would not be here if it was not for her. And so I love seeing, you know, the, the younger generations that, of artists, right? Paying homage to her and also like establishing for their fans, right? Her impact and her import. Mm hmm. Two is just one of these artists who really made you feel included. Even if you kind of had no business being included, the first time I saw her perform was in the movie Tommy as the acid queen. I was like a 10 year old little white child. And I was like, that's who I'm going to be when I grow up. I want to be the acid queen. Right? I love that. You just believe in it. You know, you're like, my mom's like, okay, go ahead. Just go put on my head heels and be the acid queen. Your dad's going to be home in an hour though. Not that hard. Right? I love that. On a less fun news turn, you know, there are hundreds, hundreds of anti trans bills being introduced and passed around the United States. We've got the dragmans and the book bands. And it just feels like there's so much of a spotlight put on our community when we are just minding our business and just trying to go about our life. We're trying to what do you make of all of these attacks on the on the queer and trans community right now? To be quite honest, I am exhausted. Right? Like it is especially for those of us who also like we are members of these communities, right? And we also cover them, right? In the course of like our work. And so we also we end up being not only impacted on like a personal level, but also impacted on a professional level. And then I'm the type of journalist that firmly believes in bringing my own lived experience into the work that I do. And so I'm deeply exhausted about what we are experiencing and going through. And yet I find it important to also still be hopeful, right? About, you know, the possibilities on the other side of this particular moment. And so it's, you know, every other day it feels like another bill, right, is being passed, whether it's a don't say gay bill, whether it is the drag bands, whether it is, you know, the particular assault, you know, just a hyper focus in on the anti trans legislation, right, which is hyper focusing on trans women and trans girls, especially, right? And the ways in which, you know, they are attempting to exploit the broader cultures, ignorance, right around gender and identity. It's just really wild. I recently had the chance to, there was an action that happened in DC called trans prom, in which these young trans people brought, you know, I think it was 100 other trans young people from 17 different states across the country, just to kind of have a prom in front of the Capitol in DC. There was a DJ, there was an MC, there was dancing. And then there were a group of us trans adults who were invited to kind of just be a support system, right, for these young folks. And it was, it was, it was wonderful and amazing to like witness, right, these young people choose to be visible, right? In a way that would directly push back on this idea that trans kids and trans people should not exist. But it also got me thinking about the fact that these young people shouldn't have to fly to DC for an action to tell people that they that the gender affirming care that they require is necessary, or that, you know, they want to play on the sports teams that align with who they are, and they should be able to do that. You bring up such an interesting point that I hadn't really thought about before with that when you say it's like they're the right is trying to get ahead of the narrative who gets to decide and educate on what trans children need, what trans people need. And there's, you know, if you look at the last 10 years of even television or the GLAD statistics and talking about like how many more trans people have been visible, we had that show I am jazz, like there's been a lot of trying to show the first person narrative of the trans experience in a very like normal authentic hey, this is what it is, it's not always so intense. It's like a very regular life a lot of the time. And now we're seeing this sort of like trying to re grab control of the narrative to spin it into something that's just so obviously untrue. Yeah, and I think it's important for people who are not trans specifically to also realize the ways in which many of these laws and bills will impact cis people as well, right? Because it's overall gender policing, right? That that on its face is targeting trans people, but it will also and can also apply to how cis women show up in the world, right? And what you are able. One of the things important, I know I just cut myself off, but it's fine. I do it all the time. But one of the things I think is important to note is how right the anti trans movement, the anti, you know, reproductive autonomy movement, the anti critical race theory movement, the book bit like it's all actually super connected. And I don't think a lot of people realize that like the same people pulling the strings as it relates to, you know, overturning Roe v. Wade are the same people who don't want trans people to have rights who are the same people who want to ban our history, right? In certain places who are it's the exact same people. And I think once we once we realize that there is a concerted campaign, right, that is unfolding before our very eyes, I hope then that that will like activate people in ways that are necessary to just transform our culture and our society. Maybe you're like me and, you know, going out into the streets is not your thing. And that's okay, right? But you have a little bit of a expendable income. And you can put some coins right in the pockets of the organizations and the entities who are doing that work. And so I would encourage folks to check out the fuck bands campaign that vote save America is doing as well. If you're looking for ways to get involved, because you realize the importance right of that work. And there's a new film coming out that focuses on a trans woman life post transition, which is something that we hear a little bit less about called Monica. Have you looked into this at all? Do you do you have thoughts on Monica? I have I have seen it. It stars Trace LaSette, a fabulous trans actress. She you might be familiar with her. She was in Transparent a little bit. She had a small role in the Jennifer Lopez movie Hustlers a couple years ago. She's fabulous. She's amazing. And the movie is great. Like it's it's now let me give you a disclaimer. Okay, it's not a blockbuster. All right, y'all. It's not, you know, high action. It's one of those slow burn movies that's less about dialogue and more about like that internal acting thing that folks love. But it's one of those movies that like is showing a trans woman making coffee, right? Like showing her, you know, hooking up with some dude in the back of his truck, right? These things that we just don't often see trans people being able to do on screen because the focus is always on, you know, our transition or our trauma and our tragedy. And you know, there's a little bit of that element here in Monica because she is the general idea of the movie is that she's trying to rebuild a relationship with her family after years of being estranged as her mother transitions to the other realm, if you will. And so it has a little bit of that, like, you know, trans one on one one on one energy to it, but it's done in a different way. And it doesn't it's not didactic in any particular way. And if you're not paying attention, you might not even know that she's trans because the way that they kind of disclose that is very subtle. But it's a fabulous movie. I hope that it gets, you know, all of the attention that it deserves and that it turns into greater opportunity, specifically for Tracelessat as a fabulous actress, but also, you know, more opportunities for trans people to start in and lead, you know, trans narratives. In 2022, the US Supreme Court overturned Roe versus Wade. Since then, it's been a barrage of bad news.

So be sure to join us every Wednesday on The Deep Dive from Lemonade Media wherever you get your podcasts. What are some issues that you think should be getting more attention from the press? Well, specifically as it relates to like transness, trans representation, trans identity, I think much of the press is we become machinations of the same systems that are trying to harm trans people, by which I mean take the New York Times, for example, which is an entity that I've engaged with a lot of advocacy around because of the ways in which they cover trans people, right? And they reproduce a lot of the same harm that is happening in state legislatures across the country because they want to equivocate the needs that we have as trans people alongside the thoughts and the ideas of people who expressly do not believe we should exist, right? Objectivity is the issue, right? This idea of objectivity that we're taught in grad school, that we're taught in newsrooms across the country that because in order to be objective, you need to like get both sides or get every side. But like there's no side to the humanity of trans people, right? You either believe we should be able to exist, you know, free from all of these isms and obias as I call them, or you don't. And I don't think I think so many news people in news feel like making a decision and standing up for the humanity of trans people is like a political thing. I think because of that news media ends up being right, a machination of white supremacy ultimately, right? That keeps us all no matter what your identity and collection of labels that you use to describe yourself looks like, right? It keeps us all under, you know, this system's boot, right? That prevents us from ultimately, you know, showing up in the ways that we need to. And the reason why this is a problem, and I will shut up in two seconds, I promise. I'm just here for this. The reason why this is a problem, this is so interesting, it comes up because in the course of me writing my book, I was looking through a lot of like archived, you know, in images of trans people, stories and newspapers and magazines from 1520 30 40 50 plus years ago. And you can see how the ways in which trans people specifically, but this is black people, this is queer people, this is women, this is disabled folks, this is non Christian folks, how the news media presented and portrayed those communities, because members of those communities were not part of the news media first and foremost, right? And because those people who were doing that reporting, we're okay with being machinations of white supremacy expressly, right? And so the history books, right, the record and even our cultural productions are not accurate representations of what life was like for various communities during those times. And so for me, part of doing the book and a lot of the work I do today is about correcting that record, right? Filling out the picture of what life is like for trans people today. Yes, you can cover the legislation. Yes, you can cover the killings that are happening of trans people, right? The majority of them, black trans women and films, but also there's so much community and love and joy and care also, right, that we're navigating. And so part of doing the book was about like correcting the record, building out this narrative so that in 1520, 30, 40, 50 years, when someone else decides that they want to revisit, you know, the early 2020s, right, and figure out what the culture was doing around trans people and trans existence, they'll have a broader, more fuller picture, right, of today than what I have and what we have of the communities that predate us. Now, did this idea for the book start at any time recently? Did you touch on any of these sort of like trying to fill in the pieces when you were at Los Angeles Times, where you created the beat of diversity in Hollywood with Focus on Black Queer Film? Like, is this something you feel like you've done before? And now you're doing it in a different way? Or where did it kind of come out of? You know, I started my career at the LA Times in a diversity fellowship program. Like you mentioned, I ended up creating my own beat of diversity in Hollywood with Focus on Black and Queer Film. This was before Oscar So White. So this was before the industry cared about diversity, if we're being honest. And the idea for the book kind of started when I was at the LA Times. This was shortly before the season two premiere of Transparent, which was Joey Solowy's TV show about their parents transition, you know, how their Jewish family kind of reacted to it. See, before season two of Transparent, I had this idea. I was like, Oh, I should create a timeline for people just like showing trans images on screen, you know, prior to Transparent. And when I went to go do research to try to put that together, I couldn't find anything. I found, you know, slithers, right? Something about this movie or something about this show, but nothing comprehensive. And then I reached out to Glad, Nick, Nick Adams over at Glad. He's the director of transgender representation over there. He's been in that role for 20 plus 30 some odd years at this point. And I think single handedly has been, you know, trying to drag the industry, you know, into inclusive storytelling. And he had his own personal spreadsheet of every image of trans people on screen or gender expansionists on screen that he knew of, and that he had come into contact with. And so I started there and then built out that timeline. And then over the years since, I've always just said to myself, it's really interesting that we are sort of kind of, as you mentioned earlier, we are as a community as trans people, you know, the most visible we've ever been as a community in culture, right? But we are also the most vulnerable we've ever been in culture. And so the idea for the book kind of grew out of that, how do we wrestle with this paradox of visibility that we are navigating as a community? And then for whatever reason, I decided to put a little bit of my own gender journey into the book as well. It's like kind of just like grew from there. It's pride month now. And some for some people, that's like a big moment of celebration. They're excited for the praise. They're excited to be out there. There are a lot of the shy gays and shy trans folks too, though, that this month, to your point, really puts a spotlight on us and can be a little bit scary. Do you have any advice for people who are scared during pride? Yeah, well, I would say I'm right there with you. Yeah. I'm right there with you. I think, you know, I remember a number of years ago when the post, the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting happened. It happened the night before the West Hollywood parade here. And I remember how unsettled so many of us were around this idea of just like going outside, attending the parade, trying to celebrate, you know, who we are. And through that celebration, show the world the importance of our communities and the space that we take up. But it was that pride that shifted things for me personally. I am not really a pride girl. I know the personality and the energy might say otherwise. But I'm not really a pride girl. But I remember thinking then that year that like because of the assault that our culture and community is continually facing, pride becomes even more important, right? And in particular, a pride that hues closely to the original pride, which was a protest. Yes, we were celebrating and clicking and clicking and taking up space and all of that. But it was a protest, right? And so for me, when I think about pride this year specifically, and then also in years to come, you know, I think it's okay if you are not somebody who goes to the parade, you're not somebody who goes to the concerts, you just you want to you want to stay at home and mind your business. I think that is wonderful and fabulous. I would encourage you to figure out ways if you don't already to like lean into whatever your queer family is, right? And it doesn't have to be, you know, the glitter gaze at pride, right? It can be, you know, your book club, it can be, you know, you just want to go to the queer own coffee shop down the road, you know, you want to go to your knitting group, your knitting circle or whatever. Like, I think we can we can look at ways to like embrace and and demonstrate our pride that don't have to be tethered to, you know, these large group, you know, demonstrations. Yeah, I'm with you. For me, I get nervous of the the mom hugs, the free mom hugs at pride, because for me, growing up all my whole life, you know, it was like pride was like the day that you got to be gay with the gays and that's all that there was. And I love how inclusive the space has become, but in some ways, it does put a little bit of pressure on queer people to be overly accepting of non queer people in a queer space. And the last time I went to pride was probably two or three years ago. And what started as like a very sweet thing, this one woman who had like a t-shirt that said free mom hugs. And that meant so much to me the first time really sort of like shook me by the last time because it was like a bunch of straight women wandering around trying to hug queer people. And I was like, okay, there are ways to show show support. And physically embracing strangers is not always it. So it gets scary because then you feel like you have to censor yourself off also because we don't want to like offend anyone or they're like, oh, there's little kids here and I'm like, okay, well, I don't know what to tell you, but the Eagles float is about to come by and those boys are going to be in leather harnesses and bright forum. King has a place at pride. So does everybody, you know, and how does it balance all of this trying to be the most inclusive and loving community? And so there are some awkward spots to pride. So if you're feeling a little awkward too, it's okay. It's okay. You don't have to like it all. And can I just say for the straight people or the cis people who may be listening, thank you for your allyship and whatnot. Absolutely. However, you know, sometimes many of you need to check yourselves when you are in queer spaces, whether that's at the Pride parade, whether that's at the gay bar, well, you know, like drag, check yourself drag, oh, especially drag brunch. My god today, you know, like, I think our community is all about, you know, or at least we say we're all about like inclusion and everyone's welcome and all of that. And that's true. However, it's important that when you come into these spaces that are for our community, that you're not taking up space from the community, right, that you that your presence is not requiring the community to then, you know, think differently about how we show up in that particular space. And so you mentioned the free mom hugs and you know, it did start as this like really cute, you know, the first year I was like, this is amazing. Yes. Love it. And then it's like, you know, a few years later, when it's not just one woman, right? It's 20 of them. And they want to force you into a hug. It's like actually, you know, pull back a little like the road to hell is paved with good intentions, right? And we know it's probably well intended. But you know, sometimes just just check yourself and make sure that the queer space is allowing queer people to still do what we need to do in that space. Yes. Many of us have very good relationships with our mom. It's it's not something that the entire community is lacking. And I think that that's an important thing to remember too, is that at this point in history, especially the acceptance and the love for queer children is at an all time high. And so this sort of history of having to leave your family behind because you were gay is not as prevalent as it once was. And we do have wonderful relationships with our family and we are married or we do have our own children. There are things that we have as a full and bright community now that we didn't have previously. So we just want to make sure you stay up on it and don't assume that the queer community is a monolith of very sad, misfit children, right? You know, some of us and we love those ones too. I want to jump back to your book a little bit here. We see each other a black trans journey through TV and film. Do you remember the first time you saw yourself represented on screen? So I talk in the book about how I hate this question. And which is no insult to you for the record. Which is why I asked it. No, no, no, no, no. I love when people ask it because it gives me an opportunity to tease out the question in interesting ways that I think people don't often think about, right? Because there was a time period in which my answer to this question, I would say that there are three entities that I often say were like the earliest ways that I saw myself when I would answer this question. And that would be the character of Noah on the show Noah's Ark from Patrick E. and Polk back in the day. That's early 2000s. It was basically like a black gay sex in the city. And Noah was like basically the Sarah Jessica Parker character in that group. So I would say Noah on that show. And then I would say to real life folks who came into my life on America's next top model, Ms. J. Alexander and Andre Leon Talley. Yes. Yes. Love them as early possibility models, right? Who showed me various ways of how to exist in the world as a black queer person. But those images do not reflect the me that I am today. Right. And for me, it's just as important that my younger self saw possibilities on screen, right? And that my today self also sees possibilities on screen. And so when I think about the person I am today and whether or not I've seen that on screen, I'm still struggling to see, you know, the particular type of black, queer, non-binary person of trans experience that I am. I think the show that gets closest to it, it's a show called P Valley. And there's a character by the name of Uncle Clifford. And she is this, you know, non-binary house mother of a strip club in the fictional Chuck Lisa, Mississippi. And I love this because, one, it's a deeply black, deeply southern narrative that has a queer person at the center of it. And oftentimes when we when we look at the images of our community on screen, all of the gay people go to San Francisco, LA and New York, maybe you get an Atlanta, maybe you get a DC, you know, they all go to Fire Island. Right. But the reality is, right, for us as black queer folks, many of us still live in our home communities in the south, right? And like showing the ways that we navigate those spaces, the complex ways that we navigate those spaces is important to me. So I love the character of Uncle Clifford played by Nico Anand, but I also put an asterisk on it. And I say, Nico Anand is a cis gay man. He is not non-binary. He's not trans. He's not, you know, even, you know, identify as gender expansive or gender queer in a particular way. And though he does a beautiful job with the role, a lovely job with the role, I often think about what that role could look like if a non-binary person had the opportunity to breathe life into it. And so I tell people that I think one of the questions we should be asking perhaps instead of when was the first time you saw yourself on screen is what is the image on screen that has held you and reflected yourself back to you the most the longest, right? So that we get to a point where we can constantly, you know, interrogate, you know, the images that we see on screen to make sure that, you know, beyond the nostalgia, beyond the, the persons that we were, when we were coming into ourselves, that who we are today also, right, is represented on screen as well. Speaking of nostalgia and finding representation, you grew up in the church, right? Does the church still play a role in your writing and the way that you see film now? It does. The church is not all bad. There's a lot of good in the church. Yeah, it's not all bad. It's not all bad. I do think it's interesting when people ask me about like how how the church specifically shows up for me and my work. I still consider myself to be a church queen, right? Like my grandmother was a pastor. I speak a little bit about her in the book. And when your grandmother is a pastor, you're indoctrination into Christianity and the specific type of Christianity that I was indoctrinated into is very specific, right? And, and, and you don't lose those things easily, right? So I still love gospel music. I still, you know, believe in a higher power. Now, I believe God is a black trans woman. And I say that that's because we say that God is supposed to be, you know, that God is love. And I think that on this earth, it is black trans women who have shown me what love embodied looks like. And so therefore, God must be a black trans woman. And so yes, the church shows up in a variety of different ways. You know, you will hear me say a hallelujah. And a man, you know, every, every which away, um, because it's like one of those things where like, what did they say you can, you can take the child out of the church, but you can't take the church out of the child or whatever. Like I am, I am the poster person for, for that mantra. Well, it's joy provoking. It's, it's light, it's energy, it's celebration. It's all those things. Sure. The church can cause harm on the judgment side on the backside. But when you're in active worship, there really is no greater feeling that's pure joy and collective celebration. So I believe that. Absolutely. And you know, I'm, I'm of the school these days, you know, I was on a panel a few years ago, prepandemic, um, about like black folks and religion. And I said on the panel that for me, church for me today is like being on the dance floor. Like when I'm at, when I'm at a nice bar or club and the music is doing what it means to do, I'm having a spiritual transcendent experience on the dance floor. And that is church for me. And so I think, you know, I, I tell people a lot of times that I think, you know, religion and spirituality, especially for us as queer people and trans people, you might have to create something, you know, create an experience that is all your own that, that may or may not be tethered to the Bible or whatever religious text, right? You might have grown up with it may or may not be, you know, tethered to a church house specifically, or a particular pastor. But like figure out what works for you so that you can tap into not only this like divine universe person thing being that we talk about, but also the divinity within yourself. Right. Um, and I think that is how we get to a point where, you know, we can have these spiritual and religious relationships and still love the fullness of who we are. Was there a piece of history you uncovered for the book that really surprised you? I think for me, a lot of it was about properly contextualizing the impact and the work of a variety of different folks and, and so many folks who I could not, you know, put in the book, because it just didn't fit, come to mind. I think of someone like, I knew it was, it was important for me to talk a little bit about Ajita Wilson, who was a black trans woman who was a jet beauty of the week back in the eighties. Um, and for those who don't know, jet magazine was like, you know, an iconic black publication. It was like one of those magazines that was on everybody's coffee table in their house. And for a black trans woman to be this featured beauty of the week, which is like beauty of the week was like, it would always be some, you know, woman in a bikini or whatever, you know, the type of profile that people would tear out of the magazine and put up on their walls, you know, it was one of those types of situations. And so to know that a black trans woman was a jet beauty of the week. Are you kidding me? More people need to know that. So Ajita Wilson's in the book in that particular way. And she was, she was involved in film and television. She was a, an adult film actress. Um, absolutely. Right. Um, so like having her in the book was important. And then also it became important for me to not only talk about the people who've been on screen, who've been impactful in, in terms of how trans people are, are treated and rendered in our society, but also the, the everyday folks. So I take a little bit of time, for example, to talk about Monica Roberts in the book. Monica Roberts was a fabulous journalist, um, who was also black and trans. She had a blog called trans griot. And she almost single handedly is responsible for what we're beginning to see now, which is the appropriate and proper gendering of trans people in news media, right? Monica Roberts would call up news outlets across the country and say, you have misgendered this transgender woman. And you need to, this is the name that her community use. This is the, these are the pronouns. This is how you talk about her. Right. Now it's kind of, you know, ghost, right? To, to misgender somebody, you know, and even if the police report says the wrong thing or whatnot. But Monica Roberts was like paving the way for that and doing it almost single handedly. I put her work on the same level as Ida B Wells, right? As somebody who, who was just up against so much and was doing it anyway. And so it was important for me to also talk about the people on screen, but also the, the, you know, the folks with the feet on the ground, you know, in the last decade or so, right? Who have also been pivotal to how we as a community have been just like rendered in society more broadly. Mm hmm. Where do you think black trans film and TV can go from here? Oh, it can, it can go to the moon, it can go to the next galaxy. We have barely scratched the surface of the possibilities that lie for what black trans representation and visibility can look like on screen. Right. We've made immense progress, particularly over the last decade since Laverne Cox on Orange is the new black and you know, the quote unquote transgender tipping point. Um, but we also have so much further to go. Right. You mentioned the movie Monica earlier. You know, I think it's interesting even in this moment where it seems like we're having the most visibility and the most success for trans people and trans narratives in this industry. Traceless set and that movie got an 11 and a half minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival last year. Now, for those who don't know, standing ovation at these international film festivals are like the barometer of like greatness. Right. If you get a standing ovation, that's wonderful. It should open up opportunities for you. It should open up opportunities for your movie. If you get one of the longest standing ovation at that festival for that year, 11 and a half have do you know how long 11 and a half minutes is so people to be standing up in a theater and reportedly they would have kept going, but the ushers had to kick people out because another movie was supposed to go in. I say all that to say that movie struggled to get distribution after an 11 and a half minute standing ovation at one of the most prestigious film festivals in our industry. It eventually got distribution, but because it's an independent film, because the distribution deal was whatever it was, they could not afford a PR team to help them market the movie. And so Traceless set, who is also a producer on the film, turned to the public. She did a go fund me to raise money to pay for a PR person to help promote the movie. I bring that up in this conversation about where we are right now as it relates to trans images and opportunity and where we can go. And I should note, Traceless set is a white woman. Okay. Because the question was about black trans. You know, the question was about black trans film and television. But if the white girls are having to go through all of these hoops to get her very fabulous movie that got an 11 and a half minute standing ovation at one of the oldest film festivals in the country, imagine what the black trans folks are having to go through to get their projects off the ground, to get their projects on a TV, on a streamer platform or in a movie theater. Right. And so that's what I mean in terms of like just a world of possibilities of so of what could be. Right. And I think it's the it's those possibilities, right, that keep us going, right, that keep us doing this work because we know that yes, it's great to have a show like Pose, right, that did and was and is so historic in so many ways. But Pose ain't on TV no more. So what now, you know, and I think that is something that I encourage you to think about. Group calls drag race. It's going to save everything. Right. Because there's, you know, always I see you as a group calls drag race on TV right now. It's all rule all day. She is the beacon of all things queer and trans. Yes. It's not on drag race. It's not happening. You know, earlier in this interview, we were talking about how difficult it is to report on a community that you're also a part of. And then so much of the stuff that we want to say, there's just not enough time to say it all and educate everyone and hold everybody's hand through all of it. What do you do to take care of yourself when you're researching and writing? Oh, I make that noise because I am horrible at the whole self care thing. Like I'm trying to get better. I'm trying to, you know, put in the necessary boundaries, right? I'm trying to get more comfortable saying no. I'm trying to, you know, take more baths, right? I'm trying to sleep in a little bit. Maybe I'll go to the gym because they say, you know, physical health is important or whatever. I don't know. So I've been trying to like do all of these various, you know, self care type things. And I think that is how we recharge, you know, in a way to like be able to continue doing the work that we're doing and having the impact that we hope to have. And so taking vacations, taking more, more baths, you know, I've been trying to schedule naps in the middle of the day because I'm old. Yeah, I'm sure is such a thing. We talked about it. I think it was last week's podcast. We talked about the nap ministry, which is run by a black woman, I believe. And she talks about how that is such an important part of resistance. Listen, that is right up my alley. You mean I can sleep and still be part of the revolution? Yeah, love that. It's a dream for me. But also, right? Just like, you know, many of us are not getting enough sleep, right? Many of us are are just not getting enough rest. And so as a freelancer, as somebody who theoretically is in control of my own schedule, that's what I say at least. How can I build in to my everyday schedule more time to just sit with myself, whether that's a nap, whether that's meditation, whether that's watching the Real Housewives of Atlanta, you know, it runs the gamut. But like, just doing more time that like allows me to not to disengage just for a little bit from from the news, from the headlines, from covering it all. That's what it is for me. I watch Sister Wives and 90 Day Fianc\u00e9. And I just watch how straight people struggle to. It makes me feel less alone and less chaotic. It's their turn to be the spectacle, these cookie relationships on Discovery Plus and TLC. And it just it really is such a good place to rest rest your mind in the comforts of 90 Day Fianc\u00e9. Before we go, I have one more question because you do so much work, this could have been a five day interview. Tell us about Slaishan. Yes, my middle name is Raishan. Okay, it's R H A J O N. That's how you spell it. But fanatically, it's like R A Y Z H O N is like what I give people. My Instagram name is Raishan. If you're interested in following Slaishan, which I also have on Instagram is a my media production and social creation house that I created earlier this year. I really wanted to one of my goals is to create spaces where black and brown, queer and trans folks can be in community to talk about film and culture and TV in a way that's like digestible and approachable. And so I created Slaishan as a means to be able to do that. And a lot of that has been thus far, you know, through a Instagram page that I have at Slaishan. I also have a second one called at Black movie posters in which I talk about black film, but then also curating these actual physical spaces, right, where we can do some of this work. And I say that I am the chief imagination officer of Slaishan because I want imagination in particular, the black trans imagination to like drive everything that I'm doing to not be beholden to what other people think about as possible. But based on what I know is possible because of the ways that we in particular is trans people have to create ourselves out of the depths of our imagination. And like this individual that is before you today, like, wow, like, if my imagination can do this, imagine what else it can do. So that's Slaishan. I love it. Your imagination and a pastor grandma. And here we are with the most dynamic, interesting person of the year for sure. Trevelle, tell people where they can find you. Yes, you can find me a whole lot of places. I co-host a podcast called What A Day over on Crooked Media. It's a daily news podcast. We give you the news you need to know and the reasons why you should know it in about 20, 25 minutes every single weekday I co-host that with three women of color, you're not going to get your news like you're going to get your news on What A Day. I also have a second podcast called Fantai that I do with Jared Hill. That comes out on Thursdays. And then you can follow me wherever on all of the apps, even the one with the man who we don't like at Trevelle Anderson is on Twitter and then at Ray John on Instagram. And we will link to all of that in the show notes so that folks can find you. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you for having me. Happy Pride. Happy Pride, y'all. Maybe we could get like a Pride song on the way out or something. Right. You know, which one I'm coming out. I want to wear out to, you know, they run that one over and over. I need a gospel version of I'm coming out just a new happy good. I'm going to call up Billy Porter. Tell him to get on it. Wow. I mean, it's incredible to think that the show Trans Parent was the first time that many people saw a trans character on screen. And that was fewer than 10 years ago. Fast forward to last year when Michaela J. Rodriguez won a Golden Globe for her work on Pose and think about how much further we can go from here. Thanks so much to Trevelle for teaching us so much about Trans representation in film. And be sure to tune into next week's episode where we dig into the headlines that you may have missed.

Hi, I'm Kate Boller and you might know me from another Lemonade Media show called Everything Happens. If you listen to my show, you know that a lot of it is inspired by my experience with colon cancer. So of course, increasing awareness around colon cancer screening is really important to me. In case you didn't know, you should start screening at 45. And a great at-home option to screen for colon cancer is with ColaGuard. ColaGuard is the only FDA-approved, non-invasive screening test that looks for both altered DNA and blood in your stool. You can use this test on your own time at home with none of the prep that's required for a standard colonoscopy. ColaGuard offers control of your colon cancer screening by screening how you want and when you want. In addition to the convenience and ease of use, it's also affordable. Most insured patients pay zero dollars. I really admire what ColaGuard is doing, creating an easy-to-use and accessible way for people to get screened. So if you're 45 or older and at average risk, ask your health care provider about screening for colon cancer with ColaGuard. You can also request a ColaGuard prescription today at colaGuard.com slash podcast. Do not use ColaGuard if you have had adenomas, have inflammatory bowel disease, and certain hereditary syndromes, or a personal or family history of cola rectal cancer. False positive and negative results may occur. Any positive result should be followed by a colonoscopy, not a replacement for colonoscopy in high-risk patients. ColaGuard is available by prescription only. Get your screenings everyone! Big topics like deciding whether or not we want kids, building your dream career, strengthening self trust, and much much more. So join us every Monday for an unfiltered entertainment and honest conversation with friends where you don't even have to leave your house. If you're not wearing pants, we will never know. That's right, so listen to self helpless, wherever you get your podcasts."
