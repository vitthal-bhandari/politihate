    "text": " Today, the mainstream media tells you don't believe your lion eyes when it comes to the Biden crime family. A father fighting for custody of his son after his ex tries to turn the boy trans joins us to discuss his case and Kamala Harris has challenged on her low poll numbers. You will not believe her response. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Saragansala. And following Hunter Biden's ex BFF Devin Archer's closed door congressional testimony that not only confirmed then vice president Joe Biden's presence on the phone during at least 20 business meetings between Hunter and his associates, including by the way the barisma executives, and not only that selling Joe's influence was the brand, but also that Hunter commonly referred to Joe as my guy. The mainstream media, much like an ostrich, continues to bury their heads in the sand. Or maybe their heads are just permanently stuck up their asses. I'm not sure. But CNN viewers were told that Hunter was merely selling an illusion of having access to Joe Biden watch. Goldman's sort of explaining that Archer qualified the topics of discussion on these phone calls as niceties that Biden sometimes didn't even know who was on the other line with his son Hunter and sourcing the room telling CNN now that Archer did not point the finger directly at any sort of a connection between Joe Biden and his sons foreign business dealings and rather said that he was that Hunter Biden was selling the illusion of said access for us. Really a stunning development that we consider that Republicans were selling this as a breakthrough that would link Hunter's business dealings with his father. Instead, business was apparently never discussed according to Devin Archer. Zach Cohen, thanks so much for the reporting. There are five viewers I'm sure were enthralled. MSNBC was busy performing the old distract and divert tactic by bringing up Bo Biden's death. You see, it must have just been that Joe was distracted by Bo's death and he wasn't paying attention to his son's abhorrent behavior. Watch. As far as Hunter Biden goes, there's no doubt. I mean, it's pretty clear even those close to the Biden family suggest that some of his behavior is pretty unseemly. That doesn't make it illegal. And it also means that we don't know the role that then Vice President Biden may have played. And it seems like, no, they have proven that he had any to do with it. They have proven that he profited from this at all. Yet, maybe he is guilty of turning a blind eye to some of his son's behavior. And we should put this in context. This is a time when Bo Biden, the president's other son, was ill and then dying and then passed away. So perhaps he was not as attentive to what he should have been here. But again, there has simply been no evidence, Gene Robinson, no evidence at all, that he was profiting from this or he, or that either of them committed a crime when it came to this. Okay. Probably most egregious are all the lawmakers making the rounds on cable news, parroting the same talking point. There is no evidence, no evidence whatsoever of Joe's wrongdoing. Watch. And on the topic of a Biden impeachment, look, if impeachable crimes are surfaced, if they are surfaced, and I say this is a Democrat, fine. They have found no evidence whatsoever that there are impeachable crimes. To say this, to even utter this sentence is either completely intellectually dishonest or bottom of the barrel level stupidity. And Democrats are both of those things. So it's hard to spell, I must say. To say this would be pretending that we don't already have evidence that in 2015, three days after Barisma executives told Hunter Biden and Devin Archer, they needed help fighting off corruption, the corruption investigation they faced in Ukraine. Daddy Joe flew to Ukraine. Now, he was originally supposed to unveil an extra $1 billion in loan guarantees to help Ukraine's economy rebuild, but he just changed his mind and root to keve. Just like that. And all of a sudden, that $1 billion in aid he had promised was being used as a carrot he dangled over the country's nose to force them to fire the prosecutor, who, oh, by the way, just so happened to be the one that was investigating Barisma, which Joe Biden later bragged about on camera. Remember, watch. I said, I'm not going to, we're not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, you have no authority. You're not the president. The president said, I said, call him. I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars. I said, you're not getting the billion. I'm going to be leaving here. And I think it was what? Six hours. I looked at it. I said, I'm leaving the six hours. And the prosecutor's not fired. You're not getting the money. Well, son of a ****. Got fired. Got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time. But all of that timing lining up is just all a coincidence, I'm sure. And finally, The New York Times, knowing how stupid their readers are, decided to just plow through reality at 100 miles an hour with this here. It has long been known that the elder Biden, Mr. Biden at times, interacted with his son's business partners. It has long been known. Really? I wonder how they square that away with Biden's denial for years that he had anything to do with Hunter's business dealings. How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings? I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings. I have never discussed with my son or my brother or anyone else in the heaven to do it in their businesses, period. And what I will do is the same thing we did in our administration. It will be an absolute wall between personal and private and the government. Do you stand by your statement that you did not discuss any of your son's overseas business dealings? Yes, I stand by that statement. So, let's get this straight. According to mainstream media, Joe was bending over backwards to be an attentive dad to Hunter after Bow died. But not so attentive that he thought about the conflict of interest he'd be put in. He spoke to his son every single day, but never about business dealings. It has long been known that Joe interacted with his son's business partners, even though he didn't know who they were because he never spoke to his son about his business dealings. Here to help me make sense of all of this. I'm a little confused, okay? We got Matt Peterson, of course, Blaze Media's new editor in chief and Blaze Media, media critic. Blaze TV media critic. I'm all the media's. So, you know what Rob, I'm going to let you. You are the media critic. So, I feel it is only right for me to let you take a stab at this first. You just watched all of these mainstream media outlets go with these crazy narratives like there is absolutely no evidence we've seen in all of this investigation that Joe Biden has done any wrongdoing. Right. They're going to be completely shocked. But it's insane. I think one of them, it was either the media or one of those reps said that, well, you know, they used to just take the cell phone. I'm going to do it to my dad right now. I'm going to call my dad and just have them listen in on the cell phone on speaker phone while we've discussed business, right? I mean, like, because that's a normal everyday thing. Sons routinely call their parents on their cell phone, put it on the table and just have them listen in on the business meeting. Like that's not an awkward thing. The media is doing what they always do, but they need to slowly, now you're getting the New York Times to say, well, it's been long known. Yeah. It's been long known. It's been continuing to walk it back. I saw, I think it was in real clear politics yesterday. I forget who wrote it, but somebody said, this scandal might be too big to actually have traction because it involves so many people. It involves the media being complicit for four years. It involves the Democrats being complicit. I laughed when the congressman said, well, you know, if something rises to an impeachable offense, you impeached Donald Trump for threatening to withhold. Exactly. And he had money from the Ukraine for not looking into corruption, which is the corruption of Joe Biden. Yeah. That we now know the timeline happened. You did. Are you just saying that that, you're now saying that that wasn't an impeachable offense and you were just doing it for politics, which is fine. I mean, impeachment is now a political thing. It's not something that's reserved for actual crimes and misdemeanors. We know that from the Nancy Pelosi impeachment. But it's just, this is what they need to do. It's going to come to a point where there is going to be a case. It's going to be shown and something's going to end up happening. And I can see the Democrats doing it because they don't want Joe Biden to be their nominee. I was struck by those, those, those clips of Joe Biden you showed. We thought that he was, you know, showing some signs of dementia then, but how with it, he looked in those clips to how he looks today, it's stark to see the difference that four years has in his mental equity. Yeah. Matt, I just, it's just so frustrating to hear them constantly carry water for this family. And I hear the reporting on it. And I honestly do think the majority of Americans, as Rob pointed out, there's so many moving parts to this. And Glenn here, what, 2019 did like four different chalkboard episodes that were several hours long each on all of the corruption. And so I get very worried and concerned that this is going to just kind of go under the radar and we're never going to make sense of it because, I mean, as one of the Biden associates pointed out, it'll take them 10 years before they ever connect the dots because they use so many shell companies. And they were funneling the money into all of these different bank accounts from the shell companies, but the shell companies didn't receive money until their attorney received money and their attorney funneled it to them. And so it's just like, how do you, how do you ever get accountability for all of these crimes that to me, it seems clear we're committed. Well, let's start with Hunter because I think Hunter is an interesting character in that we live in a corrupt society. We live in a corrupt time and Washington DC is full of corruption on all sides. And people are starting to wake up to that reality, but to really internalize that you need to think about Hunter Biden because Hunter is someone who's interesting. He's not just a white collar criminal. He also likes to do crack cocaine, right? I mean, that's interesting. He's got the hookers and the crack. It's not enough just to get a few million dollars here and there, right? And that makes him interesting. And also sort of a distraction from the deeper corruption because we have this sexy laptop and these, ooh, look at these pictures. And of course he's never going to get in trouble for any of those crimes. But the deeper problem, and that's why he was a great distraction, the deeper problem all along has been that his family is corrupt, is bilking everyone here for millions and millions of dollars using their influence and leverage with foreign agents and actors over and over again. This is something that everyone knows is going on. And so here's the question. And a great question is, is it the case, as Rob suggests, that possibly they do want to get rid of Biden because he is so doddering in a week, the ruler of the free world is someone who is wandering in and out of rooms in the White House. They have no shame about this, but maybe they do want to get rid of him. In that case, all of a sudden, all those clips you just saw, all those journalists are going to very quickly go, oh, actually, there was some issue here and Biden has stepped down and very good of him to do that. He got entrapped into something or whatever. And they'll immediately change to and move on. Or are we so corrupt now that it doesn't matter? That half the country will say, or the journalists will even get to the point where they say, of course they made a few million dollars. That's what you do. And it was good, actually. I mean, are we going to get to that point? Are we going to get to the point where they just keep denying it, you know it's happening, what happens right in front of your face, and it just doesn't matter because let's face it, we're in a world in which people aren't arguing to run for office based on their qualifications, their charisma or anything else. The Federman principle applies. You just need someone who's be able to press the button and you tell them what button to press. Is that how bad things are in America? That's what we're about to find out. Yeah, and I think that it's, I hope Republicans in Congress know what time it is because, you know, I think that they have some reservations about going full on impeachment mode because they have, they just spent the last four years seeing what they did to Donald Trump, how they politically persecuted them, how they used it as a political pawn. The problem is that there is actual evidence this time. And although, you know, you want to talk about illusion, I think that they're worried about creating the illusion that we're engaging in political games too, and we can't stoop to that level. It's time to wake up. You're trying to fight with another party, an opposing team that doesn't play by the same rules that you feel like playing by, and it really doesn't matter what they say because they were going to call you all of those things anyway. That's my personal opinion. Like they're going to call you corrupt, they're going to say you're abusing your power, they're going to say all the things that they were actually doing the whole time when they did this to Donald Trump, they're going to say all those things about you anyway, so just do the right thing. That's right. And then about persuading the other side. This is about full-scale political war and wrestling directly with that other side to see if you can actually hold them accountable. Yeah, Rob last word. And I think that that's why people, that's what Ron DeSantis does, that nobody else seems to do in our party, is he uses his political power and uses it to get things done. And for whatever reason, the Republican party doesn't like to do that. They like to be above the fray, and that's not how you change the country. We're morally superior. Oh, well look where we're at in society. That's how, where did that all, all that moral superiority get you? All right, we got to take another quick break, we'll be back, but we want to thank our sponsor Birch Gold. So Birch Gold, I highly suggest that you guys just talk to them, check them out, see if gold is right for you. It was right for my family, which we just heavily diversified even more into gold and silver because we're looking at the Biden economy. And these are not great guys. So if you were looking to maybe protect your IRA or your 401k from the fallout of the Biden economy, might I suggest you talk to them about diversifying with gold into Birch Gold? They can help get you a tax sheltered IRA account in precious metals, or if you want to own physical gold, you can also do that with them as well. So do yourself a favor, go text the word Y, W-H-Y to 98998. What they're going to do is send you a free information kit. No obligation, it's just a free info kit on gold and on holding gold in these tax sheltered retirement accounts. See if it's right for you. Text the word Y to 9898. 9898. And Francisco father Harrison Tinsley is engaged in a challenging custody battle with his ex-girlfriend for his three-year-old son Sawyer, whose mother identifies as non-binary. And shockingly, I'm sure you guys will find this so shocking. She also is raising the child as non-binary as well, but it's not taught. Okay, they're not indoctrinated into it. It's clearly they're born this way. I want to welcome Harrison Tinsley to the program. Harrison, thank you for being here. So I have all of these details of your case right here, but I would much prefer to just let you tell your story of how this all came to be and where you're at now. Okay. Well, thank you for having me. Yeah. And about four years ago, I started dating a girl in the Bay Area. We fell in love. We never agreed politically. I always thought that'd be okay. And essentially she got pregnant very quickly into the relationship. Thankfully we were both happy about that. Excited. And she always suffered from some mental health problems. And as her pregnancy went on a few months, she was being very hostile towards me, constantly threatening me that I wouldn't see my son if I wasn't exactly who she wanted me to be, particularly politically. And it ends up happening that she breaks up with me, sends me a cease and desist letter. And I don't find out when my son's born. I find out about a week after from one of her friends, social media. And there's two months after that I filed in court and it took 13 more months to meet my son. So I met him finally. When he was 15 months old, which I thought was a travesty, I thought that was far too long. And from there I pressed on. I moved to the Bay Area. I was awarded half custody. Super grateful for that. And it was right around the time I won half custody that his mom started treating him as non-binary. And doing some serious defamation of me. There was also an incident where she was arrested for a child endangerment placed on 5150 hold when my son was with her. She was let off on those charges. But I thought, you know, I brought all of this stuff to family court. And I got granted a trial, which I'm super lucky because a lot of people just get a hearing, a short 20 minute thing. Their whole life's decided. But how to five day trial, I was extremely confident about it, loads of evidence. But after the trial, the court decided to keep custody the same. And that was kind of devastating. And I decided that I'm going to protect my son no matter what. So I'm going to tell my story to the world. I'm going to be brave. And I'm going to appeal the decision. So I'm appealing it right now. So you say that she's using what they them pronouns for him. He she's dressing him in feminine clothing. She's putting him in makeup sometimes, even though again, he's free. So like usually he's in boy clothing. But even if she's talking to me and I'm like picking him up, she'll literally call him day. It's super weird. That is very weird. But you say that he rebels against this and he says that he's a boy as well. He adamantly says he's a boy with courage and conviction, confidence. He loves being a little boy. He's like as boyish as it gets. He's probably the most boyish of all his friends even. And I think it's really sad that you wouldn't want the person you love most to be happy with who they are. So she actually, your ex-girlfriend, and again, you were never married. Correct. As a girlfriend. So she actually was adopted and raised by two older gay men. In San Francisco. In San Francisco. That's right. And now she is perpetuating this on her child. But they want us to believe that children are not indoctrinated into this. This is not taught to them. Do you have any thoughts on that? I think it's super interesting because the premise is this, right? The premise is they should let the child choose for themselves, correct? Which is insane and there's only boys and girls. But anyways, let's just pretend that we agree with that. Let's grant the premise. So he can choose for himself. Well, he's choosing. He automatically says he's a boy. If you give him a girly toy or say something he conceives as calling him a girl, he literally yells and screams at you. He'll yell on screaming his cousins. Whoever. If they give him a girly toy and say, I'm not a girl, I'm a boy. It gets really, really upset. You know, and he expresses to me things like when she took him to Disneyland, he says that she wouldn't let him go on the rides unless he wore princess shoes. And he tells that to me. And you know, he looks down when he tells me like he's clearly really sad about it and I'm not happy about it. So I'm going to try to get through this without getting emotional because I really feel for you. But in reading all of this, you mentioned when she was, the mother was placed on a 5150 hold. Sawyer was placed with her dads when that happened rather than you. How come? That's correct. I can't speculate to why the police in CPS made the decisions they did. But I thought it was kind of a crazy idea not to call me that night for sure. I would, my assumption is because of the defamation of me that happened that night to the police officers perhaps. When did you find out that your son was placed in the care of someone other than his mother? And his mother was at the hospital? Oh, I didn't find that out for a long time. So CPS did call me the next week because there's a CPS investigation. But CPS assured me that there was nothing to worry about. There was a misunderstanding and my son fell off a bed. They told me that. I asked lots of questions. They absolutely assured me that that was the case. Later, when I was finally granted access to his medical records, that I should have had it took like nine months longer than it was supposed to. But I got it and I was just randomly reading through them. And I see, you know, mom placed on 5150, child seen for head trauma, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, what in the world? And then so me and my attorney, subpoena, all the police report, police body cam footage, and then 911 call that get the full medical record, etc. Find out what really happened. It's a lot scarier than that. And so yeah, I mean, that was part of the main part of my reason for bringing it to court for a trial. Matt, I want to let you weigh in because you, of course, are a California refugee. And I just... How much faith do you have in the system over in California? It's sorting something like this out. Well, I mean, obviously very little. But this is so important, so important that you have, you know, you're on the show. I mean, because people need to understand that there's other people who feel the same way and oppose this, even in California. So as bad as things are and as bad as the system is, the fact that you're standing up and there's so many other people out there who feel the same way and are going through the same thing, they need to see that. Because they don't own the whole state. I mean, this kind of tyranny, this kind of crazy ideology, they certainly control the state, right? But they don't own the hearts and minds of millions of people who care deeply about their children. So I mean, the problem is, I wonder what Eerson thinks, but the problem is that California does tilt the balance against the rights of parents. And they do so proudly. And it's awful. Yeah. So, Eerson, tell us, like, how can we help? What can we do? I mean, we're bringing awareness to it, but you have a give send go as well. I can imagine that this fight is not cheap. No, lawyers are very expensive. Yeah. I have a give send go, give send go, saving Sawyer. It will come right up. If anyone wants to help, you can send me messages, prayers. I really appreciate every bit of support. And I can tell you to what Matt was saying. All the people I've seen in California, all the parents I know, I went to the Capitol to protest some of these anti-parent bills, like AB 957. I watched hundreds of people, many of whom would go up crazy here. I'm a leftist progressive Democrat from San Francisco, and I adamantly oppose this bill. One after another, right or left, didn't matter. Everyone's against it. No one believes these ideas. We just have to have the courage to stand up for what we believe and just not let the government raise our children, not let the government abuse us anymore. And I want to make a quick addition here, just so the viewers know which bill it is that you're talking about. AB 957 is the bill that would take children away from one or both parents if one of them did not agree to the gender identity that was brought up in custody battles, which is it is so shocking to me that we are even at this place in this country that that would be even proposed. Even in a place like commie, crazy California, no offense, sorry Harrison. That's all good. But the bill might actually help me because I'm affirming that he's a boy and he says he's a boy. So I actually spoke to the author of this bill, and it was a well-sourced and I spoke to her for seven or eight minutes. She was convinced that this bill would award me custody. Interesting. Which is interesting, but I'd still think it would hurt thousands of families so I'm against it. Right, right. Well, Harrison, thank you for fighting this fight. But I'm just so sorry for what's happening to you and I wouldn't wish it on any parent, especially a father because I know in courts fathers are often overlooked and seen as second class citizens. So I appreciate you so much fighting this fight. And I would encourage all of the viewers, go to the gives and go, it's gives and go, slash saving Sawyer and donate however much you can to help Harrison pursue knowing what is right for his son, Harrison. Thank you so much. Well, you keep us up to date on what's going on. When is the next trial, anything going on in court? It's happening soon in the appeal, the intro brief. It's a complex system that I've never done before, but it's happening pretty soon. It's happening soon. I'll keep you updated. And everyone at home, you need to speak up, have the courage to say what you believe in all aspects of your life. You're not free. If you have a different life when you're at home and when you're at work, you should all be able to say what you truly believe. And if you have kids, I think Harrison, you'll agree with me here. If you have kids, you want to know that you can look your children in the eye when they get older and tell them I did every single thing that I could to make this better for you. So every single thing I can do for Sawyer. Yeah. Thank you so much, Harrison. Thank you. All right. We'll be right back. Please media. The elites in Silicon Valley think it's their job to control what you see online. They don't trust you to be able to tell fact from fiction. So they throttle our content, delete our videos, and suspend our accounts to keep you from the truth. And a problem this big requires a big solution. Head on over to theblaze.com to see some exciting updates and learn how you can help the fight against big tech censorship. Senator DeSantis in Florida has invited Kamala Harris to Florida to discuss his African-American studies curriculum after there have been quite the attacks happening from all different sides, by the way. And maybe we should get into that. But I want to, I want to, I want to play what Kamala Harris said about Ron DeSantis and about this new curriculum in Florida that this was the whole big issue that the left pound, I'll use their framing. Democrats pounced on this. It says instruction includes how slaves develop skills, which in some instances could be applied for their personal benefit. Absolutely true statement. Well, Kamala Harris took a quite, quite, he, she had quite a problem with that. Here is Kamala talking about it. Watch. We fought a war to end a set of slavery, a civil war. People died. Oh, my, did they in the Civil War? By the untold numbers. In that war, she's thinking of what she's going to say next. Many of whom fought and died because of their belief that slavery was a sin against man, that it was inhumane, that it was not reflective of who we believe ourselves to be as a country and certainly not reflective of who we aspire to be. So who then would dare deny this history? Let us not let these politicians who are trying to divide our country win. Because you see what they are doing, what they are doing is they are creating these unnecessary debates. Oh, this is unnecessary to debate whether enslaved people benefited from slavery. Are you kidding me? Are we supposed to debate that? Not what it said. Those are two people clapping still. That's not what it said. And by the way, another talking point that was used by Republicans, mind you, was that DeSantis curriculum said that it was a net benefit, which again, it didn't say, it just said that they were taught skills that later on in life, they were able to use for benefit. This is not a very common sense thing. And so DeSantis has now invited Kamala to the capital in Florida. He said, in Florida, we are unafraid to have an open and honest dialogue about the issues. And you clearly have no trouble ducking down to Florida on short notice. So given your grave concern, which I must assume is sincere about what you think our standards say, I'm officially inviting you back down to Florida to discuss our African American history standards. We will be happy to host you here in Tallahassee. I will ask Dr. William Allen instrumental in the development of our impressive new standards to join. We welcome you, of course, to bring Randy Winegarden or someone else who shares your view about the standards. By the way, the curriculum writer Dr. Allen is black. So I would welcome this conversation to take place. Somehow I think Kamala will be like, I did this letter got lost in the mail. I never got it. Oops, I can't make it. This is one of the most disgusting debates, quote unquote, speaking of creating debates. We don't need to create debates. So let's go to established standards that come from real scholars like Dr. Bill Allen. And you know, Allen is a fellow Claremont PhD. So I have to praise him. But not just because they pay me to do it. It's because he is one of the preeminent scholars of the founding and American principles out there. And I would love to see him debate Harris because Harris clearly has three brain cells that are fighting each other. And this guy is just a real deal scholar. And what people don't understand, I mean, the ridiculous nature of this whole thing is that the standards exist to get you to the point where you can understand what different African American intellectuals were arguing about after the Civil War. There were arguments about what these ex-laves should do. And the abolitionists, you know, Northern Christian, human beings are fundamentally equal side pointed out that many of these people had become skilled at various things because they were human beings and they could put those skills to use in a free way. Some of them even purchased their own freedom in some of these wild stories, harrowing stories of the time. So the idea that any of this has to do with saying slavery was okay or whatever. I mean, it's all just nuts. It's so nuts, in fact, that I think a lot of Republicans have sort of shamed themselves in this debate by taking the left side. And it's pissed a lot of people off. I mean, wherever you come down on Trump vs. DeSantis, the problem is if people on the right are going to go with Harris on this ridiculous gibberish, you know, that's just a low blow. We don't need that. So anyway, I'm looking forward to Harris debate, Dr. Allen. I think that would be incredible, incredible content. I mean, I'm a year forward. Okay, too, Rob. But the NAACP said that if you're African American, go to Florida, that your life's in danger. So maybe the secret service won't let her go. So that's true. That's a great point. That's interesting. I was just in Florida for an event with Jonathan Isaac of the Iron Land of Magic. I think he's black. He seems safe. Wow. He seems safe. It's amazing. He risked his life for that. Yes. Yes. I don't know. So much to warn him. Yes. Someone should. This is just black people and gay people very much in danger and for I was on vacation when all this blew up. So thank you for the 50,000 foot view because I too thought that, oh my God, Rhonda Santas is, you know, a racist and he's trying to say that slavery was the best thing ever because people learned how to cobble a chute, which is I think what they're going with, right? But I mean, we don't teach the truth about slavery in the United States. We don't teach the truth of how it started, how it stopped being indentured servitude and became slavery because an African American indentured servant owner filed, you know, a lawsuit in the Virginia courts to make that happen. I mean, that's something that doesn't often get taught. When somebody told me that I was shocked and I was like 40 when I found that out because it wasn't taught in our schools. So having real discussions about what happened and what happened at the time and taking into account that abolitionists that obviously didn't like slavery said that while we can put these people to work because they learned valuable trades and that's the part of the curriculum that I think that they're talking about. It was a ticket out of context. Yes. Just talk about that part. The crazy thing is it's talking about the self-ownership that these people had. It's acknowledging, no, these were human beings. So they learned how to do different things. Well, they were in these terrible conditions and that enabled many people to seamlessly come out of it and build businesses, et cetera. Because of their perseverance. Yes. And so the whole idea that any of this is about slavery being good is just bat guano crazy stuff. It doesn't make any sense. And what does make sense is teaching the truth as Rob saying about what happened. And it goes right in the curriculum. I've looked at these standards. It goes right into a discussion about how African Americans should respond post-slavery that intellectuals, many of whom were African American, got into. This isn't some out of context thing that they just kind of dropping out of the blue and say slavery was good actually. But you know what? All of this is ridiculous because we know it's all just a ceaseless frame and a ceaseless drum beat where you are all racist because you disagree with me. Everyone I don't like is Hitler and of course Ronda Santis thinks slavery is good. I mean, yeah, great. We get it. We get it. And so I think it's ridiculous. But we should make sure that everyone on the right doesn't disagree. Trump, the Santis, whatever. But let's not have everyone on the right grabbing on to any of this nonsense. Right. Right. It is a strange place to be where you're not allowed to say that Black people persevered in spite of slavery and made something out of themselves afterwards because they were, you know, that as you mentioned, human beings, but also strong and capable clearly. But we're also at a place where like we can't recognize the woman who, you know, Aunt Jemima has to be erased and we can't recognize the woman who built everything up, you know, built up her empire the way that she did. And we can't recognize all of these African American pioneers. We have to be like, oh, we can't put them on a syrup bottle. We have to completely erase them. It's just so weird to me. The whole 1619 project was, well, do you understand that, you know, all these African Americans were slaves built America? Right. And the standards are like, a lot of these people learned a lot of skills and things that in those terrible conditions they were able to use later on. Yeah. And it's acknowledging that contribution, right? That these are people who would like, they built stuff. They were just, I don't know what people think. They were human beings. And then you acknowledge, you are a racist. How dare you say that? You think slavery is good. What are you talking about? You're nuts. This entire debate is nuts. And we need to just reject. The problem is that right now in Washington, D.C., there are still people who are like, oh my gosh, that sounds racist, right? And there are Republicans coming out and saying, we're on to Santas as a racist. This makes me very uncomfortable. This thing that people made up from these real standards. And so that to me is what needs to end. The reason that they're saying this is because it does work with a certain sector of the right, right? People in charge, like, oh, the worst thing in the world is if the people in charge of the country call me a racist. So I have to stop. This is bad. Yes. This is racist. Rhonda Santas is a Nazi. Reject the whole thing, people. Reject all of it. Rob, last word. It goes to the point that people want to look at history through a modern lens based on our supposed standards of today. You see that a lot in popular history and people writing stuff. And you just, you going back and it was African American abolitionists that they're writing about in these, if I understand you correctly, that they're writing about in these actual standards. Yeah. All right. We got to take a quick break. We'll grab back. As of the time of this taping, remember, there's like a little bit of a time in between the time we finish this and the time it airs. We are being told that the grand jury investigating J6 has convened and that there should be an announcement from the DOJ. We expected to be Trump's third indictment officially announced. Remember his attorneys met with Jack Smith's office previously at what was at the end of last week, the beginning of this week, and they expected so no surprise there. But still equally as infuriating, I'll just say. Quick thoughts on that, guys. I mean, this is the case that they especially want to make out of all the indictments and all the ways in which they're trying to get Trump. They're not going to stop until they martyr him in some way. They're not going to stop until they they put him in jail. Right? I mean, that's their attitude. And so for all of them, this is the sexy one because in their diseased minds, they're they're this is saying he was seditious. He was a traitor against America itself in our sacred democracy. So I think this is the one that they're going to go with. Yeah, Rob, that is the biggest crime being against our blessed democracy. And of course, they're going to do it. Yeah. Obviously, we'll have more on all of that tomorrow. But again, it's no big shock. We know they're not going to rest until they imprison him, preferably for them for life, I'm sure. But, you know, Republicans are very nervous to vote on impeachment. There's this really, I mean, they're just trying to, you know, politically persecute their enemy and throw him in jail for the rest of his life. But we just don't want to vote on impeachment. We're too scared. We don't know. All right, I want to throw up this quick, quick story here. University of Michigan survey found that boys in their senior year of high school are almost two times more likely to identify as conservative than liberal. However, the girls suck because they're more likely to consider themselves liberal than conservative. But if we can, I feel like we got, I mean, winning the males is huge. If we can just build off of that, the females will follow as they should. She said it. No, I did. I'm allowed to say it. Repeal the 19th. I'm allowed to say women should be submissive. I'm allowed to say, well, women should never be president. I'm allowed to say all of those things. I can't have you write my dating profile. But this is fascinating that this is 2020 through 2023 numbers. And they're the highest that they've been for conservatives since the early 1990s. And liberal identifying boys have been an ever falling trend. So that's maybe there's hope out there. Oh, I mean, there's definitely hope. And the thing is, even if everything continues to go the way it's going and there's a totalitarian state and whatever, you know, you still you still have human nature underneath all of that. And that's what you see here. If you go and you talk to how these kids and you realize how oppressed they have been in every way, there's no there's nothing rebel against anymore. Right? I mean, most of them don't know anything about religion. I don't even know what it is. They don't know any better, in other words, and they're just looking around responding in a natural way to the situation. And they realize they sort of live in a dystopian nightmare and they associate being liberal with all the radical ideology. So that doesn't surprise me at all. And for for the girls, I think, I think that there is a difference between the two sexes. I don't know, it's comfortable. I think that might be true. But I think there's also a way the way in which they engage with social media would be my guess. Because I think that the girls are very much, they relate to social media in a different way. And they intuit what the values are supposed to be. That would be my guess. Whereas a lot of the males, the young guys, they feel as if they have been hosed in many ways and they're being told that they're bad and they're evil, etc. Right? Right. Girls are much more emotional as well. Well, also, but also, I you said that not me, but shocking. But also, the girls are being told that they're okay. Right. Right. So, you need to release your inner goddess and you're perfect inside. And that's the story of every female heroine. And so no suffering for you. Just be who you are. Right. So you're going to go along with it. Whereas if you are a young male and you're told, no, actually inside you, you're terrible. You're bad. You're toxic. And also, if you're white, you're intrinsically evil. We got about 20 seconds here, Rob. Yeah. That's exactly right. This is a reactionary to use that phrase response to being told that everything that's in your nature as Harrison's. I mean, Harrison's boy doing that that we talked to earlier is the exact same thing. He knows he's a boy. He gets upset when you call him a girl. He gets upset when his natural tendencies are tampered down. And in the case of many boys, when being a boy gets medicated away, yeah, that's you would expect it. And it goes back to us. I mean, we're Gen X and I think we're one of the most conservative generations. So it's very interesting that it was the early 90s was the last time. All right. We got to take a break. We'll be back. All right. Vice President Kamala Harris had quite the interesting moment with an ABC News reporter. I don't think she's used to them pushing back. But the ABC News reporter was like, how do you respond to all the low polling? And her answer was amazing. Watch. There are reports to say that you have the lowest approval rating of any vice president. I'm curious how much of a role if any that you feel race and gender play in that? Well, there are polls that also say I have great approval ratings. I think the point that has to be made is that there are attempts to create distractions away from the accomplishments of our administration. Like what? Like what? Like what? Well, there are polls that show like the great approval ratings. I spoiler alert, there are no such polls. None. None because she is absent. I said earlier, women should not be president. Probably not vice president either, to be quite honest. Did you see the way she cringed? I'm saying it all. You guys are not saying anything. They don't endorse. They're going to do retweets. Do not equal endorsements, whatever everyone puts in their bio. I'm saying it. I'm going to retweet a lot of it. Send me the hate mail, dear Sarah, at theblaze.com.
