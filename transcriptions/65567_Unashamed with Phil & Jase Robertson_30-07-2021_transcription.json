    "text": " I am unashamed. What about you? So I go to play golf yesterday. I was just trying to play golf. I didn't play, but maybe twice in two months. So my buddy gets me there out at the place we usually play. And he said, well, there's a tournament going on. So if you want to play, you got to get in the tournament. I was like, well, what kind of tournament is this? It's like playing the ball down. We're going to play by the rules. It's some kind of they had letters. You know, I forgot what the letters were. M. G. something event. And I was like, why would I want to do this to myself? My game is not in tournament shape. So I went in there, paid my entry fee because I just wanted to play golf. I was like, who cares? And I made a, I made a plot to, I said, why don't you all just for people with handicaps worse than 10? Why don't you all just put a rule that says once you hit double bogey on a hole? That's it. Pick it up. I said, they're not going to win anyway. So, and the guy who's running the golf course and the tournament, he looked at me bewildered. He said, but that's not real golf. I was like, he's like, why would you want to do that? I said, because I don't want to spend six hours out here waiting on someone who's running out of balls or because some of these people in the tournament are not capable of finishing the whole. Do we really want to watch somebody make 10 on a whole? I mean, and guess what, Al? On number, what was that? Number six? I made a nine on a par four. And here's where it all started. We're on the tee box. And we had started on, on hole number nine. No, this was number seven. So I played all the way around. I actually played pretty good. So I'm fixing my tee shot. And somebody said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Look in the fairway. And there was a, there was a dough and a fun in the middle of the fairway. Of course I made a joke. I said, trust me. Safest place I could be. They're good. And so then I, so then I said, I got the wrong weapon in my hand, boys. And they were like, well, I've never heard that before. So then I had to tell them the, the size story. Can I tell this story? This, it's PG. Oh, yeah. It's a famous duck hunt. We were together. I don't know if we've ever told this story, but side, you know, there's no bathroom and, and the duck hunting area. You basically have to, when, when nature calls, especially if you're, you're at a certain age, older, you know, when you got a, when you got to go, you got to go. And so, so I had to go. And the world is your, your, no, at this point. We're hunting. We had killed no ducks. And it's like eight o'clock in the morning. And so Si is doing his thing, which was awkward. And all of a sudden 12 get wall come into the decoys. Everybody cut them. We mama, mama, mama, mama. And the whole time we're shooting, Si is hollering saying, I got the wrong weapon in my hand, boys. And he came one of the funniest things I've ever heard in my life. And so I said that about the deer. And then I, so I was distracted. My point is I lost my focus. I missed the fairway by about 75 yards. I was by a tree. We're playing the ball down. I tried to chip out. I hit another tree. I eventually hit it in the water and it, you know, just, it was not fun. So, so I made it nine. But my point is that when you make laws for things, it just kind of takes the fun out of it, you know, and granted, I didn't win. And I made it. I did birdie the next hole, which I thought in a way. I made a nine. And then the next hole, I birdied it to finish the round, which just, which just shows you that life is not so much about what happens, but how you respond to it. So that was my spiritual. And I would say that golf, Jay is probably the one of the most legalistic, you know, I say that in quotes sports anyway. I mean, there's so many rules about so many different things. And then you're right. Some people just love to be there to enforce every little thing that you address the ball. Was that really a swing? Did your ball move? And you know, so then we watch golf, who do these guys are professionals. And obviously they're not worried like a guy like me about, can I even advance the ball? But for me to be able to enjoy golf, I can't, if I play ball, it's not fun to me. To go out and shoot 112 because, you know, I couldn't move the ball off a route or whatever. So it's just, you're right. I mean, is it fun or are we doing this for fun? Are we doing this to try out? Well, I, we're, I actually paid money to put myself in this situation. And I would say half the round we spent in consultation trying to figure out what to do. Because the professionals are playing on courses and I played on them in these, these program type things. But the courses they're playing has been maintained at a level where the rules are easier to uphold. I'm, you know, when you're out here just, you know, playing on a course and you're like, is this ground under repair? There's no circle here. But I would call this, I mean, yesterday we were having to debate. I said, I would call that ground under repair. It actually needs some severe repair. So I tend to lean on that when I would be giving my opinion. Jay, remember, you remember recently we told a few podcasts ago, we told this, I told the story about when I hit that golf ball and it hit that little beady small rock marker and it came back and hit me right in the groin. Yeah. My thigh, thankfully. Well, I didn't say this in the podcast, but after we, you know, got done laughing five minutes of just, I mean, laying on the ground laughing, including me, we get up. And my first question is, well, how do I count? Is that, does that a stroke? I mean, is that a, is that's a man made? So then we spent the next five minutes arguing. I've just now almost, you know, neutered myself. And we spent the next five minutes arguing about whether that was, should count. And am I hitting three now? Oh, because of what happened. You're not going to believe this. Same hole yesterday. I'm playing with a buddy of mine. He is, he's down the fairway. And there's a ditch that goes across that by sex, the fairway. And so he's over on the right. He's going for the green and two. It's a par five. He hits a shot, but he, he came up on the ball and the ball only went about a foot off the ground, but he smoked it. But he hit into the side of the, there's a concrete, I don't even know what you'd call it. They have a pipe under and there's a little road with the facing of it is concrete. He hit that concrete and it, the ball came right back where it came from with probably twice as much speed and went right by his head. And he looked at me like, what do I do? I said, you'd be glad that you're alive. That's why I retired from golf because we were playing in this story. What was it? The worm burner? The worm. It was our last worm burner closet. Thanks to Zach. Yeah. We've been doing it for 10 years. Why is it called worm burner for our audience? So just what you describe, because if you hit the ball and you barely get it up and it goes across, it can kill worms as it goes because it never gets over two inches. It burns the worms. It burns the worms. And we knew at Wysway Road, there were a few golfers, but for the most part were worm burners. So tell the stories that this is the. So I'm out there playing. It's, it's me and my wife, Jill and Paula Godwin, John Godwin's wife. And then Ben, my brother-in-law, because I think he sponsored, it was a fundraiser. We put the four of them together talent wise, Jase and your golfers. You've got like my six-year-old grandson. No one's still that. It wasn't that bad, but another skill. That's combined. No, I just started playing and Willie was giving me lessons which turned into more of like a roasting session more of like a, I felt like it was more like him abusing me and pick. It was ridiculous. He's the worst coach. Way back to your childhood. Oh man. I was like back in his armpit as a kid. It was horrible. But so I get out there and I'm hitting the ball fairly straight and, and, but Jill and Paula kept going up to the women's tee box whenever I would, me and Ben would tee off. I'd say, you guys, you can't go up there until we tee off, but I've been hitting them straight. And in this particular hole, I'm hitting to the right and the, and the women's tee boxes way back to the left. So they, they go up there in the golf cart and I'm just like, you know what? I'm not worried about it. I'm going to hit this thing off the tee box and I get my drive around. And I mean, I just smoke it and it, that thing just makes a hard left. It goes in between the two golf bags, hits Jill in the back of the right ear. Are you kidding me? No. I'm dead seriously. She collapses. Paula lets out an explicit, just a curse word rant out of church tournament. She's, she's still not a dude. She's still not an old enough Christian not to go back in a moment like that. She's in the medical profession. Oh, she's freaking out. I dropped the club. I'm thinking I've killed my wife. I run up there. She's got blood coming out of her ear. The ambulance comes. We take her to the, you know, the emergency room. It was about four days of healing and everything was fine until about, about, about three years later, Jill's like, man, I'm, I'm losing my hearing and I'm by it. Twenty five years old. You're not losing your hearing. So she, we get referred to a doctor, an ear specialist in Jackson, Mississippi. And this guy, I mean, he is the, he's the upper echelon of the ear world. And we get in there and I'm, I'm not kidding you. And he walks in with a tuning fork and he, he hits that thing on his, on his hand and he puts it behind her ear and he asks her a couple questions. And he said, and she answers them and he looks at me and he says, has there ever been any blunt trauma to her right ear? And we were like, nah, and then we both at the same time were like, it was, it was that one time. And we talked in the story, of course, he's like, you idiot, man. And apparently when I hit her, there's three bones in your inner ear. And one of them was not loose. And over time it lost blood flow and disintegrated. And so she lost 95% of her hearing in her right ear. And they did a prosthetic implant, implanted the bone, returned her hearing returned immediately. But that was, so I retired. Let me, let me give you the Paul Harvey rest of the story because this was the last worm burner. So that, that was the afternoon in the morning, our old friend, dad, Ken Bolden, you know, Bolden, right? Oh, yeah. So Bolden, who's about, who's wider than he is tall. If you can imagine that he's a little short man, but he is a wide load. And he decides he's going to play in the worm burner this year. So he's out there warming up, which means he's just spreading the ball left and right. And he, he pops his knee out of joint. But when he fell over, he's rolling around the ground. The person who works at the golf, this is the start of the day. Because we had two rounds round the morning, round the afternoon. They call an ambulance. And so, because they thought he had a heart attack. So I go running up there where these, he's popped his knee out of joint. And the ambulance shows up. And then of course we send it back because we didn't need it. And then that afternoon I'm out on the course play it and I hear another ambulance and I said, you know what, this is the last year that I'm doing this. If you have two ambulance calls, one day your church does not need to be playing in a golf tournament. So that ended the worm burner. Thanks to Bolden and Zach for their golfing prowess. There's a reason I never played in the worm burner. And I went to that church and I played golf. These are the reasons why. I never thought of until today in the last five minutes. I've never thought of golf as being dangerous. Yeah, it's dangerous. Until I'm listening to two or three rednecks and I'm thinking, you know, maybe that's why I never tried that game. I don't think you missed one. You get yourself killed, I tell. Oh, I know. Well, I mean, look, yesterday I hit a ball. I mean, just a bomb. Unfortunately, it was about 80 yards right of where I was aiming. And so I, and I hit it further than I thought I was capable of hitting it. So it went over the recovery is a golf ball. Is it like zero? No, it's about as rubbery as a rock. I mean, when you were basically, it's hard. Yeah, it's hard. So I hit this ball through the fairway. Well, what I didn't know was because there's a hill there. There were other golfers there. So I go up there. I'm in their fairway. Well, guess what they said? Hey, you almost hit us. I said, sorry about that. They're like, you know, that's why we haul our four. I didn't holler because I didn't see them there across the hill. So anyway, let's just take a break. So we've been talking about Jason's homes. I don't know if he's ever found out exactly. He checks his text to find out how many he has. But one of the things, Jason, that you probably better be checking on you. Go ahead and text yourself a message that you need to go to home title lock.com and make sure that you still own your homes. That's right. Because these cyber thieves, they go in. They steal your title that they run up a bunch of them. They run up a bunch of bills and borrow a bunch of money against your house. They'll take the equity out of it. Yeah. And then all of a sudden you get four clothes though. You didn't even know you don't have your house. So it's a terrible situation. It's happened to a lot of people. So you don't want that to happen to you. So here's what you do to protect your most important asset. You go to home title lock.com. You're going to register your address to make sure that you're not already a victim. You get a complete title history of your home when you do this. Home title lock.com. It's a hundred dollar value and you're going to get that free. So check these guys out home title lock.com. Make sure that you are the owner of your home. So, Jason, why do you holler for anyway? Do you know that? I guess is it F O R E? Yeah, I think it's a European thing. They came up with it. Incoming, incoming. So that reminded me, Jason, remember when we first joined Calvert, we were playing what's now number one. It used to be number seven and it had kind of a hidden, it had a little helier back then if you play from the back. And it looked like the people had gone. And so we all started hitting our drives down there. And when we come over the hill, there's four guys standing there. One of them is one of the owners of the club. We had just joined the club. And they're all looking back at us. And one guy's hopping around holding his backside. And it turns out that I hit him right in the rump. So you've had people too? Oh, yeah, with my driver. And it was the owner of the club. It's true. I feel better now. We were so embarrassed, you know. So yeah, that it's hard enough to cause people to jump around. He called me a couple of names that weren't really, you can't find him in the Bible. And Zach almost killed his wife. Oh, yes, golf. I've actually hit two people with golf balls. And then I lived on the golf course. I was on the 18th green, which had a pond there. And it was late at night. And I don't think you're supposed to do this. But I said, let's go down there and get all those golf balls out of the... Those things are expensive. So me and my brother-in-law Ben, we're raking them out. I hear somebody coming. So we started running. And I grabbed the rake. I hit him in a tooth and shipped his tooth. All this happened in a three-month span. And I was just like, you know what? This thing. Maybe golf is not your game. That's what you started telling us. You went from playing golf to stealing golf balls. Well, I mean, they were in the water. They were in the water. They were in the water in front of my house. And I'm like, who's going to get these? They're just sitting out there. I don't know. Yeah. Is it stealing? Is it stealing, guys? That's just grand theft. Golf ball. Golf ball. That's a golf ball. I don't know what the material is that they use, but if it sinks, that's pretty dense. That's a pretty dense ball you're playing with. Well, let's just put it this way. If you're baptized and the evil one tries to steal your soul, is it stealing? Wow. That's a stretch. The question is, who owns the golf ball once it enters the water? The golf course, because they go out and get those balls and resell them. You'll have to work that out if that's ethical, because it was your ball that went in there. But usually the course. No, I was getting other people. I was getting them other people's. Yeah. But I just started, I'm out of another rules. I didn't know that. But you know what that cramp is doing? I lived right there. Yeah. It was almost like technically, I mean, it almost could be like my area. Well, there's a statute of limitations here, because this has been about 15 years ago. I think you would be right. If you put a mark, if you marked your ball and you went into the pond at night and retrieved your ball, I think you'd be fine. But if you got other people's... Well, they would not like it because they make money. I think you'd be fine. But you could probably work out a deal. They'd probably bomb from you at a cheaper rate, because they still got to go in there and get them. But don't let J.C. be all sanctimonious, because he's done... He will have done their share of night raids. Oh, I've done it many times. I didn't say I didn't do it. I just... He's laying it all out like a terrible person. Some of the greatest nights of my life, I had a tow sack full of bullfrogs and golf balls that I had taken from the same location. Yeah. That's pretty good. Yeah. If somebody sent me a video, J.C. is one of our listeners, but unfortunately it was so dark, I couldn't see what he was talking about. But he said that I finally found somebody that loves frogs as much as me and my dad, and he was sending me a video of them on a program, but it was too dark. I couldn't see anything. Oh, I do. I think I realized that when I think I've told this story before, but I mean, I was leaving the church building with my family, the entire family. We're in the middle of town. I mean, now it's a, what, six lane road, and it's pouring down rain. There's traffic everywhere. And my headlights, when I was fixed to take a ride, I looked in the middle of the intersection and there's one of the biggest bullfrogs I've ever seen in the middle of town. And I said, wait right here. And Missy started screaming like, wait, and I put my hands up and stopped traffic. I got down into the ready position and I put a show on for all the onlooker. I literally shut down the highway, pounced on the frog and I held it in my, they blow the horn. Oh, they were blowing the horn. People hollering obscenities like, what are you doing? And I'm like, I'm saving this frog. I kind of had fun with it, you know, and so then people started cheering, you know, blowing their horn and Missy's like, well, what are you going to do? And they might said, I'm going to take him home. I'm going to clean him and then I'm going to eat him. But with that, with that story, I was like, golf balls and bullfrogs. But so let's get out of something a little more meaty. Well, I'm glad you asked, but Phil in Romans 13, eight through 14, the via the Holy Spirit, Paul, there's, there's a lot of references to real life to spiritual things, which is all we're doing. He makes the reference about being awake or asleep. He looks at being awake as a positive thing. Where's that at? Verse 11, understand at the present time, the hours come for you to wake up from your slumber because our salvation is near now than when we first believed. All right. Yeah. Then he says day to night, he says, the night is nearly over. So night, another earthly thing that we experienced, but night is viewed as not favorable. The day is almost here. Let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light, which is an ex illustration. Don't live in darkness, but on the armor of light. I just think it's interesting how the Bible does that and makes spiritual references out of things. Unlike law, we're not under law, a law of works. Grace is a free gift. However, knowing that grace is a free gift, let no debt verse verse eight, Romans 13, let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another. When you come to Jesus, there is a debt involved in that. And that text says, and the debt is you are, you must love your brother. You owe him. You owe him that. Even grace, you know, it teaches us to say no to ungodliness, all that, and then to do good. But he's saying there, that's a debt that you can't repay, which is pretty interesting way to phrase that. Yeah. Well, I think his point was, where's that verse that said Jesus didn't come to abolish the law, but to fulfill it? Yeah. I think that's his point here, which is the law. What what love does to the law is everything the law was trying to prohibit and everything that it was trying to get you to avoid. Love pretty much does the exact same thing without all the rules and regulations. That's right. So love when you say, well, but but you think, but it's keeping a law. Yeah. Oh, your brother love. His point is you're not loving your brother and you don't owe him, owe him your love because it's a work on your part. You love him because you are saved, not to be saved. Exactly. In other words, you learn that from Jesus. But that's right. Since you're saved, you say, well, I don't have to do anything then. Thank you, Lord. And I don't have to reach out to my brother or my neighbor for nothing. He says, nope, you're missing the point because you're saved. You love your neighbor and you owe him that because look what God did for you because he loves you. He gave his life for you. But you don't learn that unless you take yourself off and put on Jesus. That's why he said, close yourself with Jesus. That's right. He he becomes greater. You become less. Yep. Let's take a break. Yeah. J.S.A.P. was Matthew 5 17. Yeah. He said, do not think I've come to abolish the law. I have come to abolish them, not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. And he said the law of the prophets. You know, what's interesting, Al, is that he said all the commands in the Bible, that people that you that you we didn't keep and it would violate them or summed up whatever other commandment there may be in verse verse 11 there can be summed up in one rule when some of those absolutely no rules. Well, there is one rule. Love your neighbor as yourself. Love does no harm to its neighbor. Therefore, love is the fulfillment of the law. That is wild. Well, let me ask you all what you all think this means. I was perfect love. And you say you would have fulfilled the law. Jesus had it. We don't, but we can at least work towards that. Yeah. Let me ask you this. And Luke 24, you know, when Jesus appeared, now he's he died. He was buried and then he's raised and they were like having a hard time dealing with that as I would. You see your friend die and that three days later, he walks into a room and you're like, you're doubting that this is him because you just, you knew that he died. And you remember the exchange. Yeah. But Thomas, it's I myself touch, been see a ghost. I was not have flesh and bones. As you see, I have, then he asked a perplexing question. He said, do you have anything here to eat? Well, he obviously no longer needs food to stay alive because you can't kill him. So that now their heads are racing, but then he says this, this quote in 44. And I wanted to ask and see what you all thought about it. He said to them, this is what I told you while I was still with you, everything must be fulfilled that is written about me and the law of Moses, the prophets and the Psalms. Of course, then he opened their minds so that they could understand the scriptures. This is what is written that Christ would suffer and rise from the dead and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in the name in his name to all nations, which is kind of the point of Romans. So I was going to ask you, what do you think he meant? Since we're talking about being fulfilled, he came to fulfill the law. What do you think he meant when he said, this is what I told you that everything must be fulfilled that is written about me and the law of Moses and the prophets and the Psalms. One of my favorite phrases that I use when I preach your teachers is the finished work of Christ. Yeah. Because I grew up in a faith tradition that his work wasn't quite finished yet. I was almost earning my spot in by what I did and I didn't see the finality and the completed work of Christ. His work is finished on the cross. What he accomplished there was a fulfillment of everything that had been prophesied up and at that point. So you have the prophets that prophesied about him, which he fulfilled every single one of the prophecies about himself, the law which pointed to him. He fulfilled the accomplishment of what the law was trying to accomplish, which was, which was righteousness. Which, and even that it really wasn't put into effect to bring righteousness that was put into effect to show that you can't be righteous without God. But then God came in human flesh and in Jesus, he fulfilled the law. He fulfilled the prophecies. He fulfilled all of the Psalms and the messianic Psalms that David wrote that, that we're talking about this coming Messiah. Everything, everything was completed in the person of Jesus Christ in his finished work and that, and that matters because if it's not finished, then that means that we're not necessarily saved. You know what I mean? And we've got to do more or there's more coming. It's the whole book of Hebrews. There's nothing more coming. In Hebrews 6, if Jesus ain't enough, Hebrews 10, there's nothing left for you. What comes to my mind and you're exactly right. God made him who had no sin to be sin for us so that in him, we might become the righteousness of God. He was sinless and it's putting, he'll allow us to get in a position in him so that we are viewed as sinless because we're inside the sinless one. Does that make sense? Oh, yeah. I was thinking about this in Colossians chapter two the other day when I was doing a little research on some prevailing philosophies of our day, but it says, see to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human traditions and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ. So in other words, don't buy into these humanistic man-made systems, these philosophies that men come up with, they're not rooted in Christ. And then it goes on to say in Christ, in Christ, the fullness of deity dwells in bodily form. And if you continue to read Colossians two, it uses the phrase in him, probably five or 10 times to show the centrality of Jesus. And I love that verse that you just quoted Phil because it really does point to how we are made righteous. That's correct. Not in our own position, not in our own work. It's in Christ were made righteous because our identity, you talk a whole lot about identity today, if my identity is in my race or my gender or my pronouns, whatever I decided to be, there's no hope for me. But if my identity is found in Christ, then there is a way for me to be righteous. There's a way for me to be in a right standing with God. Yep. Yeah. I think he's, he made a really good point there in verse 14 when he said, close yourselves with Jesus. And then he says, and don't even think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature. You know, he had gone through about let us behaving decently, but he, he went to where it starts, which is in our mind, we have these ideas that are selfish. I mean, what's that James 3 16, where you have envy and selfish ambition. There you find disorder in every evil practice. But part of, part of putting on Jesus and allowing his power and spirit to work in your life is to realize the power of just what you think about, you know, what you put inside your head. And the more you are self absorbed, you come up with ideas and thoughts that are wrong. And then it, then you go down the, the trail, you know, yeah. That's good. All right. I'll say another break. Well, you become the, you become what, what the physicist calls a black hole when you're self centered. If you think about a black hole by very definition, it's a, it's self centered. And, and it pulls in everything around it. The gravitational pull of a black hole is so strong that it pulls in every thing around it. And when we become self centered, we become like that and we start pulling in all these people around us. But if you're in Christ, it's quite the opposite. Instead of pulling in people around you and do your consumptive hole of nothing. This you actually give and pour out and, and there's life and there's life abundantly, which is the, I think that's the whole point of, of Romans 13, get into this idea of, of love being the core and the center and the only debt that we owe. It's the second Corinthians 10 passage. It's a, it's a new weapon we fight with. The demolishes strongholds that sets up, sets us up against the knowledge of God. It's love because love by its very definition is, is that is who God is. First John four eight, God isn't loving. God is love. Like this is the description of who he is. And I think that's why when we, why it's the core of the whole thing is because it's the definition of a God who's love. And the reason why he's love is because he's triune his father, son and Holy Spirit who existed eternally and they loved each other for eternity. That, that is God. You know, I said everything that we see that's going to give life, it has to come from the source of life. That's come from who he is. I think that's why the social media world has been so difficult. On our society, because you're basically marketing yourself. To, and so you can think about how to make yourself look good. This constantly on your mind. Hey, have you, have you observed lately in an airport or somewhere? If you see a young girl, a teenage girl, maybe a middle school girl, do you see what they do on their phone constantly? Have you noticed it? They just sit there and either they're either looking at themselves like they're used their phone as a mirror or they're taking pictures of themselves, I guess, to post. But when I watch them and I just think, man, you talk about just only about you. I've seen it so many times that I've just observed it. You know, for every picture they post, there's probably, they've probably taken about 400. Yeah. Until they get the right one. Right. It's labor. I said every five minutes on the way down here today, everybody was going around a car. I said, Oh, they're having car trouble. And when I got to the car, it's a red light. It's green. There's four lanes. So this lane, this lane has stopped. Everybody's going around, going around, going around. I look, it looked, this is a teenage girl. She was on her phone. Now she might have been calling somebody saying my car broke down, but the car looked fairly new. I think she just stopped and said, nope, I got to answer this right now. Amazing. I mean, that was an hour ago coming down. But I was for some reason, my wife had posted something about my metal detector on social media. And she was asking me if it was okay. I mean, we're one. So she, she does it and she knows what I would do. I mean, I gave her the picture. So I went on there. Well, someone had commented on the last event I did with the truckers. I, I told you all about that. Somebody had said, thanks for coming to South Carolina. It was good event. Well, they had a picture, but the social media provider had had censored the picture. It said this. So I couldn't see it. It said it, it, it contained sensitive material. And I thought, well, why would they? Cause you know, I was scared to click on it. Cause it was like, this is sensitive. But I thought this person is saying, thanks for coming and sharing. They were at the event. I'm clicking on this. When I clicked on it, the picture was me holding my Bible up as I was speaking. And I thought, are you kidding me? They censored me holding a Bible up. And it was a picture. It wasn't like I was saying anything. And I thought that, that, that's where we got problems. When you're promoting you being self-absorbed, that's okay. But me sharing about the power of God. Oh no, this is not promoting you. You're promoting God that we're going to censor that and not allow people to see that photograph. I thought that was a bad sign for society. Very bad. So, Jason, to your point, I remember about the girl, I was just trying to verify it, but I'm not sure that I have. But someone told me that there's a new law in Louisiana that if this woman you described, if a police officer pulls up behind her, she's texting or looking at her phone, driving, that he can pull her over and give her a DUI driving under the influence, because now they've added electronics as an influence or just like alcohol or drugs or all these other things. So I'm going to verify that. But I heard that that's a new law. I actually think it's a good idea. Because I say one out of three cars on the way anywhere. I mean, we just got back when we went to, you know, on the beach. When that's the first time I had gotten in a car, drove it, driven seven or eight hours, one out of three or four cars were visually distracted by a cell phone device. Some of them are either going way under the speed limit and you're like, what, what, what is what's happening? Everybody's trying to go around and you get up there. And it's just somebody is on their phone and they're just oblivious of the world going around. You've just explained why I don't have a cell phone. Yeah. But Phil, as a citizen, you have to drive and navigate around these people. I understand that's why I don't drive up everywhere. There's a lot of them driving. Well, OK, you're a terrible example for this analogy because you don't have a phone. You don't have a driver before we don't drive. So he's got his own gas station at his house. Yeah, your own gas station. Yeah. The rest of the skate do that, Bill. I don't need to go to town to fill her up. I just said, no, no. You've literally fallen through a crack of civilized society. I've retreated from how do you feel about it? I feel pretty comfortable about it. I'm glad I don't have a cell phone. However, I'm glad our audience does have a cell phone. I'm happy for you because you're clicking on and you're finding out why I don't have one. But I want you to keep yours. You don't have to throw it away, but I'm just not going down that road. I'm just not going to do it. It's too much. I'm stopping in the middle of the street and you see a little girl talking. You say it didn't make me mad. Well, I mean, I just. But I blew the horn, but look, I blew the horn. I just laid on. Can you just shut it off and drive? Yeah. You get to where you're going and OK, pick back up. Yeah, they have all kind of apps that you can put on where it like disables your phone, while you're driving. If you're not strong enough to avoid that or whatever. But look, when I blew that horn, just, I mean, just laid on it as I'm going by. But don't you feel good. She looked up at me like, what are you doing? Yeah. Don't you feel good about doing whatever you're doing and and and qualifying a period of time? I'm not I'm fit to shut this off. Yeah, I don't want to hear anymore about anything from anybody. I just want to shut it. Now, do you make a you make a really good point? Let's take our last break. So to your point, so a couple of weeks ago, I'm preaching at that. BFR and someone's phone goes off, you know, it starts ringing. It's got a distinct ring and the whole auditorium hears it. And so, you know, but I'm a professional, so I ignored it. Some person didn't turn their phone off. I knew now they were going to be scrambling to turn it off. Well, about two or three minutes goes by. I'm still preaching. It rings again. So I'm thinking, all right. So it takes a little bit. He turns it off about another 10 minutes go by. It rings again. Third time, well, now I, you know, I tried to ignore it. Same ring. No, same ring. Same area of the building. If the agent, I can see it law enforcement personnel. I can see it. A medical doctor who's on 24 hour call, I can see it. But for just somebody to walk in there and put everybody else under the auspices of their own self-harm, whatever it does. I just don't get it. I it's distracting the audience. Cause so, so third time I decided to try humor. Cause that's my style. I said, Hey, whoever's calling, tell them they need to be here listening to this message. Well, everybody laughs and I thought, okay, now I've called about. Look, it goes off two more times by the, by the fifth time this phone goes off in the course of me, priest of a 30 minute sermon. I said, whoever that is, I can guarantee you they're over 60 years old. And they don't know how to turn their ring off with someone sitting near them. I mean, now I'm literally calling this person out from the pulpit because they're phone went off five times. And somebody told me afterwards it was about a, about a 75 year old man. It was just what I said. But why didn't you just get up and walk out? It's my point. Like, so that thing rang five times during my time. To a fields point 75 year old men don't need cell phones. Why wouldn't you just leave it? Why wouldn't you just leave it in your car and walk over and sit down for 30 minutes? Here's the word and go back in your car. Okay. And maybe wait till you get home to turn it back on. I mean, I just can't think of a device that's that. What's the word? I think you should have, what you should have done is said, you need to respond, bring the phone, quote that verse put to death, the misdeeds, and just take a hammer at the altar call and just sacrifice that phone in front of the audience. Well, that had been wrong. Do y'all enjoy at all the availability of just being quiet and nothing's going to, nobody's going to reach you at all. It's impossible to reach you via cell phone, telephone, any kind of just get away from it for a little bit. Is it possible? It's difficult. It's difficult for most people, but you're right, that it has become too consuming. I think so. And I don't know. I read something that everybody has a phone, looks at it every so many seconds. Like now you're almost just conditioned to have to look at it. Well, you can look at your screen time and it'll tell you how many times you've already seen Jase pick up his phone about 15 times in this last episode. I've told you I send text to myself. So we get to talk and then I have a thought about a verse. So I have to check my text to myself. Some people use no books. We have a running suspicion that you're looking at your stocks. Yeah, that's exactly right. We think you're multitasking during the podcast. No, I haven't looked at those because I'm a long term investor. If you get into daily emotional roller coasters, that's a recipe for failure. Let me bring up one last thing from Roma's 13, our last few minutes here because what we talked about today, focusing on the last from verses eight down to 14 when Paul makes the transition is all true, of course, and everything we said, I think it's spot on. But we didn't really focus on what led into that because he makes that transition that when it comes to the government. You owe them. These are things you need to do submit to them. He gives those words. When he brings it to the one another, he puts it in the love context. You should want to do this. This should be your desire. But a lot of people just kind of run right past this text and I understand why. It says that's why you pay your taxes and give everyone what you owe them. In other words, pay your bills and pay your taxes. Then he goes into how we treat one another. But there's a lot of people, a lot of Christians that think they don't have to pay their taxes and don't pay back what they owe. I just want to make a charge to you guys out there. It's pretty clear what Paul was talking about. If you owe people, you pay them what you owe them. I think that's a reflection of us as Christians if we don't. I think we violate the very idea of what he was talking about here. I think we lost Al. But Al's got a point. Even Jesus, you remember when they had that conversation where Peter had heard, overheard some of the authorities about paying taxes and so he went and asked Jesus. And Jesus made one of the most favorite things from my perspective as a fisherman. I guess you taught me as a commercial fisherman when he was like, what do we do about this situation? Jesus was like, well, give the seizure what is seizures. He was basically saying, pay your taxes. But his method was like, go down there and catch a fish and you'll find what we owe. And the first one you catch a bed as well. Why do you think he did that? I don't know how hard to say, but they couldn't trap him on anything. That's all I gotta say. And he knows our heart. I think that's why he ended this chapter with don't even think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature, but let's face it. Our flesh, we want to be greedy. We don't want to pay what we owe. We want to hustle people out of money. We want to participate in things. He went through all these different things we get into in verse 13. But he gave us this image of being a part of the armor of life. So we had Al try to come back, but he didn't. He started talking about paying taxes and they like, no. Somebody put the quietest on them on that one. We ain't paying no taxes. I think there's a reason that even 2000 years ago tax collectors were not viewed in a favorable light. And I'll be honest with you. I don't like them now. Yeah. And if I find any legal, no one does legal way around it. I've tried to get around it. However, I'm not going to cheat. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to compromise my character because of passages like Romans 13 that I know. Guess what? The government may have a lot of corrupt tendencies, but if you didn't have them and you didn't have law enforcement and you didn't have all this, well, this place would be a lot rougher to live. It's bad enough as it is. Yeah, exactly. The bottom line is I think for us, we pursue Jesus's character, which was based on love. And when all these things come up, we should be the ones that people view as doing honorable and respectful things within our society. Despite the fact that there's a lot of corruption that's going on in all these entities. Yep. There's a lot of confidence when you just do things like Jesus said, reach out to the poor, the downtrodden, and the ones, the street people. And when you help them out and free-gratice, but they don't owe you anything and you leave your life like that before them, there is something about that, Jesus satisfying. Yeah, it is. For people who never tried it, they're like, you know, they're not worth helping. They're worth something. They're human beings and they're worth something, all people. And the quicker we learn that as a nation, we wouldn't be near as divided as we are now. That's for sure. I agree. Instead of name calling, just be good to your neighbor. Love you, God.
