How much money the Democrats want to spend here. And then of course there's there's infrastructure as well. And they're doing these two things together because they feel like it's harder for people to understand just how crazy this really is. If you do it all at once, you're overwhelmed by the amount of spending. I mean, you just you can't even really take in these numbers. Here's Mitch McConnell talking about it. And he said, look, it's it's left wing. It's like the squad is in charge. Play nine. The policies they want to put behind this budget resolution read like somebody walked across the rotunda to the house and handed the squad a pen and piece of paper sweeping, sweeping amnesty for illegal immigrants in the middle of the border crisis. Regulations that are so radical that our college center of market quote said the Green New Deal is in the DNA of this budget resolution. The Green New Deal is in the day. I mean, it's true though. It does feel like the Green New Deal is in it because they're trying to do everything they can to use the power of the purse in place of actually having to do real legislation on something. Right. Just we'll just fund something. We're not going to pass a law saying you have to. We'll just play with the the numbers and the spending that the federal government has to achieve a similar goal. So you've got the Senate. Well, let's start. Let me try to break these two pieces into separate buckets for a second. The Senate approved the $1.2 trillion transportation, water broadband, other infrastructure projects, 69 to 30. So you had a bunch of Republicans go along with this, including Mitch McConnell, by the way. So just just put that. So they're all there in for infrastructure. And let me tell you what the problem with the infrastructure bill is. Even the parts of it that are bridges, roads, right, the things that you might have a tougher time trying to win an argument to somebody about why they're about idea. You say, okay, bridges, roads, those seem pretty important, although we do already spend a lot of money on infrastructure in this country that never really gets talked about. But with all that stuff going on at this point in time with all that happening, you would say, okay, well, is this going to be spent efficiently? And that's where you start laughing, right? I mean, there's no way there's no realistic version of this where you don't have lawyers and activists and bureaucrats and union bosses. And by the time this actually gets to money to build stuff you will use, Lord only knows what's going to be left and what the upside of this for the actual taxpayer is going to be. I mean, it strikes me that this is just going to end up being a massive boondoggle. Remember shovel ready jobs under the Obama administration? If you start thinking about the Biden administration as the third term of the Obama administration, everything makes sense. There are no surprises. It all adds up. It all comes together. And that's exactly what you should expect here with infrastructure. They're making all these promises. They're saying all these things. But even the areas of the bill that seem the least objectionable will be problematic down the line because of the implementation of this. Ultimately, this is just about moving taxpayer dollars around to favorite constituencies of the Democrat Party. That's going to be a primary goal. You know, in Afghanistan, which is falling apart so rapidly. Now they're saying the Taliban could be in charge in a month. You see that the Taliban could be in charge in Afghanistan in a month. I mean, the whole country, Kabul could fall within a month is what people have been saying in the last 24 hours. I mean, that is stunning that the Taliban blitzkrieg would be that effective. Just goes to show you that for all those years, all the years we spent, US military training, all the contractors over there, training the Afghans, mentoring them, working with them, all this stuff, just disintegrating, disintegrating. I'm going to tell you, it's not surprising to anybody who spent real time over there. It's just not, it's not surprising. The Afghan national police, the Afghan army, they don't really have a tremendous allegiance. They don't have a sense of their honor as tied to the national government. They have a sense of honor and obligation to tribe, to family, to religion, but to the central government and Kabul. Whereas the Taliban believes in their movement. Yeah, there are a bunch of sadists and and jihadist maniacs, but they do have the advantage of belief on their side. And they believe in what they are doing. And that country's going to fall apart. Oh, but I bring up Afghanistan because any of you listening to this or anybody who knows about how it would work over there, you know, you could spend, I'm making up the numbers here, but you would allocate a million dollars to build a brand new school building and water treatment plant or something in Afghanistan. But let's just say a school building. And by the time it actually got to the building of the school, when you had paid off the local elders and warlords and strongmen and what do you, what do you ever going to take in their cut? You were left with almost nothing to do the actual project. Now, our corruption is not quite as out in the open and blatant as that, but there will be a lot of waste fraud and abuse with this money that's being spent. That's definitely going to happen. And as for the actual Bernie budget now, the 3.5, it's really, really, we should be talking about this as a five trillion dollar thing. The Bernie budget, so to speak, includes funds for universal pre-kindergarten tuition free community college, paid family leave, clean energy stuff. So that's the Green New Deal piece, billions of dollars for quote, helping immigrant workers onto a pathway to citizenship and quote, that's called amnesty, my friends. Amnesty is now something you will pay for. The amnesty is coming and you're getting the bill. Now, let's see what Senator Lindsey Graham has Lindsey Graham has to say about this one. Play 10. All I can say is that I believe in climate change and I'd like to have a rational approach to solving the problem, but this is not rational. This is partisan in this 4.2 trillion dollar bill. It's not three and a half. It's going to lead to a wave of illegal immigration, illegal immigration, the likes of what you've never seen before. A 262 increase in the last six months. If this bill, this idea ever becomes reality, you can double that. If this bill ever becomes reality, a dollar increase in gas prices are going to be the good old days. If they shut down all the coal fired plants without any way to replace it, other than a bunch of BS, good luck with a heating bill. Yep. You know who actually pays for this? Not only through tax dollars, but through costs, people that are working for a living and trying to stay ahead of their bills and build some financial stability for themselves and for the future. Those are the ones who actually end up paying for this. Those are the people that are going to have a greater challenge because of the rise in the cost of energy because of just the well, inflation, of course, as well, which is going to eat away at the wages of people who can least afford that change in their purchasing power. But Democrats don't care. In fact, Joe Biden's running around talking about how this is going to be great. Historic recovery play 11. This is going to help make a historic recovery a long term boom. Folks above all, this historic investment infrastructure is what I believe you the American people want. What you've been asking for for a long, long time. This bill shows that we can work together. I know a lot of people, some sitting in the audience here didn't think this could happen. I sort of, you know, yeah, sometimes a wander off when the secret service is telling me to go one direction and I go in the other direction and I go, oh, oh, oh, oh, malarkey, my last malarkey, buddy, no joke, no joke. Forgot where I was for a second. I will never forgive the Democrats for foisting this guy on the United States. Yeah, they should be ashamed. They should be ashamed, honestly. And I mean that as much as it's possible for me to, I mean that in a non political fashion. So this also is a reminder that the Democrats think that they somehow have a mandate with a 50 50 Senate and a handful of votes in the house. They're looking to make massive transformations to the American economy and with it the American way of life. There's nothing about the Democrats that has any, there's no bipartisan spirit in the budget aspect of this, really. I mean, they're doing exactly what they want to do. And on the infrastructure side, I think they're swindling Republicans. I think they're fooling the Republicans, including Mitch McConnell, who are going along with this. I was fasting that President Biden yesterday said that Cuomo did a great job. This is one of the things that makes me so mad. Oh, I know I didn't talk in the podcast yesterday about Cuomo resigning. So let's discuss that because I did the part of the morning and Cuomo resigned after I had already finished. Yeah, am I surprised by it? Absolutely. And do I own the fact that I thought this guy was going to go down fighting? Yes. That was his plan. I've talked to some folks and done more investigating of this. It was his plan to fight it to the very end. But turned out the Democrats in the state legislature really did uniformly turn on him. He had no allies, no friends. They all wanted them gone. And I think part of what happened here is that the tyrant in this case, who had been able to rule by fear and knew that as long as he could keep some fearful and loyal, he always had a weapon against the others. This was the moment that had finally turned and he looked around for allies and everybody realized now's the time we can shove this guy out safely. They wanted to get rid of him and he wasn't prepared for that. He always thought there'd be some people that owed him a favor or were scared of him in New York state politics. And so he's gone now. Unsurprising. Unsurprising. But this is where we are. Well, I should say surprising. And so far as he resigned, I did think they were going to have to impeach him. I thought they were going to have to be. I didn't think he was going to step down as you know. So I own that. I was like, wow, really, he's actually going to go. But let's be very clear about a few things. One is the Democrats. This doesn't mean that all of a sudden they're so ethical. Oh, they clean. They clean up their own house. He should have been, he should have been pushed out of office over the nursing home scandal a year ago, a year ago. But no, instead they gave him a book deal. Instead, they gave him an Emmy award. I mean, not just any book deal, millions of dollars. The entire Democrat apparatus of control through everything they had behind him. The Cuomo sexual phenomenon. Oh, he's just so dreamy. He's such a hero to the left. He was so great during those briefings. He was horrible. It was a disaster. New York has suffered from worst leadership and worst COVID effects than any other place in the country. Still continuing to go on now. But the fact that they held up Cuomo, like he was some kind of a shining example for all the rest is it's just crazy. Honestly, it's just crazy. And they're not really paying the price for it. And they should. You know, Wall Street has been lying for years saying a few measly percent is a good return on your stocks. It's really not. And that trading is so complicated.

A teacher in Loudon County, broke into tears, addressing the school board saying she would not honor the transgender pronoun policy because of her faith. She told the board she was quitting her job right there on the spot. Really powerful, really moving stuff. Play 14. This summer, I have struggled with the idea of returning to school, knowing that I'll be working yet again with a school division that despite its shiny tech and flashy salary promotes political ideologies that do not square with who I am as a believer in Christ. After reading about your lack of consideration for the growing population of concerned citizens in this division, clearly evidenced by this empty room tonight where you shut the doors to the public as well as the emails sent by the superintendent last year reminding me that a dissenting opinion is not allowed even to be spoken in my personal life, going so far as to send a form to my colleagues and I encouraging us to fill it out. If we hear one another speaking against the controversial policies being promoted by this school board and adopted in this county, if you speak out, you get crushed. No free inquiry, no free exchange of ideas. No, for educators, of course not educators are supposed to be brain washers on behalf of the Marxist left. That's the game. That's the way this is supposed to go. Can't think about anything else. Can't take any other approach. Right. That's what they want you to take away from all this. That's what they want you to think. This, uh, this teacher in Loudon County continued play 15. Not only that, but within the last year, I was told in one of my so-called equity trainings that white Christian able-bodied females currently have the power in our schools and that quote, this has to change. Clearly, you've made your point. You no longer value me or many other teachers you've employed in this county. So since my contract outlines the power that you have over my employment in Loudon County public schools, I thought it necessary to resign in front of you. School board, I quit. I quit your policies. I quit your trainings and I quit being a cog in a machine that tells me to push highly politicized agendas on our most vulnerable constituents, the children. I will find employment elsewhere. I encourage all parents and staff in this county to flood the private schools. She quits. She begins crying. She can't handle it anymore. Yeah, this is what it's going to take. People are going to have to stand up and say, no more. Not going to do it anymore. Refuse to play the game the way they want you to. In this pronoun policy that's, that's now sweeping across all these different schools, people are changing their pronouns on it. I'm not kidding on a day to day basis. You can see TikTok videos and things on this. They change their pronouns on a whim and you're supposed to obey. Today, I feel like they them tomorrow. I feel like she her today. I feel like, you know, Zod Zed. I mean, whatever. This is what they're doing. And if you don't go along, you're a bigot. They're just flexing their power. They're just flexing their social coercion. And yet Democrats don't go along with it. Little collectivist. Authoritarians. They love it. No problem with it whatsoever. They think that this is great. Speaking of authoritarians, I got a real problem here in New York, guys. I'm just going to tell you this. They are putting in place mandates. And some places, some school, some restaurants are putting in place vaccine mandates in advance of the de Blasio mandate. So what is someone like me supposed to do? I mean, I'm going to be essentially banned from public life in New York City within a matter of weeks unless I get the shot. You could say move, but I can't move that fast. I'm thinking now more than ever about moving. I mean, I've already thought about it a lot during the pandemic, but you know, my, my lease ends in a few months. So yeah, I could go do anything. I could go move anywhere pretty much, theoretically, at least. But what do I do in the meantime? I'm going to be some kind of a hermit who can't really go anywhere outside of his apartment. This is the coercion. The totalitarianism really have the left on display. And Joe Biden's out there even talking about maybe a universal mask mandate from the federal level for schools, a mask mandate. So we got vaccine mandates and they're still pushing mask mandates. Masks don't do anything. Masks don't work. But here we are. By the way, you know, Rand Paul, doctor and Senator Rand Paul said that on YouTube pulled him off YouTube. Not allowed to say masks don't work. Why? Who at YouTube is some expert in the studies, the actual proof of masks working? I'm just wondering, do they have anybody? Anybody over there have some knowledge of published medically sound control group, gold standard scientific experiment data? Are we really to believe that the CDC in the last 18 months has never thought to set up an actual could it work or could it not work trial of masks? No, they just rather it's a, it's a religious symbol now. It's we believe because we believe how dare you challenge our belief in masks. Here's President Biden on how angry he is about governors that are stopping the mask mandate. Play one. And one of the things that I find a little disingenuous when I suggest that people in zones where there is a high risk, where the masks like you all are doing, I'm told that governments should get out of the way and not do that. They're on the authority to do that. And I find it interesting that some of the very people were saying that who are whole government positions are people who are threatening that if a school teacher asks the student if they've been vaccinated or if a principal says that everyone in my school should wear a mask or a school board roast for it, that governor will nullify that. That governor has the authority to say you can't do that. I find that totally counterintuitive and quite frankly disingenuous. I find that complicated because I'm a moron and I should never have accepted this job. Joe Biden doesn't understand what freedom or individual rights are. Apparently is making that quite clear. Just doesn't understand or perhaps does not care to understand. Maybe he could figure it out, but he knows what his team expects of him. His team expects authoritarianism. His team expects the Democrats demand obedience when it comes to masks and anybody who stands in the way of that is a problem, a problem for them. I ask you this, show me, think about how long we've been in this in this game. You know, they brought back masks in my building now, but only in the elevators. I can tell you right now, I will not comply. And if somebody decides to get up in my face about it, we're going to have a serious disagreement. It's a line from last though. He can some of you might have caught that. It's a very it's probably one of the best moments that Daniel de Louis has in that movie where the British officer is screaming at him. And he's just like one day you and I will have a serious disagreement. And yeah, he ends up later on shooting the guy in the head, but for his own benefit, spoiler alert. I know that seems weird, but if you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about. Great movie, by the way, put it on the buck recommendation list. Last of the Mohicans, great film holds up really well too. So they want me to wear a mask in the elevator, but not in the lobby and not in the gym, not yet at least. I mean, I think they're going to come back with masks in the gym soon. Has anyone looked at the mortality data recently? I just, you know, you point that out to people, they say, Oh, do we care about cases? Should we care about COVID cases? No, not really. We should only care about hospitalizations and deaths. Now, there have been an an increase in hospitalizations in a number of states, including Texas and Florida. I've seen that, but we've heard so many times, Oh, the hospitals are going to be over. Well, they're going to be overwhelmed. The case level in Texas right now is about a third what it was in January. A third. So were the hospitals all the hospitals unable to give people care in January? Because I don't remember that in Texas. Do you remember that? I don't remember that. So now we're to believe that with 30% of the cases, the hospitals can't can't handle it. How does that make sense? How does it make sense? And as you know, the CDC recently over reported the deaths or I can't remember if it was cases or deaths in Florida. I think it was cases in one day in Florida dramatically, like 100% more than there actually were, which you could say is a clerical error, but it's kind of interesting that of course it goes against Florida because they've got to destroy DeSantis. You know this, they've got to make DeSantis look like the bad guy and all this because he is such a threat to senile Joe in the next election. We all know it. Everyone can see it. So they've got to do this. This is why they're already certainly to write these pieces about how, you know, Ron DeSantis is worse than Trump who was worse than Hitler, you know, yeah, we're already at Ron DeSantis is worse than Trump. They're already starting to try to float that out there and see if they can get away with it. That's how despicable and dishonest these people are.

It's time to cancel cancel culture. But they hate to Santas because also his policies and it's not just that he's a political threat to them. His policies in the state of Florida are a and have been a real time repudiation of the lockdowns and the madness that they've been pushing all across the country for 18 months now. And more than that, I guess it's well, no, it's bad 18 months. So Ron DeSantis has to be ruined. Otherwise, he's not only a risk to the Biden second term, but also the whole narrative of Democrats as somehow the good guys in this COVID pandemic when they've been the hysterical lockdown crybabies who demand that you mask up even if you're vaccinated, even if you're vaccinated in double mask. Oh my gosh, we have to stop these wounds. We have to get them to just calm down. And I'll tell you this, the mortality data on on COVID shows you right now you're at like 500 600 people dying a day from COVID. And this is during a surge. Surge is not gonna last, it's not gonna last forever. We all see what happens. It's a four to six week curve. So we're in an upswing now. We're losing about five to 600 people a day. We were losing, you know, third 3,000 3500 people a day during the winter surge. Now that that feels like a lot of people. I mean, look, every life loss is precious. You know that we all know that, but we're talking about public health data here, you know, does everyone go around crying and saying they can't go on with their lives because of how many people die every day in this country from heart attacks? No, it's a tragedy. If you know someone who died from a heart attack, but we can't shut the country down and make sure everybody, you know, is spending an extra hour a day outside walking because of heart attacks. We don't do that. Right. We're all going to die. I mean, that's ultimately a part of the the philosophical disconnect here is that Democrats have this silly and absurd belief that the state can keep them safe from a virus that the state will keep them healthy. The state will absolutely not do that. It's not going to work. They refuse to believe it, but they hate Ron DeSantis because he is standing up against this in schools. Play three. We're going to do whatever we can to vindicate the rights of parents and make sure that parents are in the driver's seat when it comes to the health, education and welfare of their kids. And they should not be decreed by the government. This should be something that a parent is ultimately making the decision on. I mean, isn't this really straightforward? Parents should be making decisions about whether kids get masked. Could you imagine? I mean, you're going into school, you're going into school setting and some some teacher is like, sorry, your kid has your kid has to be really uncomfortable. What if you're what if your parent what if you're a teacher told your kid that you're that just just for everyone's benefit, you are going to have to, you know, walk around all day wearing a really itchy wool sweater without it without a t shirt on an undershirt on anything where a hot itchy wool sweater because it'll make us all feel safer. Is that okay? Say, well, well, no, that that seems weird. Well, that's about as important as wearing a mask in school, but they they won't, of course, agree to that they won't accept that. But it's true. No, but it doesn't do anything. It doesn't do anything. The kids are going to be pulling their masks down to eat. They're going to be pulling their masks down when they need to sneeze. They're going to be pulling their masks up and down and up and down and up and down. It's not an epidemiological tool when you're calling timeouts every five minutes. We all know this, but they want you to do it, do it, do it, I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm a lib. I watch CNN. I'm terrified. I'm so scared of the virus. I'm 35 and I drink soy milk. What am I going to do if the virus comes for me? I need Cuomo. Where's Cuomo? He'll protect me. Oh, no, he won't because I guess he's gone now. What a shame. Jen Psaki's out there responding to Rhonda since I mean, Jen Psaki is like a C minus student from a from a third tier academic background and she's the White House press secretary. You got to sit there. You say, this is amazing. It's amazing that this person has the influence she does. But anyway, play a four. If you're not interested in following the public health guidelines to protect the lives of people in your state, to give parents some comfort as they're sending their kids to school, schools are opening in Florida this week. I know in many parts of Florida, then get out of the way and let public officials, let local officials do their job to keep students safe. Psaki, I just think that's sake went to William Mary is actually a decent school. She was a sociology major though. Of course, of course, not that your college or your major matters. I just like to poke fun. So yeah, she's there to say if you're not interested in following the public health guidelines, get out of the way because we're going to save people. You know, I just I want to remind you of this. We were told so much here. We were told so much about what was going to happen. If only we just gave Biden the leeway here. I mean, remember when they told you Biden was going to crush COVID fix the economy, unite the country, stamp out corruption and bring back faith in our institutions. Give credit where it's due, my friends. That was hilarious. Thanks for being here with me on the Buck Sexton show today.
