Appreciate all of you hanging out with us all over the country. Encourage you to go download the iHeartRadio app. Make sure you don't miss a single moment of the program, no matter where you are in the country or around the world. And also we would encourage you to continue to download and subscribe to Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Be 15 million plus downloads and counting every single month. That is a tremendous credit to you guys. We continue to set records as more and more of you subscribe and download there yesterday, Buck. We got several things to get into. Marsha Blackburn is going to join us at the bottom of this hour next hour. We'll be joined by Republican presidential candidate, candidate Vivek Ramaswami yesterday. I tossed out that I think there's a great deal popularity in this audience that Robert F Kennedy Jr. has unlocked. And I didn't know what the numbers would reflect. But I said, for instance, if you gave me a choice of voting and again, no third party and you gave me a choice only of these two, death is not an option. You can't pick anybody else. I said, I would vote for Robert F Kennedy Jr. over Mitt Romney. And I said, I would vote for Robert F Kennedy Jr. over Paul Ryan and a lot of reaction rolled in. So I thought, you know what, I should put a poll up. And this poll has now been retweeted by Clay and Buck at Clay and Buck on Twitter. You can go vote in it there. We'll also maybe put it up on the front page of the Clay and Buck website to allow people who are not active on social media, don't have accounts, you can go vote there. We'll see what the numbers look like. Buck, these stun me right now, over 60,000 of you have voted in this poll. Again, you can go see it right now at Clay and Buck. You can scroll down. In fact, I'll retweet it right now. So it shows up right at the top of my feed at Clay Travis. You can also go vote in it there. Over 61,000 of you have voted. 79% of people Buck said they would vote for Robert F Kennedy Jr. over Mitt Romney. Now, I think that's pretty significant because I bet a large percentage of people listening to us right now actually voted for Mitt Romney for president in 2012. Now, granted, Mitt Romney since then has you're nodding. I mean, I've been a huge percentage of people. I mean, ever since people saw Mitt Romney with his mask on marching and being like, I'm here because I want to march with Black Lives Matter. I was like, Oh, yes, Mitt Romney, there's a man who understands the struggle. Like, give me a break. Mitt Romney has been a guy that people have had to just, we've had to try to forget the Republican votes that were cast for him in 2012. I mean, I still think he was a better option than Obama, but he's not running this time though. So I think it'll be more interesting to see what about RFK Jr. versus a Republican who's not Trump or DeSantis. Well, I mean, he would crush let's run through him. I'll give you my guess. It would be so RFK Jr. would crush Aza Hutchinson. I think he probably would beat in this audience, Chris Christie. I think he would beat Nikki Haley, honestly. Really? Now, that that to me is a little boring because she's a mainline Republican. Mitt Romney has gone over basically to the other team. Mitt Romney is effectively Liz Cheney with, you know, shorter hair. So which that's to Utah. He has an announcement, Romney, whether he's going to run for reelection. I believe I'm correct in this Utah people can correct me if I'm wrong. But remember, he refused to endorse. Mitt Romney did Mike Lee, the Senator from, from Utah in he said he was sitting out because he was friends with both the guy who was the Democrat nominee. Romney's basically a Democrat now. So that's why the, you know, that's why when you look at a RFK Jr. Romney comparison, it's like saying, it's like saying, you know, someone like an Aza Hutchinson. I mean, there are Republic. It is, it is the case that there are Republicans who are effectively Democrats, but they just like to pretend to be Republicans. You never get Democrats who are actually right wing though. That's not really a thing. That doesn't really exist. Well, let's say you count Joe Manchin or somebody like that. I think he's closer to the middle than anything, right? It used to be the case that you did have more crossovers because they were legacy, right? You'd have guys who were members of parties that they didn't really fit because the parties had changed a lot. I also think that the more people on the right have to, well, find out about RFK Jr's policies on things. My guess is he's probably, I'm guessing here. I don't know. And maybe he's addressed some of this. He's pro choice. My guess is he's pretty into high taxes. You know, you start to go down the list of things. I don't know where he is on crime. I have no idea. I don't know if anyone does because that could go either way. But on some of those issues, he would lose Republic. He would lose Republican support if he came out and I have to repudiate. He's he said crazy stuff on climate change, which I believe he has said, I don't like, well, I don't like the way I said that or something else. But the climate change thing could be a problem. Trump said a lot of crazy left wing things back in the day before. I'm not saying that it means that he can't get support. I'm just saying he has to come out and clarify on these things, what he where he would stand out, which is why we want to have him back on the show. I will not be at the doctor. I will be here. So I think the what it really represents is people are desperately craving authenticity. And I think even if you or me or other people out there, this is what I get. My sense of the national electorate as we move towards the primary season is a lot of people feel. And the reason why I think that Romney and Paul Ryan are good examples, this is a guy who in 2012 was the presidential nominee. Paul Ryan was the speaker of the house for Republicans. I think our vice presidential nominee and vice presidential candidate. I think that our fight is a free recall. I think that RFK junior would beat both of those guys among Republican voters right now. And the and here is why I think that would happen, Buck. I think there is one, a desire among a huge percentage of the population for there to be a reckoning over COVID. And I think there is a deep well of distrust that is similar, I would imagine, I wasn't alive to what happened coming out of Vietnam over the fact that you know that your government lied to you. And I think people are willing again, this is my read of the national electorate. I think people are willing to say, okay, I disagree with you on that. If you just honestly tell me what you think, at least I know what you mean. And I think Trump hit on a lot of this in 16 Buck. And I think his presidency, honestly, what did Trump do that in office, not a lot that he said he would not do now, he wasn't able to accomplish everything. Yeah, he said things that he believed to be true that are things that a lot of people believe to be true, but they felt they weren't allowed to say, including among other Republicans. Yes. And that was the breakthrough. I think that right now, a lot of people, the craving of authenticity, I do think that's reading the feelings that that people have right now. I think that as things get closer, you get into the fear of losing and the desire of winning. And that starts to crowd out, meaning, well, I'm going to vote for whether you're a Democrat Republican, I'm going to vote for Joe Biden because I don't want the Republicans to win. And so that's where I think things narrow pretty quickly from everyone saying, well, I want the most authentic candidate, all of a sudden electability, which is a very amorphous thing, right? You're not electable until you're elected. We're going to argue a lot about this. Everyone's going to be arguing about who's electable. And people will point out that we've seen plenty of times in recent political history in this country, Trump being probably the best example of it in 2016, where, oh, that person can't win until they do until they do. And then all of a sudden everything, the convention, conventional wisdom changes. And remember, one of the most, you remember one of the most controversial things that Trump was willing to say to me, this was when I started really taking note. I mean, there are a lot, Clay. So there's a remember the controversial thing that Trump said. Well, I mean, in terms of directly attacking Republican orthodoxy, Oh, the Republican rock war thing? Yes. That was where I looked up and I said, oh, like, that to me is evidence of being willing to challenge the existing party. That to me is the direct attack, right? Was when he said Iraq, the Iraq war was a disaster. And George W. Bush blew it. So, I will say though, he read something very important in the shift in politics that had occurred. Remember, that was also something that Barack Obama in the Democrat primary was able in 2008 to outmaneuver Hillary on. Yes. Which was her previous support of the Iraq war. The Iraq war was as much as Democrats tried to rewrite history. John Kerry tried to rewrite that history. He failed. The Iraq war was a bipartisan, a bipartisan push at the time. Both parties had their hands all over that. And Trump came along. I think he saw I'm not saying he didn't feel this way because he saw what happened in Iraq and just came to this assessment. But also politically, it was clear that on the Democrat side, Barack had an advantage over Hillary because of her support for Iraq. And on the Republican side, everybody who was prominent in Republican politics had effectively been tied to the Iraq war in some capacity. So Trump comes along and he's like, that was terrible. What was that all about? And people are out saying, wow, finally, we get it because it's a little bit harder if you voted for Iraq and you gave 15 speeches about how great the Iraq war was going or whatever, which was true of a lot of Republican members of Congress, etc. So that was a big change, a big change for him. I also would say that's why I think, and I know people out there, you think it's crazy. I think Trump is seriously considering putting RFK Jr on the ticket. I really do. And I know people out there, you may say, you know, you're, you're crazy for even suggesting it. That is the single, the single most disruptive thing that Trump could do in selecting a vice presidential candidate would be RFK Jr. And you see the DeSantis has said he will not be a vice president. So he's I just we've to be fair and to be clear, we, I've told you, I've said this on the show when people called in and they said, what about a Trump DeSantis ticket? I said, I think that would be very powerful. Ron won't do it. Yeah. Now Ron has said he won't do it. So sometimes they say things. Go ahead. Fair. Every single Republican or Democrat presidential candidate of the last 50 years, when they're running for president has said at some point, I won't be the VP, right? And a lot of those people end up being the VP. I don't think we talk to some Republicans right now and say, would you be Trump's VP? And they would say, well, I think I should be the first choice, but I'd be happy. Ron has has completely ruled out VP under Trump. So I get it. But if Trump wins and it's over, right? If Trump wins, they issue with DeSantis as VP, as we have talked about, I'm gonna get the betting board up. I would give crazy odds to anybody wanted to. There's no chance that Ron DeSantis would take a big slot under Trump. I think the legality of it is actually the reason why he wouldn't be the nominee, right? You can't really have two from the same state because there's constitutional issues. Trump has houses in New Jersey and New York. I mean, do you think New Jersey would allow Trump to easily switch his residency to New Jersey? They would go to court to try to say that they have to give up Florida's electoral votes. I don't want that legal issue. If DeSantis were the governor of any other state than Florida where Trump lives, I think DeSantis in March, if he if Trump had swept to the nomination and he came to him and he said, I want you to be my VP. I think he would take it. You and I disagree. You weren't the nominee 100% in 28. If Trump, if you're Trump's VP and you're and you're DeSantis, right? Now, there are other people Trump could pick as VP that aren't as well known. For instance, I'll just toss one out. If he picked Christie, no, I don't think that means Christie, no, him has to be the nominee in 28. I think if DeSantis were the VP, it would be a default Trump wins in 24. There's not hardly even a campaign in 28 on the Republican primary side. I see the I see the logic of it. I don't think he would take that role. I get it. I get it. I don't think it's not because of it. It's not because of leaving. I'm looking at because of constitutes the egos and mentalities of the men involved. It's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. Some guy, you know, I just don't see it. I don't see it. Oh, look, the good thing about all this is we'll see. We'll let it. We'll end up seeing if this goes. We should ask Vivek, by the way, who is on in the third hour. Yes. Would you gladly accept if you are not Vivek says he's right? He is running and he has been gaining to be fair. And we try to be very fair to all the candidates. Vivek has been gaining support, you know, so you got to treat that with respect. He's obviously people are listening and they're liking what they're hearing. I don't think he would say at this point, there's no chance that I would be Trump's VP. We could try this out with him. Vivek, would you take a VP job with Trump? He would not say no chance. We can ask him. I think it's like when you're going after chicks, sometimes the best way to get the chick is to pretend you have no interest in getting the chick to try it and true. All the boys out there, young guys, one of the best, every girl's like, yeah, one of the best ways to get the chick pretend that you have no interest in getting the chick makes you way more desirable. It's between sports and chick analogies. We cover a lot of ground here on the show. It's all psychology sports chicks. It's all psychology. All right, we're going to get into more of this. Also, we do have coming up, Senator Marsha Blackburn is going to be joining us from Tennessee, which is a fantastic state. We'll get to that in a little bit. Earlier this month, we took a long holiday weekend to celebrate our nation's independence day and remember our freedoms and the heroes who fought for our freedoms. But have you thought about this, that there are more Americans today, unborn Americans that do not have that freedom of life and liberty. These are the children we may never meet because abortion has been chosen over giving them life. Every day, unborn babies lives are under attack, but because of a brave and selfless organization by the name of preborn, we can rescue them. Preborn is the largest pro-life ministry in the country. And by providing free ultrasounds to women contemplating such a decision, they're saving some 200 lives a day. Will you stand with preborn and make a donation to this nonprofit organization? Each ultrasound is just $28 or five ultrasounds or $140 to donate just dial pound 250 on your cell phone and say the keyword baby. That's pound two five zero say the word baby or donate securely at preborn.com slash buck. That's preborn.com slash B U C K. The voices of sanity in an insane world. Clay Travis said bucks. Some of you know him as the patriarch from succession. I always think of actor Brian Cox as Uncle Argyle in Braveheart for those of you who or perhaps even one of the CIA guys from the born supremacy. So or is the born ultimatum. I can't keep it all straight. But the succession star, which just got what was it? Like 27 Emmys or something like that? So just sweeping the Emmys. Not that we can't. I mean, I haven't watched the Emmys ever, but it's a thing. But he says that what culture is bad play 18 things worse now or is our perception of life worse because of things like social media in flaming everything. Well, I think I don't think social media helps. It hinders rather than helps. And I think it points up to readily inadequacies that we can actually and the whole work where we've talked about this before, the whole work culture, I think is truly awful and the shaming culture and the shaming culture, which I really feel quite strong. This incessant need to shame and bury people. I don't know where it comes from. I don't know who's who are the arbiters of these shaming. Right. And it's very hard to pin them down. And it turns out it's usually a bunch of millennials. That's the left wing, actually, it's Democrats. That's where the woke stuff comes from, just to be clear. But at least this guy knows it's bad clay. Give him that. Yeah, I give him credit. I think a lot of people of his age get it, even if they aren't traditional Republican voters. And I would argue that this is the cancel culture is the reflection of the toxicity of identity politics, because really cancel culture is about who can be canceled. And it's the pyramid of victimization. It's political correctness weaponized. It's political correctness in the hands of people that now have power to hurt people. So they do. You know who never gets canceled? Rappers. You can say anything in a rap lyric, get away with virtually anything. And it's because of the pyramid of victimization. Black guys, oh, they're hugely victims. So they can say anything they want to rap song. Pure Talk, one cell phone company. I can honestly say looking for you when they upgrade your service won't be charging you for it. Pure Talk just added data to every plan and including a mobile hotspot with each one. No price increase whatsoever. Longstanding monthly price, just 20 bucks a month continues to be in place. That includes unlimited talk text. Now 50% more 5G data plus mobile hotspot, just 20 bucks a month. So I'll be love Pure Talk, who they happen to be veteran owned also have the best customer service team base right here in the good old USA. Dial Pound 250 say Clay and Buck to make the switch to pure talk today. And you'll save an additional 50% off your first month. Again, dial pound 250 say Clay and Buck make the switch to our favorite cell phone company, Pure Talk pound 250 today. Play Travis and Buck Sexton on the front lines of truth. We are joined now by one of the senators from my home state of Tennessee. She is Marsha Blackburn. She is fighting battles every single day that matter for so many Americans. Senator Blackburn, appreciate the time. I want to start with the news that I'm sure you saw come out just in the last couple of hours. The Secret Service said that they have no idea essentially who brought cocaine into the White House and that they have no suspects. And they're basically closing the investigation. You've been to the White House a lot in your career. I am sure you know the security that is involved in going in and out of the White House. Do you believe the Secret Service? What should happen in your mind when they come out and say well, we have no idea and try to close this case? That should be the sign to the American people that they know exactly who did this and why they did it. And to the minute when they did it, but they are choosing not to tell the American people this information. They don't want to share that information. So they're going to hide that information. And saying we are closing the case, we don't know who did this is the equivalent of saying we know exactly when we are and how this happened, who did it, but we're not going to tell you because we don't want you to know. Senator Blackburn, I know you're also raising the alarm of it about the Chinese Communist Party, the CCP setting up what are being called service centers with China's national police agency in different cities. Essentially, the Chinese Communist Party operating surveillance platforms of different kinds here in the US. What can you tell us about what kind of a concern like what level of concern this is, how widespread it is and what's happening? Yeah, and both you know, we've talked for years about the Chinese Communist Party's aggression in the United States and they're pushed to be globally dominant. And the way they have used economic warfare, great power competition, their Belt and Road initiative in order to gain favor around the world and to push their way into having countries in our countries be subjective to them through debt diplomacy. China holds as much as 80% of some of the debt from some of these countries that they're pushing into such as Djibouti. They're the Horn of Africa. And what we have seen is an uptick in this aggression. They feel like Joe Biden this week, he has compromised. He is not going to stop them. He's not going to hold them to account. So in their push to be globally dominant by 2050 to make this the China century, they feel like they've got a lot of runway and that they can make a lot of headway. They knew better than to try to do something like this on Donald Trump. They knew that he would come after him and there'd be held space. But for Joe Biden, they think they can push this off propaganda. Nothing's going to be said for goodness sake, they wouldn't go take down the spiral. And they won't go after Cuba for setting up a training facility within 100 miles of the US. So why would they tell them to take down these Chinese Communist Party police stations that now are in seven US cities? And they are surveilling Chinese nationals who are here working or living. Or people, Chinese individuals that now have permanent residence status or are applying for citizenship or who have become US citizens. This is all of their surveillance mechanism. It is showing their power, showing that they can push their weight past that of the president of the United States and that you can't outrun them. No matter where you go on the face of the earth, if they can spy on you in the United States of America, they can find you anywhere else. So it is trying to instill fear because fearful people are easier to control. Senator Blackburn, I'm sure you also saw yesterday, and I agree with everything you're saying about China. And thanks for being one of the foremost attackers in frankly, all of the American body politics when it comes to China's evilness and the fact that we need to be calling them out. When you see what happened with the FBI and yesterday, Christopher Ray spoke. And I'm just in disbelief that we could enter into a place where the FBI is as politically compromised as it is. And where frankly, the rank and file of the FBI who go to work, I do think every single day trying to catch bad guys is now being tarred and feathered by the awful leadership and the political degree of protection we see with Hunter Biden and the persecution of Donald Trump. How do we fix this? When you watched Christopher Ray, what, what, how do we get back to the FBI being trusted and applying impartial justice to bad guys and not becoming a political arm of the Democrat party? That's right. And Clay, item number one is going to be to again, that a presidency in 24 takes a US Senate so that we can work in concert with the House and make certain that we are are holding these individuals to account. The next thing is Christopher Ray needs to be fired after we find out everything that he has learned. And as he was testifying yesterday over in the House, Senate Judiciary Committee, we had a judge before us out. It was a guy who wants to be a judge, I should say. He's a nominee from the Biden administration. He happened to have been the deputy chief of staff and acting chief of staff for Christopher Ray at the FBI during the time of the 2020 elections and the Hunter Biden laptop and all of the other things that have happened. He was there until July of 21. So I ask him under oath, if he was a participant in any writings, any meetings, any conversations, any emails, any phone calls, dealing with what happened with the election with Joe Biden, Biden incorporated, Hunter Biden's laptop, anything against the pro-life activists, anything against parents being labeled as terrorist and he refused to answer the question. So I've sent it to him in writing for a response and I was pleased Senator Hawley joined me. He followed me in the questioning and he picked up on that line of questioning also. These people feel like running the FBI, they have the two tiers of justice system locked in. Tennesseans don't want that the American people don't want that they want equal opportunity, equal access, equal justice for all. And they're ascended with a smugness in the arrogance of people like Christopher Ray and Brendan Long, his former deputy chief of staff who under oath will not tell you the truth about what is going on or what their part was in it. And I did a telephone town hall the other night, thousands of Tennesseans on this telephone town hall. We did questions for an hour and so many times regardless of if the question was about inflation or the border or AI or any of a host of issues people would say and I got to tell you this two tiers of justice. The Biden's not being held to account, the Clinton's not being held to account. People getting favoritism from the government. People are exhausted with it and they want it to stop. Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennesse, thank you for being with us. I'd like to join you. Thank you. A former Wall Street insider and renowned financial newsletter publisher has words of caution for each of us. Tika Tawaii is his name. He believes our federal government could soon announce a mandatory national recall on the US dollar. Those would be replaced with a new digital version that will be radically different from what you have in your bank account right now. Tika Tawaii is warning that the official announcement could come as soon as two weeks from now. That's on July 26th. He's exposing this government plan in a controversial new video and showing you the three steps you need to take to prepare. Go to dollar recall dot com to watch this video. Some of our government probably don't want you to see it. So you need to see it. Go to dollar recall dot com. Learn how to prepare before it's too late. Your savings account could depend on it. One more time. That website is dollar recall dot com paid for by Palm Beach research group. US adults say that trans athletes should only be allowed to compete on a sports team that corresponds with the sex they were assigned at birth. According to a new report from Galp. You know, I've had this dream that one day Clay, I could like in later life teach a class on media propaganda. You know, like at a university level, it'd have to be only only like kids that actually want to learn real stuff because this is a fascinating moment in it. Notice. Okay, 70% of adults say that trans athletes basically trans men shouldn't be able to compete against women in sports. Two things that I that I have though in my head as I look at this. Who are the 30% according this? Well, that's way more than I think a lot of us would have anticipated. I thought it was probably more like, you know, 15 to 20. And then beyond that sex assigned at birth. Notice how they NBC news filters into the conversation that also known as your gender. Yeah. Sex assigned at birth also known as male or female. What I would say jumps out to me, Buck is yes, it should still be higher. But I think this is evidence one, there's going to be about unfortunately, I think 20 or 25% that are just not going to move. They don't care. They are super left wing. They think that trans people should be able to do anything that that gender is basically made up. I don't know where their baseline of support is. I'm guessing it's 20 or 25%. But here's what's interesting, Buck. The number it's now 69% according to this, they rounded it up in the headline. But it's up from 62% two years ago. So this is why I'm always thinking and I understand there's people out there get super frustrated over how slow some of this stuff has to be to percolate in. I think the Riley Gaines is of the world. I think what happened with Leah Thomas becoming a women's champion. I think it's filtering in. I think that for a long time, this is the way the story works a lot of times. And you guys will understand this. The first thing that gets said whenever you point out an issue like this is what that's not really happening. So if you say, well, men who identify as women shouldn't become women's champions. The first thing that a lot of left wingers say is why do you care? That's not really happening. And then you have a situation like Leah Thomas, which cuts through, I think, a bunch of the noise. Again, it was 62% two years ago. Now it's up to just shy of 70%. Well, that's a decent movement. And then people say, Oh, wait, it is happening. And then the pivot goes to, well, it's happening. And it's actually a good thing, right? That they will move from it's not happening. You're out, you're crazy. What in the world are you thinking? And then they rapidly pivot to, of course, it's happening. And it's a good thing. Right now Democrats are trying to make the argument, of course, it's happening. And it's a good thing. And Buck, I mentioned this. I think it's ties in what we're talking about. RFK Junior to my knowledge. RFK Junior is the only Democrat in the entire country that has been willing to say, actually, you should compete against your biological gender. Remember, every single member member of the Democrats in the house and the Senate voted against a bill that would say exactly this. And then the final way that I would analyze this is Buck, the less you know about sports, the less you realize how much gender matters. If you never have played a sport in your life, you may sit back and say, well, there's not that much difference between men's and women's athletes. Well, there's actually a tremendous difference for anybody who's ever competed in athletics. But a lot of left wingers, a lot of super left wingers are not interested in athletics. That's kind of a badge of honor. They're they're totally committed to politics. They're not going to actually ever have played sports. But anybody out there who's ever coached a little league or who's ever been involved in high school sports to say nothing of college or pro sports knows that your gender matters a tremendous amount in terms of how good you can be at a sport. Yes, this is obvious. But yet we're still at a point. As you as you said, it's they rounded it up. You're looking at 31% of people are so insane that they really think that watching 16 year old boys compete against 16 year old girls, um, you know, that that's not insane. I mean, that's insane. I mean, this is the problem. Is we're arguing with crazy folks. The problem is, we try to sit down and say, hey, can we all reason through this? The answer from these lives is no, they cannot. They are unmoored from reality. They are often never, never land. They think that MSNBC is giving it to them straight. The Gallup poll is actually interesting, Buck, because the person that so it's 69 to 26 now. Okay. And I'm doing math in my head. What is that? Like 70 to 26 would be 96, right? So it's 5% of people evidently don't have an opinion on this. So only 26% of people say, and I granted it's way too high. But what's interesting, Buck is in May of 2021, 34% of people were in that camp. So just in the last two years, the you should be able to play on whatever team matches your gender identity. It's gone from 34% of people saying that to 26%. So they've lost 8 percentage points in support. And I think that's because we're slowly cutting through this noise and pointing out how absurd this is because again, at some point you can be, and maybe you're listening to us right now, and this is you, you can be super liberal, right? Traditional liberal. But at some point, inclusion becomes exclusion. And this is a good talking point that I'm starting to see other people pick up on that I hadn't heard anybody else say. If at some point you are a dude and you identify as a girl, and you say, I deserve to be included in women's sports. You're arguing for inclusion, but your inclusion excludes women. Leah Thomas took away a championship from a women swimmer, her or his or whatever you want to say inclusion excludes real women. And I think that cuts through and people start to understand because what people are seeing is the argument is not let trans individuals compete against women to be nice. That's, that's just a strategy. The actual argument is trans women are women. Yes. This is the point. This is where you're either in or you're out of this lunacy, folks, you either see it or you don't. The argument is not be nice to the 12 year old boy who thinks he's a girl, let him play on the girls team. The argument is the 12 year old boy who says he's a girl is a girl. That is the argument. And the I'm just, this is the foundation of totalitarianism. If they can get you to believe that they can get you to say and believe anything, which is sort of why you see the psychology of the schizophrenic left on display here, where they get so upset about this because they want you to comply. If they can make you say yes to this, anything is on the paper. Why they're so dedicated to it. And I think it's also bucked why it's such an essential example of the brokenness of much of our discourse in America on these social related issues. It goes right to the essence. White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, gay, straight, male or female, most people are like, yeah, this is crazy. They're trying to get you to say something that is a why.
