    "text": " politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative true the conservative review with Daniel and welcome back fellow Patriots independent conservatives and all around comments as Americans to this the conservative revolution here at the conservative review podcast an independent conservative revolution not just anyone we are independent minded here where we give you the perspective from the Constitution from law politics history all without the cult of personality and boys there a lot of cult of personality going on these days although it is a very quiet news day on this the last week in August August 26th certainly looking forward to the kids going back to school after Labor Day at least here in Maryland but it was it was a quiet weekend for me I took a lot of time off and I actually began to appreciate why it is that so many of our people are asleep every day even a day like today which is extraordinarily quiet probably among the quietest days I've had at least in a year there still are so many stories out there that I want to share with you that I'm not gonna have enough time to share with you and I feel they're teachable moments they're things everyone needs to know about there are things that men if everyone would know not just the traditional conservative base but really the broad array of common sense Americans that that still think along the traditional ways of politics and policy that define this country for most of our 200 plus years if they would know about it they would be in an uproar but they don't know and I guess part of that is because our lives are so good let's face it these days we all certainly have our own individual health or wealth challenges everyone has their package that's given to them by God but generally speaking we live good lives and I'm telling you I unplugged over the weekend I did so much stuff with the kids we went biking and we did so much outside because it was finally cold or at least cool and I certainly wasn't gonna pass up that opportunity and then my son looked at me and he said we repaint up my room and I was thinking oh man I'm not really in the mood but it was a valid request so I just did it spur the moment prep the walls ran out and then just worked non-stop and then I woke up today with such a headache some of it is I think I was just dehydrated from from doing everything yesterday but the point is I was thinking I could have gone on like that for a number of days and I wouldn't miss politics I wouldn't miss what I do for a living and I guess that's how most of our people live and I don't blame them the problem is we have a left that is inexorably working plotting scheming to implement their utopia what I call their decivilization agenda to flip the law on its head to make citizens of illegal aliens to make a man of a woman a woman of a man redefined marriage make the criminals the victims and the victims of criminals make law enforcement the criminals they do this stuff every day and our people are asleep that's the question how to keep conservatives focused and frankly I'm still struggling with that but with that said with that introduction there is a lot going on today I want to share with you here today on the screen I really want to put this up so you could see our graphics team made this for me two years ago explaining what is the system of government we adopted on the one side there's a system that I think we all agree was adopted in 1789 three co-equal branches of the federal government along with the 50 states and they all sit on an equal playing field under the Constitution the Constitution stands over that no one branch has a greater claim to the Constitution to power to interpret or enforce the Constitution than any other branch at best even if you agree with the concept of judicial review it's not judicial supremacy it's only that the courts can also for its purposes when the civil society interacts with its branch of government like the other branches also interpret the Constitution but not only they can interpret the Constitution another side of the ledger you got a system of government that we never adopted that is more tyrannical than anyone can imagine but it's the system that seems to be prevailing that the courts the Supreme Court really until you appeal and unless they overturn it's really the lower courts created by Congress by the way stand on top of that food chain they stand on top of the executive branch on top of the legislative branch and on top of all 50 states and anything they say irrespective of whether they had power to adjudicate that case irrespective of the statute of the Constitution of history of tradition of any consequence anything a district judge says on anything is the unquestable law of the land unless it's somehow overturned by the Supreme Court and then once the Supreme Court weighs in then certainly it's the it's the unquestable law of the land immutable irrevocable and there's nothing we can do about that folks that is more power than that of a king in fact courts have been accorded the power of God and it's amazing to me that we don't question this and every day we go on without questioning this is another day that we lose our Republic and that's what I really I've been seeking ever since I wrote my book stolen sovereignty to focus the minds of so many of our people as they focus on these elections I say look it doesn't matter if the courts are accomplishing for the decivilization agenda more than anything the left could accomplish through the legislature if they were to win a smashing success one year winning a bunch of governorships and Congress and the president we spoke about this last week on Friday in the context of this crazy judge just snapping his finger and saying I'm vetoing a 130 years of immigration law the law against inducing and encouraging illegal migration and this judge happened to be the brother of the president of La Raza a racist open borders organization they actually just renamed it to unidos us or something I guess because they got a bad rap for for having a name called the race but anyway there's more cases I want to share with you just to start off today's show it's from the Washington Times this also happened Friday I didn't get a chance to to talk about this with you guys and just wanted to share it with you today it's it's at a control Idaho must provide gender confirmation surgery to a transgender inmate living as a woman for years but who has continuously been housed in a men's prison a federal appeals court said Friday the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with a federal judge in Idaho that the states denying the surgery for a 31 year old Adrian Edmo amounted to cruel and unusual punishment a violation of the eighth amendment of the United States Constitution so I mean they used to say it's like you know 14th amendment its first amendment right to express yourself that taxpayers have to give you money to mutilate yourself and we call it surgery like like a bunch of Orwellian propagandists but now it's a violation of cruel and unusual punishment if you're arrested you're convicted on a crime you serve time in the joint and you say you know what I'm really a man so what so and look I'm not trying to be cute here I guess they're saying that unless this is a woman and she wants to be a man so unless we what we attach a you know what a male thing between their legs and remove and mutilate their you know chest I don't know what that means but under the ruling Edmo would become the first Idaho enemy to receive gender confirmation surgery while an Idaho Department of Corrections this is a complete win for Miss Edmo said her attorney Laurie Rifkin our client is immensely relieved and grateful that the court recognized her basic right to medical treatment I mean I just I don't know what to tell you courts could now do something that God doesn't do I mean a king King George never did this how a single lower court could say that states have to cough up the money and here's what I keep telling you folks even to the extent that when a court gets a statute or a constitutional interpretation wrong and you believe that we should abide by that opinion that's only when they're granting relief to a plaintiff in other words we are doing something negative to a plaintiff and the plaintiff wants relief from that but if the plaintiff comes to court and demands a positive action I want taxpayer funding to mutilate my body a court has no power to appropriate funds I mean this is literally what Hamilton said in federal 78 they have neither forced nor will they don't have the force to appropriate funding so everyone's like Daniel shouldn't we you know just defy the court I'm like well yeah for sure but it's not even defying a court a court doesn't have the power to appropriate funding I mean this is out of control you can't make this stuff up however I mean can you imagine you know especially in Idaho but even nationally which is less conservative than Idaho in Congress you know passing a law that you have to let's just say either castrate a male add a thing to a woman take off her you know chest could you imagine that passing the public debate we would have yet nobody's gonna know that overnight unelected judges are being accorded that final arbiter status to say what the Constitution is so you know this slippery slopes this is what if they say that the Constitution mandates the taxpayers must pay for cutting someone's thing off and it's in the eighth amendment I mean that that's a new one friends Romans country men if you don't see this point I can't help you if you don't see how nothing matters until we answer this one question who has the final saying constitutional interpretation and the answer is not the courts the courts could adjudicate an individual case but the courts can't say for a broad population oh the eighth amendment mandates taxpayer funding for this because that is an executive and legislative function and at the state of Idaho doesn't want to appropriate that funding they have no right to do it they could say whatever they want I could say I wish people give me um you know free dr. Pepper every day you know hey de Blasio for all your complaints about soda here you go maybe I deserve free free unhealthy drinks every day if a convicted felon now has a right to mutilate themselves but that's not all there's a recent case this from our friends at judicial watch we reported on this case in its preliminary stage this is from last week and Obama appointed federal judge is forcing Wisconsin taxpayers to provide costly sex reassignment surgery and her multiple procedures for low-income transgender residents who get free medical care from the government and recently issued ruling US district judge William M. Akonle writes that Medicaid the publicly funding insurance that covers 65.7 million poor people cannot deny the medical treatment needs of those suffering from gender dysphoria officials estimated will cost up to 1.2 million annual annually who to provide transgender medicated recipients in the Badger state with treatments such as gender confirmation surgery including elective mastectomies hysterectomies genital reconstruction and breast augmentation oh my gosh I mean friends this is a quiet week okay but yet what the left is accomplishing with Congress even out of sessions the legislators for the most part out of session is something that you can never hope to accomplish through the political process and the courts do this every day and it takes forever for this stuff to get to the Supreme Court but even the Supreme Court they're not the final arbiter of that I mean I'm just saying let's say a court says that you know what I don't know let's just say they say Republicans conservatives are a danger to society and we are going to have we think that it's cruel and unusual punishment for America to have conservatives living and we need tax fair taxpayer mandated sterilization for conservatives I'm not trying to be cute here I'm just saying let's say they said something like that is that is that the law say it's in the Constitution well how do you know it's the Constitution well the court said it is well the courts are the Constitution they define the con no they don't it is so dangerous could you imagine the keys to our society is what it's the Constitution and you're saying that the soul and final expositor of that document is the unelected branch of government I mean that's more despotic than you can ever imagine and nobody says time out before we fight over everything else politically can we talk about this you know we talked about immigration a lot how all of our problems today really stem from judicial amnesty it's the courts saying that you're not allowed to have immigration laws and all my colleagues are kind of running around saying well Congress needs to pass better laws and I keep mentioning the fact that the laws say illegals have no standing the laws say illegals don't have any benefits the laws say illegals are literally as if they are not in the country and the judicial branches own case law from the Supreme Court since the 1880s has said this yet over the last decade or so part it mainly the lower courts have just defied not just the law and the Constitution but even the Supreme Court's own precedent these issues and no one says a word about it and everyone treats it as legitimate I just wanted to read to you just how far the courts have moved on from this this is us v Ginsburg in 1917 an alien who seeks political rights as a member of this nation can rightfully obtain them only upon the terms and conditions specified by Congress courts are without authority to sanction changes or modifications their duty is rigidly to enforce the legislative will is that simple so remember we had this judge saying I don't know that that law it's a little unconstitutional I don't know no their own branch of government said a hundred years ago Supreme Court precedent here your duty is to rigidly enforce the legislative will on immigration law this was a naturalization case even where they were trying to naturalize even a step ahead and the court said in in us v Ginsburg 1917 no alien has the slightest right to naturalization unless all statutory requirements are complied with and every certificate of citizenship must be treated as granted upon condition that the government may challenge it and demand its cancellation unless issued in accordance with such requirements so how is it that I'm the only one who says wait a minute stop stop time out this is illegitimate this is a violation of the court's own precedent you know there's discussion with trump every six months he kind of drops this now talking about um potentially issuing an executive order ending anchor babies this notion going forward not retroactively but going forward that we just hand out birth certificates to any organism born here irrespective of how they got here so an illegally broken dark country demands access to hospital we're nice enough to give it to them and then huh that's a citizen no as you see that a citizen can only be brought in on the terms of our laws and if you break our laws you can't force a citizen on us the guy who wrote the birthright citizenship opinion in 1898 wonky markets justice horis gray he said that blatantly he said that blatantly in 1892 that you cannot unilaterally assert jurisdiction and indeed in 1898 when he was declaring birth birthright citizenship he said very clearly it's only for children of those permitted to reside here everyone ignores that line from the ruling i never understood it because we don't have a focused movement but everyone is agreeing that if he winds up doing this it's all going to hinge on the courts how could something that fundamental be decided by that madison said in an essay on sovereignty that the most republican oriented thing meaning republican form of government that that the power has to reside in the people is determining who becomes a citizen it has to be the people through its elected representatives moreover the 14th amendment section five says that congress regulates the provisions and the enforcement of that not the courts so there you go it's just unbelievable and by the way just as a side note it's important to note i could make fun out of trump for always threatening to do this and never doing it and there's what to laugh at of but i mean it's also it's our fault too trump puts out trial balloons if we don't have a movement really backing it and pushing for it he's gonna back down i mean this has always been the lesson this has been the lesson of trump unless he feels compelled to act he won't act and there's two ways that he feels compelled one is naturally there's something going on in the world that forces his hand that was the case with the may border numbers that forced him to finally you know stop this asylum nonsense and florist and things like that because he just couldn't let this go on but then there's things like this i mean it's too subtle with the birthright citizenship the way to force his hand is by the conservative movement so to speak getting on his case and part of getting on his case is issuing a robust defense for what he is proposing to do but our people are asleep but anyway you know i'm sure some of you saw this but a couple of weeks ago going back to judges this federal judge in massachusetts said that this judge uh joseph for getting her first name now just judge uh joseph she was the judge that was prosecuted by the the department of justice for literally harboring an illegal alien in her courthouse she's entitled to her salary during the indictment and no other federal worker you know like let's say you're a massachusetts state employee and you're indicted you don't get that salary so judges ruling for themselves circling the wagons i mean the degree of rights that they create every day again it's not just the constitution everyone in the legal field i'm one of the few people to challenge this but even the people in the so-called right all these republican conservative judicial nominees you listen to them at these confirmation hearings they all espouse the same garbage that the courts are the sole no the courts get to decide but that means that the courts don't just decide the constitution they get to decide the contours of rights of fundamental rights how do you put that in the hands of unelected unaccountable people it makes no sense it's got to stop but we don't stop it and one of one of the other things we've been talking about a lot is the crime wave the fact that after two decades of reduced crime crime is going up because just like in the 60s and 70s except it's even worse now the judges and the political system in the legal field are just granting criminals so many rights now even evidently to cut your breasts off and have taxpayers pay for it but we're at a point where i mean they're just letting everyone go this is from the free beacon washing free beacon.com the democrat majority on north carolina supreme court ruled to let a child porn offender go free on a technicality and allowed serial sexual offenders to avoid gps monitoring and two decisions released in august so we've been talking extensively discussing extensively on this program the amount of illegal alien child sex offenders that have been caught in north carolina we just wrote about that today from nate manon if you want to check this out the article on this guy who came to the border with a kid the paradigm case of florist the poster child for florist came with a kid got let out on a gps tracking system and then he cut it off and he wound up raping a child now he's convicted he's um he's charged and there's going to be a trial and he is also being charged for identity for cutting off the the ankle bracelet and nobody's talking about that case we're the only ones to report on that but anyway you have tons of this and now judges are saying they don't even need to wear gps monitoring this is unbelievable democrats now hold a 6 to 1 majority on the state supreme court um and yeah i mean they're basically doing this left and right left and right using the remand is an opportunity to make a broad policy statement the majority though saying it addresses only one statutory classification recidivist applies an unbridled analysis with which understates the crimes overstates repeat sex offenders legitimate expectations of privacy and minimizes the need to protect society from this limited class of dangerous sex offenders newbie wrote in the greaty dissent that's the one saying justice on the north carolina supreme court and um they just create a new uh new right a new right he said ankle monitors um i have fourth amendment problems everything's in the constitution except for what actually is so now sex offenders get to go free as a result of judicially created rights for child porn and child sex offenders in north carolina and then in addition to those in north carolina as american citizens as we've noted there's a rash of sex offenders that were importing from other countries and again republicans will not talk about this in a meaningful way and before i get to some of those cases i just want to continue from friday's show there but i just want to close the loop on the courts here on friday the other big news was that well the supreme court released a statement saying justice ruth bader ginsburg has undergone surgery for pancreatic cancer which is never never good and obviously inevitably that's going to bring out all sorts of speculation discussion about a potential vacancy at the supreme court and everyone's predicting oh my gosh this is civil war because if this happens in the near future it's going to give trump the opportunity to appoint another justice and give conservative so to speak a clear majority on the supreme court now those of you who are veterans to the show know that at the end of the day there's only one consistent originalist on the court and that's clarins thomas you got a lido to varying degrees who's good um and then the others are often depending on the issue very unreliable and we've noted a bunch of reasons why no matter how good you think the supreme court's going to get the lower courts get worse and worse permanently alter policies and politics and law and the trajectory of politics in this country i say this all the time the supreme court has almost never rendered a bad immigration opinion in its history yet to this day we have so many bad criminals in this country so much public charge so many things that ice will not do because of nine circuit rulings years going on for years now so people need to understand that this hope that somehow we're going to win the judiciary is nonsense which is why my view on this issue is that if you had a real statesman this is the time to extend a hand and shake hands with the left and make an agreement to me this is the ultimate grand bargain you guys think that you're somehow going to lose ruth bader ginsburg seat and arch conservative lose a majority fine we as conservatives should be concerned to begin with about judicial supremacy how about we shake hands on it and agree to finally take politics out of the courts in other words you could adjudicate your cases in controversies but if a judge is going to give standing to a case that the outcome that they want to render is going to be broadly political pronouncing some sort of judgment on a broad kind of social provision fundamental rights politics that's not just that case that the other branches of government will be very clear that that is not binding over the other branches and even over the states and we're going to continue to fight on that issue so in other words if a judge want to say you know this person's entitled to transgender surgery because we think transgenderism is in the 14th amendment it's in the 8th amendment no the other branches still have a right to push back and that's true even without this deal it's true already but we don't enforce that that is the grand bargain i would make with the left the left would be smart to take it because they think that they're about to lose the courts but i think the right would be smart to take it too because we are never going to win this judicial supremacy game in the long run and it's not healthy for republic it's not the right thing to do so that is my grand bargain that i would issue you know you want to make the supreme court nomination confirmation hearings less contentious take the politics out of the courts and then you'll take the politics out of the confirmation process and it's going to be just this very hyper technical legal position that was viewed by the founders of some nerdy you know obscure thing that nobody will care about and it's going to be like the court nominations were for most of our history which were really unceremonious this is why um john j who was an original supreme court justice he was offered by john adams to come back on the court and to be nominated as chief justice and he was like screw that you know john j was a flamboyant type of guy who was a politician he wanted to do politics he didn't want to just do bankruptcy law that is what the court is supposed to be and i think we'd be stupid as conservatives not to make that deal see if we thought you know the left would at least on the surface appear to be getting a supreme court majority then obviously yeah you know the left is not going to take that deal from us but i think now that they view in their mind they're going to lose all these cases now's the time i think we now is the time i think we should make the ultimate deal and again we'd be stupid not to take it now i just wanted to move on i said you know we have a number number of these uh you know sexual assault cases this type of stuff um that's just added control added control this is a new story i missed kenyan man gets life sentence for raping elderly us patient now in all the american media they reported this guy is a dallas man a dallas texas man but if you go to this is the daily nation it has a kenya url some assuming it's a kenyan paper and i found a couple others like that you see the kenyan media is actually reporting on this that the guy is a kenyan or at least came from kenya and it's their first word in their article but no one else is reporting this now this happened in 2018 but still a kenyan man has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a u.s. court for sexually assaulting a 74 year old patient at a medical facility where he was working anthny mambolio nayakayo 53 was convicted wednesday of two counts of aggravated sexual assault of an elderly or disabled person nayakayo's victim was living at the woodwoodridge health and rehabilitation center in grapevine texas when the crime occurred in january 2018 um she died last year age 75 evidence filed in court showed that the sexual assault was discovered after other nurses working at the facility found blood in the underwear of the victim and exam found evidence jeez that a vaginal tearing consistent with sexual abuse and staff collected dna that was eventually used to time mr nayakayo to the assault after the discovery of blood all male staff at the facility i had at the time the suspected assault took place where asked to undergo dna test taren county dia's office told the court that mr nayakayo's dia sample matched the sample recovered from the women during her sexual assault exam the court was also told that the kenny nurse who immigrated to the u.s raped the elderly woman despite knowing that she could not resist or consent to a sexual event i can't i mean she could not speak feed herself or use the bathroom on her own as she wore diaper and relied on staff we are an aging community and we each deserve the peace of mind of knowing we will be treated with dignity when such time comes jordan uh rolf the lead prosecutor told the court in addition prosecutors also said in court documents that nayakayo had also sexually arrest his colleagues and that he attempted to leave texas during the investigation doesn't this sound familiar do you remember two weeks ago we reported on an ongoing investigation a trial about another kenyan health care worker who originally was an illegal alien whose mother 19 seniors to death what is it yeah folks if i had the control of the media that the left us or if i had control of the media even that the pseudo right has if i had fox news i would get the country more wild up about this riled up about this than el Paso this is the worst nightmare of anyone everyone knows that you know there's tough decisions to make with elderly parents is the most vulnerable position to be in if anything in terms of medical staff in terms of nursing home staff you need the most vetted people around why is there no national discussion on criminal aliens that are allowed to be in this country where's the vetting what was known about this guy how did he get a green card you know i looked up briefly his criminal record it wasn't robust but he did he was caught i think twice driving without a license you know these are the type of things when you see a foreign national in this country i'm assuming he was legal but still why you know they should be on the radar of dhs then i'm not saying driving without the license is is it you know the worst of crimes but that type of guys should already start to be on our radar and these are the discussions that i plan to push but no one will listen to me that we need to have to jujitsu the focus on gun control that's inevitably going to take place when the critters come back to congress next week why aren't they focusing on this rash of brutal murders brutal sexual assaults by foreign nationals especially on seniors when it comes to people that should have been properly vetted if this would be done with a gun we'd be saying where did he get a gun from so again why was he given a green card here's another one this happened uh earlier in in august k i r o seattle boys a lot of news that is seattle with sanctuary cities we have an article out today on them refusing to participate in the law enforcement data sharing program because their scared ice might get a hold of data so they're therefore going to harm all enforcement as a result of it but this was earlier this month i forgot to talk about this a man is behind bars after authorities say he raped a disabled woman in a nursing home where he worked this was an a Kenyan this was an ijirian according to court documents 29 year old anishimaya hamza nursing assistant at false home and village nursing home in north seattle was caught on a hidden camera and then there's a picture of it sexually assaulting the victim more than once has been charged with second degree rape i asked him what are you doing to me he said to me back i'm trying to help you i'm trying to clean you the victim said who did not want to give her name she described feeling shame and because of that she did not immediately tell her family i was feeling that nobody would help me once she told her family her brother bought the hidden camera and did not tell his sister about his plan which made him nervous he was worried if the suspect found the hidden camera he might hurt his sister even more um he said the video proof made him lose his appetite hamza who the state says owns another adult care home himself in bottle washington where operations have since been suspended remains jailed and um um according to seattle media there is another investigation involving another sexual assault at the same facility hamza is not a citizen and came to this country from nijiria well well well well well well um i i don't know what to say these are three cases here we have of African migrant health workers in this country not properly vetted able to remain here either brutally raping elderly or disabled or both you know elderly women and in the case of the other guy smothering 19 to death and there's no talk about this there's no discussion we're going to be coming out with an agenda if i have time for next week on all of the things we need to focus on because what we are doing is not working and for the life of me i don't know why i'm the only one doing this but remember the power of a story one story one narrative the left could drive politics forever they could drive law they could drive policy they could drive congress's legislative agenda but all these stories that implicate open borders lack of vetting for for green cards and no one even knows about these cases so i might sound like a broken record here but i'm gonna keep focusing on this because someone's got to know about this maybe i'll do a print article on this as well but this is insane i'm starting to see a pattern here let me know if you're seeing this pattern as well um i know many of you have sent me cases and i'm forgetting who it was and i apologize if uh if i'm missing you i i know one of you sent me a email over the weekend but this was another story lee high acres man arrested for sexually assaulting a child this is in um near fort miers lee county florida lee high acres man i love this lee high acres man um was arrested after he was accused of sexually assaulting a child younger than 12 45 year old richard rick holland or goodie eras is currently being held at the lee county jail on a half a million dollar bond he was arrested thursday evening lee county deputies arrested rick holland goodie eras after his victim recently came forward about the years of sexual abuse she received the girl told deputies the abuse started in another country when she was just eight years old and continued when she moved to the u.s according to the report the latest is all happened a month ago so that means that this guy came with her i don't know if he's family it's not clear what it is but the guy is likely and illegal certainly not a citizen certainly came here a few years ago rick holland goodie eras his neighbor said that they were appalled and disgusted to learn about the hindu's accusations made um rick holland goodie eras wife declined to comment ocea as a wife i wonder if she has an anchor baby too that we're gonna be stuck with we're gonna be focusing on this safety and security agenda we're gonna be focusing on getting tough on sexual assault not just for illegal aliens but for you know american criminals too for all this me too movement somehow when it comes to the very people that are in our system we just let them go and there's all sorts of cases now being let go let go every one of these people let me read you one more case from san Antonio it's from matt trammel convicted child predator indicted for slitting strangers throat during home invasion a man wasn't indicted for breaking into strangers homes stealing his bike phone and leaving him with a slit throat on august 7th at tom green county grand jury indicted lavere on two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon according to the court reports on june second the san angel of police department i'm sorry i said san to san angel of the police department was dispatched the area of prasur and main streets for call for call about a man being a robber once they arrived police met met the victim who was visibly bleeding right under his adam's apple real nice police say that while the victim was sleeping a man entered the home and put a pocket knife against his throat he then received a punch the eye that caused visible swelling the men then started to press and cut his throat when the victim escaped and ran out of the door with nothing but his pants on before the men left he took the victim's phone and bicycle um he let it you know he left beyond stuff that they were able to track him down with the now here's the deal police identified the men as chad lavere 39 he was originally rested on the act of a warrant for failure to appear he was later charged with burglary um i looked up his record he has a record like 20 years long guess what he's registered as a child sex offender and he was convicted on multiple child rape charges as well as uh he has a whole other history why was he out why was he out i'm daniel there's too many people on jail and prison that that that don't do that therefore non violent crimes they served shuntin shishtard or too long that's what the retarded teletubbies are saying even in the conservative thing tanks and conservative politicians in this administration by the way in the white house endless endless cases and there you have it folks endless child rape charges you know i feel bad because i wanted my you know family even potentially my oldest son to be able to listen to these shows but they're increasingly becoming so gruesome but i mean that's what it is this is what's going on and and what i see is just a fraction of what happens anyway send me your comments questions and concerns to blaze uh yeah let's get my email here dharwhitsatblazemedia.com tweet me at arm conservative subscribe to our
