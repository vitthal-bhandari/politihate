Welcome to the TUTER DIXON Podcast. I'm TUTER DIXON and I'm so glad you're here today with someone that I have known for a few years now. One of my favorite people to just chat with and just before we started recording, we were having an awesome conversation. So I know that this conversation is going to be great too. This is former New York Congresswoman Nan Hayworth, also a medical doctor. So she's got a lot more knowledge and information than me. So we think of her as a professional in many ways. So we're in good hands today. She is from New York. So I do want to start in New York because there's a lot going on. But first I want to say welcome. Welcome, Congresswoman, Heyworth. Thank you so much, TUTER. It is my privilege. You're one of my favorite people to have as a host. And by the way, I grew up in Northwest Indiana, so not far from Michigan at all. Wow. So you know a little bit about the Midwest then. You know, Midwest nice, but you also, but now you're in New York, which is an interesting contrast because certainly going from the Midwest to New York, I see you sometimes when we're in New York together and New York City has changed a lot in the past few years. It has not for the better. And much of it is a tribute. Some of it's attributable to COVID. There's no question. It's all attributable to the predominance of Democrat politicians and politics in our state. And the criminal reform law of 2019 is the lingering source of a great deal of disruption and continuing problems. I want to ask you a little bit about some of this because I think that we've been, we've been talking about woke a lot, right? So we talk about all the things woke that are happening. And I'm starting to think that's too nice of a term and it kind of excuses a lot of the hatred that comes out of this because we've seen a lot of hatred of white people, white men, especially. We just had Jane Fonda come out and say white men should be put in jail for climate change. We've seen a lot of hatred toward Christians. And just most recently, you had the City University of New York. There was a commencement speech that had what's being called as anti-Israel hate speech. And then they also... Right. I mean, Anne, condemning the NYPD, calling them fascist. This is like, we're going to the next level. I mean, that's why I don't like calling this woke. This is becoming very dangerous. Yes, I agree with you. It's poisonous cultural Marxism. I will offer this, Tudor. I think much, in fact, all of the depredations we see emerging from the academy in this country originate because taxpayers are being attached to pay generously for these abuses. We have an education government complex almost exclusively, although there are notable exceptions, including Michigan's own Hillsdale College, which refuses to participate in any government funding programs, scholarships, loans, or otherwise. And they are a shining light of American founding values that are universal. And can and should be cherished by all. And have engendered the prosperity that the education government complex abuses today. What you see, these kinds of... This kind of infective that we heard from this commencement speaker condemning white supremacy. And the law is abused in this country to oppress all minorities. And yes, she had a whole... She's... Obviously, mostly, she had on a headscarf. But yes, to condemn our ally in the Middle East Israel, this infective was made possible because these people live in an ecosystem. And that's the problem with the left. They never understand the ecosystem in which they can exist. This country is able to harbor them and their rhetoric and their protests and their dysfunction, precisely because we have had a nation that has relied fundamentally, if and perfectly, on the principles of, yes, hard work, showing up, being reductive, competing, striving for excellence. All of those values that are now condemned as white supremacists, which is an incredible insult to the black folks I know personally who embody the best of those values. But the education government complex exists for two reasons. One is to indoctrinate the next generation of Marxists and the other, crucially, is to serve as the conduit, the extortion division for the Democrat Party. They prime money out of taxpayers' pockets and sluice those campaign contributions and votes directly to the Democrat Party and their politicians. It is an absolute disgrace and the best thing we could do for this country is to defund and dismantle that education government complex, make all education private. And I say that as the product of great public schools in Munster, Indiana in the 1960s and 70s. My dad went to public schools in Tyrell, Ohio. My husband went to public schools in New Jersey and Texas. My kids went in New York. They had many fine teachers. I had amazing teachers. I'm very grateful for it, but it should all be private at this point because this is the wellspring of that poisonous hatred. And they're cranking out all these graduates going into policy, going into now, of course, business, going into education, and of course, it's starting, it's starting really young because you have, I mean, exactly what you're saying, this money that we're putting into big education, and that goes, starts in, in some cases in preschool. Now, that money that's going in is also paying the dues of the teachers unions and the teachers unions are becoming more and more and more powerful. And this is something, I mean, just today, I've been talking about this because my kids were in public ed until the pandemic. I moved them to a private school. My oldest will be graduating from eighth grade today. And it's very emotional for me. I've been like a wreck all day. I know that's so silly, but it's still it is. It is an ice. I've seen how she's grown. And I was telling the folks here in my office today, we went in this morning and they had a breakfast for them for graduation day. And then they had what they called an award ceremony. And everybody's like, Oh, did every kid get an award? Every kid did. They got a folder with their award in it. And they weren't called out for what their award was. It was on a roll and things that they had earned. But what the award ceremony really was, was the teacher standing up and and telling them, these are the gifts that we've seen that you have over the last several years that you've been here. And I just cannot tell you the value I see in these private educations and private educators that pour into your child in that way. And I'm not saying that that doesn't happen in public ed. But this was this for us is very values based for our family. This is a Christian school. I feel very blessed to have them learning their faith while they're learning their history and their math and their English. And I think that's something that we as Republicans, we want to come in and enact policy and in several states, we've been successful with choice policy. I think the conversation also has to be out there that you have to as a parent be incredibly involved in your child's education. And if you think that's missing, research other schools. And if you think you can't get into that school, but it reflects your values, find out what programs they have because you probably can figure it out. Well, I think that's great advice, Tudor. I agree wholeheartedly. And I do think that as a nation, we should be and I welcome state by state. Yeah, federalism, but state by state, these school choice, you know, the money follows the student, not the school. That is a powerful means of ensuring that institutions will compete on the basis of quality. And that means involved parents recognizing what that quality should be and what it should look like. But institutions competing to do the best they can for our children. Families have the fundamental you are so right, Tudor parents have the fundamental responsibility. There's no question. I do think that we as a society have a collective responsibility, not ownership, but a collective responsibility to make sure that we're fostering the development of the best individual citizens we can have because as the framers and founders brilliantly noted, this country will only work. John Adams in particular, this country will only work if it is comprised of moral actors, of individuals who understand their relationship to God. What it should properly be in terms of obligations to their communities, to others, to themselves, to their families, to this country. And that will not happen in public schools of today, sadly, for many reasons. And that's why that that choice is so important. Let's take a quick commercial break. We'll continue next on the Tudor Dixon podcast. Ronald Reagan said inflation is as violent as a mugger, as frightening as an armed robber, and as deadly as a hitman with rising inflation today. It's critical to protect your money with gold and silver. That's why I've partnered with the number one precious metals company, Goldco.

Freedom is the key to any good relationship. It's about being around each other because you want to be around each other, not because some contractor, some inflexible data plan are holding you down. Consumer Cellular knows that a good connection with somebody isn't something you can take for granted. It's something you earn with every bill you send, every fee you don't charge, every charge you don't hide. That's why Consumer Cellular lets you walk away at any time. No feelings hurt. That's why at Consumer Cellular, you only pay for the data you need each month, whether it's one gig or a bajillion. So anyway, listen. Consumer Cellular wanted me to ask you if you're into that kind of thing, you know, freedom, love, having a good time. If maybe, maybe you wanted to go steady. If you do, check yes or call us. We love talking on the phone. Consumer Cellular, when Freedom Calls, we're here to answer. Call us at 1-888-Freedom. Some of the things that we see coming out of public schools today, I mean, obviously we're seeing, we started talking about Woke, but we are seeing a lot of the stuff come into the schools. Absolutely. This is, you know, Pride Month starts in June. A lot of schools are ending in June. And so that's, that's just like, that's how they're, that's the note they're ending on. And there's a lot of pushing me. We saw the department, US Department of Ed on the first day of Pride come out there with a, a post saying, you know, we're welcoming this. This is an exciting thing. And as far as I'm concerned, we're talking about your sexual identity, which I don't, I don't feel that that has a place and certainly in elementary school. But really, I don't want somebody talking to my middle school about that. And I think you're, you're figuring out who you are in high school. So I don't see, I really don't see this as a school issue whatsoever. But we see communities that are, it seems as though the social contagion of transgenderism is infecting entire communities. And I say that, and I'll have people say, oh, you don't believe that people can be transgender. I don't believe that five girls that are friends become transgender altogether. And, and I know that there have been studies, I think it was Boston University that did a study showing that this is a social contagion. I mean, similar to anorexia or bulimia, which is something we saw when I was in college, we had these whole communities of girls that would become anorexic at the same time. Why are we not allowed to say that? Why indeed? And to your point, Tudor, I observed today that a paper was just withdrawn or rejected or submitted for further review. Anyway, you know, has been pulled. And the paper dealt with, from a scientific journal, the paper deals with rapid onset gender dysphoria, ROGD, just what you're talking about. That phenomenon seems particularly prevalent among females, female adolescents, that they all of a sudden decide as a group that they are not in the right body. This is, it's such an important, it's a vital issue on so many levels. Clearly, there are individuals, it is a very tiny number of human beings who feel profoundly that their body is not the right body. And that, you know, the sex that they're born with, it's not a matter of being assigned, you can call it observed sex. I'm a doctor. You know, it is clear when an infant is born, almost always, there are, there are outlying cases for reasons that are well known, they have to do with certain abnormalities of ordinary bodily function. But, you know, we're observed to be male or female. Son of a, the doctor are maturely saying, well, you know, this is a little boy, this little girl, everybody, and anybody with common sense knows that. And the fact that it's hard even to say that, not about Republicans, but among Democrats, cotangi-brown-jaction could not define a woman. You know, it's like, what? Yeah. And when you have a gender reveal, there are only two colors that we're choosing for. Well, yes. So an adult, and by the way, you know, the definition of adulthood probably is much closer mentally and psychologically being 25. You know, it's not 18. Right. Right. Right. 18 is an artifact of the Vietnam War era, because the argument was, if you can get drafted at 18, then you ought to be able to vote. You can argue the legitimacy of the draft, by the way. I completely get that. But the Army is an authoritarian hierarchy, or the military is an authoritarian hierarchy. You put 18 year olds into that, their lives are completely regimented and regulated. That does not mean they have the discernment to have the franchise. I think we're just that something people don't understand, though. And so go into that a little bit, because you're talking about brain development and things develop at different points. But we know for sure that consequence and all that, those are the last things to develop. So fully understanding. Yes. Perspective self-control. And if you want to know, I learned this on the Financial Services Committee when I was in the house. If you want to know who's got the skinny on, real life risk, ask an insurance company, because that's their livelihood. That's their survival. That's their bread and butter. Auto insurers will not ensure a driver until their, or at least rental companies. I'm pretty sure a lot of auto insurers either, but you can't rent a car until you're 25 years old. Yeah, right. Exactly. Because they want your auto, your rental company insurers won't, won't ensure you if you're renting to under 25 years old, because that really is the cut off. So my, my strongly held view as a doctor, I'm an ophthalmologist. I am not a, you know, a gender specialist. But my strongly held view is that because I know the kind of harm that we're capable of doing as doctors. You know, there we can do unnecessary procedures. We should not be. I didn't, but you know what I'm saying. But there's also, I think, a temptation, just like in any, in any business, there is a temptation to go a little bit to the next, like, try to bring in the next buck, right? And we've heard about this happening in medicine. Yes. I mean, we've heard about people having cavities filled when there was no cavity, all of these different things. Yes. So why is this not a big deal? Why are there not more doctors standing up and saying, yeah, this is incredibly lucrative. I mean, to cut off healthy body parts, that's a serious surgery. I've had a mess, a double mastectomy. I know that it was extraordinarily expensive. And between me and the insurance company, a lot of money was exchanged. So why is, why are people in the medical industry afraid to stand up and go, Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is not a big deal. No harm. You know, tutor because the political pressures are enormous. And also most of the house of medicine in this era is on the left. And I see it at my own alma mater, corn. Now it's wild corn, all medicine. But anybody willing to do a life-altering, irreversible intervention, chemical or surgical, on a human being under the age of 25, before they have full neurobiological maturity, personally, I think that is malpractice. And I think criminal penalties should apply. That's interesting because I'm not a piece of regrets. A lot of these lawmakers are looking at bills up to 18. And I think that they are doing this without probably the advice of a medical professional because we have all, we all have this ingrained in our head that once you're 18 years old. Exactly. And it's a big mistake. That's right. And it's because we were drafting people into Vietnam at age 18. And then folks said, we've got to be able to vote at age 18. The dumbest thing this country ever did was let 18 year olds have the vote. Sorry. You know, but they're not ready. I think that the people, it's such a compelling argument from the left to say these people want to commit suicide. You're taking this away. I know it's terrible. Yes. There is a lot to be said for just growing up. And there are things no matter what that you just can't do until you're a certain age. And I don't know how we frame that in a way that people understand that what we're doing is the loving part. We love people enough to say when you're ready, when you're ready. Right. And I think I think the elements are this. Number one, we say, look, once you are an adult, you live your life the way you choose. If you were, you know, if your body has XY cells, you know, male cells, but you want to live looking like a female, that's up to you. Now, we have to have a separate conversation, of course, about women's spaces in sports. I think this is politically where Republicans gain a certain community affiliation that might not otherwise be there. But before the age of 25, you know, we as certainly as practitioners have to protect the vulnerable. And that's, you know, we have to recognize that these folks need, you know, they don't need judgment. You know, that's that's an element of it. We're not judging. But we are offering compassion and care. You know, and what we're saying is I understand and appreciate that you are distressed. You don't feel right. Most of these people, as I'm sure you know, tutor, are somewhere on the emotional disorder spectrum. A lot of them are on the autism or Asperger spectrum. They don't feel, you know, and folks on that spectrum have a lot of trouble placing themselves in a community. That's what I think there is. There are, there are folks that have a feeling, a lack of fitting in feeling. And so, and the message from some folks in the medical community is that this can manipulate those people. Yes. Our percentage of truly transgender people is not as high as what we're seeing coming into these clinics. And but it's also pushed by social media and all these other things. And now we have this madness of we're changing the boxes of menstrual products. And I mean, they're even coming out and saying this is a bigger financial burden for trans people. How is a menstrual product, a bigger financial burden for one group over another? Like we're all all people that are going out and buying these products are buying them at the same cost, whether you're buying this for yourself or your daughter or you know, whatever this is, they're they cost the same. And I think it's also disappointing to see these companies cave and say we're going to make this look less like it's for women. We've got to get rid of the this female symbol. We've got to get rid of the color pink. I mean, the next thing you know, I'm going to have to search for it in the spaghetti aisle because we don't even want it in women's products. I mean, give me a break. It's just yes, the left exists to disrupt. And that they have embraced this transgender theme movement in part because they feel it just simply disrupts American society. And whether or not, you know, it's it could be subliminal for some of them. But they are they are succeeding because of the complicit nature of American enterprise at this point. And we're seeing it on all fronts. So social media, as you pointed out, Tudor Jonathan height has done a lot of great work about this with with colleagues and wrote an essay a couple of months ago published an essay really statistically. You can see that the figures from mental distress, mental dysfunction skyrocketed with the advent of smartphone use among kids. Let's take a quick commercial break. We'll continue next on the Tudor Dixon podcast. Ronald Reagan once said inflation is as violent as a mugger as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hitman with rising inflation today.

They see friends out there, not out with the friends. There's something wrong with me. There's an internalization. We were seeing young female suicide and suicide attempts that are increasing. What is the answer for that? I think that so often we look for a legislative answer to these things. It's just like when you have a kid that's suffering. What's the pill that I can give them? Absolutely. What is the legislation that I can do that can just cut this off? But it's a society. It's a culture issue. I agree with you, tutor. You're right. And once we lose the culture, we're in trouble. I think we are in trouble. Why are Democrats winning? What are we doing that is not... What is your perspective in New York? Because obviously I have mine in Michigan. But you have the same thing where everybody thought oh, we're going to end up with the governorship here. And then it don't happen. So what are the Democrats doing that are winning over hearts? Because I believe it's hearts. I don't think you're just getting votes. I mean, I think that there are shenanigans going on. But they're moving hearts and they're very serious. Absolutely. And look, Republicans did come close. Democrats make the argument that they are more compassionate and they care more about personal liberty. Superficially, some folks might agree with them because Democrats want to take lots of money from rich people and send it to people who are needy. And isn't that compassionate? Well, not when you think it through when the coercive power of government is involved. But unfortunately, anybody can vote even if they really don't know how our government works. Anybody can run for office even though they don't know how our government works, how it's supposed to work. We don't teach civics anymore. We don't teach math properly. We don't teach. I mean, all of these problems are interrelated. The most immediate answer for teenagers, for kids, is for them not to have smartphones, for them to have flip phones. You know, they can get calls and they can make texts and that's and take pictures maybe. But that's it. That's it. And you would think that there would be a huge market for that that we have parents have to make that decision. Not the government. I mean, but you could even you couldn't even see I mean, companies like Apple, they could easily make a device that doesn't do any of the other things, right? But the market is out there. And then you'd have people saying why want that to be available. We're in an interesting conundrum right now. And I think the Republican Party has some soul searching to do on how to reach people and how to message, but how to get that message out. I mean, I think we're messaging or just not reaching people. And I mean, we were talking about the presidential battle before we got on here. And that in and of itself is boy, it's such a fight right now. We see that on social media. And I don't think that those open battles and the tearing down of one another is going to do well with the 18 to 29 year olds, because that's a group that I mean, they've been told their whole life there's nothing worse than a bully. Right. Although they see bullying all the time and they participate in bullying and again, right? Yeah. Well, yes. Yeah. As long as it's their side type of bullying, right? You know, Democrats doing the bullying, you know, because what what the left will say is, you know, they wear the tolerant ones, but they're completely intolerant in the name of tolerance. They're completely intolerant of what they perceive to be and what historically in some ways is. I mean, the dominant culture in this country was white and Christian, you know, or Judeo Christian. So yeah, if you want to look at what was what it has been. I mean, I think about just the other day on the view, you have sunny from the view coming out and saying that white women are following their husbands and what they're doing voting. They need to preserve the patriarchy. And what are you talking about? And I think about the days of the view when it was really the viewpoint of all different women, you know, when Barbara Walters was on there and giving them stern looks, no, no, pull it back, you know, there is no point back now. This has become a propaganda arm of the Democrat party. And no one condemns that she says this. No one says, well, wait a minute, these women have minds of their own, but they can paint conservative women as a handmaid's tail or whatever it was that I kept hearing when I was running. And yes, the handmaid's tail. No, it, well, okay. So yes, did, did you and I grow up in a country that had more white citizens and still does than those of other races? Yes, more Christians. I mean, certainly in my era, arguably that's changed an awful lot. But that doesn't mean number one, that they're inherently bad. They haven't been inherently bad, not at all. So that's number one. You know, but number two is that in order to try to reverse, you can't reverse the past, you can certainly change what we do now and for the future. But in order to try to make up for past sins, we have created protected classes of citizens. So Sunny Hostin, because I guess, I don't know, I don't know what exactly her ethnic background is, but I think she's red as black because she's a black woman. You can't say anything that's Sunny Hostin. She will interpret it as racist and sexist, right? Yeah. So, you know, she's in a protected category now. And if you don't want to get into trouble, right, you tip to around the protected category. So we can't have a real debate with Sunny Hostin, I mean, people do, but you know what I'm saying, you can't have a real debate with Sunny Hostin because then you'll be rejected from the halls of, you know, white thinking people. That's, that's exactly right. I think that is the, that's the fight that we keep having is just, it's interesting. You talked about girls sports a little bit. We didn't get there, but the fight, I think that we keep having is just to keep having our voice out there and say, these are our values. We're not actually, we're not going to bend to you. We're not going to say that we're ashamed of what our values are. There are values. They've worked for a long time. And I think that people, no matter what faith you are in this country, you can be proud of your faith, you can speak your faith, no matter what political party you are part of, you can be proud of your political party and you can speak for that. You can speak the values to that. That's something that I think that we've seen being pushed further and further, but I love that you are out there every day. And I see you on TV all the time. I think that's amazing because as a woman who did serve the country and has been in the medical field, also in Congress, those are two combinations that I think are our places. We really need voices.
