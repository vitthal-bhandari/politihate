Join the millions of listeners on the iHeartRadio app. Free never sounded so good. IHeartRadio. Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Ooh, welcome back in. Clay Travis, Buck Sexton Show. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us. We roll through the Thursday edition of the program. We've been talking about Alex Murdock, who is testifying in his own defense as we speak in South Carolina in a case that has captivated the attention of many. That is a small town, relatively, relatively in the global scheme of things. Small story. I would argue the biggest story that is going on right now from a geopolitical perspective is this question of what is going to happen in China. In particular, is there going to be an attempt to invade Taiwan? And what do we make of China's newfound relationship with Russia and how it might implicate things? There is a report out there that we are going to quadruple our military spending on behalf of Taiwan at the same time that we are spending billions of dollars on behalf of Ukraine. What does this all mean? We're joined now by Steve Yates, senior fellow at the America First Policy Institute host of the China desk podcast. You can find Steve at America First Policy dot com and his podcast is at the federal newswire dot com. Steve, I'm sure you saw the story and we talked about it on this program about the American general who said, I believe by 2025, he believed that that China would invade Taiwan and we would have to make a decision about what exactly we're going to do in the event that occurs. Do you believe that's going to happen? What do you make of our increased expenditures on military material for Taiwan and where are we in that relationship in that context of Taiwan and China in your mind right now? Well, thank you, Clay. Well, this is a challenge that has vexed us for a long time. We do now have an increased number of military officials at a senior level speaking out publicly about it. Right about it internally and our intelligence services and our diplomats always seem to underestimate the timeline on which China was prepared to act against us or against Taiwan. Now it seems like the conventional wisdom has crept up into being at potentially real time and we are behind the curve on making sure we've enhanced deterrence in the Asia Pacific. We've allowed a lot of material to be reallocated to the Middle East for a long time for different kinds of missions. The Ukraine conflict has drained a lot of material. One can argue whether that's good or bad, but it can't argue away the impact it has on what's available for other contingencies. And of course, President Biden has been on a trail of provocative weakness and that I think is a very unsettling message to an aggressive provocateur like Xi Jinping of China, the latest episode being the balloon transiting and the weak response. So not a happy picture, but at least when we're talking about armaments going to Taiwan, they pay for them unlike a lot of other countries where we give them away. But we're behind the curve in allowing them to acquire what they really need to deter China and defend themselves with or without our intervention. Hey, Steven's buck, let's drill in on that point for a second. What does Taiwan really need in order to raise the, raise the cost of a Chinese invasion enough to deter it and what can we do or should we do to fill that gap? Well, first they need the ability to inflict pain on China itself in a meaningful way. Buck, you know, as well as anyone, I mean, for deterrence to exist, someone has to have a credible belief that they're going to lose something that matters to them. So whether that's their power grid potentially going down a massive cyber attack, missiles that could hit key locations reliably on the mainland, having the most advanced fighter jets instead of selling the decades old material with less than cutting edge systems. All of these things were under this rubric of strategic ambiguity and avoiding offensive air quoted capabilities. So we have put Taiwan somewhat in this straight jacket for a generation and we need to get out of that if we don't want to be the first sharp end of the spear intervening on their behalf. What do you make of this potential relationship between China, Russia and Iran? It seems that the invasion of Ukraine has brought all three of them together. Is this just a function of they recognize that they're all outside the scope of American friendship for lack of a better way to describe it? And so they've brought together as a result. Do you buy into any sort of danger of this unholy triumvirate? Are they a legitimate threat? Are they trying to create a counterbalance to American power around the world? What happens with that trio in their relationship? Well, it's similar to lemma we always have. If we have reliable and good leadership in the United States, this is much less of a challenge. Most of the world, even the sense thaters will want to hedge their bets and lean more in our direction. But under the current circumstances where the United States doesn't seem to be meeting with leadership or success in several different parts of the world, this condominium at best is a do-no-gooder condominium to avoid sanctions and to proliferate dangerous technologies and impose penalties and other kinds of pain on those who seek freedom or to go about their business, et cetera. But at the worst, it is a condominium in which the United States loses the ability to try to put discipline short of war to shape other countries' behavior. And so I think it's troubling. I wouldn't say we're at a clear cold war of the free world versus this Beijing-Moscow Tehran silo, but it's going in that direction and we're not doing a lot of good to show that we've got the will and capability to lure the others on to say bet on us, not on them. Speaking of Steve Yates, he is the host of the China desk podcast and a senior fellow at America First Policy Institute. Steve, how would you assess Chinese regime stability right now? You know, we've really thought about China internally for the most part last couple of years, just because of the COVID madness. I mean, they went even beyond what we did here in the West or even what they did and say, Australia and New Zealand. But is she worried about internal threats? Is he concerned about the economy imploding? What's the status inside of China? Because obviously that can play a big role in the decision making vis-a-vis Taiwan. Absolutely, but they do face a lot of challenges internally. Economic, demographic, their radical COVID policy had a massive impact. Plus, this Wolf Warrior mentality that had taken out into the world is pretty different from the term offensive they tried in decades past. So there's a lot of reasons for a rational leader in China to be concerned about riding through this turbulent period. However, Xi Jinping is in my estimation the most ruthless leader of the People's Republic of China to date. He has complete control of the security state. And if we are unnerved by what our security state can do to American citizens, imagine that a thousand times more developed with no civil liberties whatsoever. And that's what Xi Jinping sits on top of. So in short, he's not scared of being toppled, whether he's right or wrong, but he is not presiding over a stable and prosperous period in China relative to his predecessors. I'm sure you've seen some of the war games that they have run on what happens if China tries to invade Taiwan. How the United States will respond, what is likely to happen? We know we spend $100 billion plus and that bill is ongoing. It's a money pit in Ukraine. What do you think Joe Biden would do if he got a call in the middle of the night? China has begun the invasion of Taiwan. Well, it's a terrifying scenario to me to be honest because on the one hand, Joe Biden, the individual tends to say what traditional American presidents and congressional leaders have said for a generation that if Taiwan was attacked, we would honor our commitment to defend Taiwan. President Biden has said that three or four times. So the first part that scares me is that when every time he does so, someone from the White House anonymously corrects him on the record, which just makes it very murky for any American, much less our allies and the people of Taiwan. Have any confidence they know what would happen. And in China, they could overestimate their ability to inflict pain without there being a broader conflict with us, with Japan and others. I think that is just a dangerous web of miscalculation. But what should be done is arming them to the teeth, to the extent they want to pay for it and use it, enhance deterrent independent capabilities of Japan and others so that it's a complicated situation for China and make clear that they pay a dear price, not just with a military attack, but you'd have an end of the economic relationship. There would be significant comprehensive attacks to undermine them. And that's just a step further than any president's been willing to talk or prepare since the Nixon Kissinger bargain. What is the Biden administration doing right? And what is it doing wrong with regard to US-China policy now that we're two years in? Well, I think one of the things that seems to be interesting in the right direction is they do seem to be amping up the supply chain of capabilities and training and interoperability with Taiwan. There are senior Taiwan officials that have been in DC for eye-level consultations. Those used to be completely clandestine now that is in the media and it's not denied. We also have some senior American officials, well, senior with air quotes, it's sort of the mid-levels of appointees from the Pentagon and other places in Taiwan to talk about these scenarios. And so at least they're inching in the right direction on that front. And we've heard a lot less from climate czar John Kerry about that being the number one issue that has to be addressed in US-China relations, but it's to be determined who's actually calling the shots in this and where it's all going. So timeframe-wise, my big picture question here is there's this idea that China has been on a cent. But actually, if you look behind the numbers, we now know their population has begun to decline. We now know that their economy is not growing as fast as they had wanted and certainly as buck laid out, the COVID-0 collapse has certainly undercut Chinese legitimacy as well. Because China's beginning to decline in power actually make things more dangerous as it pertains to Taiwan because a decade from now, they may not have the ability to try and invade Taiwan. In other words, could they invade out of weakness as opposed to strength? Well, the scenario you outlined just now, Clay, is the one that I would buy with the biggest bet because I do think it's declining. We can, China, or a troubled China, has a natural appeal to nationalism to hold people together and to extract. There is, if they allow another decade, time for Taiwan, Japan, the United States, and others to catch up technologically and materially for us to get meaningful biting sanctions or other actions. And so there is this, I think, danger of vulnerability between now and, say, 2025 that is very, very troubling. So through the exercise of a presidential election, you think no American would want to show any weakness through that, but they might see that as just a moment of chaos and distraction here to push before we get our act together after that season. Steve Yates, go check out the China desk podcast. He's at the America First Policy Institute. Stephen, always great to have you on. Thanks so much, Buck. Take good care. 997 people lost their lives on 911, but that day is still taking lives. People are still suffering and dying from 911 related illnesses. There's a whole generation of Americans who know little to nothing about 911. Only two states in our nation mandate K to 12 learning about it. That's why the talented towers 911 Institute is giving educators access to nonfiction 911 resources for K through 12 grades. Whole curriculum units built around first person accounts with scripted social studies lessons, activities and background for teachers. They've also created a mobile exhibit, a high tech 83 foot tractor trailer that turns into an 1100 square foot interactive museum with 911 artifacts. This organization does so much to make sure that we remember to never forget we must educate future generations, help talented towers, educate our future, our children, donate $11 a month at t2t.org. That's t the number two t dot org. Keeping it real. Keeping it honest. Clay Travis and Buck Sexton. The free iHeartRadio app is your home for the holidays.

It's a very clear indicator of the political salience and and let's be honest, the political win that Donald Trump has just has just achieved by doing the right thing and going to see the people of East Palestine because it is upsetting liberals. The libs are upset about this somehow and they're running to give the Biden administration Joe Biden very quick to run over to high five Zelensky for a for accepting another whatever will be $100 billion of US military and taxpayer support over the next year. Here's what Joy Behar over at the view has to say to the people of East Palestine who are wondering if their lungs have been forever damaged if their drinking water is forever polluted. Here's what she has to say play by the way he plays someone with deep ties to the chemical industry in charge of the EPA's chemical safety office. That's who you voted for in that district. Donald Trump who reduces all safety. He did. They need to look past the photo. Of course. And say who's doing the job here. Forget about the photo. I think this is Donald Trump's fault. This is Donald Trump's fault. One of them says you need to look at who you voted for. The other one says Joe Biden has been president for over two years. I mean, the first of all, the premise is just it is dumb beyond comprehension. But beyond that, look, I know it's the view, Claire, right? So like, should we even, but they're contempt of everyday people if they voted for Trump, they despise Trump voters, not just Trump Trump voters. And that's what everyone needs to be needs to be reminded of. Well, remember where we've gone here too? Initially it was this is a whole made up story. Nothing is big deal in East Palestine. This is a right wing made up story. And now they have pivoted as they are recognizing that, Oh, wait, this was a significant ecological issue. There are tons of issues associated with water and pollution and the ability of people to live their normal lives in this community. And so fairly rapidly they have pivoted from this is an exaggerated story that isn't worthy of our retention. Remember, this has been three weeks now to, Oh, Donald Trump is responsible for all of this. And I think it's symptomatic of what you said, Buck, which is 2024 is going to be decided in the Midwest, whether people in New York and LA like it or not. What happens in Wisconsin? What happens in Pennsylvania? What happens in Michigan? That's probably going to decide the election. Now Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, New Hampshire, you know, we can sprinkle in a few other parts of the country that may have contested in serious races. But by and large, this election is going to be decided in the Midwest. You tell me what happens in those three states. I'll tell you who the president is going to be in 2024. So the idea that the Biden administration was caught flat footed here and I would circle back around to what we were talking about earlier, Buck, how many people out there listening to us right now who care about the direction of the country who pay attention to politics can even name an apartment of truck transfer, a department of secretary of transportation for what the last 20 years. How many of them can you name? I can name Elaine Chao. I think was she labor or secretary? Transportation. Transportation. I mean, I'm not sure that I'm not 100. Not a different property. I wouldn't be buzzing in. I'm not sure. So you and I are pretty plugged in. We pay a lot of attention. If we can't name them and yet we all know may repeat because he's done such an awful job. That's a bad sign. If you own a small business, you know the value of time and getrefunds.com does too. That's why they've made it easy no matter how busy you are to apply for the employee retention credit or ERC. Go to getrefunds.com to get started and in less than eight minutes see if your business qualifies for ERC. Getrefunds.com has already helped clients claim over $3 billion in payroll tax refunds through the ERC. They may be able to help your business too. There's no charge up front. They don't get paid until your business gets its refund. Many people believe they won't qualify, but they're relying on incomplete or outdated information. Don't let this pass you by. Go to getrefunds.com. Again, that's getrefunds.com. Welcome back in Clay Travis, Buck Sexton Show. I got a thesis for you. Every now and then I like to try out thesis ideas. You guys can contemplate them. You can reject them. You can agree. You can modify thesis. The most the single most important job of adulthood to a large extent is assessing risk. That is figuring out how to live your life knowing that there is danger involved. And certainly this is a huge part of being a parent, I believe, which ties in with adulthood, knowing what is out there that is a danger to you and your family, yet being able to go on about your life despite understanding those dangers. And to me, COVID has been a litmus test on this. Whether or not you were able to consider your own age and health factors and analyze your risk for COVID as a result on an individual basis and your larger family's results and everything else was to me a test of whether you could assess risk accurately or not. And Democrats failed it overwhelmingly. I was listening. I think we played a clip from Bill Maher pointing out that like 50% of Democrats believed that if they got COVID, they would go to the hospital. Yes. They didn't understand that you're probably going to get COVID and odds are you're probably going to be fine and get over it like you tend to get over a cold or you tend to get over the flu. Well, Axios has a poll up and the headline is what Americans say is the current greatest threat to US public health. Okay. What is the greatest threat to you and public health? And it gives you a lot of different topics that you can choose and but they divided it between Republicans and Democrats. And I read this and I said, okay, I'm fascinated by this. Republicans, 37% of them said that opioids and fentanyl, you know, eventually learn how to pronounce it, fentanyl were the biggest risk to public health in the United States. It's a decent answer, right? Because you could theoretically be a hundred percent healthy. You use the wrong type of fentanyl. And the next thing you know, you're dead. I mean, that that is a very real fear. I mean, you look at the number of people age 20 to 50 who are dying and and then you look at life expectancy lost as a result of that. And to think that fentanyl is a public health scourge on a scale, you know, in terms of substance abuse beyond anything we've seen is apparent and is very real. Okay. So that Democrat number two for Democrats by for Republicans, by the way, obesity. I mean, again, public health, if you are overweight, it is recognizable that you would have worse health outcome. Well, obesity is, I think you would argue correct. You could argue correctly that on just a statistical basis, because if you put under obesity, the umbrella of things that are associated with obesity, heart disease, hypertension, type two diabetes, inflammation, by the way, of all kinds of internal inflammation. Some people will will link a whole range of diseases, but most notably heart disease, the biggest killer of Americans day to day and obesity. Go hand in hand. So that's a very reasonable answer from people. So 63% of my math is right. Of people basically are saying 62% Hey, these are the things that we're most afraid of for Republicans. Democrats. Number one, and there isn't a close second. Number one, biggest threat to public health, according to Democrats, gun or firearm access. And I think this is, I mean, such a window. And by the way, cancer is 9%. Cancer is 9% on this issue. I believe cancer kills around 600,000 people a year buck. So and firearm, most people who die of firearms, unfortunately, over half is suicide. And so this idea, I think feeds into, we hear all the time about Republicans believe things that aren't true. I actually think Democrats believe way more things that aren't true because of their infatuation with the media than Republicans do. Well, this is, this is a very clear example. And you started off talking about with COVID, they use, they use exaggerated fear and, and anxiety as a political tool around certain issues. So they have convinced people, for example, that lawful gun owners are somehow a threat to them. Yes. When you look at the data, concealed carry permit holders, and I think we're about to get a constitutional carry down here, for example, in the state of Florida, concealed carry permit holders, though, are not only more law abiding than the general population. They are more law abiding per capita than law enforcement, okay, which is a pretty crazy statistic, but it's one that is often cited. And when you look at the way that people are afraid of lawful gun owners, that's completely a creation of the media for political purposes. The overwhelming majority of crimes, violent crimes that are committed are by people who are not supposed to have a gun in the first place or commit crimes, whether in the carrying of or the transport of that firearm, the straw purchase, all range of issues. But really what this is, is all an effort to create mass paranoia around lawful gun ownership so that they can push for confiscation. So they can push for what they call law abiding or a common sense gun regulation, claim more people have been you cited the statistic about suicide, via gun, which more people die via suicide than actually murder, I believe you're in and you're out with firearms. 30,000 people a year, according to the CDC, die of falling. Now generally that's older people, but more people die from a standard fall down the stairs off a roof, whatever the case may, and if they're doing roofing, then die from guns every year. But do you think that if I told the average, you know, live walking around a major US city that you are statistically in more danger of dying from a from a fall than from a gun, they would think that I'm crazy? Yes. No, they would. And I think it becomes such a huge part of how we see the world. And it was a window, COVID was into really Democrats and all their allies not being able to successfully analyze risk and live your life despite the fact that there is risk, right? Every single day that you walk outside, bad things can happen. 40,000 people a year buck on average roughly die in car accidents, yet almost every single person that will listen to us today, unless you live in a big city like New York and just don't even own a car, will at some point during the course of today, get behind the wheel and go somewhere, almost every single person listening to us. And that is because we have to understand that there comes a level of risk associated with life. And when I saw this list, the we don't talk enough about how many untrue things Democrats believe. One of the biggest is that police are killing thousands of minorities every year, right? I mean, this is a hard and fast belief by and large of Democrats. If you quiz them, how many unarmed black men are being killed by police every year? They think the answer is thousands. It's literally seven or eight and unarmed does not mean without risk, right? If you're choking someone to death, you're unarmed. If you are reaching for somebody's firearm, you are technically at that point unarmed, but they don't have an ability to understand where the risk factors actually are. And for guns and access to firearms to be the number one fear of Democrats, I think is such an intriguing window into the world that they live in. But it's intentional. This is the media that pushes this stuff and makes people think these exaggerated sense of fear they have, for example, from gun violence is meant to bring about a political outcome, which is the only way to make us safe from the dramatically elevated fear we have of general gun violence is to make him a clay. I'm picking up an AR 15. I meant to do it yesterday, but I'm actually going to do it a few days. I have to wait five days to pick up my gun. What is that? Right. What is that all about? Like in what world is that making it just annoys me? I have to go in, fill out my little form for, you know, the for the FBI background check, I have to go in and do this little little dance and then wait five days. It's just meant to recognize people that believe in the Second Amendment. How about the difference between your experience in New York City and Miami, though? I mean, you couldn't even have a gun in New York City, basically, like impossible, right? Yeah, it's completely that they make it so that it is as onerous, expensive. And it actually is even worse than just the expense and the time in a place like New York City specifically. New York State is a little bit better, but New York City, the laws are so that this has gone to the Supreme Court. So this isn't my perception. This is reality. The laws are so vague about lawful gun possession that you don't know if you are breaking the law and perhaps committing an accidental felony and they can't even tell you whether you are or not in New York City because they haven't figured it out because they want you to not know because they just don't want you to have a gun. It's virtually impossible. It is kind of fascinating just to consider that despite the fact that New York is having skyrocketing rates of crime.

On the curious case, the unusual news story of the former Biden administration, Deputy Assistant Secretary Sam Brinton, who is a self-described non-binary, non-gender, conforming individual who was fired. Can we just, I feel like we need to explain what that is every time we describe it. So this is a man who just wears clothes and makeup and everything else. And he couldn't dress like a dude one day, woman the next day. He's refusing to choose a gender basically. Correct. He's not transgender. He is effectively in between or rather gender switching. I believe not that I have deep expertise on that. If you and I in our forties are confused by all this terminology, I can't even imagine what the grandmas and grandpas who hear this language are just like, what in the world does this even mean? So cisgender we know is male female. So that's that's non-binary is not fitting into cisgender category of male female. Sam Brinton as a non-binary person, self-described would wear women's clothes and makeup and things like that. And we know that Sam Brinton is no longer with the Biden administration because he on, you know, by the I don't know. I'm being serious. And sometimes it sounds like I'm trying to does that if you're if you're non-binary, are you inherently a they now? Is that how I don't know? I don't know. I feel like that's what that's what they claim. And the problem that I always have with that beyond the the most obvious is that they is for plural for multiple people. This is confusing and and and makes no sense. Okay. Sam Brinton fired for multiple instances. You know, I just came back from a long trip. If somebody stole my bag, I would be very, very angry, right? Because especially if you're traveling, you know, now you got nothing and it's one thing when your bag is delayed. Maybe the airport gets it to you a day later, something your bag is stolen. You're you know, you're on your own, right? I mean, there's good, good luck trying to figure out. But Sam Brinton, it turns out this is up on Fox News. He stole the clothing of a female Tanzanian fashion designer. And she has said her name is Aisha Kamson. She has said that she has designed and handmade her own clothing line for years and has seen photos of Sam Brinton after her luggage was stolen, wearing proudly her specially designed clothing out and about and taking photos of of himself or they sell for whatever. And and yeah. So this I wonder, do we think that he figured out who's colloidal? That's quite a to be to be an individual who wants to steal and wear women's clothing, which he did this multiple times. So we know this was a fixation. And this is somebody who the Biden administration was touting is look at how diverse and inclusive we are. We have a we have a they in charge of nuclear waste disposal, right? That was the whole thing. For him to just happen to get a fashion designer, female fashion designer who wears very bright clothing, it feels like do you think that he kind of, you know, targeted targeted her for he's like, well, she's got she's got very interesting taste. Can we just talk about how crazy all this is? I know there are so many people out there who are just can we just be normal? Like the dude would dress up in women's clothing and appears to have had an infatuation with stealing random luggage. All the time. I mean, it appears that this is a compulsion that was taking place everywhere. I don't know if there's random though, Clay. I think this is the new wrinkle in the story. I feel like maybe he's he's like that lady really knows how to how to pull together an outfit. But here's the deal. First of all, I hate checking bags. We're going to Italy. I've never been to Italy. I can't wait. The whole family's going. We're not checking a single bag. Wow. Look at you. My wife's credit. She's the same way. The fear is you lose a bag if you're going on a week long trip. It doesn't make it to where you're going. It's infuriating. I'd rather show up as long as I have a passport or a wallet and a cell phone. I'll go buy like a $50 outfit somewhere and just where like you always find clothes, right? As long as you have a wallet, as long as you got a ability to walk into a store. I have no idea when on the rare occasion we have to check a bag. Like 90% of bags look the same, right? You have to put like a bow tie on your bag. All of them are like black or brown, it feels like. I made our most recent purchase. My wife, I said, let's just get lime green luggage. No one else will never get confused as to whether this is ours or not. Like a big lime green luggage tank. So to your point, I don't know that you could even target luggage very easily because it all looks so similar, right? Does that make sense? Like it's all like black and brown. I think this was just a compulsion and sometimes he got lucky. Not a few. Not a few were doing like a stakeout and seeing who turned in their luggage and then tried to grab it first.
