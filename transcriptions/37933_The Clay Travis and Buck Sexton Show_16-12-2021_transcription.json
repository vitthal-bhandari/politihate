    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucks X 10 show podcast Welcome back in clay Travis bucks X 10 show we are rolling into Our number two appreciate all of you hanging out with us coming a good time as we get closer and closer to the holiday season I was on Fox News this morning buck talking about this transgender swimmer issue all the NCAA Parents the parents of these pen women swimmer have written a letter Ripping the idea, but you know what's getting more attention than my opinions buck The color of the jacket that I wore what you go you I went with a like kind of a spring like a pinkish Cue jacket and I'm being attacked across the board for wearing a pastel color jacket in December Now are you someone who commits to the color of the jacket you can wear based on the time of the season? I'm just proud if I can remember to have a blazer in time for the hate usually So I I am not about to criticize anyone's fashion choices our friend will Kane said good Lord, man Is it it's not May it's December and then it's being well received across the fashion landscape I had no idea I was putting such a faux pas will is a dapper fellow though, you know, he's got high high Sartorial standard You know who doesn't have high Sartorial standards or high standards at all. I can't believe this clip is real, but like every now and then We play a clip and I just my jaw drops over how Insanely stupid it is and you know how often it is connected to either joy read on MSNBC or or joy Bayhar on the view a huge percentage of the time The two joys are Probably the dumbest people in media and that's saying something because there's a lot of dumb people in our industry But I can you think of someone who consistently says dumber things than the two of them The guy who was running for lieutenant governor of Texas the former Republican turncoat doubt He's up there. There are a few there a few Steve Schmidt on MSNBC says Stunningly stupid things, but he says it as though he's just cracked at the soreest before he comes on air to use some big words To make it sound less dumb to some people But no, I mean, I don't know joy joy Bayhar is is really I think in a class by herself, but at least she's I mean Comedians she was a comedian so like she's not necessarily known for being a political heavyweight She has kind of stumbled into whatever job she has to read with Harvard folks Did she go to Harvard joy read went to Harvard? Yeah I don't know the joy Bayhar graduated from high school. So the joy read stupidity is far more disappointing All right, so I want you to listen to this argument So you guys know because we talked about it and hopefully you saw it Elon Musk I don't agree with everything associated with his relationship with China That's pretty much the only thing I can point to with Elon Musk that I'm like Hey, and I don't expect for every public figure to agree with me on everything So I'm not one of those people who's like I've got a litmus test And if you don't agree with 10 out of 10 things with me I can't appreciate you now I like most of what I see Elon Musk doing and saying I love that he's a capitalist I love that he's a warrior for free speech that he's willing to stand up to the stupid Indefinsibly absurd Rules and policies Associated with different identities that are out there. I love that he attacks cancel culture So he's been going after it with Elizabeth Warren before that he was going after it with Bernie Sanders So joy read decided that she needed to defend Elizabeth Warren and this is the clip that was on her show last night listen to this You know wasn't happy so we do what he always did and stop his little feet and insult at Senator Warren Calling her an angry mob and referring to her as Senator Karen So for so many reasons being a freeloader and a selfish and disrespectful one and from this appropriating black vernacular from his agnostic purposes Elon Musk is the absolute worst Meanwhile Senator Warren has better things to do than fight with junior bird man on Twitter Okay, Elon Musk is the richest man on the planet because he's really smart Okay, so so the notion that he's his wealth out of nothing Yeah, get rich because his dad had money or his family had money like he is the ultimate capitalist in the entire world So that that's interesting But the other part of it that I think some people would have said huh? So there's term Karen which I actually people use it and I might even use it sometimes I I don't really like it. I think it is it is a term used to disparage white women right so sometimes so he you know But but sometimes it seems pretty appropriate I get it It's for the person who calls the manager unnecessarily and is complaining and being difficult about somebody But there's some tones there's some aspects of it that I don't really I find a little troubling Put that aside for a second We're not allowed to use the term Karen now I mean I just we're no it is a term of disparagement by Joy Reid's own admission here for white women but because she says it comes out of the African American vernacular So the black people create the Karen insult is that which I guess that's what she said But so now But you know now I or you or Elon Musk can't say there were I mean look It's so stupid that I think we spent too much time well on his but Cultural appropriation in general is stupid right dumb I drink cultures appropriate. Yes every you and I drink coffee It came from Ethiopia the internet was invented in America, right? Basically The democracy came out of Greece and Rome. We have rugs because of Genghis Khan clay We could do this all day, right? So the goal the entire goal of civilization is to appropriate good things right that is how civilization advances Oh, your thing is better than mine. Oh, I'm going to take this but here's what's kind of funny first of all She's defending Elizabeth Warren who? appropriated being a native American and Actually claimed that she was a native American for purposes of getting her own job Which is why I think of all the insults that Trump ever made up Pocahontas is one that legitimately makes me smile every time I see it apply She is a liar and then she released her own DNA test remember buck and it showed like she was like one 1800 of a native American I will have to know that that that I I made fun of CNN Because when they did this initially CNN was like Elizabeth Warren Proves her native American heritage. They were going with it. They were trying they were a part of it They're like wow Elizabeth Warren coming out swinging with 1.4% Native American It was it was tiny but it was 0.0. Well whatever it might have been it was it was like everybody you and I have more Yeah, literally I think I've seen a native American heritage, but CNN's a comm shop came after all of all You probably were watching us. No, it's watching you guys just a bunch of idiots But Elizabeth Warren is a little upset with Elon You can tell because they're not look they're not used to somebody who has such a big following on his own that the mainstream media can Protect from that person right you on can get the way that Trump could in some ways Elon can too because so many people want to hear What he has to say so Warren's a little upset about it the world's richest freeloader Evidently has a very thin skin But you know the part that really makes me angry about this. It's on behalf of every public school teacher every waitress every computer programmer who actually paid taxes that means they paid more than Elon Musk did But the days when these guys not only get to rake it all in But then rub everybody else's nose in it Well, they head off into outer space and declare how they did this all on their own when they were subsidized by the federal government and subsidized by Every waitress and by every public school teacher who paid their taxes. This is wrong. Yeah every waitress across the country He was listening to show it and I was saying Elon didn't send spaceships out there because of my extra tips. Okay, like Elizabeth Warren is being Such a demagogue everybody knows this is Marxist class warfare crap and by the way She's worth about 12 to 15 million. I think something like that herself She was seeing on a private jet clay yesterday Yeah, and here's the thing if I could point towards anybody in the public eye right now and say I hope my kids could grow up Like this guy Elon Musk would be at the top of the list, right? He created think about how amazing this guy is He decided hey, you know what I want to send rocket ships to space I think I can do a better job of it than NASA and he did He said hey, you know what I want to reinvent the car So that we're not reliant on as on oil, right? So in theory we could create more energy Independence and he did it and oh by the way on the joy read attack Elon Musk is an immigrant from South Africa So he's actually unlike her 100% an African American he was born in Africa and now he lives in America He is an African American So I'm not even sure that she could accuse him of cultural misappropriation since unlike her He's actually an African American in Africa now in America and you know what his sin is of course There are all these there all these lib billionaires a lot of them are people that have made money through financial services And people like Soros who made his money through a lot of currency speculation and often on the misery of other countries having their currencies devalued over the years There are people that do that but as long as they support the right causes they remain untouched by all this right Jeff Bezos buys the Washington Post so Jeff Bezos gets left alone by the whole media also because he obviously buys his ink By the barrel and has it delivered by drone to your front door So people tend to leave him alone because Elon believes in capitalism and also Because he has been along with you and me Questioning all this stupid so remember when you know six feet of social distancing was the the mantra that was going to save us all Now we all know it's completely arbitrary and moronic all the mats stuff suddenly We discovered mats can stop all respiratory on this if we only wear them for not true. He knew that So he's been questioning that apparatus too So so he's a he's a target for the Marxist nonsense and other billionaires Of course who write checks to das who let criminals out to go beat old ladies with lead pipes and not get punished They don't get this treatment from from Elizabeth Warren. I wonder why? Yeah, and credit to rush to for folkahontis which was a play on Pocahontas and then One of the funniest tweets the dub just sent this to me from again I legitimately sometimes the insults land and I thought Trump on Elizabeth Warren landed really well He put up a new campaign slogan for her remember It said Warren one slash the fraction 2020 to make fun of the fact that her percentage of being a Native American that she ran with that I mean that was a amazing Appropriate it we have to remind people of this because Otherwise the media will do a whitewash of all of it. She leveraged our Racial entitlement system of affirmative action in this country and that is what it has been called in Supreme Court Decisions She leveraged that as a fraud to get hired at places as a law professor Where she absolutely would not have been hired otherwise So she gained the racial entitlement system to her benefit Yes, and elevated herself professionally and now turns around and wants to pretend that she's you know A friend to truckers and waitresses. Yeah sure she is she sent in a recipe to a Native American Pow wow chow pow wow Wow Awesome, that's one of the most amazing and cited her cheekbones as evidence of the fact that she was a Native American I mean this is I mean the fact that she's sorry the fact that she's sitting a recipe called How chow I think that was the name of the book, but yes, oh pow wow chow. Yeah, okay, but I mean it's still pretty funny Right? The this is that she would be in any way defended by somebody's citing appropriation by anyone Is beyond it saying I mean remember when Rachel Dole is all buck the NAACP white woman who claimed that she was black When Rachel Dole is all claimed a heritage that she didn't actually have She got canceled people are like oh my god. How dare you pretend to be black Elizabeth Warren did an entire career benefited off of it by she's running for president by science and biology race is actually much more of a mixed and variable Categorization right race is actually largely an artificial categorization because you have people who are you know Multiracial by racial that's all reality that we're all living with every day and it's you know, that's the way things are great Sex gender is actually a physical binary reality But you can change that according to left But if you try to play that look I've been saying for well You know how you bring down the affirmative action system for college admissions You just have ever you just have every kid who thinks this is garbage because it is Apply as something that will advantage them just over doing a linsky style Overwhelming of the system of racial entitlement then they would actually cause some real problems because you know what forced them To do clay say your skin is not actually the right color for that designation that you claim Which starts to sound pretty darn creepy to folks, right? That sounds pretty Also, we got a big Supreme Court case a dealing with Harvard admissions Associated with Asian applicants that could also blow up our Noxious Rachel politics because as we talked about a little bit yesterday Asians are as you said white adjacent. They're not considered to be minorities because they're too successful Right now and that's what the left says. I think that's right. That's what that's what their argument is for why they should be treated Differently when it comes to Harvard applications and everything else.

They're absolutely correct. Welcome back to clay and buck show And he keeps taking actions to Defend people as parents People's rights to have their children instructed in a way that isn't keeping with a well Shane view of America and the world around them clay. I gotta tell you governor Santis It's like it's like he was created in a lab of conservatism to save the state of Florida I think this is honestly we talk a lot about what the legacy of Trump is going to be I Think the legacy of Trump is going to be he hasn't boldened a lot of younger politicians to say Gotta be careful here Effort and just say exactly what they think as opposed to worrying about what the media might say in response And that there is a massive number of people out there that will have your back because how many times did they say oh Trump said this? He's done as a political figure they couldn't cancel him and I think he's emboldened a generation of Republicans to be advocating for what they believe and DeSantis is one of the first to take that mantle up mortgage rates are continuing to remain incredibly low right now Will they stay there for the new year? Not necessarily because the Fed is talking about raising rates Which is why you need to go ahead and lock in an incredibly low rate while you can an American financing All you need to do is give them a call.

Maybe you're gonna be driving I know I've been in that situation a lot you got loud kids in the back and you're like man I just want to listen to something to So I don't have to hear all the fights that are going on behind me as we travel for the holidays Go download the podcast you can scroll through pick out anything you want you be able to listen to it, but one thing that nobody's talking about this transgender swimmer issue and Some of you know that we have talked about this story a decent amount and the reason why I love it is Because it brings to the forefront Identity politics and the failure of identity politics as a reliable and reasonable and rational political philosophy Because you have hardcore feminist women's athlete spokespeople Title nine adherence who believe that women and I'm one of these people are the equal of men and that they deserve the right to Compete at the highest possible level against other women and then you have transgender activists who believe that men Can decide to become women and set all-time women's records and that they should be applauded for this and you can't be both You have to pick a side and these are two Theoretically left-wing groups. I'm a hundred percent confident in picking my side I'm on the favor of biological women being able to compete against biological women And so are the vast majority of Democrats Republicans Independence anyone who cares about sports competition in this country I am one of the only people and out kick is one of the only media sites that will even cover this story buck The parents of these you pen swimmers probably many of them liberal Certainly many of them if you look at the overall breakdown of you pen probably from wealthy northeastern communities They have written a letter now to the NCAA saying this is wrong and all these people in sports media who have said oh We've got to speak out. We've got to talk about the intersection of sports and politics. They're all silent They're pretending ESPN buck. They gave Caitlyn Jenner the SP for courage for becoming a woman They haven't even covered this story at all. There's not one ESPN article about this direct threat to women's athletics And this is why when we had Abigail Shrier on I asked her that question About the machinery and the apparatus and who really pushes for this because it's fascinating You won't see there are so many people who will go along with this But they won't as an individual in public stand up and say this makes sense This is a good idea But what you do have are the massively influential but nameless fate well Faceless they have named companies of course, but no one individual reminds me of my dad He's belonged to a a long time ago a hunting club, right? You go shoot birds there was really one guy who ran the whole place and he used to sign every every Pronouncement, you know if it was that you had to wear, you know blue shirts on Tuesday Everything was signed the committee, but he was the committee. There was no other committee, right? Yeah, but what do you do when you when you you can't go up against the committee? You have HR departments you have college admissions offices you have corporate now at the very top level Executives who will put forward this guidance about the trans issue and obviously universities all the university administrators We'll get on board with this But it always comes as part of the collective Individuals will not make this argument play because they know they would be Humiliated because it is so clearly wrong and so clearly stupid So they have to hide behind the committee if you will or the collective I put up a poll buck because I was just curious We know Twitter is extremely left-leaning and that it's Overwhelmingly filled with blue checkmark brigade members who are running around trying to defend the transgender community or whatever A pressed group of the moment that they have decided is being Disrespected and I just asked a simple question, right? Do you believe a biological male athlete should be able to compete in women's sports if he decides to change his gender tool woman? Okay, simple question Over 20,000 people voted so far in the first couple of hours And if you want to vote in this you can go find me on Twitter at clay Travis scroll down buck 98% of people said no 98% you know how hard it is to get 98% of people to agree on anything under the Sun right now Yet almost no one will even discuss this so I started tagging people right Megan Rapinoe She's always talking about women's she's so brave because she wouldn't go to the White House Women soccer player won't talk about it. Jamel Hill remember Jamel Hill said Donald Trump was a white supremacist She won't talk about it Pat 40 who's a big sports illustrator writer his daughter to her credit is actually a women's Olympic swimmer she made the Olympic team if men are able to be made female swimmers She wouldn't make the Olympic team he tweets about women's women swimming all the time He won't comment on it. Oh ESPN as I said buck hasn't even written a single story about this case It is Unbelievable it's a conspiracy of silence because this is buck for a long time. They said oh this is never gonna That's why that that's why they have to never be an issue They have to be quiet because the way that they tried to shut down people like you and me who for years I've been talking about the trans issue for years saying things like get ready for them in the bathrooms get ready for transgender individuals competing in women's sports get ready for transgender individuals in female prisons, which is also Scary because that's a safety issue and you've got you kind of imagine if you're a guy who's facing life in prison You'd probably rather be in the woman's prison wouldn't you right and and now what what are the standards for this? And all you've got to say some things to the prison shrink. This is happening These are all things that are occurring now, but if the people that are now That that had been saying it'll never happen if they come out in favor of it Then they're caught because we can point to you said this was never going to happen and clearly you were full of it Which has been true? This is the incrementalism that the Democrats use to fight the culture wars all the time in fact They'll call you bigoted for even raising what we all know will eventually happen and then when it happens They pretend like it didn't it's effectively gaslighting on a massive scale. It is remarkable though that of all the women in Sports media for example. Yeah, they're not going to come forward and stand up for women's sports Women's sports are actually at risk here as a serious endeavor. That is the reality of what is under what? What is the point of trying to be the best in your league the best in the NCAA the best in the world if a guy Can come in and beat you I'm ever years ago. You should do CrossFit play you'd see the men's you know There are guys going in there with you know, I'm not speaking for personally But you know, they got like 20 or 30 extra pounds around the belly and there are women who are clear physical specimens I mean working out every day the chubby guy sitting behind a desk has a higher bench press than the women We all see this its reality around us all the time pound for pound my wife is a much better athlete than me She's also five foot two a hundred and five pounds like the idea that we should be competing in a sprint when I'm six foot 180 ish I say 180 ish because it's kind of the holidays and I'm not sure exactly what I weigh right now, but The idea is crazy everybody out there understands it and buck. It's not even just male versus female We decide for instance in boxing or or UFC or whatever we have weight classes in high school We have different standards for state championships because the school that has Students shouldn't be able to be judged against the school that has 300 This is a big part of fairness and athletics We have all different sorts of weight classes all different sorts of designations when it comes to what schools Public versus private some schools give scholarships and they don't I Big colleges small I wrote in college happened all the time I wrote in college would have been great if I could have wrote as a lightweight I would have been a kick-ass lightweight. I was a heavyweight in college. So here's the deal buck. I suck at golf I love to golf. I don't get to do it as much since I had kids if I got to play from the women tees I would be pretty damn good at golf if I got to take 200 yards off of some of the holes I'd be getting a lot more birdies. It would be ridiculous Like if you and your buddies are playing I mean it's kind of funny and ridiculous But it points the absurdity and you walked up and you were like today I'm feeling like a chick and you just played from the red tees the whole day and you crushed your buddies They would they wouldn't allow you to do it first of all because it's the very essence of competition You almost think the only way this goes away is you know in a USTA tennis, right? There's the challenge there's the challenger matches beforehand. You can get into this pretty easily They can have the man who's you know number 250 in the world Compete as a woman for the US Open tennis championship if he wins I think he gets four five million dollars With someone willing to do that are you willing to pretend you're a woman for a week for four or five million dollars? I think a lot of people the answer would be well not a lot But some people answer would be yes Almost on some level where someone just needs to change their gender for purposes of dominating a sport That's what I mean. Yeah, but but make that candid choice and and and not even say it publicly initially dominate And then say hey, this is the reality of what happens in the larger scale in the meantime look Tommy John lounge where is Incredible buck a lot of people holiday season want to sit around the house you hanging out with your family You want to be comfortable when your loved ones start the day wearing Tommy John? They're that much more comfortable so they can do everything better Tommy John lounge where soft tri blend micro modal fabrics You will absolutely love the four-way stretch extraordinarily comfortable and fits well 17 million pair sold the gift of Tommy John underwear and lounge where has become a holiday tradition for families all across The country which is why but Tommy John doesn't have customers. They have fanatics and we're probably two of them How do people get hooked up? I just place my order for Christmas because I need more this stuff and getting for members of my family I absolutely love my Tommy John. I wear this stuff every day get $20 off site wide. That's that's right $20 off site wide right now at Tommy John comm slash buck That's Tommy John comm slash buck for $20 off order by December 21st to get it in time for Christmas Tommy John comm slash buck seasight for details Thanks for rolling with us today on the clay and bucks show in the third hour We're gonna have our friend cat Tim from Fox news with us. So stick around for that We've also got more updates for you on COVID right now the caseload going way up Possibility of shutdowns reductions and capacity happening in certain places in Canada Reducing and its boarding events bring up to speed on all of that coming up here in just a few minutes We've got a lot of calls lines lit here 800-282-282 Gene in Louisiana wants to weigh in gene great to have you Here's the thing with this African American culture appropriation thing It's so stupid because she's gonna say something about he's a line is Appropriating some culture if that's the case then how is it that she didn't say anything about all these other Quarter quote Caucasians or social media care. I mean that's stupid. It's right. You're saying It's a good point you're saying people use the term care and all over the place But Elon gets called out for using the term Karen. It's absurd And also yeah, thanks for the call and also I would say this not even she said he appropriated She also said it was misogynistic. It's not misogynistic to attack a woman that attacks you first Like that's called treating people equally. I get fired up when look Elizabeth Warren picked this fight, right? She accused Elon Musk of not paying taxes He fired back and said actually I'm gonna pay one of the biggest tax bills in the history of the country this year The reason he hadn't paid big taxes by the way because he hadn't sold his stock by and large in Tesla Which has taken on up in a big way, but then when somebody fires back at you You can't curl up in the fetal position and be like oh, it's misogynistic. Why is he attacking me? You came after him. He's allowed to return fire it. You mean imagine you are just just everyone take take a moment here Imagine you are the self-made richest person on planet Earth from building Unbelievable company and immigrant and immigrant to America don't need a yeah, no trust fund none of that stuff and You build a company that is changing the world possibly multiple companies multiple companies I'm thinking of Tesla. Yeah, but multiple companies and SpaceX and you're being called a freeloader by a woman who pretended to be a native American so she could get a teaching job at a university that Otherwise would have wanted nothing to do with her just based on her not fancy previous degrees Which is the reality of law school professorships. So yeah, I think you'd be pretty annoyed to everybody I think you'd be like who is this clown and we should mention this to buck several of you sent this to us in addition to claiming falsely to be Native American As Elizabeth Warren did she also then submitted a recipe to a book called powwow Chow which was supposed to be Native American food and she stole the recipe from someone else She plagiarized her Native American recipe that she sent in the whole thing was amazing And just if you ever want to real laugh go back to the initial Two or three hours of coverage when she released her DNA results and the media because there's such lap dogs And they're so pathetic tried to spin it as vindication vindication for a lazy Warren, you know, I mean it was It was amazing Stephen in Pennsylvania's got some thoughts on this. Hey Stephen Clay and Bach, thank you for doing what you do every day. Thank you for listening I I Gotta say this about Elizabeth Warren She should be ashamed of herself She should crawl back into whatever holes she came out of it's it's horrible My my wife God rest her soul was Cherokee She was not She on a form. Yes, she put down Native American, but she always said she was Cherokee Yeah, look it was important it was important to her because Well, you know like everybody Yeah, look if someone's celebrating their heritage is something that we would always celebrate here Elizabeth Warren was lying about heritage to advance herself professionally. Thanks for calling in Stephen Dan in Savannah, Georgia I love I love Savannah. I haven't been down in Savannah too long. I gotta go out on weekend in Savannah, Georgia. Great town I'm a great man Savannah's beautiful. Hey, I just like to the point I wanted to mention, you know how we're seeing history being rewritten right before our eyes with these Democrats coming out In San Francisco against crime and where did it come from? And you know, this is BS and everything We need to remember their words We need to get clips of their words before they make them disappear and my point to it is Nancy Pelosi would occupy Wall Street when she was asked about them. She said bless their little hearts So her question is to where did this lawlessness come from that came from her as the leader of the Democrat party back then? She she was the top dog her and Obama And so, you know, I I think we need to stay focused on what they're gonna do for 2022 And it's going to be they're going to become the party of law And we're gonna be the ones that are just hating on people We need to really watch what they're doing here. This isn't them cow-towing or saying, oh, we were wrong This is a strategy. Well, they are moving and you're right Dan. They're moving toward thanks for calling in from Savannah uh, they're moving toward a more realistic view of how to deal with crime because you know in San Francisco right now people leave open their trunks So that cars don't get broken into that's how that's how sad it has gotten in San Francisco now We'll talk about the democrats pivot on crime and how we're not going to let them get away With what they did up to this point. We're going to hold them to account big hour three coming your way You're listening to clay travis and bucks exes on the eib network You"
