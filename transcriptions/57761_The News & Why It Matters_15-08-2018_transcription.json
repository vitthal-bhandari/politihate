    "text": " The Blaze Radio Network On Demand Why is this so important? Why did you pick the story? Why does this matter? This is the news. And why? Why? Why? And why it matters. Hi, I'm Sarah Gonzalez. Welcome to the news and why it matters. Glenn, what was the top story for you? I'd have to go to Vermont for the top story. And it's not for any reason that anybody thinks. Oh! Wait, can I tell you what my top story is? We have Ben Shapiro and Jeremy Boring here from The Daily Wire today. Oh, yeah, very good. That is not a good top story. The ratings just took it back. Alright, go ahead, Stowe. I really like cake. So I will go with the Masterpiece Cake Shop developments. Okay, alright, Ben. I'll go with Andrew Cuomo taking the title of this week as the stupidest Cuomo brother saying that his name... It was hard. It was hard. I mean, Chris really made it. It was neck and neck and then Andrew just pulled ahead at the end. He got really jealous. And he decided that America was never great. So that's going to be the new Democratic slogan. Good luck with that, guys. I think that the big story for me is this... Is there a tape of Donald Trump proving that he's even worse than everybody already knows that he is? And I would say because that's the one story that could change a presidential election? Yeah. You know, in any year besides 2020, at which point it'll mean nothing. Right, exactly. Okay, before we get into all of that, I want to take an opportunity to thank our podcast and TV sponsor, Ministalgia. So I have tried several of the Ministalgia products. Is this the beer jelly? Yes, this is the beer jelly. Okay, when I say to you guys, beer jelly, does that sound appetizing at all? No? Right? No. No. No. No. Do you drink beer? Yes. Yeah, okay. So does it sound appetizing? Smell it. Yeah. And I have a little sample on track right? And I have this. It is su... It's like... Shut up. It smells like beer, right? Smells like beer? Smells like beer. Alright. That's... It don't mind me not watching you guys, Ollie. Yeah. I don't worry about it. It's fine. It smells. It's fine. It just smells it. Isn't that good? Oh my God. So, yes, it's totally different. So they have the beer jellies, they have, of course, the wild rice mix, and they have waffle mixes as well. They came to the studio and they made all these different varieties of waffles. I took home the chocolate and my son just devoured them, and they're healthy too. They're really strong. So I felt good about giving it to him. Yeah, I didn't care about that. It should be clear. I didn't care if it was healthy. You didn't care if it was healthy, but it's tasty. Anyone author who cares if it's healthy, is healthy and it's delicious. What company do you want on this side of the table? Okay. Well, so you can save 10% on their sampler packs by using promo code TRY10 at blaizewildrice.com. It's over by, you know, over by. Yeah, you want some more? Okay, so just in case you want some during the show. You're right. Alright, Glenn, your top story. Okay, so I'm just going to play the audio in the video. And I think it speaks for itself. We'll take it from there. Watch. Do you support capitalism? I, you know, well, obviously the long history of measuring ourselves by increasing of roast domestic product is a flawed measure because that just encourages consumption. And we can see what consumption is doing to our world. Can we stop it there for a second? I want to come back to it. I want to come back to hear her thoughts on socialism. But does anybody have anything to say at this point? I wouldn't dare. Ben. That the, if, if your critique of the GDP statistic is that it encourages consumption, then you should be critical of Keynesianism because all of the growth from basically 1940 to 1970 is based on government expenditures that are baked into the GDP growth statistics. So it's actually a case for capitalism, not the opposite. Yeah, and I'll say quite clearly the, the answer to the question was that they do not like capitalism. And I use they very specifically. They do not like capitalism. There's only one person that was answering. Yeah, that's only one person. Oh, really? Okay, go ahead. Roll the, roll the rest of the answer here. Again, I know you don't like labels. And this poll didn't ask people to choose between capitalism and socialism. But when faced with a choice between the two, it does sound like you look more favorably, again, the labels you have an issue with on the ideas behind socialism. Well, yes, and I'm not sure I even know what socialism is. So, so, so I just don't have the background to answer that question. I don't care if it was, there's only five people in Vermont or, you know, a million five. I don't know. I don't care. But half of them voted for this individual to be running for a governor. Now, at any other point in my 40 years of broadcast, I'd have a lot to say about that. This is the big story of the day because I haven't heard anyone state anything other than, what was that point on the GDP? Not a word. The fundamental transformation of scaring people out of their animal person, you know, the regular observational, hey, there's something more to that video. Yeah. Is complete. That is terrifying. That is terrifying. Yeah. Ben, what are your thoughts? I mean, I think that's totally right, obviously. The word socialism no longer has the sort of immediate shock value that it used to. And you see that there's that whole of Democrats that said they're more favorable towards socialism than capitalism because now they think socialism is what Norway does, even though Norway will tell you socialism is not what Norway does. They've decided that they are going to rebrand capitalism as socialism so long as there's a capitalist country like Denmark or Switzerland that has some redistribution as programs stacked on top of the capitalist space. Capitalism is capitalism with a welfare state. Right, exactly, which it absolutely is not. And so long as they can get away with that, as long as no one's calling them on it, so long as you have an idiot like that anchor who basically says, well, I'm not going to ask you to define any of your terms or explain why you like socialism better than capitalism, I'm just going to let you get away with anything. Then people will say, oh, well, it sounds so nice again. It sounds nice and cozy. But also to the extent that you're talking to a transgendered politician, you can't ask them about definitions of any kind of concept. Right. I can't act like labels at all. I don't like labels. I guarantee if you called her the wrong gender, the labels would become very important in the conversation. It would be the only thing anybody was talking about. Yeah. So let's move on to the masterpiece, Cake Shop Development. Yes. They are just harassing this guy. I mean, you know, Jack Phillips is a guy. He had to deal with years of turmoil over whether he's going to bake a cake for a gay wedding or not. He goes all the way to the Supreme Court, wins the Supreme Court ruling. And, you know, we talked about this a lot at the time. The ruling did not have the scope that I wished it did. It was very, it was way too limited. Thank you for listening. I at least took out of that day that at least Jack is going to be all right. At least he won his thing. At least that case was resolved. Well, apparently not. Someone came in and wanted to get a gender transition cake, which of course he decided as he was consistent of all the way to the, you know, not making cakes for a holiday. Not making cakes for Halloween. He's so consistent with his religious values. Decides not to make it. And now the Civil Rights Commission in Colorado are harassing him again and trying to rip his life apart. So, I mean, the way I read that Supreme Court decision was practically guys wink, wink, nod, nod. You did this wrong. Go try this again. Exactly. That's exactly right. If you read Kennedy's writing in that case, he specifically says this is not really deciding whether if you did this the right way, it would work or not. He said you're not allowed to be openly discriminatory toward somebody while you're telling them not to practice their religion in the workplace, but so long as you're covertly discriminatory in your assessment of the situation, then it's totally fine. I mean, frankly, I've always been puzzled as to why these are freedom of religion cases and not freedom of association cases in the first place. I do not understand why, and I think it's a mistake, frankly, for the religious community to say, well, this is about me practicing my religion in the workplace because then it makes it sound like I get to discriminate against people because I'm religious. As opposed to if I weren't religious, I wouldn't get to discriminate against people. When the real answer is, if it's a private business, you should be able to do whatever the hell you want. And it shouldn't matter whether you're secular or whether you're a religious person. And as a deeply religious person whom this will affect, you know, I think that the more important value here is freedom of the speech and association, then freedom of religion per se. Please explain to me. I've asked people this all week. Wait a minute. Hang on just a second. I can't hire an all-white staff because the 14th Amendment. Okay. You would want to hire an all-white staff. You're not saying that. You cannot do it because the government says it's not constitutional. You can't do it. We have standards. Yada, yada, yada. However, I can kick Alex Jones off on every platform. I can kick anybody I want off on this platform because it's my private business. I do that. And not even be clear on the rules. Here's a guy who's clear. These are my standards. These are my standards. This is my business. And we can't do it because somehow or another, the Constitution says that he can't do that. That doesn't make any sense at all. Well, the idea that any of this fits within the purview of the First Amendment, you know, as moved to the States through the 14th, is just, from a legal perspective, it's completely asinine. If you really think that the founders were sitting around going, yeah, we have to force religious people in their businesses to violate the religion on behalf of same-sex weddings. I'm sure that's what Madison was sitting around thinking about. That was definitely in his mind. Or any person. I mean, the right to be a jerk is as much a right as anything else, right? You know, the original language, I mean, you know, in all their writings earlier, it's all right to conscience. That's right. It's right to conscience. Conscience, conscience. It's not religion, which this makes religion look bigoted. Right. It's my right to conscience. It bothers me for whatever reason I want to say it bothers me. I don't have to participate in a group sport. Well, this is the invisible hand. Also, can weigh in on this and be true to its conscience, right? But this is where the demagoguery of politics is so dangerous, because what you get is you say, okay, well, I think this person should be able to do whatever they want with their business. And then somebody on the other side says, well, so you don't like black people. Okay, so you don't like gay people. That's why you want businesses to really be able to do what they want, because isn't that what we're talking about here? And then they go back to the Civil Rights Act, and they go to the specific provisions of the Civil Rights Act dealing with private businesses, which, by the way, I think that there's a good case that they're unconstitutional. The provisions dealing with private businesses is one thing to say in the Civil Rights Act that states cannot segregate. It's another thing to say that private businesses are to be told by the government how to handle their business. I know it's an unpopular viewpoint, even on large parts of the right, because it's uncomfortable. But the bottom line is either you have a right to run your business as you see fit and then take the consequences of that in the market, or you don't. There's a coffee cafe. I think it's coffee cup cafe, but strangely they spell it all with Ks. It's here in Texas, okay? We all know what that means. I don't want to be around those people. I would never go to that store. I despise what they stand for. You want to be those bigots? Be those bigots. Yeah, that's right. You know what I mean? I don't understand why we all have to force each other to be exactly alike. Well, government involvement is what creates these particular kinds of problems. I might have a little bit of a libertarian streak. I think libertarianism is mith is to the extent that it's a utopianist view, right? But to the extent that they're touching on the idea that government shouldn't use coercion in order to force these sort of values down people's throats, I think they're right. We see the opposite version of the same problem with Twitter banning Alex Jones or Gavin McGinnis or other people because many people want to defend Twitter's right to do that by saying that they're a private business. Don't you think it's a private business? They have the right to do what they want. The problem, of course, they're not exactly a private business. They're publicly traded companies that should have some sort of obligations to the people who own shares. But beyond that, those Silicon Valley companies actually sought protection from the government from being regulated as publishers. Based on the idea that they would be open platforms for political discourse. In other words, they said, as part of getting Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act through, they basically said, we won't have a political editorial voice. Right. Therefore, don't hold. That's right. You can't hold us if you're trading child molestry. You know, you're trading information for child molestry. You can't hold us responsible. Because you're a public opening platform. We're an open platform. That's right. So you wind up in this situation where, because people don't understand how government gets involved and corrupts these systems, it seems like we're being hypocritical on these issues. I'm not. I don't think that there should be special protections for Twitter in the first place. If there are special protections for Twitter, there should be special protections for the people on Twitter. That does a real problem too with the government forcing speech. I mean, yes. Like, yes, the words he's writing are delicious in this particular instance. But again, you're asking someone to write words they don't want to write. You just had another ruling about that. You can't compel even professional speech. And to see someone being forced to perform an artistic, his artistic talent, as well as just writing words down that he doesn't want to write, it's ridiculous. And beyond that... It shows a tremendous faith in the power of government to keep the population quiescent is the truth. Because if there are people like to talk about these kind of apocalyptic scenarios with America and how it will break into civil war, you actually want to get to the point where people start taking out guns. When you go to their private schools and tell them what they can teach their kids, or you go to their house and you say, well, you know what, you can't comb school anymore because you're not teaching us what we want your kids, what we want you to teach them. Or we're going to go into your church and we're going to tell your church that you must perform the same sex marriage because otherwise you are discriminatory. It's going to come to guns a lot faster than anybody thinks it's going to. If they start cracking down on people's quote unquote private expression of their religion, there's not a religious person who has ever lived who believes that their religion ends at the front door of their house or at the doorway of their church. So tell me how silencing voices doesn't make every crazy conspiracy theory that Alex Jones has ever spewed, look to his audience as, see, they did it, they're cracking down on them, they're silencing him. It's the big state, it's the deep state that silencing him. That only makes things worse when, I mean, why is Louis Farrakhan accepted by all the journalists and everything? Because we've always known you make him into a martyr. That's right. You let the people speak. Why is it okay with Farrakhan and not with Alex Jones? Why can the left tell me I must say these things because I'm a hater and tell this guy, that they have to, they have, he has to make this cake. At what point does it become persecution? It's persecution. It's persecution when the left disagrees with it. That's the point. Right. Great point. Let's play a game of which Cuomo brother is the dumbest when we come back. I can't solve that now. I know. It's really tough. It's awesome. Hey, it's Glenn. And if you like what you hear on the program, you should check out Pat Gray Unleashed. His podcast is available wherever you download your favorite podcast. This is the news. And why, why? Why? Why it matters. Ben, those Cuomo jeans. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you heard a trip. You can see the water. There's something going on there because between Chris Cuomo and Andrew Cuomo, it was a week. I mean, you had Chris Cuomo out there defending Antifa and saying Antifa was actually wonderful. It's just like the soldiers storming the beaches at Normandy, losers who sit in their parents' basements until they go out and shout out cops and throw bottles at them. Same exact thing. And then to surpass him, it is a running gun battle between the two brothers for supremacy of stupidity. Then Andrew gets up at a dinner and he says that America is not great again. What she has to do, he says America was never great. He has to do that because he's running against Cynthia Nixon in a primary. And Cynthia Nixon is going to outflank him. She'll lose. But she'll do damage to him. She'll win 30, 35% of the vote in New York because people are dumb. And people are dumb. They're so dumb that they think this guy is good at politics. Watch this clip. We're not going to make America great again. It was never that great. We have not reached greatness. We will reach greatness. When every American is fully engaged, we will reach greatness when discrimination and stereotyping against women, 51% of our population is gone. And every woman's full potential is realized and unleashed. And every woman is making her full contribution. Even. Even. I do love that the same guy who always talks about tolerance and non-stereotyping. You remember a couple of years ago, he said conservatives just get out of his state. Oh yeah. He's a real toleranceor. But I do love when he says things like America was never great and will only be great again when everything is perfect. It depends on what your standard of great is. No one is arguing that America hasn't had flaws at any given point in time and doesn't have flaws today. Because that would be idiotic. It's a place filled with human beings. Human beings kind of suck. And so we created the best system possible to handle the suckage of human beings and hopefully instill virtue in those human beings at a higher level than other societies. Great. But if you're comparing America to some utopian society that has never existed and will never exist until we are all dead and either in heaven or hell, then I don't know what he's even talking about. Plus, that's going to be his campaign. He's going to go out there and he's going to be, Trump will be out there shouting we need to keep America great or whatever his next slogan is going to be. Cuomo will be out there shouting no we're never that great at World War II. Not that great. World War I, not that great. Fighting to free the slaves. Not that great ending communism. Not that great. Curing the world poverty. Not that great. Supporting the entire burden of virtually every problem in human history. Not that great. But yeah, but I mean other than all of those things. And also how great is this country that his dad got to be mayor and then he gets to be governor of New York and his brother gets to be on CNN and none of the three had a brain between him. That's an amazing thing. That's amazing opportunity. Maybe a case, maybe a point in his favor. Oh, that one. Maybe we weren't that great of those three. Good to be after that. Great societies is not going to be designated by when everybody is engaged. Like the great thing about America is we have incredible freedom to be as disengaged as we want to be. Hang on just a second. Wasn't it Nancy Pelosi is one of the sales points for health care that hey you can have free health care so you go paint and do nothing. Right. No more job. It reminded me of that whenever you talked about comparing it to utopian society because I think that that's what we did with Obamacare was that we were like, oh no, our health care sucks. We need to change all these things. We need to fix it. Not realizing we still have the best health insurance, the best system in the world. You can't fix every single problem. There's always going to be problems. It's almost who wasn't in any system. Who wasn't that said the poor will be always be with you? Oh, it's Jesus. It was Jesus that said that. He's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, I don't want to be. He's going to mine but then one of you. Right. If Jesus was saying, hey, by the way, it's always gonna be your ____. I don't think Cuomo's gonna fix it. I have this argument with our friend Andrew Klaben all the time because he says, you know, things aren't that bad in America. It's not as divided as you think it is. People are relatively happy. People are relatively wealthy. I mean, America's defeated war disease poverty and death. So you know, I don't think the tension that you're observing is as bad as you think it is. respond to it by saying i i think that it's it's a privilege afforded the nation that defeated war disease poverty and death that we can believe that things are bad even when they're not and people actually are motivated more by their perspective on things than by the reality you're also talking about two separate classes people in the united states i think that drew tends to hang out with a lot of people who are not only very wealthy but also are relatively disengaged from politics outside of our office he actually deals in the culture mostly and if you are somebody who doesn't spend all day in politics then you live a pretty happy life in that you know yourself many get off a twitter it's like your life becomes one thousand percent better and so most people don't live politics all agreed agreed and so i used to think that the future of the country rested in the hands of the thirty five forty percent people who are engaged i'm starting to think the opposite i'm starting to think the future of the country rests in the hands of the sixty sixty five percent of the population doesn't give a crap about any of this stuff and they just go about their daily business now i used to think that that was bad i'm beginning to think that might be good thirty five percent we're losing our minds agreed and i think that it is this thing it's kind of fascinating some called radicalization theories about how small groups get taken take over big groups how minority can basically shift a majority and the logic of something like this you've got a family and nobody in the family is a vegan except for one daughter who's a vegan and the parents have to decide every night when they cook do i cook two separate meals one for the vegan kid and one for the rest of us or do i just cook a vegan meal for all of us because hey it's easier and it's less effort well the same thing holds true in politics is how you turn entire family vegan just because one person was vegan the most extreme person in any room can move the rest of the room if they care more and if the transaction cost of ignoring that person is higher than the transaction cost of catering to that person so what what you see indian nixon is going to move quamo exactly this is why it cost is too high for him and this is what i think you're seeing inside the democratic party right now what's fascinating is that look at the primary results across the country what you'll see is that mainstream democrats by and large are winning despite all the rhetoric being about socialism all this all the candidates that will cause you a court has endorsed virtually all of them lost same thing is true for bernie but they don't have to win those races all they have to do is drag the normal candidates over to the left and that's exactly what's happened with the democratic party where you've seen the entire party move to the left it's not that they're electing new socialists to replace the old people is the old people are now mirroring all of the rhetoric of the new or more extreme base brings us all the way back to the first story that we talked about the governor the governor governor race in vermont which is to say that even now having gone through the entire exercise of examining that story none of us have spoken aloud the obvious absurdity of of the situation and that's because even though the vast majority of human his human beings who've ever lived and who lived currently all feel the same way about what we observed in that video we don't care as much about it it's almost the opposite right it's the opposite of the idea of of of attacks on a punitive tax like a tariff you know milton friedman would observe that well that affects a small group of people an awful lot it it affects the the bulk of people very little and the bulk people just can't be given to hear that nobody's gonna say anything about that obvious that obvious picture we're not gonna say anything because it really doesn't matter to us that's right and you don't want to fight that battle because it doesn't mean anything that's not a hill you want to die on but you you end up losing so much because you're now you they're controlling the conversation we're all eating vegan I hate to interrupt what we got to take a break back in a minute up next enjoy bonus overtime content from the news and why it matters available exclusively for podcast listeners and blaze premium subscribers become a premium subscriber at the blaze.com slash subscribe all right Jeremy Wow so the weather not the trump tape of the n-word exists what does that all mean well I know no one's happy about my question but I felt like it was my goal is to why in the news and why matters. You know I've cautioned been against against getting cornered by hypotheticals and now I'm wondering myself I appreciate that which is you know if this tape does exist I think that it will have a dramatic effect on on the election it'll certainly define the narrative surrounding the election I mean there's a good argument that it can't possibly exist because if it did we would have already heard it but the world gets crazier and weirder and so I don't make predictions anymore who knows what's out there the question that we were all talking about beforehand which I think is important is would it change anyone's perspective on Trump that's gonna be that that's the electoral question right you think no I don't think there's anything that I don't think there's anything that he could I mean what else I mean look at this is good look at the list the thing we had a hypothetical question your quick conversation I don't know a couple months ago about this what would is there anything that could happen that would change it and the only thing I could come up with was a video of Trump using the n-word frequently and conversationally and negatively so not just like he says it one time he's quoting someone he kind of just says it out there it's like this is part of his lingo behind closed doors and we all believe it outside of that because I think if you found it surprising that would be surprising it would be surprising it's true no you know I agree with you I mean you would you get the feeling that he's you know a doofus on race issues but you don't get the feeling that the guy's like actually a brutal racist to and so that would so if that actually came out that would be shag but I will say this I don't think that anything virtually can change what people think of Trump because either like him or you don't like him there's no in between but it will change how people think about themselves being forced to defend Trump and half of politics is about that it's it's really not I think the great lie of politics is that you vote based on whether you like the Kansas or not no you vote based on what your friends and family think of you for liking a particular Kansas it or not this is particularly when you're young I don't think it's true when you're 65 when you're 65 you're like screw it I'm gonna vote how I want to vote I'm 65 what are you gonna do to me kill me right when you're but when you're 20 you're 25 and you're millennial and you're still working in social circles you haven't built a family haven't built a business you're still trying to define yourself in the eye of the people who surround you how you feel about particular figures figures is a form of virtue or vice signaling and so if you and this happens with the I mean you see with the arts all the time right where somebody will say that they like a movie simply because everybody else says that they like the movie I mean this is just a human tendency and so if it turns out that there were such a tape I don't think you could get a person under the age of 30 to admit that they like President Trump would be warm to President Trump or are interested in dealing with people in a party who are willing to defend that I think I think it would be serious fallout it would be the end and I would celebrate the end of the Republican Party it would have to reach it if you defended it it's it's on a timeline of death I mean how do you how do you recover from that you came from Lincoln there and yeah from Lincoln he would be the I mean yeah that's the opposite if it was a tape that was really horrible you just but it may not change the election because people would be disgusted but I mean who's left gonna put up right exactly it would still be it would still be the same binary thing that they did that we did in 2016 where it's the end of the world every elections the end of the world you got to vote because you got a vote but the untold story about all of this obviously the only reason we're talking about this is because the media decided to take Omarosa seriously yeah that's right I mean that's the part that's that's truly absurd I mean then that is Trump's fault I mean he picks all the best people like all the best the very very best people and except for all the worst people that he's picked right exactly those ones don't count that was that was also he could fire them don't try to be part of a broader strategy it's just step one you're not thinking when I know I know okay you got to flip the game pieces over underneath you see the truth story and John Roberts is still he still got that whole health care thing boiling to you know yeah that was strategy I do want to point out this is a good time to bring up the poll results from yesterday the question was would you support a Republican primary opponent if a Trump n-word tape surfaces 40% of the of the blaze viewers said yes it's higher than I would expect me too 60% said no I feel like that's the 60% you know I mean the 40% should be higher but but again I think your question was gonna be no because you you failed to control for did the deep state forged the tape there is an actual calculation in which you hate such a tape but you don't want a primary and here's that calculation the calculate theoretically and this is not something I agree with because I think that if that tape comes out you almost have to have a primary just to prove that the party doesn't endorse this sort of thing but the calculation goes something like this he has 90% approval rating inside their public party anybody who primaries him no matter what they say will be pilloried for anything they say this is actually my case against primary him right now without the tape is that if Ben Sasse word primary him it talks by everything Ben Sasse would ever say even though I like what Ben Sasse has to say a lot better than what president Trump has to say so I prefer that nobody primary Trump if it means toxifying the causes associated with that primary candidate just to have the people like we encourage McConnell to run you should primary that way we can get rid of all of these people who are really bad right you have to see him again let me want to talk about friends of a oh I you know that I saw a story today from Harvard Harvard economic economist who who said that we cannot hire universities should never hire anyone who has worked in the Trump administration because it will taint the university setting now this is this is from a group of people who have hired communist terrorists domestic terrorists like Bill Ayres they've laundered everybody somehow or another a blacklist is okay and it's it's it's everywhere on the left Hollywood should be the place that understands blacklist because of communist and because of their sexual practices had to keep it in the closet forever had to marry people even though you weren't attracted to them and pretend the whole time how does a group of people that have been on multiple blacklists and have been preaching to us don't do this it's bad suddenly find themselves as the cheer leader for all kinds of blacklists yeah well our friend Andrew Brightblart's father-in-law worse than being who's a terrific actor and comedian was black listed in the original communist blacklist the red scare he says you know I've been blacklisted twice I was blacklisted as a communist I followed a girl into a communist party USA rally and I stuck around because it was interesting and she was cute you know here he is decades later and he's a conservative and he's feels he's blacklisted again he says the difference is when I was blacklisted the first time I was considered a hero by my peers in the industry for having been blacklisted now no well those are the very people who won't take my call I think that you know I jokingly said earlier that anything the left disagrees with that's persecution I think that is the standard they they control Hollywood because Hollywood is a city of vice it's an industry of vice and even people of vice have to see themselves as people of virtue politics is sort of the unifying virtue signal for people who work in the entertainment industry it doesn't occur to them that they know people with whom they disagree so they don't think of you know the grip staring at his shoes while they're railing about how Bush brought down the Twin Towers which was a big topic of conversation back in the Bush administration on on the conspiracy theories yeah but they they don't they don't see that person staring at his shoes as a conservative he couldn't possibly be a conservative conservatives or racist were mongering bigots he's a nice guy so you started Fred's vape I mean I did not start it I inherited it okay what happened to it where they go so you know after the election it got harder and harder to get people to come out to events I think that the town really toxified you during strangely because of Trump yes strangely the Obama era was good for conservatives in Hollywood we saw real progress in town you know liberals are nice when they're winning once once Obama became president you know F.O.A. became a lot easier for people to attend I think now in the era of Trump it got very difficult especially right after the election and we just made a call to defend it's what you were saying you have to defend too much that you're like I can't I can't carry all that water if Trump made it easier for everybody you know how much easier everybody's job would be like really it's a this is the part that that drives me out to wrote an entire piece about this today with regard to Tim Paul Lindsey who lost his primary in Minnesota basically because he was too anti-Trump in 2016 and it seems to me that that because Trump has become such a litmus test for people and then Trump insists on being Trump and then we take every basically we've decided that we are now living in the universe of the untouchables and every and every political race is the Sean Connery speech right what are you prepared to do and whatever Trump does that's bad if you don't defend that you are not prepared to do the thing that is necessary in order to win and so the the deeper Trump dives there the more people are forced to defend him or be or be cast together is disloyal and traders and and cocks and people who don't understand the fight and all the rest of this where you can be fired for something that was said five years ago when it was okay to say that right but you know culture has changed what does that mean for the conservatives who are tweeting and and Facebook posting their support for Trump and you know in even engaging in things that they don't want to what does that mean I mean they're not gonna work again I mean really in Hollywood I mean I know many I'm talking like A list people who are conservative real A list people who are conservative and will not get together in broad daylight for lunch with people who are even peripherally known as conservative because it will end their career I've talked to them and some come to our offices and I'll say like don't let anyone know that you're here because they will finish your career doesn't matter how big you are I know you guys have to run really quickly I have one more thing to ask but I want to give the poll of the day how do you feel about the midterms after last night's primaries are you confident are you a little bit concerned let us know on Facebook and Twitter or Instagram and Twitter I believe so I just wanted to ask really quickly I want you to have your Alex Jones moment and share your conspiracy theory well it's gonna be embarrassing not that moment take you shirt off I'm like what the conspiracy theory Glenn and Garth Brooks well I've never seen them together in the same room at the same time they're they're both larger than life highly animated visionaries they cry easily on cue on camera and I listen I don't like that I don't like that I know they're a bus are there's also the sort of Chris Gaines reinvention that happened if you remember with Garth Brooks and I feel like Glenn is sort of prone to occasionally recreate Glenn a little bit I don't know I feel like I've heard him once referred to Tricia Yearwood as Miss Yearwood I know that Garth Brooks sued me for the G that's amazing so I that was part of the theory I had the lowercase G was my logo for years was my logo well he started to use the lowercase G who knew Garth Brooks owns that lowercase typewriter G Wow didn't think you could own it and his attorneys came and said you don't have any idea we have been defending this for nine years at the ten year mark it becomes done we're going to spend whatever it takes to make sure we keep the lowercase G so you cannot have the lowercase G has the argument house like the like the Marx Brothers and then you just like stood on the other side of a doorway like you're in just you can't sue me I'm you I want to me go I think that just proved his theory and that's all there is so there's no record of that lawsuit is there you go right thank you guys so much for joining us tomorrow
