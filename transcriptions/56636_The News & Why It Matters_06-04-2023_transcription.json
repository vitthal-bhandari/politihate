    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at BlazeTV.com slash The Blind. Today, Nike partners with Dylan Mulvaney to sell sports bras. RFK is running for president and in shocking news, the GOP is responsible for tornadoes. We've got all of that and more coming up, but it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez and yesterday afternoon, White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre was asked about the Biden regime's position on sex change surgeries for minors after Indiana became the latest state to ban the use of puberty blockers, hormone therapies and sex change operations for anyone under 18. Here was her answer. And then today, Indiana just banned puberty blockers, hormone therapies and gender transition surgeries for minors. I'm wondering what the president's reaction is to the Indiana governor signing that bill into law. And does the president have a position on at what age these kinds of therapies and surgeries are appropriate? That's something for a child and their parents to decide. It's not something we believe should be decided by by legislators. So I'll leave it there. But well, you know, in the past couple of months, we have seen a record number of LGBTQI bills, anti-LGBTQQI bills, more than 600 of them have been filed in state houses. And a significant number of them have been anti-trans bills and targeted at youth. This is a president that has said that when these are some of the bravest people, he knows. But no one should have to be brave just to be themselves. And so this is a president that has been committed to this community that has been committed to our kids in the trans community, to a trans youth. And he's going to continue to fight for them. But again, I'm just going to leave it there. Oh, okay. Leave it there. Interesting. That is something for a child and their parents to decide. Okay. Can a child and their parents decide that punching them in the face is an appropriate punishment when they misbehave? No, that's abuse. Can a child and their parents decide they can engage in a sexual relationship together? No, that's also abuse. Can a child and their parents decide a six-year-old is ready to like, I don't know, take the car keys and take the car for a spin? No, that's illegal. The reality is lawmakers already have about a billion laws put into place designed to keep parents from harming their children. And this is no different. But I find it so incredibly laughable to hear this administration attempt to champion parental rights as if that's what they've ever advocated for. The same administration who pushed for your babies to be forcibly injected with an experimental, sometimes deadly jab in order to go to school, whether you like it or not, the same administration who, by the way, fights for you to not have a say in which school they attend, the same administration who demanded you suffocate your child in a mask in order for them to go to school, and the same administration who empowers Merrick Garland to put you on a domestic terrorist list because you dared go to your school board meeting and, you know, politely request that they stop providing your children with pornographic materials. And by the way, if we were advocating for these people to, you know, be brave being themselves, we'd be giving them the treatment to accept the way they were born. They are quite literally not being themselves. But then again, you know, language seems to me nothing these days. And what do I know? I'm not a biologist. Here to discuss this and more, I have Alex Stein, host of Primetime with Alex Stein here on Blaze TV. And their first time on the program, we've got Royce Lopez and we can just go by Merrick. It's Merrick. It's Merrick. It's Merrick. It's Merrick. It's Merrick. Merrick is fine. Merrick is how they know him and they are the host of the Revenge of the SIS Podcast. We're happy to have you guys here. And I want to say this. I have to cut off the program. We agree with everything the CDC says. We love Dr. Fauci and the vaccine is the most safe and effective drug ever created. So go ahead. Oh, well, I, so I could hear all of you guys audibly reacting. Yes. The absurdity that Corrine Jean-Pierre just said. So I want to give you guys a chance to share your thoughts. Alex, you want to take it? I mean, I'll just start off with it. They can't even put a number on it. I mean, like you said, there's so many laws. You can't get a tattoo. You can't join the military. You can't vote. It's basic numbers. Just put a number, but they don't want to put a number on it. Right. She just gave the longest non-answer I've ever heard. So, I mean, it's just an indication that there's, they want more trans kids and they want to create legislation that gets more access for youth to have gender reassignment or hormone therapy. And I think it's pretty obvious that's her stance. Yeah, Royce. I love that they, they, they retconned everything into anything that's pro-trans. They go, this pro, how come everything pro-trans is anti-kid? Like it's, it's a, it's the same like pro-choice pro-life thing that's, you're messing with words. No, it's really simple. When I grew up, there was always people that were trans. I remember them and we laughed at them because it's just funny. And I don't care money, Python, people in the wigs. It's funny. But that's fine. But we had an understanding like, look, I don't care. Just leave me alone. But now it's like when you press secretaries shouldn't be talking about people changing their sex in any circumstance like it's Martin Luther King or the civil rights. Right. They really are trying to make this the new civil rights. Right. But the point is the civil rights had an end where it was like, okay, this is what we want. We want equality. The problem with the trans would win in a lot of movements like this. Now, once it become monetized, there's no need to end it because then the cash flow stops, you can't buy 14 million dollar mansions or be Dylan Mulvaney and be in the White House, you know? Yeah. It is fascinating too because when you ask them, merch, you ask them like, what rights are you seeking that you don't already have? They never seem to have an answer for that. Yeah. Well, this is a right to groom kids. Let's be honest. The civil rights movement took a huge leap from, you know, hey, why don't you let black people own houses to let us mutilate your child and groom him and teach him sex. So, but I think, you know, I'm not trying to be a contrarian here. I think you guys have been a little tough on KJP. She does have a good point in that trans people are brave because there's nothing braver than mutilating your entire body for adopamine Russian 15 minutes of fame. And take that followers and take that for you. That's pretty brave. I wouldn't do it. You know, it's just like I wouldn't join the Marines and I probably would never, you know, cut things off of me either. So I don't know, man, it's pretty brave. But not to be contrarian too. This is another topic that they're not talking about. Sarah and I talk about, you know, secretly is that what's not secretly if you're about to announce it on my show. Well, let's be known. I think Dr. Peter McCullough that I spoke with, not trying to brag and he actually said the same thing and confirmed this is that the amount of people that identify as non-binary or transgender oftentimes are autistic is even worse than gender dysphoria. So this is a mental health crisis and they're actually going after the most vulnerable people with mental health issues. Well, speaking of mental health issues, you're talking about me? Yes. Spend a whole lot of time talking about your mental health issues. Dylan Mulvaney. So I guess Nike didn't get the message from the response to Bud Light with Bud Light's partnership with Dylan Mulvaney. So a Nike has now partnered with Dylan Mulvaney. He unveiled this cute little partnership yesterday on his Instagram wearing Nike leggings and a sports bra and I'm, look, I'm really sorry. It's just that I saw it. So now you have to as well watch. Wow. I guess Dylan says they're thin. Look at her work in it. That's how you do it, Sarah. That's so embarrassing. Oh embarrassing. Good. That's like LeBron James. This is, I mean, high level athleticism. Oh, please God, make it stop. Why? So when you don't have breasts, you don't need a sports bra. And when you don't have breasts, I feel like you probably are not a good representation to sell sports bras to women. Well, here's something that we talked about in our show a bunch of times with Dylan is specifically the weirdest thing. Normally when people transition, the first thing you get done is the boobs because it's the easiest one. It's just the easiest one. But with him, for whatever reason, he went and he got the bottom surgery first and then he went and he shaved down his jaw like it was a piece of Parmesan cheese. I was like, no, I'm a girl. But he hasn't done the boobs yet. And at first we've been racking our brains like it doesn't make any sense unless the reason is you want to look at a 12 year old girl, which is what it's a good point. It's not my journey into womanhood. It's my journey into girl. It's just weird. We just talked about that verbiage the other day and how weird it was because you see the other videos of him like with little girl, like material, little ways or whatever. Yeah, I mean, it is very weird. But one thing that he also has not done, I might add, is he clearly is not taking hormones. I don't, I would be shocked if he was taking estrogen. I want to play, I'm going to play a video of him reacting to like, oh, I haven't been on social media lately because it just, it's just been going through a lot with all of the reactions to my partnerships. But in that video, you'll notice when he tips his head up, I'm like, that is a beard. It is a beard. So how, it's so weird. All right, let's watch that. Hi, how are you? I haven't been making as many videos. There's been a lot going on. Right. And I was feeling a little down today. I was walking on the side walk in New York and this garbage truck drives by me and the garbage man leans out of the truck and goes, hello, Dylan. Hello. It was the most unexpected person. And it gave me the courage to keep going. And I love you. And if you're that man that's watching this right now, you really made my day. And I especially love you. Okay. I have to say this, isn't don't little kids love the garbage truck and garbage man too? Isn't that like a little kid thing? Probably. Yeah. I'm just saying, I feel like they like big trucks. There's, I mean, that is very interesting. Really into trains and stuff. Some things are saying kids are like, I mean, but it's the five of, by the way, I did see who was what's her, what's her name from the sim cast? She had a really funny joke. Chrissie Merr had their really funny joke about the Bud Light thing. It killed me. She posted the bill with the Bud Light and it says it's five o'clock shadow somewhere. And that killed me. I've seen other photos of the film of Amy before, where it's like coming all in and you're like, yeah, okay. You see his prices, right? Did you see what that was wild? Because it's like, you've always wanted attention and it's just how far would you go? Like back in the day when we were younger, people, like there's a lizard guy that would split his tongue in half and put the black in his eyes and he's like, oh, there's a freak. And you're like, this is just a new form of that. But the difference is I used to be able to make fun of that guy. And now I'll get arrested in certain states if I do the same thing. And it's like, look, you do whatever you want. But you have a five o'clock shadow. And by the way, that's that was a made up story. That didn't happen. That never happened. There was no garbage man. That's okay. That's what I'm going to ask. I don't think it happened either. That's like the in case you're one of the people that watches me, I don't think a New York City garbage man is like, finally home after real tough day. I'm going to watch the little mama. I'm really big at the LGBT QI to spirit. You know, after a long day of throwing garbage out, I go watch the view. I watch Drew Barrymore getting our knees and go distillum oveni, dude. I've turned it around. Because now the problem is I go, you know what? This is great. Men are winning again. Men are on top again. And this would be one of the ladies. And every boy. And patriarchy. Liberal white women literally carried the flag for this. It's like leave him alone. And now you're getting blown out in sports. And I'm laughing going like, you're doing this to yourself. You broke the glass ceiling and then shoved the shards in your eyes. Like, why are you doing this? So it's kind of. And you called us bigots for years when we were going, you don't want this. And they're like, no, we're fighting for their, okay. But I'm telling you, you're going to regret this. Yeah. No, what do I know? So, okay. So that I want to ask you, there's the latest controversy is Jack Daniels now. Because Jack Daniels, so I want to be clear. This was a marketing campaign from Jack Daniels that resurfaced. So it was done in 2021 during Pride Month. But this is drag queens partnering with Jack Daniels. Here's part of that ad watch. What's going on with this ring? This is not conducive for a Pride party. We got up in the morning and it just, it was just pouring. You get rain on our parade? We're so glad we're not in Dragon Hills and Wigs right now. Can you imagine in like the weather being so bad and just makeup and hair, oh, that would be all the stretches. But listen people, we have a party to plan and we need to go get some decorations. Yeah. We need to get this going and we're taking a pop. Let's go to the town square and get some party supplies. I'm ready. Oh my gosh. She looks so starting in every single one of you. Oh my God. It's really super hard. This is going to be the fiercest party Lindshburg has ever seen. Why? I'm very kind of see. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Can't bury. So my question is why? Yes. But also, when we go out, I don't like, I order a jack and diet, right? Do they get a pass because this was done in 2021 or and but I still feel like they were kind of grooming in 2021. Well, none of them can pass. Let's go. Let's start with that. So but they're not passing. Right. Right. Right. But no, I feel like they, this is so gross. And I said, no, I'm like, God, do I need to stop drinking Jack Daniels? I said this today. So then over to the dark side, start drinking Irish whiskey. No. That's the way to go. I mean, I will do they do they promote do they promote this? Oh, no, no, they're super misogynistic. I love it. I'm in. They're like super busy. No, but the problem is the thing with boycotts is I mean, in theory, it sounds great, but the reality is sure that's going to happen. So I'm just going to go to a bar and be like, can I have a Bud Light? Can I have a middle of light? No, we only have Bud Light. All right, that's fine. Yeah. That's the real world. And I know I'm not saying people, you know, support what you want. But the reality is just like we say to the left, it's the truth. The Twitter is not the real world. People are going to go out. Listen, oh, I'm not going to have a Bud Wiser or to one of the other 50 beers they own because that's the problem. That's the other issue. When three companies run the world, you can't boycott everything. Like somebody said it today on Twitter, it's like, if Monsanto just decided to go super woke, you're not going to eat bread? Right. And that's the real problem. The real problem is what boycotting, the real problem is why do we let it get this? We got real bad, real quick when everyone controls. If we all thought free market, free market, which is great, but then when now it's just the government's working with all the free market and there's no free market anymore, it's like you're doing this, you're not going to have a bank and that's it. Free market doesn't work when like seven companies own everything now. Right. Yeah, that's not really free market actually. By the way, I would just like to point out if that happened with Monsanto, I would just not eat bread because I don't. She doesn't eat bread anyway. Yeah, but that's- One Monquito too. I would be fine. You had trouble with carrots and other vegetables. It's great. No, it's my life. I know. It's pretty good. Once you're in good, it does. It's you feel pretty good. Yeah. You feel good. I feel good. I feel really good. You feel great. I know, but you know, 20 Sarah used to be very heavy set lady and you guys had this picture. Oh, no, I've seen people try to dunk on you on Twitter. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I just looked like that. Yeah, I'm seeing the problem. Yes, I made myself better, right? You should try it. You don't realize it would be the reverse would be like a hurtful thing to do. Yeah, you used to look like this. Right, right. Right. Check that out. I remember we used to be like, yeah, kind of sucks. All right, let's go ahead and let's take a quick break and we will be back with more first. We want to thank our sponsor Birch Gold. So as you guys are seeing kind of play out in real time, it turns out inflation has consequences as the Fed raises interest rates to combat out of control government spending. Long-term bonds have diminished in value. It's been crippling banks. Depositors are holding their breath and investors are bailing on bank stocks. You need to diversify the time is now. You can do that with Birch Gold. What Birch Gold is so good at, you can get physical gold if you'd like, but you also can get a, you can get gold and silver in a precious metals IRA and you can transfer it over. Birch Gold can make it very, very easy to do that. And when you do that, you will be able to diversify into Golden Silver, which historically has been the safest thing to diversify into during times of inflation and kind of like what we're going through right now. So don't watch your money waste away. You can text the word Y to 9898 to get a free information kit on gold. Again, it's free. There's no obligation. So there's no reason not to do it. At least look into it. Text the word Y to 9898 to claim that free info kit. So this is wild to me guys. Donald Trump speaking from, we covered the speech of course, speaking from our logo on Tuesday the first time since he had been arrested. And ABC News in their broadcast blurred out his podium that said to text Trump like to get official campaign notifications, they blurred out the text number so that you couldn't text and find out more. Watch. Never thought anything like this could happen in America. Never thought it could happen. This is the wildest thing I've ever seen. Are they doing it on purpose? Because either these people are stupid, which is possible, or I don't know what's happening. Because the first thing you just gave it more exposure, they always do this all the time. Because now people, I know that most people probably ignore that, but now people that were watching are like, what was, what was they doing? Why are they going to? It's trending and then more people are going to give money. So it's like, why are you doing this? I think it's because they need Trump to be in there. Because I think that they already, Trump's the villain, right? He's a supervillain to them. So they need the guy that they've already built entire dossier's and everything against. It's like, that's the only reason because I don't understand nothing they're doing. He's just going to be photoshopped on like another rap album, for a chance to think it's funny and he's going to win again. Well, I mean, there is an alternative. They could just be that stupid. That's what I said. They could also just be. Yeah. I think, I do think that they could just be that stupid and just for clarification, just to set the record straight, this was Joe Biden's podium broadcast by ABC in 2020, where you can clearly see his text message. Yeah, there it is. Yeah, but if you text out to just sign Jibs of Ben and Jerry's flavor of the month club, it's not that bad. Yeah, you're right though. People are just going to get curious now. Most Americans are just going to see blurred out thing and be like, I bet there's boobs under there. You should try to look them up. Literally, they're like, what is it? What is it? A penis? Trump stuff. What is cool? Yeah, what do you know? Yeah, it's so wild. Me just shows you that the news is obviously fake. I mean, they can't even show you the real live shot. They actually have to edit it. It's like literally George Orwell's 1984, where they can just change the history. And if you look at it, now they're going back to change literature, popular books to make them more woke. So it's like, we don't even know what's real. And if you're watching from the mainstream media, it's probably fake news. I wish that we had your video that you did the other day at Dallas. You just, and you just troll the Dallas Morning News too. We're both fighting with them. Why are we fighting with the paper of record in our city? I'm not surprised. Why? I'm not just saying I'm not surprised because you're the number one, you're the transgender terror, the transgender terror of Dallas. If you have a transgender drag brunch, uh oh, because Saragans also going to be there with a crew to shut you down. Well, she's going to show up with a fake mustache. Yes, I'm going to show up with every disguise. No, she does. I'm going to have to. I'm going to have to. Now, because the wigs are not cutting it. They're making me take down my mask. They have pictures of me there to look for me. But you know they're scared if they're writing that article. It's a hit piece. Oh, no, I know it's a hit piece, but my point in that was, so for those of you who didn't see the video, Alex went, this was supposed to be an interview for his school board race, and he went in there, and the Dallas Morning News would not allow him to record it. On my cell phone, yes. But they were interviewing you, so like if they're good faith reporters doing a good faith interview, what would be the problem with recording it? There shouldn't have been any problem whatsoever. No. No, they should have let me record it, and they were recording it. So it's like, why can't I have a copy of it, but they're not going to give me a copy of their record. So listen, I tried to do it, and they wouldn't let me do it because they know that they are whatever I said they were going to miss him. It's true, but now I'm kind of mad because I could have even said, crazy your stuff, but I'm excited now that we got the Dallas Morning News attention. Now they're writing a hit piece about you, me. I think we're going to be in the crosshairs for the next. Well, fine with that. Yeah, I'm fine with the two. Please, I need the publicity. So write about the Dallas News. Well, I actually don't think it will last for very much longer. No, they're dying. Dying over there. So I want to switch over to RFK. So Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has filed to run for president as a Democrat. Now, I'm interested to hear your thoughts on this because I have seen a lot of conservatives very interested in this because of his position on medical freedom. And because medical freedom has been something that I think a lot of conservatives have really reconsidered since COVID. It's kind of, I always said, the silver lining of COVID will be that people will be awoken to the medical industrial complex as Alex calls it, and Big Pharma. And I think that that happened. But I am a little concerned that that is going to siphon off some Republican votes because I mean, I don't think the Democrats are not going to vote for him. They hate him. They think he's an anti-vaxxer and they can't stand the guy. So I'm interested to see how this plays out. Well, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So if you look at the mainstream media has portraying Robert Kennedy as an anti-vaxxer and just as a conspiracy theorist, so that makes me like him more or so. I don't know if he's going to get my vote, but I definitely he has my support on his side. I hope he causes him chaos there without causing chaos on our side. Yeah, me too. I don't think he'll take votes away because he's not going to get the nomination. Yeah, I know. I don't think that's something worth it. That's fair. But I think in terms of the positive, the positive stuff with somebody like that is it makes a lot of people, Democrats and Republicans answer a lot of uncomfortable questions about the medical stuff because I think most people would agree that one of Trump's biggest weak spots was still his stance on the vaccine. And that to me is something where it's hard to defend that and somebody coming in and going like, yeah, but you know what, the vaccine is terrible. You know, so so into freedom, why do that? That's the biggest, most uncomfortable thing. He's not going to get it because he was painted. He was painted crazy so long ago. And I think he's dead right about a lot of stuff. Yes, yes, I love him. It's uncomfortable to people how right he is because I always said, I apologize to people because when I was younger, I would be laughing at people that wouldn't get their kids vaccinated. And then I said, I was stupid. It's like, obviously no wonder. Now I know what this feels like. This feels like, wait a second, what are they putting into you? And I think the best thing that's happened. It's safe and effective. Safe and effective. And even from when I was a kid, the number of vaccines I got to the number of kids get now is ridiculous. And that's a real thing. You know, I'm not saying don't get the polio vaccine obviously, but what I am saying is the fact that this that this vaccine was able to be questioned and the fact that this guy's running on it, I like anything that gets more spotlight regardless of what party they're on on the medical, like you said, the medical industrial conference, that to me is more important than anything else. Yeah. Yeah. I just want to see him at the debates. But like he's not like he said, he's not going to get the nomination. But I just want to see him on national television being like, yeah, they killed you with this vaccine. Which is really, no, that's not a generation of people. Listen, we want to just make this very abundantly clear. We love the vaccine. And listen, if I got three polio vaccines and I got polio three times, I would get a fourth polio vaccine. That's how vaccines work. So we love it. Thank you, Dr. Fauci. I do. I do. I do. I just will be very interested to see, you know, I mean, in the primaries, right? Like you can only, you're only voting in one. Right. I just don't want Republicans to vote to decide to vote in the Democrat primary just to try to get Kennedy to be the guy because he's not going to be the guy. And all that will do is water down the rest of the votes in the Republican primary. Yeah, I mean, the Republican primary is too big. It's going to be either DeSantis is going to be Trump. That's about it. And DeSantis, I mean, Trump is like, especially after this, they shot him up. Yeah. Yeah. So even if that does happen, I don't really think it'll affect it. The general election will affect anything. It's going to be one or two people, basically. And I think if you're on a Republican, and you're seems to be people that are more for the medical freedom now, more DeSantis people. So there is kind of an option, obviously not as hardcore as the one of K is, but still, you know, so I think that I'm not too worried about that. I just think it's the point of this for him to get him on TV and to talk about this and have people make people listen to it. Yeah, no, I totally agree. Do people actually vote in the Democratic primary anymore after 2016? I just wouldn't even bother. Bernie Sanders. You know what I mean? I just wouldn't even bother. I thought the CIA just picks it now. Yeah, I just think sure. Yeah, I just thought they'd pull them out of a lot of machines. Well, no, that's not true because my grandma has been dead for about 18 years, and she still votes in the Democratic primary. That's vote and die. That's a dedicated person. Yeah. Die than vote. Die than vote. Yeah. That's going to be dying vote. Let's start it. Die in vote campaign. Let's go ahead and take another quick break. We will be back with more first one. I think our sponsor, this segment, nefarious. So look, I have not been bashful about this. Nefarious, I've already seen twice. I realize they're a sponsor, but I actually am a very, very big fan of not only the movie, but the guy who wrote the book that it was based on, of course, our very own Steve Dase here at Blaise TV. And it is a movie that if you are spiritual at all, you're going to want to watch, but you don't have to be spiritual to watch it because it's not one of those, you know, religious movies get such a bad rap. They're like, oh my God, a religious movie. It's so boring. This is not that at all. What? I had to make that point. I went into this movie and I thought, oh, this is going to be some lame Christian movie. That's, that's what everyone said. That's what I mean. It was like demonic. It was the demonic side of Christianity. So it was actually like thrilling. It was a good movie. Was it not the demonic side of Christianity? It was just, I'm saying the person was possessed by demons. So I'm just saying you got that aspect. Boilers, some of us have to go to see it tonight. I like the issue of religious films, right? I'm a big fan of some Kirk Cameron firefighter movies, right? Yeah. It's got everything. It's got action. It's got suspense. So this is like, it's definitely a psychological, it has a feel of a psychological thriller. It's not going to be like gory or anything like a horror movie, but I'm just saying you're going to have some great conversations afterwards. Bring a friend. It opens nationwide, the weekend of April 14th. You can go get your tickets at whoisnafarious.com. That is the weekend of April 14th. Make sure you bring a friend at whoisnafarious.com. After years of battling Big Tech, we're no longer willing to play their game and watch them stifle our reach, cutting us off from you. It's time to make a big change. Go to theblaze.com for some exciting updates and join the fight against Big Tech's censorship. This is the part of the program where I am going to, I'm going to torture you guys a little bit and I'm going to make you watch a little bit of the view. I'm sorry, but it's just fun for me because again, if I have to see it and I have to suffer, I want others to suffer along with me. In this particular episode, Joy Behar is talking about the Republican Party and that this is going to be the end of the Republican Party. They're never going to win elections anymore in this country, which I actually agree with because the game is rigged. When the game is rigged, of course, you can't win another election. But she says that the GOP is responsible for school shootings and also tornadoes, apparently watch. They've said it all, but this is the beginning of the end of the Republican Party, as I say it. I don't see that they're going to win in any elections anymore in this country, not national elections. They're on the wrong side. These kids were born in 1897, not 1897, which is where the Republican Party is going. And they're like, hey, come on, hold up. I don't want to get killed in school. I don't want to be in the middle of another mill tornado or whatever the hell's going on in this country. Oh, I hear about a tornado all the time. Is that climate change? It is. It is. It is. It's fine. You know, and they don't want all these. They don't want it. They want their abortion rights just in case. Yeah. They want it. Okay. I'm done with her. I'm done with her. She's a tornado. She's a tornado. I can't. I'm sorry. But I'm confused. We need abortion rights in case we're going to be the victim of tornadoes. I didn't understand. Because the baby's got stuff in the tornadoes, dummy. Duh. Babies are going to get sucked up and they're going to fling around. Is that what you want? I guess I don't want that. I'd rather be killed in a worm. You trained the elements or an everyday thing. It's nothing to worry about. But I haven't seen a tornado before 2019. That's what we're going to do. That's so perplexing. That's so perplexing to me that like, you heard all of the other cast members. That's climate change. It's climate change, right? They're like, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yep. It's like, you guys don't remember tornadoes existing for like, literally all time. I'm sorry. I just, the level of stupid, I mean, the stupid people, they're always the most sure of themselves. Yes. And the view is the perfect example. Yes. I had to be contrarian. I had to be contrarian. Of course. Time to put on the tin foil hat. There is a technology called cloud seating. In China, they do this on important politicians' weddings. They might not want their wedding to have rain on it. So there is ways that the military or the government can modify the weather. Now, can they create tornadoes? No, but maybe Joy Behar, she's probably in the Illuminati, drinks the blood of children. Maybe she knows something we don't. Maybe. Behar sign an Illuminati. They would have known that. No, there's certain people that get in. She's not in the Illuminati. Jupy's in. Whoopi Goldberg's in the Illuminati. Yeah, I mean, obviously she was insane. She got to be in Phystorak too. Yeah, so you're in the Illuminati. So obviously you're in immediately. No, but these people, we watch a few clips all the time because we have to. We get mad and we know we're going to get mad, but we cannot help ourselves. Because they're so stupid and they're so sure of themselves, but they go, this has to be tornadoes. And kids, the truth of the matter is, is that, I mean, I talked to, you know, we're our fan base, skews younger because of our show. There's a lot of zoomers that send us messages and they're a lot more base than you think. The problem is you can't see it because you're not allowed to say anything. You have to be secretly based. Yeah, but that's a good point. We get like messages all the time like, don't worry, man. You're like, all right, there's some cool kids out there. They're just, but they're like, I can't say anything in school because they're just going to cripple the crucifying man. Well, it used to be a big deal to be a closet homosexual. Now it's going to be a closet conservative. Oh, yeah. That's the new closeted thing. It's okay to be homosexual just you can't be conservative. Yeah. All right. I want to switch to Disney. So I'm actually very upset about this. Disney is now altering the lyrics in two songs in this upcoming remake of The Little Mermaid. So of course, the song Kiss the Girl. Well, we have to change that because they're the man is forcing himself on that poor mermaid woman. So the original song, The Lyrics, are yes, you want her. Look at her. You know you do possible. She wants you to. There is one way to ask her. I want to sing it actually as I'm reading it. No. They're kissing the girl. It was Sarah kissing. It don't take a word, not a single word. Go on and kiss the girl. And so now they're going to change it because Prince Eric could not. He cannot force himself on Ariel. And the other one is the evil witch Ursula who is singing the men up there don't like a lot of blabber. They think a girl who gossip is a bore. Yet on land, it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word. And after all, dear, what is idol babble for? Where's the lie though? This is some weird Harvey Weinstein cover up dystopian freak show thing. I mean, why would they even try to change history of some of the most popular culture of our lives and try to make it well? It's very weird. Well, by the way, the little mermaid is black, right? Yeah, actually that's right. Well, the thing is, I think the biggest problem is first off, you have to ask her pronouns. You can't say kiss the girl. How do you? That's true. Kiss the them. And secondly, the consenting is super fun because you're romantic. You're working hot and heavy with a girl. And then you always want to be like, excuse me, before we continue. May I please kiss the lady? To get you out of the house. Let me tell you, no girls are out. We're like, oh, right off to me. Look, can I kiss you? Why did you say that? Now you put on your face. Just do the lean in and if they do the hey, you're like, okay, well, hey. Men of the evening, you've been in your shop for a long time, but ladies, this is nothing new. We understand. If you're, we get it. I got it. My bad. I messed up and you move on with your life. Right. But now you're going to be on a boat with a mermaid person, by the way, the most important thing in this thing is a mermaid person became a mermaid became a person and then lost her voice. The most important thing is the consent in the song. We're in a fantasy world. Why don't we try to keep adding real worth something to fantasy? Well, she's friend with a fish and some some reason that you're making crap. Come on. Enough. Stop. It's a cartoon. Um, you know, I feel bad for young men who are growing up now because it's like, how do you, how do you date, like, how do you date? That's a topic. That's a topic I bang on about a lot because like don't envy young dudes now. Yeah. It's just, it's not a lot of depth on that bench out there. You know what I mean? It's a minefield. It's a minefield. It really is. It's so superficial with the dating apps. It's very hard to date. Dating is basically just like sideshow Bob from The Simpsons, just stepping it to rake after rake. Just one after the other. And your face on your face. That's dating though. It really makes me sad. Um, and then, you know, it's also fascinating to watch the left constantly accuse us of being like, you're banning books. You're, you're book banning. You're trying to, and it's like you guys are literally altering Dr. Seuss. You're changing Willy Wonka. You're changed. Like, you're changing all of these things and you want to accuse us of rewriting history. Fascinating. That's even your history. But then if, but if you say, if you call your friend retard, then all of a sudden you broke a cardinal rule and you go to jail and it's like, I'm just joking. Like, they, they, it's crazy because they, they've banned, they've banned, they've, they're the ones who banned everything. When I grew up, it was, you know, the, the family councils that were banning music and banning that and everybody was on their side. Now they're the ones banning everything. Yeah. And then they go, hey, maybe we just shouldn't have pornography and screaming. Right. It's like really? Yeah. Excuse me, sweating. Oh, oh, now you're the word police. We, what if we want to show little kids, penises and books? Why can't we? Then they turn into Ron Paul Libertarians immediately. And they're like, ah, freedom for it. I'm like, all right. Well, pick a lane. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And the parental rights and education billy did the same thing. Like your book burning. And it's like, no, no, no. There were just some books in there that were like for like second grade is there just literally 80% bucks. Maybe we need to dial that back. Remember, we, we covered a story a while back where it was like a kindergarten teacher and they passed the billy. He's like, I don't know, man. It's just like, I don't understand how after like a romantic paddleboarding with my boyfriend over the weekend. I come in, I don't understand if my kids ask like how my weekend was. I can't talk about my gay paddleboarding. I'm like, it takes a lot of shoe warning fruit to get a kindergartener to like segue into that for you. I have a feeling it's not the kids going like, how was your gay paddleboarding this weekend? It's them going. So we learn in math day. It's like, yeah, I'm so tired from the weekend though, you know? And they're like, OK. So we're going to do math. Yeah, a lot of gay paddleboarding. And it's like, I don't care. I need to learn math or I'm not going to graduate. But the craziest part is like more people stood up for like getting common quite a school than getting like, you know, the groomers out of school is crazy. So hear me out. Let's ban common whore math. I like that. That's the bet. See, you mix it together. Common whore math. Yes. Exactly. I was thinking, I have a solution for school shootings that if we actually made our public schools under Sharia law and we made it so women couldn't go to school. There'd be 50% less targets. Yeah. So that would could reduce about 50%. Well, there's a girl really need to go to school. I just say give all kids guns. Well, on that note, we're going to take a quick break. I want to thank our sponsor Fearless Roll Call. So something really awesome is about to happen in the Nashville area. If you are out there, our nation, I don't know if you've noticed, it's tearing itself apart and we can't go on like this for much longer. We desperately need healing in the worst way from the deep seat, the deep set ideologies that divide us in dialogue to the real life moments of violence in which lives are lost. We face total cultural annihilation, if not worse. One of the things we need for most right now is for men of God to rise to the occasion and become who God has made them to be. That is what inspired Jason Whitlock to organize Fearless Army Roll Call. It's an all day event in Nashville. It's going to encourage men to put on the full armor of God. Take a stand against the evil forces destroying American culture. At the conference, you're going to hear speeches from Jason and several special guests, but you're running out of time. You got to join them, all these men over there who are going to Nashville. For this conference on April 15th, you can get your ticket over at fearlessarmyrollcall.com. That is fearlessarmyrollcall.com. Matt Walsh recently attended a college campus discussion with these, just I don't know how he does it with these mentally insane individuals who attend his talks and ask these questions and they think I guess they think that they're going to like, they're like, oh, I'm going to get him. I'm going to get him. I'm going to leave him dumbfounded. He's not going to know how to respond. It just never ends up working out well for them. Here's one of those exchanges. Watch. How do you know that? Okay. So, thinking back to when I was 16 in an anatomy class, when I learned that transgender people tend to have the brain structure that confirms their identity that they identify with. What? And you can look that up. You can look that up. I will look that up. Yeah, it's back. I will look that up. I will find it. It's not a fact. It's not a fact. It should be awful. So, you're saying a trans man has the brain of a woman? No. I'm saying that a trans man who identifies as a man will tend to have similar brain structure that a cis man would. And where did you get that from? Look it up. You can look it up. It's literally, I'm telling you, I learned it from my anatomy class. And I looked up the fact before I walked up here because I knew that you'd ask. Oh, that's why when he asks where, she's just like, look it up. It's like, well, if you looked it up five seconds before you just ask the question, can't you say what reputable medical journal you found it from? How do you not recall? You just looked up two minutes ago. It's just, yeah, that's, that's somebody who's like, oh no, it's probably like, probably bullshit. Probably like, she probably didn't want to answer. She's just like, because it was reddit.com or slash rslash. rslash. Brain structure. Does an a man and woman have the same brain structure? I mean, what does brain structure mean? No, no, those women be shopping. Yeah. Shopping. How is our brain constructed differently? But I don't know. I don't even know what science are trying to reference there. They don't. That's right. I believe it's called science. I believe we're looking at the word you're looking for a pseudo science. Yeah. It's a very specific niche. When I was 16, I learned some things. So I've built my entire life on this fact that I never really looked up. And what does that even mean? The brain structure is the same. Here's the real truth. And that's why you sing on Twitter a lot. That whole lgB kit, everything out of here movement that's going on because a lot of like, yeah, that was called being gay back in the 90s. Yeah. What happened? You know, you know, and that's what's happening. How many people are going from like, my great guys? Yeah. Now it's like, no, no, no, no, you're not gay. You're definitely not. And that's what it is. And it's a keep men week. It's what it is. It's, I mean, it's like my 10 for a hat now. Yeah, please. It's the keep men week. It's it's to keep us docile until they can keep doing whatever they want. COVID was a big was a big experiment and not just the vaccine into how much we're willing to take. And we we took a lot spoiler alert. We're willing to take a lot. I mean, we're from Florida. So we fought back in Texas to too. But you know, a lot of places like, yo, whatever you want, pin me more daddy. And everyone's like, okay. Well, and that's the problem. You know, and if everyone's confused and they don't know what the sex they are, they're not going to know what you're doing. And they're not going to know during their taxes or through their lives or their country. You know, care. It's an overarching thing to try to feminize a feminize all men and masculinize all women. It's very weird. Yeah, I, um, one of one of the other people, one of the other students, we don't have the clip, but one of the other students that he was talking to, um, I retweeted it on Twitter, if you're interested in watching it. But it was, I mean, you, you get sad sometimes listening to these people that this just like, they don't even stand a chance and nobody is guiding them. And one of them admitted that it was two years ago that, you know, your home, your shutdown in the middle of COVID and he's like doing all of this research and listening to these podcasts and decides that he's transgender. And it's like, these were people that are already mentally ill. How much worse did it get when we shut them down? They weren't able to go socialize. They weren't able to go to school. They couldn't go, you know, to therapy if they were, you know, if they wanted it. And now look where it's led. No, and it's, I mean, it's, I design. Yeah, but they say the slippery slope. I mean, it's really gone far where, like we said, these are people of gender dysphoria that are probably on like 10 different psychotropic drugs. So they're disconnected with reality. And I think that's where it comes down to is they say we're based because we're based in reality. These people are based in La La Land. I mean, they're not, they're not in touch with reality whatsoever. They just made it more difficult now. Oh, Mershin I was talking about is they made it more difficult now if you're an older guy 50s to get like, you know, TRT testosterone replacement therapy. They have? Yeah, they're doing, they're trying to pass it. Make it harder. But they're making, they're also at the same time trying to make it easier for women. If you're a kid, it's going to be easier to get testosterone. But a 50 year old man, or a 50 year old man who sometimes say TR, which by the way, a lot of studies. Show you should bring that into the doctor and be like, yeah, we're making her a boy and just keep taking your daughter from months for a year. And they're like, I don't, yeah, you have to give her like, I'm just gonna show some of our jacket. It's not working. It's not working. Yeah, it's not working. There you go. That's how you fight the system. Yeah, I love it. All right, let's take a quick break. We'll be right back. A new report that just was released outlined a whole lot of alleged incidents of Don Lemon treating women really poorly at CNN for like over a decade. One of them, he vented his disappointment at being passed over by tearing up pictures and notes on top of an inside Kyra Phillips desk in the news pod that they shared because she got an assignment that he had wanted. And apparently after that, she received a text message from an anonymous number that said, now you cross the line and you're going to pay for it. The messages were later traced back to Don Lemon. How was that not it? How was that not it? How was he not fired then? Look, as a guy, he was historically had a couple of issues with women. Don Lemon is on a whole nother lap. I've never seen somebody who just hates women. And it oozes through on camera too. He just has that like, even if they just speak up sometimes, you'll seem like, look, basically called Nikki Haley, an old bitch. Like, what are you doing, you're screaming at people? They hate him there. I mean, and you everything that comes out, you could tell. He has taken a lot of little vacations or been on a lot of assignments, which that's what they do with a key to cool off. Well, to be fair, I mean, Don Lemon just loves penis so much. It's hard for him to actually respect women on lemon parties, what I call him. I'm saying he loves it so much. So I think I kind of enjoy his passion for men. He's the ultimate non-simp. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I'm the biggest simp. He's not the truth. And that's also the truth. I really do enjoy watching him live in his own personal hell on like Sunday day shift. It's so fun watching him go, I was like a mutual next time. He's like, I love it. I love it. I love it. He's walking with two women. It's great! I'm looking to look with Rachel Ray. Oh no.
