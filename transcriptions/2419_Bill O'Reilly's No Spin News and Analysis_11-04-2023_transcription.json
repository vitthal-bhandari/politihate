Download and listen on Apple podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts. Get briefed, stay ahead with the President's Daily Brief. Bill O'Reilly, here you are listening to the O'Reilly update coming up next, the news with Mike Slater. Thank you, Bill. It is Tuesday, April 11th, 2023. Here's what's happening today in America, an awful mass shooting. Tennessee rep back on the job, Newsom wants a new job, and female athletes will soon be out of a job. That's all coming up. Then Bill will be here with the message of the day, but first a 25-year-old bank employee went to the bank that he was recently fired from and murdered four people between the ages of 40 and 64. So downtown Louisville, Kentucky, the governor of Kentucky, said the senior vice president of the bank, one of the men who was killed, was one of his closest friends. The murderer was killed by police. Nine other people were injured, including a 26-year-old police officer who just graduated the Academy 10 days ago and was shot in the head. He started opening fire 30 minutes before the bank opened to the public during a Monday morning meeting, and some people were there virtually, so they watched the shooting on their computers. Horrific. The two Tennessee Assemblymen who were expelled from the chamber for their role in some protests last week, while the vacant assembly seat was to be appointed by the Nashville City Council for the Assemblymen who was from that district. Well, the Nashville City Council just voted to appoint the same guy, the guy who was expelled. So one of them's going back. They voted 36 to nothing. Nashville is a blue city. Even Nashville, Tennessee is a blue city. The other reps from Memphis and the county government is going to vote to fill that seat, and we expect them to do the same thing when they meet on Wednesday. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, finishing up his campaign for a democracy tour across red states. He went to Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, and of course, Florida, where he said that Ron DeSantis is going to be rolled by Trump. So he's in red states, lecturing them that they're doing it wrong. Meanwhile, the city of San Francisco, which he used to be the mayor of, the mayor asked for the federal government's help in fighting crime in her city. She said the scale of the problem is beyond our local capacity. So she needs money from the people of Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Florida, among others to help. Meghan Rapino from the US women's soccer team, she's the one with the pink or purple hair who went on to inexplicably become a Victoria's Secret model. She and 40 other women wrote a letter opposed to the protection of girls and women in sports act. This act would require people to dudes couldn't compete against women. And these women are against that. They want men in women's sport. You'll remember in 2017, an under 15 boys soccer team crushed the women's national team five to two. So 14 year old boys. And this is the only thing that will end the madness is just have all men in soccer. Just have one team with 11 men playing against the women. And we'll see how much they'd like men competing in women's sports message of the day with Bill next. Did you know water heaters last about 10 years refrigerators, typically about 13?

The Clarence Thomas thing is illuminating. And once again, shows how wicked the American media really is. The justice allowed his longtime friend Harlan Crow, a wealthy Texan to pick up some vacation expenses over the years. Mr Crow had no business with the court. Apparently there was no Supreme Court eating against that until fairly recently. So Thomas believes he did nothing wrong by accepting his friends large S. It was interesting to see Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez jumped the line in hammering Clarence Thomas, even though she accepted freebies in a museum controversy last year where she was scolded by the House Ethics Committee. But as Barbara Streisand once saying, Misty water colored memories, right Congresswoman. But it is a civilian Harlan Crow really is being worked over. The media painting him as a Nazi sympathizer because he has a copy of Hitler's book mind, Comps signed by the mass murderer. Well, I know this story firsthand because I visited Mr Crow's home and saw his historical collection. Yeah, he has stuff from heinous villains, but that's history. But he has much more documentation and letters, things like that, from American heroes. Nevertheless, the left wing media demonizing Harlan Crow because he's friends with Justice Thomas. I'm Bill O'Reilly. I approve the message by writing it. You can reach me. Bill at bill O'Reilly dot com, Bill at bill O'Reilly dot com, name in town if you wish to opine. Now let's go to the mail. David concierge, remember Bill, you asked to buy his upcoming visit to Ireland helps America. I would say yes, and so he'll be out of the country. But he doesn't run the country. The other people do. It's not going to matter. Greg Bruno, Staten Island, New York. What do you think about a Trump gabber ticket? The problem with Tulsi gabber is she's an isolationist. Be tough to have Trump run with her. James Day, Batavia, New York. What is the going on with the dollar? I'm hearing we're going crypto and digital. Look, I know this conspiracy dollar stuff is all over the place. Ignore it. If I thought there was something to it, I would tell you. Okay, it's just conspiracy BS. Renaud, I'm Ari, Medford, Oregon. And we thought the country is falling apart during Vietnam and everything else going on in the 60s is no comparison on what's happening today. I wish more people would discuss this in some way to drive home the seriousness of it. People know, I mean, the people who live in a bubble and don't pay attention, Renaud, they don't know, but they don't care. But anyone aware knows the division. Theresa concierge, remember, thank you, Theresa. I have never seen this country be in the situation that it is. We can't talk to each other without being labeled a racist. I remember years ago, when conversation between two persons of different persuasion was enjoyable, no longer. I still make fun of my liberal friends and they give it back to me. But I know what you're saying. And I tell people don't even bother. Don't even bother. If you know somebody, you're not going to change their mind. You can refer them here. You can do that. But don't you do it. Mark Jager, Barn got New Jersey. Just watch Killing Jesus on Good Friday, a perfect way to reflect on the day. Killing Jesus, the book and the movie, it's worth a time. In a moment, something you might not know. Now the O'Reilly update brings you something you might not know. On this day in 1970, a third mission to the moon launched from Florida. After a massive explosion in deep space, thousands of people worked heroically to bring the astronauts home. Of course, they never made it to the moon. Here is the story of Apollo 13, the crew consisted of Commander James Lovell, Lunar Module Pilot Fred Hayes, and Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert. On April 11, 1970, the three man team took off from Cape Canaveral without incident. Two days later, the astronauts were performing routine maintenance operations when the main oxygen tank exploded. They were 200,000 miles from Earth. Captain Lovell's iconic statement in mission control, Houston, we have a problem. For the next 72 hours, Lovell huddled with his crew in the freezing spaceship. Mission control spent this time frantically trying to create a procedure that would allow the astronauts to land safely in the Pacific Ocean and spare their lives. A new mission was developed. The team quickly converted the lunar landing module into a lifeboat. It was a rough journey home. Each crew member lost an average of 10 pounds. Hayes developed a kidney infection, but the small vessel carried the crew long enough to reach the Earth's atmosphere. The astronauts blast safely into the Pacific Ocean near Samoa on April 17. It was later determined that a small wiring defect led to the explosion. The design flaw occurred two years before the spacecraft even took off, but it was never uncovered. And here's something else you might not know. In total, the Apollo program cost taxpayers a hundred billion dollars in today's currency, but it might have been worth it. Between 1961 and 72, NASA made the following scientific advancements. Athletic sneakers, firefighters, suits, heart monitors, solar panels, battery powered screwdrivers, nonstick frying pans, freeze dried food, plastic containers, Velcro, wireless headphones, even a miniature vacuum that is now known as the dust buster.
