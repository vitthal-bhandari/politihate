I didn't expect to talk about this this morning, but last night I went to a friend's birthday party and guess who was there? Paris Hilton. The second I saw her, I just felt my body leap over to her. I didn't really think about it. She was talking to someone and that's always awkward. It was vulnerable because I'm just standing there, but then she saw me. We just hugged right away and I felt a connection to her. I think she did too. We felt just connected by all this Michigosh that happened this year. We really talked about it. We got real and it was so lovely. She said, thank you so much for what you said. I felt like you really meant it and it meant a lot to me. I said, I'm so grateful for the opportunity to. It was fun and then I stopped and I was like, fun is not the word. It was fun to it was interesting to look back on all those years ago and see it in a new light from a new perspective as a new person, an older, more mature, wiser maybe, more open person. I said, thank you so much for bringing it up in the first place and giving me the opportunity to make it right to the best I could. Isn't that cool? We're just like, look at us. Just human beings connecting and being vulnerable and letting it all hang out. It was kind of special and then the conversation took a kind of natural end and then I was like, I'm gonna walk over here. I'm a little high. I'm not really sure how to wrap this up right. And that was that. But it was lovely. And there you go. But you know what I wanted to talk about today is I had this idea and it's not some genius idea by any means. It's an experiment. I want y'all to try. I've been trying it. Rory's been trying it and it's so dumb. Before I even tell it to you, I am aware of it that it's dumb. It's base. But it's just very simple. But hey, you know, important stuff is sometimes is very simple. But sometimes it's just dumb. But the experiment is to it's it's just this. Just substitute any word that is traditionally masculine. I don't know. Mankind, fireman, businessman, congressman, right-hand man, may the best man win. I don't know. Best man for the job. Manpower, bunch of guys. You know, we we just for the roast, we get a bunch of guys in the room. Just any of those things that are masculine. Whenever those words come up in your life, change them not to be neutral, not to be genderless, change them to the feminine, not not genderless. I don't want to make it a word that includes everybody. I want to um, this is an experiment in exclusion. You may say, well, how can non-binary people participate in this experiment? Non-binary people can if they want. But my point is they don't need to. They understand exclusion and inclusion better than binary gendered people possibly can. No? So what? Fireman becomes firewoman. Fire girl for all I care. Anything you want, just feminine. Woman kind. Bunch of women in a room writing jokes for the roast. I don't know why that's in my mind. I know why actually. Handy woman, business woman, congress woman, blah, blah, blah. What's the point? Um, what am I trying to prove? I don't know. I'm not trying to prove shit. I don't know what the result is. I don't know what your result will be. But what I'm wondering is if you maybe get a sense of how it might feel to not be a man specifically, um, to only know language through a masculine lens, you know, so, so, so, we've only known language my whole life through a masculine lens to only see ourselves as a an addendum towards that do not include us. And we know that when we say mankind, it means women too. That's, we were always taught that we know that when we say congressmen, it means the women in congress as well. But to never hear yourself reflected back in the words of your language, what might that be like? Might you want to know? So, uh, for my, the fellas in the audience right now, just for shits and giggles, you know, uh, you might want to try it, you know, because for women, for girls, for non binary folk, this is how we grew up with masculine words. It's all any of us knew we didn't know it as wrong. We just, you know, I can't speak for everyone. I didn't. I just, this is what is life. This is not a feminist experiment. It is a language experiment. Does language matter? I think it does. But we'll see. I can't wait to hear, um, hear what you think. You know, there's no answer or result that I am planning or anticipating or hoping for. I just, I wanted you to notice how it makes you feel. I'd be curious to see how many of our male friends out there are willing to do this. I asked Rory to do it. Rory. Rory. And I did it too. And I fucked up way more times than he did. It's, it's funny where I'm conditioned. We're conditioned language conditions us. But Rory was having a lot of fun with it. He said, go woman, Pierce was great in mayor of East town. All right. Rory has a two very impressive skills. I've noticed he, um, he can spot a celebrity fully masked from far away. And it was, it was really impressive on our way to New York. He spot, he spotted John legend. Okay. I feel like a lot of people would be like, even with a mask, you'd go there as John, what you see as little eyes and you know, you kind of recognize him. He spotted Keith David. That's a pretty deep cut right away. And then on the way back from far away, way down the hallway at the airport in masks, he spotted those two actors from Ted Lasso. Um, am I going to get this right Hannah wadding him? Very sexy, very cool, very brilliant. Brett and Brett Goldstein. If you're not watching Ted Lasso, I mean, watch Ted Lasso. It's like I've never seen a feel good comedy with such hard jokes. I mean, he did it. They did it. Anyway, and Brett Goldstein's on it. And it's one of those things where he plays this like stoic, you know, macho soccer player, very much like a straight character in it. And, uh, then you Google him and he's like one of the writers on the show. I love that shit. And he's a comedian, swarthy Jewish British comedian. There aren't many of them, but he's one. Sasha, Baron Cohen, David Bideal. I can pick, I can name three and I don't, I'm not even worldly, but can imagine they're a whole bunch. Anyway, I digress. Oh, so that's a talent. And then Rory's, other talent, which blows my mind. Commercial comes on right away. He knows this celebrity voice over artist. Celebrity voice over artist. All right. That's all I have to say. Let's, uh, listen to some voicemails. Uh, bojuras, uh, I very like to know what kind of scarf and who made it that you wear on the show because it's very elegant on you. And I would like to purchase this one for my fiance. And I will wait for your response on one of you show. Thank you very much. Maybe I see book it. Oh, well, it was the red one and black and very, very elegant. We get awesome. She said, I'm not usually suspicious of people, but I'm going to say, I know exactly the scarf you're talking about because I've only worn one because it was like, you know, and a fashion, uh, you know, it was fashiony for me to where I remember it was like that black blazer. It looked good, but I don't have like other things that look like that. I wish I did because I, I thought I looked really sharp that day. I know the scarf you're talking about. And I got it as a gift, not as a gift from a friend, but it was like gifted to me. This is very interesting. And it on it, if you unravel it, which you couldn't have possibly seen, it says like liberty in French in French. What do you think? I'm a dummy? No, maybe this is a coincidence, but I don't know. I kind of call bullshit. I think this collar, because this guy's French, right? That's a French accent. I mean, I, I haven't heard an accent like that since like Peppy Le Pew. Maybe that's a big dumb ugly American thing to say. I knew a French guy once, actually. Armin Zayner, friend of my mom's great story. This French guy and his girlfriend call, oh, what's that scarf you wore like eight months ago once that had a French word on it that you couldn't have possibly seen? Bullshit. You guys like make that scarf or something. Is that what it is you think Raj? I don't know. I think this collar is somehow connected to the scarf trying to get a little free scarf publicity.

Hey Sarah, this is Laura from Ontario, Canada. I'm a huge fan. I just wanted to call about a caller you had a few weeks ago named Karen. While I agreed with you that her problems did seem pretty trivial and I think she won't recover from the trauma. I do really hate the term Karen. It's kind of become a term that just silences any woman that shows any sort of assertion or opinion and I don't know it just has really been rubbing me the wrong way. I'm hoping that maybe we could work on a more non-binary term for people in general that are just dickheads. Like let's just call them dickheads. I don't know. Just that. Thanks for making us all laugh and think. Bye. Okay, I would say in in my view, you know, the term Karen is not about women speaking up for themselves. At all. In my view, it's it's really about white women whose entitlement stems from a like an unconscious devastation by the threat of racial equality. You know, I'm certainly not consciously so, but that's what I think it comes from. And that said, I don't know that this is the use of the word Karen is something that is meant to be defined by a white woman. So maybe we both sit this one out. Of course, I don't know that you are white, but I'm it's an educated guess. I'm assuming that you two are white or a white colored Jew like me. Let else. Hey, Sarah. This is Jessica again. And I actually had two questions. One was if you ever considered being blonde or tried to do something with your hair that maybe didn't work out quite so well. Because your hair is very lustrous and dark and sick. And it looks like you've never touched it within a kind of chemicals or perms or colorants or anything like that. So that was one of my lighter questions. The other is what experience do you have or opinion with general narcissists? I have had so many questions, but I would like your opinion. Not even in the the comedic realm. So would be. She done? Wow. She really did not feel any pressure to be concise. She's like, how do you say it? Eckhart Tolle, just like pauses, thinking. Um, I would not look good blonde. I have very salot yellowy greeny skin and I would have to definitely like bleach my eyebrows as well, obviously. But I did once try to make my hair, um, like brown, just a subtle difference of brown and it turned into hay, actual hay for a long time. So I try not to fuck with it. I wore it one time. I wore like this fiery red wig and then one of those like masks like, uh, uh, you know, um, who's the guy with a tanto? I'm an old lady. You know, one of those or red wig with all those and I went to a comic con and that was really fun because I just felt free like they just I roamed wherever everyone was in costumes. It was cool. But actually in the movie I just did, my character towards the end cuts in colors or hair. And it's like a, actually kind of like a strawberry blonde, like a, like a red, but not dark red. And it looked okay with my eyebrows. It was like a red that looked okay with black eyebrows and it looked pretty good actually. Great story. It's funny because the woman who, who did my hair and who made hand made this wig for it. She's brilliant and she's really young. Her name is Mallory. And, uh, she's, she's, she's 26, but we were in the, um, hair and makeup trailer and I don't know what I was talking about, but I was like, you know, Danny's about to turn 40 and mobile, well, Von Mallory's 29 and she's like, what? I'm 26. I was like, Oh, all right. Okay. You know, she's like, what made you say 29? And then I was thinking about why I said she was 29. And I just, I think I thought I'm just in a place where I feel like the youngest age is 29. But, okay. So now that's her second, what's the second question is about? Do I know people with narcissism in my life? I'm in show business. Yeah. Including myself. I mean, we, we, I went into a field where I'm trying to get strangers to like me. I mean, that's, that's pretty, you know, of course I try to unlearn the, uh, the bad, the survival skills that do not serve me that, that brought me to this wonderful business, you know, but, um, yeah, I have friends in, uh, show business, beautiful, wonderful friends, some more peripheral friends and we all have a bit of, narcissism, you know, it's an ingredient to being in show business. As I said, you know, we want strangers to love us. But it's funny, like a friend will reach out and like assume I've seen some, you know, gossip online about them. And I've gotten really good at comforting them by saying, uh, I had no idea about it. I saw nothing about it. I'm just living my life. And I promise you that no one is googling your name. And if they are, they're definitely not sorting it by date, like you are. So just truly don't worry about it. You know, every once in a while, I get like paparazzi dinner. If I notice half the time I never noticed, and I see pictures of them just like, where were they? But mostly I just like it really never bothers me because, you know, I, unless someone sends it to me, I never see it. Like I had a friend, uh, you know, an actor who we were both in New York and he's like, let's get dinner. I go, yeah, let's go here. And he's like, well, will there be paparazzi? I go, what do you give a shit? You read Star Weekly? You read, you read us. Like what are you, uh, what does this have to do with your life? X-Tree, X-Tree. Read all about it. Someone went to dinner. All right, I don't know. Here's some ads. Genexa, baby. Did you know your allergy medications could actually be filled with allergens? It's crazy, right?

And we're back. What else? Hi Sarah. Hi. My name is Brianna. I'm sorry. I'm calling from Maine. Just kidding. Love your podcast. I think that your opinions and your views on challenges around the world are very entertaining and get me through the most mundane shit of my day. So thank you for that. I'd like to set up a desert island scenario for you. So you're marooned on a desert island. Maroon. Luckily you have a copious amount of marijuana with you. But you're only allowed- Do I have fire? ...of one snack food. Now you can also have a copious amount of this snack food. Copious. And obviously a cabbie of meal, but rather just a snack to keep those munchies at bay. What would you pick? And why would you make this selection? Thanks. Oh Brianna from Maine. Go New England. You know what? The first thing that went in my head for my snack is something that will expose me for the failure that I am. Because it's cheese and crackers. Just plain old cheese and crackers. Or then I think like mac and cheese. I don't know but what does that expose? I went off the vegan wagon. Oh I'm not proud of it. And I think maybe I'll go back. I listen. I just did a movie in Suffern, New York. A tiny town where it was very hard to eat vegan. And that's not an excuse and I know this is not something animals enjoy. I know that cows do not enjoy being enslaved to make cheese. And I feel terrible, terrible about it. This is my struggle. This is my comp. This is mine and cows comp. And when I say mine, I mean me. I am. Uh I feel real bad about it. All right. Well maybe how about like a sweet and salty popcorn? Know what I like? I don't even know if I'm saying it. Like right. Auntie Anne's. Auntie Anne's. Whatever. Those soft pretzels. Maybe that would be I'd like that. Those soft pretzels. Something like sustin and sea. Zeppoles. Zeppoles. Just hot bread and butter. Maybe milk the day me a butter. Hot bread and butter. That's just like it gets filling. It's sustenance. Yeah. So this is me saying I have been eating some dairy and I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I let you down. It's funny when I like got that collar way back when and ever since then I went vegan and then I talked about it on the show and then it's like all the vegan blogs and stuff were like Sarah Silverman announces you. Sarah Silverman pledges to be you know it's like well I didn't take a pledge and just you know trying this thing that aligns more with my heart. But it was funny because Rory was like and I blame myself. I could have brought a bag of nuts to set. I could have done something but instead I just I broke down. I am an imperfect person. I don't feel good about it. It was funny because I was lamenting it to Rory and he said well you know you have had like more energy lately like maybe your body needs cheese and I was like I don't know that you know I can't imagine a doctor telling me your body needs cheese. You're you're low on cheese. Very oddly I do have I've got low blood pressure. I'm anemic and I doctors tell me to salt my food which is rare I think but um I still don't think you'd ever hear a doctor say you need more cheese in your diet. I did look into the like that blood type diet once. I'm oh positive. I just looked it up because I always forget and so this time I put it in my contacts under blood type. I'm oh positive. So I looked up that blood type diet and my blood type is like red meat blood. You know like just like everything I don't eat I'm supposed to eat everything I eat. They're like no lentils no avocado and I was distraught. Distraught. But then I was like uh you know what I'm just gonna go back to yesterday when I didn't know this. Know what I did? I unrung that bell. Yes I never thought I'd say it. I like to say you cannot unring that bell like Jack McCoy but I unrung that bell. I erased everything I learned about the blood type diet because it truly does not serve me. But I am anemic like the red meat the blood that like that saying that my blood type needs that kind of makes sense because I am anemic but I take a like a blood builder vitamin from mega foods hoping that works. I don't know. Is that interesting? I don't know but you're still listening. What else? Hi Sarah. What are you? What's your opinion on the whole Britney Spears situation? And did you listen to her testimony? Thanks. Love ya. I did. I the whole thing's unbelievable. It's disgusting. She can do a whole world tour and a whole residency in Vegas and work her fucking ass off to make you money. Not you but her dad and everyone but she can't take care of her life. She can't be in charge of her own life. It's so fucked up and there's nothing I can say about it that will be better than what Howard Stern said about it which was brilliant and it's just true. You know he said this is 100% sexism. It's fucking sexism. You see Charlie Sheen was he given a conservator when he was bat shit crazy with tiger blood? No. I you know I mean I can't even he listed an endless list of male maniacs and show business who are out there who were never given a conservatorship. You know Robert Downey Jr. when he was you know on drugs and breaking into houses and sleeping in beds like a like a drug crazed Goldilocks was he given a conservatorship? No. It's disgusting. And the fact that the court did not hear her would not hear her when she said if you if I have to have this can it at least not be my father? Shitty shitty shitty shitty the present doesn't even look kindly on this but certainly history will not assuming Trump doesn't run and win in 2024 in which case all women will have conservatorships. It really feels like this country has just slowly become a majority of untreated mentally ill people. I say this as a lucky treated mentally ill person. But you know then again this is what the right says about the left. I've seen a bumper stickers and t-shirts with it. The liberalism is a mental illness you know so I don't know the hope for this country I think is just it has to be immediate action with the patience of knowing this is long term shit long term solutions. The right solutions always seem to be band-aids you know but this this can't be a band this can't be band-aids this cannot be band-aid based. We need long-term vision education for all health care for for for role mental health a focus on mental health without stigma and starting at an early age too. Without that stuff we're pretty fucked. You know I take it back the right does think in the in the long term when it comes to voters you know the Tea Party because you know when the Tea Party was first around arrogance fucked up Sarah just laughed oh he's crazy people well you know what they did they bred themselves and 20 years later what do they have a sea of more voters pretty wild I think the Koch brothers are somehow involved in that and they educate they have a law school that just churns out right wing whatever who's that guy Walter something on instagram who trolls it's really funny but he was interviewing uh he's very right wing people and he said you know uh no indoctrinating people in school none of this indoctrinating kids in school because that's what they they're saying about like just teaching the truth about race you know and and the history of racism in this country it indoctrinates we're in docket or are talking about gender and and and pronouns or something if we were indoctrinating our kids but he goes no more of that indoctrinating our kids in schools and they're like yeah we're gonna make them say the Pledge of Allegiance every day yeah I thought that was very funny very very funny it's interesting seeing all these people on the right now saying to get the vaccine too you know because what did they realize they're actually losing their audience and their voters to actual death now they want them to get vaccinated it's scary because it isn't just unvaccinated people who are getting sick it is just unvaccinated people who are dying from covid but because they're not getting vaccinated all these mutations are happening the variants are happening and people that are vaccinated are now getting sick with the delta variant but they're not dying and they're not going to the hospital thank god and that's the point good grief all of this because unvaccinated people will not do this very easy call to action for their country to do this for others you know tyla string around your finger to remind you that others exist that you have fellow americans out there that there are children you know because because of them there's no herd immunity and therefore the variants please don't wait for some variant to come that kills our children please I'm so afraid of this people are so goddamn motherfucking selfish shit has to come right to their front door right to their door for them to give a fucking two shits excuse my language too many swears but did you see that story about the nurse in alabama and she was like you know uh all these unvaccinated people are getting hospitalized with covid and the nurses and the doctors initially felt very little sympathy for them but when you are with them and you're caring for them and you see how scared they are and that they're gonna die and that this wasn't you know I just said they were selfish it's not that she said you know it's misinformation there's so much misinformation out there they literally do not know what is true they believe it's a hoax and you know because people go like hey it's a hoax do your own research well you can research anything on the internet and find and get it substantiated somewhere I think I went off topic I don't even remember what the question is it was about Britney Spears so there you go that's my feeling on Britney Spears the worst but uh dad you know what this means when I reference you it means that we are rounding down this is it this is the end this is the end um of the show and this is when I say subscribe rate and review wherever you listen to podcasts and check us out on youtube if you like watching it visually if you like the aesthetic of watching me talk uh you can do that on youtube but either way whether you listen to it audibly or with your eye holes um subscribe or sometimes it's just you like or you follow or you press the plus or you press the check or you press the subscribe button whatever it is do that okay because that's how we get to continue with this fun podcast all right adios adios as Liam Neeson said in a trailer I just watched bye hey hey hey i wanna see hey hey yeah fuck up hey"
