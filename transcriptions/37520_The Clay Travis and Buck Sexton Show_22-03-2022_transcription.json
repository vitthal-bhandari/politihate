Please do check us out there. Clay, we've been talking a lot about the transgender swimmer issue because a transgender swimmer just won the NCAA 500 meter woman's free style. Free style championship and there are some women who are very rightly upset about this because it affected their ability to compete at the NCAA finals at all, which for some women would be a crowning achievement to spending what 12, maybe 15 years of their lives in the pool, training, training, trying to get faster. Me to be at that level as a swimmer is a remarkable achievement for women. And that was taken from some of them. Well, we do have some in this country in elected office who are willing to say something about this. They are not going to stand silent on it. Here is Rhonda Santas put out a statement today by allowing men to compete. Notice he used the term men. He doesn't say biologically gendered previously described males. He says, by allowing men to compete in women's sports, the NCAA is destroying opportunities for women, making a mockery of its championships and perpetuating a fraud. In Florida, we reject these lies and recognize Sarasota's Emma Wyatt as the best women swimmer in the 500 meter freestyle. Clay, you've said it. I've said it's absolutely true. Emma Wyant is for all intents and purposes, a gold medal winner number one for women in the NCAA 500 meter freestyle and DeSantis even spoke out on this today. The NCAA is basically taking efforts to destroy women's athletics. They are trying to undermine the integrity of the competition and they are crowning somebody else, the woman's champion. And we think that's wrong. And so in Florida, I'm going to be later today because this is a Floridian who I think deserves to be recognized. We're going to be doing a proclamation saying that Emma is the best female swimmer in the 500 meter freestyle because she earned that. And we need to stop allowing organizations like the NCAA to perpetuate frauds on the public. I think he's totally correct. Totally right. Man, this is an example of how to fight back. I mean, it really is. Now, this is not something that is, but you and I have been fighting on this a lot. Outkick has been aggressively covering this story. And in fact, we had an article up over the weekend congratulating Emma Wyant, who I believe is from the University of Virginia swim team, and would have been the 500 meter women's team. And it's a 100 meter women's champion, but for the inclusion of a transgender swimmer. And so I get, I didn't know she was from Florida credit to Ron DeSantis and his staff because I think that gives a, oh, with like a no brainer effect to the decision they're making, because it is a Florida native who was deprived of a 500 meter. I think it's meter. Sometimes I screw that up, but the 500 she would have won. And I will, by the way, is Twitter going to ban Ron DeSantis for having this opinion? I mean, I never know that Twitter is trying to defend this, this Leah Thomas story. They may well suspend Ron DeSantis's Twitter account for proclaiming that this 500, this other girl would have won or this girl would have won the 500 meter. And this is the kind of battle that we're in right now where the party ostensibly of science book. Let's emphasize this. The same people who are lecturing all of us through Dr. Fauci, you don't believe in science when we say, Hey, you shouldn't wear masks. Or when we point out that many people who are double vaxxed and boosted, ie Jen Psaki, who just announced that she had tested positive for COVID again. Many people who are double vaxxed and boosted are still testing positive. The party of science, in quotation marks, is refusing to acknowledge biology. And by the way, this swimmer still has male genitalia. Sorry if there's kids out there, but walking around in a women's locker room. When you still have by you're still biologically male and you're competing against. Just think about it. Take it outside of transgender issues, Buck. What would happen? I coach Little League sports. If I showed up for our 11 year old baseball team, and I had a 16 year old with me, and I tried to play that 16 year old in 11 year old boys baseball. Everyone, and I tried to play that 16 year old in 11 year old boys baseball. Everyone, every parent at that field would reject what I was trying to do. Because in athletics, we try to have people compete against other people like them. Ages are paramount. High schools, we have different sizes. Boxing, we have different weight classes. All of these things are designed to increase overall competition. But can you imagine if I just showed up with a bunch of 16 year olds, they would kick the crap out of the 11 year old boys. Because they're older, bigger, stronger, faster. I mean, what would happen if the 16 year old says, well, I identify as an everybody would say that's absolutely absurd. And the absurdity of this is in many ways, I think becoming more and more apparent to people. The arguments in favor of this are rooted in the negation of reality and mob madness. And such that even some Democrats, I mean, Fox, I know, Clyde played this over the weekend, a video of three women who are protesting the Leah Thomas swimming quote victory at the women's championships. Here's what these women who all claim to be lifelong Democrats said. I was historically liberal. I mean, I'm a walk away Democrat. I am a lifelong registered Democrat who ultimately feels politically homeless. I would say I'm politically homeless now because I don't think the Democrats care about women and girls. The Democrats are not even acknowledging women as a sex class now. Now men can have babies, men need abortion. It's no longer even a women's issue. I cannot be a part of this party anymore. That doesn't even recognize my sex class. I know a lot of historically liberal people, especially parents who have felt like they needed to walk away from the Democratic Party. And I don't know who they're going to be voting for in the new and same next elections. Welcome to reality and welcome to voting for Republicans. It's just a question of time because if you insist on living in reality, you're not going to be able to pass. You're not going to be able to vote in good conscience for these leftist loons of the Democrat Party. And I mean, Clay, at some level, you bring this up with the the existence of Leah Thomas's male genitalia and the changing on a regular basis in front of in front of women. You know, you think about, you know, indecent exposure, for example, right? If you walk up to somebody who does not want to see that part of you, you get arrested. You get arrested for this, right? Because we have some understanding that this is this is in a front to a person's dignity to have to see this. Although these days in New York City, I mean, you know, there's all kinds of stuff going on and it feels like nobody gets arrested for anything here anymore. But in general, you can be arrested for this. There's been, I think, all along an exploitation by the left of conservative kindness and courtesy. This is how they've gotten it even to this point. Oh, come on. It's a be nice to everybody. Be inclusive. Just use the just use the preferred pronoun. This is just about being nice to people. Why won't you be nice to people always in the context of whoever the trans individual is deserves your kindness and simply by all, all, all people, including trans people, including trans people deserve our kindness, sympathy and decency. What they leave out of the conversation, though, is what about the women in the locker room? How is it kind to them? How is it kind and courteous to tell a woman who's been swimming her entire, you know, life that she can basically remember? Sorry. You don't get to have your peak athletic experience. You don't get that gold medal that you earned. You don't get to be even the NCAA finals, which you earned. That's that's discourteous. That's unkind, but they don't even talk about it. That's why women who are actually, they think they're feminists are realizing, hold on a second, the wires are crossed here. There's something going on. Well, and this is why also the entire concept of inclusivity is in many ways a lie because the very inclusion of Lee at Thomas is excluding women from being able to compete at the highest level. So when we talk about inclusion, we're also talking about exclusion, excluding women who otherwise would be able to perform at the highest level. I believe this woman, woman swimmer, give her credit from Virginia Tech spoke out and said, Lee at Thomas, a man swimming against women, cost me the opportunity to compete for a championship. And this am a lion that Rhonda Santas is giving the proclamation for would have otherwise won. And let me say this to Buck that all those women we just played discussing how they feel politically homeless. There are a lot of people listening to us right now. I guarantee you who don't identify necessarily as conservative, who don't identify necessarily as Republican. They identify as team sanity. They want for America to be sane again. And I know Donald Trump ran on make America great. I think 2022 and 2024 make America sane again is actually something that appeals to a huge number of otherwise Democratic voters to a lot of suburban women that went against the Republican, went against the Republicans in 2020. And we want you to be listening to us. We are a voice for sanity in an insane world. And I don't take that lightly because I know we have an incredible privilege on this show, Buck. You and I get to come on for better or worse. And I know sometimes you don't agree with everything that we say, but for better or worse, we have the privilege every single day for three hours of saying exactly what we think and fighting back against the voices and rising tide of insanity in this country. And I know that a huge number of you out there listening to us right now feel voiceless and feel as if you are surrounded by that insanity and you come to us for three hours every day. And we try to do our best to make sense of the world. And we welcome all of you, regardless of how you may have voted in the past, because I really do think there's a new lineup that is occurring in American politics. And it's not necessarily, in my opinion, Democrat versus Republican, it's sane versus insane. And the Democratic Party is on the side of insanity and awful. I mean, I think the party is kind of a line on, you know, same versus insane these days. This is what we are seeing and we could go through and do go through, I think, a lot of the ways in which that plays out through policy. Jen Psaki, I don't think it's a story when anybody has COVID anymore, but this one is kind of funny because she's going to be fine. First of all, she's going to be fine. We wish her a ski recovery. And she'll be, you know, she'll be sipping tea for, because I had it. You had it. She'll be sipping tea for 24 to 48 hours and she'll be, you know, back on the on the soul cycle in, you know, three days, probably anyway. But it's funny because you have to, if you're a lib, you have to sing that are required to in a second. The second you get COVID, we all know you must say something and we'll actually play that for a week. Come back. There will be a time when you're considering the purchase of gold or silver.

Welcome back in clay Travis Buck Sexton show. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us news that is out there as we tease you in advance. I'm not sure if you're interested in this. I'm not sure if you're interested in this. I'm not sure if you're interested in this. I'm not sure if you're interested in this. I'm not sure if you're interested in this. I'm not sure if you're interested in this. I'm not sure if you're interested in this. I'm not sure if you're interested in this. I'm not sure if you're interested in this. I'm not sure if you're interested in this. I'm not sure if you're interested in this. I'm not sure if you're interested in this. She also said she had two socially distant meetings with the president yesterday. He's not considered a close contact as defined by CDC guidance. She said she got tested in preparation for travel to Europe and she had a positive test. She has now tested positive twice for COVID buck since October despite being double-vaxed and boosted. Of course, as is required in the liberal playbook, she is saying the only reason that she's not having any issues with COVID is because she did not because she got vaccinated and boosted. Whereas, you know, I've had COVID twice zero issues with it either time and I'm still not vaxed or boosted. But this to me is a harbinger, Buck. You had the J&J. By the way, I was going to say I'm essentially now. I'm cast out and have been for months from the vaccinated community, sir. The J&J vaccine now, the the triple and quadruple vax. Look at me like the the unloved the unloved peasants of the vaccine community. So it doesn't really count. And everyone knows the J&J. They basically said after about 60 days, as soon as the Omicron came along to like, well, J&J doesn't do a damn thing. So I was on Spirit Airlines Sunday flying back from Las Vegas. And I laughed when I boarded because I was thinking about the perfect description of your J&J vaccine as the Spirit Airlines of the vaccine community. Which one of your buddies said, which is fantastic. But I do think this represents, by the way, larger context. We're having a lot of famous people testing positive again for COVID. And I mentioned earlier in the show that cases are now back up over 20% in New York and starting to go up elsewhere. I think we're headed for another. I don't know what the surge is going to look like or how much more pronounced it's going to become. But we are we have hit the I think the low point of COVID cases in the wake of Omicron. And if you look at the historical data, which we now have two years of, typically the states like Florida are going to go back up in in in April and May and June and July and starts to get warmer there and people move inside. Can we put a marker here, Clay? Do you think we're going to go through NBC, the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN again saying, Oh, Red State. Oh, this is what happened with all their icky COVID this summer. They're so icky. They don't mask up enough and all this other. Do you think they're going to do it again? They're going to try them in terms of a third straight year. I think they're going to try a third straight. I mean, how why wouldn't they write their so out of their minds anyway? What difference does it really make to them at this point? You got Fauci appearing back on. I mean, this guy, what's it going to take for people to realize that this whole thing has just been such a scam, such a sham all along. But yeah, I think you're right. I would, I would co-sign that when I do think that we have, there's a likelihood here of in this summer, it's not going to be from Biden. It's not going to be from the top Democrats the same way, but the media will be like, Oh, Florida didn't get their booster. That's why they're, and then we're going to come into the winter time in New York. So I'm going to be like, Oh my gosh, it's COVID everywhere. It's the same thing every time these people cannot get out of their craziness loop. I think what they're going to try to avoid for the craziness loop is bringing back masks because they know that it's going to be a disaster for them. Everybody blames Biden now for COVID as opposed to Trump. We'll talk about that a little bit more here coming back.

We really appreciate all of our subscribers. And with that class, I want to say, I don't want to dive into this today because I think there's going to be a continuing story. I want to get some calls. But Peter Schweitzer, who's an investigative journalist, has done a lot of great work on particularly financial corruption in American politics. The Clintons, he was great on Clinton Cash. And here he is talking about, because this is going to be something that I think gets, I'm just going to say, I've been told by people that are very close to the whole 100 laptop thing that there's more coming. I don't know what exactly that, I'm being honest, I don't know what that means, but I know some people who say there's more stuff coming out on that and the future of the 100 Biden. Are you getting nervous now about your steak bet? I don't know what the poll say, Mr. Travis. The polls, so a final result, you've got them and you have them in front of you right now. It's not favorably received for me. For those of you who missed yesterday's show, I predicted that Hunter Biden will be indicted in some manner criminally in the next year, in the next year for this laptop related to the laptop related investigation, but disagreed. We put up a poll question. We have a high end steak dinner on the line. That's right. Maybe even maybe even some Kyoto prefecture where they massage. I'm going with one of those cows where they massage it with the beer clay and they price it by the ounce, buddy. All right. So they still have the girls who come out and lay on the table. Wasn't that a New York thing with the sushi in the high end restaurants. I'm not aware of this. Oh, yeah. I'm sure you've heard of this. I don't know if that's still permissible in the video. I don't know what Mr. Travis is speaking of, but I will say that might be the place that I pick when I win this bet is what I'm saying. So we can have a high end steak and also some some women laying naked with sushi on top of them on the table. Will Hunter Biden be hit with federal criminal charges? No, tell them when that's going to cost buck. In the next year, Clay and I have a bet as you know, the options were yes, Clay is so smart. No buck is always right. Clay is so smart. Got yes on this one, meaning Clay is Clay says he's going to get indicted. People who agree with that 18%, 82% agree with me. We had 8,200 votes. So we'll see, man, for you, you're calling now. Now if we were doing odds here to be fair, if we were really placing bets on this, which you know, we've already made our little bet over steak dinner, but it really, you should probably get because you're much less like that's a much less likely outcome based on what, what the overall betting would be. So you should probably get like two or three to one odds on that one, but we're just going to leave it at a, at a straight. That's why I'm getting the sushi. That's why I'm getting the sushi on top of the state. Oh, you a Toro guy? I don't know how much of our audience likes sushi, but I got to tell you the Toro, the Fatty tuna is always so expensive. You're like, am I really? It's always worth it. Fatty tuna is always worth it. I love seafood. I like everything. You know, like I'm trying to think right now on where we could be going out to dinner and somebody could be like, Hey, do you want this kind of food? I'd be like, no, I can't. I can't rock with the, with the organ meats. I, that's where I draw the line at the organ meats, the various, I don't even, you know, you know, sweet breads. There is nothing sweet or bread like about them. I will have you know. So yeah, like the, what's the stuff from Scotland that's haggis? I mean, you know, that's not, I've never even seen, have you ever even seen that on a menu? Why? In Scotland is the only place where I ever was. I, when I was in Scotland, I studied abroad in England because I was confident I could handle the language differences there. And, and when I love Scotland went up there, by the way, speaking of Scotland, how awesome is JK Rowling in the transgender battles that she fights on a day to day? Have you, I started following her on Twitter. She is fearless. She holds the line and will not give it inch. And look, she's a billionaire who's got, um, don't give money. Don't give a what money. Yeah. And, uh, you know, she's, she's decided that as somebody who says she cares a lot about women, this is actually now a women's issue. And it isn't fascinating that in so many other areas of life, there, there was a burrito store, like a burrito restaurant that was shut down in Portland a few years ago. Oh, I remember this because people were so upset that it was a white guy chef and he was appropriating, you know, Mexican culture. Well, that was the whole thing. This has happened in other places. Portland though got particularly insane over stuff like this for well, because of all the food trucks and the food scene there. So everywhere we have this notion of the appropriation of culture as, which I also reject as a concept, but I'm just saying they use it because culture is meant to be shared and diffused and everything else. Uh, somehow appropriating gender never occurs to the left, but there's an appropriation that growing your hair long is not an appropriation of gender for a man seems to be a strange disconnect from how they feel about food hairstyles by the way now. You know, there's a lot of, you can't wear your hair a certain way if you're, you know, white versus other ethnicities without people saying you're appropriating cultures, all kinds of stuff. Well, think about it. I mean, you could argue since white privilege is the thing that everybody wants to get involved in on a day to day basis, uh, and cultural appropriation, everything else. Isn't it the ultimate white privilege for a rich white kid going to an Ivy league school to decide that he wants to become a woman and then to become the greatest woman swimmer in the process? Like if you were going to argue white privilege, a white guy deciding who's attending an elite academic institution like Penn, wealthy family that he's tired of being a man and instead wants to be a woman and when a women's championship would seem like the ultimate white male privilege. I think if you were really arguing something since we are speaking about, and this is a seamless transition since we're speaking about, I guess it makes it less seamless when you say it out loud though. I'm going to, I'm going to note that. You know what I mean? It's like, it's like when you say a funny joke and after you're like, ah, my joke was funny. Like it's like not as funny when you say, um, but the mayor of Boston. Yes. You see this one, the mayor of Boston speaking of white privilege. You have the privilege in this country. If you are white to count on, on anyone who is a lid. They don't have to be widening me anything. Just thinking it's hilarious to dump on white people and whiteness. This is, this is the only group that you're allowed to make fun of in any way you want, however you want. And here is the Boston mayor, Michelle Wu, making a joke. Ha, ha, listen, I won't lie. This past winter was pretty intense. Trial by snow, trial by fire, fighters union. I'm getting used to dealing with problems that are expensive, disruptive and white. I'm talking about snowflakes. Snowflakes. I mean, snowstorm snowflakes. I mean, she's saying the firefighters are white and she's dealing with white, you know, white people problems. You would never hear a politician say this about any other group that I'm going to fill in the blank problems for this in a way that's mocking them ever. Imagine if a politician said I expense, whatever the three things she said expensive, uh, and ended it and black and then was like, Oh, ha, ha, that's just a joke. Like that person would never be able to be involved in politics again. And they'd probably get kids would probably get kicked out of school. I mean, I mean, it would be unbelievable. The outrage and look, it's attempted joke. It's a bad humor. The funniest thing I've seen the Boston mayor, Bucky. I think we talked about this. Do you remember when she was trying to do the Instagram live and the comments were going to be like, Oh my gosh, just trash. Just crushing her. It was a man having the mask mandate and everything else. And she was like, Oh, we're running a little late. I guess her guests didn't show up. And so she was like, I'll take a few questions now. And there was just, yeah, I was like, why do you suck so much? Why do we still have a mask mandate? Bostonians have a pretty fantastic and salty sense of humor when they hit it right. Bostonians can be a really funny bunch. And they were, they were lighting up that, uh, that stream. So yeah, look, I think that it's fascinating. We're in a country now where if you were, if you were to decide whether you were accused of, let's say, let's say you're 30, let's say you're 30 year old clay, trying to make a career for yourself in media. And you have a choice between someone saying that you said when you were 16, you know, the word that we can never say. Let's just say it this way. Yeah. Like you were just saying along to a rap song, not even, yeah, whatever it was. You sang along to a rap song. Yeah. You say, say the word along to rap song, but you said it and they know you said it at 16 or committed vehicular homicide at 18, which would be more damaging to your career, man, you know, involuntary manslaughter because you were drunk driver, which would be more damaging to your career. I think the first one means you don't work again. I think the second one is, Hey, no one's perfect. It's such, it's ridiculous that we could even have this discussion, right? I think DUI, I think you could argue you're probably better off to get three or four DUIs than to have sang along with a rap song with the N word in it when you're 16 and have that video circulating. I mean, and that is crazy. So to my analogy, professionally, it would be more. Okay. DUI, you say you think the man's lot is too far? I mean, you know, involuntary. I'm talking about someone who gets drunk and obviously hits another car. They kill a person by accident. Yeah. Right. So you think that that is more damaging to your career 12 years on than saying the word that you're not allowed to say it is. I think the death might make it, but I'm not even sure. I'm not even the fact that you're not even sure which people who have killed people in car accidents. I'm not sure everybody knows this, but they continued being famous afterwards. That is a thing. Yeah. No, there's no doubt. I think the drunk part of it. I think the invo the vehicular manslaughter or whatever. If you were speeding or something, plays really lawyering this one up. He's like, my client, we got to look at the D.D.O. Well, I'm just thinking about it three or four D. The fact that you could get three or four D.U.I.s and would be better off professionally without a shadow of a doubt than having sung along to a rap song when you were 16 and having that video circulating is evidence of how bonkers the world has gone right now. Agreed. Completely. Agreed. There you go. All right. We'll close out the show next, but in the meantime, I got to tell you our nation faces real challenges. And we spend a fair amount of time right here trying to discuss them and solve them. Election integrity is a big one. Big tech censorship. Another one. Mask mandates, border security, two more. The liberal response to adversity is always to strike down individual liberty and implement more government. The conservative response is to remind people individual rights or a cornerstone of our nation's promise to its citizens.

Let's take a couple of your calls. Justin in Southeast Georgia. What you got for us Justin? Yeah. Hey, thanks for taking my call. I won't take up too much your time. I just wanted to get your guys in thought on the idea of the Republican party maybe distancing themselves a little bit from Donald Trump in order to pick up some of these politically homeless people that we were talking about on the last segment. Someone like a Rhonda Sanchez or even a Tulsi Gabbard I think would piss the liberals off to no end. We're going to support on this program. Whoever the nominee is for 2024 and whoever the Republican nominees are in 2022. Buck and we've talked a lot about this particularly for the midterms. If you believe in freedom you have to vote for the Republicans in 2022 and if you believe there should be consequences for all the COVID lies that were spread you have to vote Republican in 2022. What we try to do and this is kind of a big picture discussion. We try not to pick sides on this program when it comes to intra Republican battles if that makes sense. And so it's so hard to forecast who's going to run in 2024 and we'll have an entire year probably of the campaign season and everything else to decide who the nominee is. All we can tell you is we are going to zealously advocate for Democrats to lose in 22 and in 24 because we care about the country and that has to happen. So I don't like and I know you've kind of feel the same way Buck. I don't like trying to tear down anybody in a Republican primary because it shouldn't to me be our responsibility to pick a side in those. We let all of you pick sides and then when the real battle between Republicans and Democrats arises you know which side we're going to be on. We are a battleship of conservatism. Our guns will be trained at the enemy and we will allow the Republican base to make its determination about who's going to be the first wave on the beach so to speak. Right. I mean this is we're not we're not going to be the ones that are doing any intramural tearing down or fighting. We want to just promote our side our beliefs and and try to honestly help save the country. That's the point here. Amen. And here's what else I would say Mitt Romney is probably the most blandly inoffensive man in America today. And I'm not saying that today. I used to call him rich Ned Flanders just so you know. Yes. I think it was pretty apt. That's a very good analogy. And what I mean by that is by the time he was running against Barack Obama Democrats turned him into an awful racist misogynist wound. He was giving people cancer after kicking them out of their jobs and stealing their dogs to put on his roof for long trips. Yes. So my point on that is I understand the argument of X candidate would appeal more to other people and I and I can see that argument play out. What I think you need to keep in mind is by the time you get to national politics you are going to be defined by the Democratic Party as a vile inhumane wretch of humanity. So you could I mean and I'm saying that you could pull mother Teresa back out. Yes. And she would be a sexist you know homophobe misogynist before all was said. There's a very clear litmus test. If someone is a is a Republican standard bearer in our current political environment and the apparatus of the left does not absolutely hate that person with the fire of a thousand sons and suggest that remember they've already started to say about the Santas worse than Trump and I just want to say that's what it would be will be worse than Trump including Trump running again because I'll say that now he's even worse Trump than the last Trump was completely out of their minds. So there is no world in which you have somebody who opposes Democrat power that is not being called a you know a racist who's worse than Hitler destroy the country hates minorities xenophobic all hates women hates pets. I mean hates everything right. I mean this is this is what they're going to do. Buck they called Larry Elder a black man the black face of white supremacy in the LA Times when he dared to run against Gavin Newsom. If you can call a black guy the face of white supremacy then there's really no level that they won't stoop to in order to define you now having said all of that I do believe that whoever is running in 2024 and I know we're talking a couple of years out and certainly this is going to be the case for this fall to the story needs to be the failure of the Democratic Party not whoever is running in 2024 does that make sense and I think that's an important distinction because Biden's failures are the story got to make that the story not whoever the Republican is now you have to have an antidote a way to solve those failures but we don't want the race to turn into a referendum on the on the Republican it should be a referendum on the party in power as opposed to the party out of and we have a process the process will play out but right now the most important part of it is that we get that that red wave that red tsunami that you know those waves those guys ride off the coast of Portugal where they have to tell them in with a jet ski we need an electoral red wave like that it has to be oh my god you're actually gonna go near that thing on a surfboard anything short of that clay and we're gonna be sad amen well hang out with you tomorrow thanks for hanging out with us today on the play in buckshough clay Travis and Buck Sexton on the front lines of truth with the lucky land sluts you can get lucky just about anywhere this is your captain speaking yeah we've got clear runway and the weather is fine but we're just gonna circle up here a while and get lucky no no nothing like that it's just these cash prizes add up quick so I suggest you sit back keep your tray table upright and start getting lucky play for free at Luckyland sluts.com are you feeling lucky no purchase necessary void we're prohibited by law 18 plus terms and conditions apply see website for details hi it's Carol Markowitz I'm so excited to launch my very own podcast we'll talk to the biggest names and politics news entertainment and get to the truth of the issues that affect your family and have some fun along the way it's the Carol Markowitz show part of the clay Travis and Buck Sexton podcast network new episodes drop every Monday and Thursday on the iHeart Radio app Apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts"
