    "text": " Hey! Hey! Hey! I wanna say hi! Hey! Yup! Fuck up! Hey! Hey, everyone! It's your Jewish friend Sarah and welcome to the show. Let's get right to some voicemails! Hi Sarah! This is Amanda. I'm thinking about this huge shift in perspective on the way that our society looks at gender and how we are embracing this gender neutrality neutrality. And getting away from the black and white of gender, the blue and pink of gender, and I think it's very cool and very exciting. But then at the exact same time, there's this widespread epidemic of gender reveal parties. Isn't that weird these two things are happening in parallel? I don't understand. Gender reveal parties really are odd. I just watched a video about a guy who cut open a cake and it was blue and he found out he was having a boy and like the excitement in his face. He ran around like headbudding people like I think he probably could have crushed a beer can on his head or something just in excitement. And like God, imagine if it had been a pink one. I don't know. Anyway, something that's on my mind. I'm not really into gender reveal parties. Let's just stick with baby showers. I don't know. Hey, I hope you enjoyed this message. I love you. Bye! Sure. Yeah. It is interesting. I mean, there's always, it always is kind of an equal opposite like pendulum swing, you know, happening like, yeah. As we start seeing gender as this antiquated thing that means less and less in terms of who we are as humans, of course, there will be those of us who almost out of a sense of survival cling to the meaning of the human being. And so, I think that's what I'm going to do. The meaning we had always assigned to them. You know? It's interesting. I believe the word dichotomy might fit into a question like this or an answer like this. Yeah. All right. What else? My name is Lexi. I'm a welder fabricator in Arkansas. Wow. I work in a shop with 20 or odd men or so. And the only woman in the shop as well. And I had an experience where I ran into my boss at a pop-up bar this past weekend. He was intoxicated. I was not. He then proceeded to make some comment about how I looked sexy as hell. It made me feel weird. I promptly left. And it kind of ruined my whole weekend. I then went to work this morning, told a few of my trusted coworkers about the experience. And they laughed it off and just kind of said that that's who he is when he's drunk and no big deal. And you know, not even a sorry. Not even at. Oh, my gosh. Like how awful. And I guess I just thought that I would, you know, have earned their respect to have my back whenever I told them that it made me feel really uncomfortable. So I guess I'm just from a woman to another woman in the male-dominated industry. What are some tips where I'm not constantly full of rage and want to set everything on fire and burn it all to the ground? I love you tremendously. Thank you for everything that you do. And thanks again. Bye. I'm having trouble with this one. I want to be on your side. I am on your side. And I'm sorry that you were made to feel uncomfortable. I was often sexually harassed and objectified in a time where I had to shake it off and keep going. And I even think I, for a while, I just became one of them in a fucked up kind of way. The wanting to burn it all down. I do know that feeling. And I believe that it comes from something deeper that this event triggered. And I think you should figure out what that is. I'm not saying that what you're bossed was appropriate at all. It was not. And after being triggered by that, you didn't get what you needed from your workmates, which wasn't a lot. Just like, oh, that's fucked up. I don't like that. And I'm sure them not giving you what you needed, your workmates made you feel wildly isolated as the only woman there. I do know that feeling. And this is not me saying, find out what's wrong with you at all. But there is something deeper there, something historical. Something maybe from your childhood where you were not able to protect yourself or defend yourself. And you need to identify it and address it because doing that is going to give you the tools to deal with shit like this more than I can give you those tools. And I know this from experience. I know that rage, especially around any kind of injustice. And it's just it's not as useful as it feels. But getting to the source, that's going to get you major tools to deal with bullshit like what happened with your boss. I think, I think, I think, I think, I really do. So good luck. Let me know what happens. What else? Hey, Sarah, this has been Love Your Podcast. I grew up very evangelical and I have been doing some reflecting and it just kind of crazy to me how growing up as a kid, liberal people were seen as the enemy. And to us, liberals were evil and they had this really bad agenda. And they were just not good people to me growing up. And since then, I've left that world behind. I am myself am liberal now. But I have to say thank you to you because when I was in my late teens, you tweeted something along the lines of I really think Jesus would want millionaires and billionaires to pay more in taxes than teachers. And you were one of the first liberal people that I was like, oh, yeah, that's definitely true. So thank you for helping me start my journey of leaving evangelicalism behind. Love your podcast. Thanks for what you do. Wow. Thank you for that. That feels so nice to hear that I may have affected you in a positive way. And that you accessed me. A lot of us are in echo chambers. We're not even, we don't even see what other people are thinking or saying, we're just told who they are and we shield ourselves from it. And maybe just because I was a comedian and I would, you followed me or, you know, but you did that just to make this clear. It would be good on me, but you did the hard stuff. You made the choices that have given you the life that you've made for yourself and you should be very proud of the person that you are. I'm proud to have tweeted something that you saw and thought about and that maybe that opened your mind to new things. I have many people to be grateful for for that same stuff at that same age. You know, as someone who's older than you, I like to think that that's my job. Our job is to help people who are younger than us move through life in a better way, a healthier way, a happier way, a way that works for them. Maybe, I mean, I'm full of shit, but there's something there. What else? Here's some ads. Chime, baby. No one likes waiting on a paycheck, especially when you got bills due. Good thing there's chime.

How do we be well in a sick society, meaning how do I stay strong and do the right thing in the midst of a family that is dysfunctional and doesn't understand boundaries and freaks out when people set boundaries, even though I've thought them through and talked them through and approached them in a somewhat spiritual manner. My family just does not get it and wants to continue the dysfunction. And I don't know why I'm asking you for help, but you have nice eyes. And that's enough. Be well. This is Dave. Dave, I don't know. Do you mean the family you grew up in? Like your parents and your siblings, you sound like an adult. Or maybe you live with them because of COVID. A lot of like college age kids are like moved back with their parents or living with the home they grew up in. I don't know. I need more information. Get a roommate. Move out. I need more information to help you, but you seem to have a good head on your shoulders. I'm not too worried about you. There's some kind of, you know what? There's a form of martial art. I should fucking look at this up before I talk about it, but you can look it up. I can't remember what it's called, but I learned about it on The Walking Dead. It's, you know, it was like Lenny Marcus, that actor on it. He had a big stick and he could fight the zombies with it. And somehow it's like he fights with it and it's a kind of martial arts that uses your opponents weight and force and inertia. You know? I don't know what it's called. I don't, I don't remember, but I think of that when I, it comes to clashing with family for some reason. Like maybe there's a way to go with their flow and focus on the common ground instead. I'm sure they know how you feel and you know how they feel. It doesn't look like either of y'all are going to budge. So you're going to fight and change nothing or you're going to find another way to connect. This may be up to you. You know? There's a lot of things we can connect on. Most bass TV. Y'all watching succession, walking dead, pen 15. It might be that's not the best, but it's so good. What we do in the shadows that though it's a, it was a movie, but this, I think the series is even better. It's just like vampires, modern day vampires living like as roommates and Staten Island and it's so fucking funny. There you go. Maybe? I don't know. What else? Hey Sarah, this is Brittany. I just had a quick question. What do you think about doing some sort of travel show like Anthony Bourdain? I think it would be amazing. You would make a lot of people happy and you could start Norway and then go to other places. Just thought. Have a great day. Bye. That's so funny. Honestly, I should just like do a travel show. That's a tour of finding the collars into this show. I mean, it's like what do we got? Jordan. We had Egypt, Iran, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, New Zealand, Australia. Where else? I mean, just, I can't even believe where the calls come from. It's very fun, but I think that's actually a very good idea because I'm so interested in other people and other places and other cultures and I'm not proud of this, but I'm incredibly unworldly. I'm way too old to be how unworldly I am and I'm a comedian. I mean, I travel all over this country completely. I've seen a lot of this country more than the average bear. All comedians have. My job relies on travel. So unfortunately, when I'm not traveling, I love being home. But I have not spent much time in other places, other countries, other cultures, but it's a really funny idea because I think my mind would be blown by the world around me and I get a nagging feeling that I really need to see the world now while I'm still, you know, nimble. I just, I don't have a very adventurous palette and I'd have to pack a lot of peanut butter and jellies for sure. Does that make sense? Yeah, I just, I don't, I don't like much food. I have the palette of a 10 year old. So yeah, I just like bring a lot of cliff bars and PB and J's. What else? Hi Sarah. I love your podcast and I love your little cameo in the movie Don't Look Up. I thought it was a great film and I'm glad that you were in it for a second. Anyways, I'm calling today because I'm a public education teacher and like many other teachers feeling a little undervalued here. You know, coming out of this pandemic, going into the pandemic was hard and then coming out of the pandemic going back into in person teaching was also hard. And it's fine. It's what I do. I love to teach, but what's difficult for me and many other teachers is that we're, you know, it's the lack of respect and appreciation that we get. And for instance, our district is refusing to give us cost of living raises, even though they have the budget to do that, but they are choosing not to not use it for what it's intended for. And it's just such a shame because teachers end up leaving their profession and students lose out on great teachers. And, you know, I feel like when we don't invest enough in our education system, we have the society that we kind of saying now there's tons of misinformation and people lacking the critical thinking skills to combat that. Anyways, I was hoping that you could touch on that for a little bit. And thank you so much. Love you. Love the podcast. Thank you. Teachers are fucking heroes, except for the ones that suck. But my God, that fucking disgusts me, honestly. I mean, these people that say like children are children, but the children. And then they skimp on education and don't pay our teachers. We're the richest country in the world. I just, it makes me insane. And paying people well ultimately saves money. I mean, people need a living wage. Ultimately, it saves money because first of all, it puts more money into the economy. And ultimately, if you're not paying people a living wage, they're going to get subsidized federally anyway. It's just an endless cycle. Just God damn pay our teachers. They're teaching our children. But the truth is, yes, there are some really brilliant people in politics, but an alarming amount of our representatives are just really basic base stupid people. I mean, I know that sounds just so rude to say, but just truly stupid people. And they have a lot of power because we live in a country where money is power and not knowledge. And it's embarrassing. And I'm sorry. And I value you. I mean, come on. It's just like that old bumper sticker like, I'm not going to call it right, but it's like, why doesn't the military have a bake sale to raise money and the government funds the teachers? I don't think that's exactly how it is, but it's get the general idea. All right, what else? Here's not many people realize this, but having a consistent nighttime routine is so important. A better tomorrow starts tonight. When I miss out of sleep, I need at least 20 hours of sleep a night. And that's the truth. Then I have like, for four hours, I'm superwoman. But I need good sleep is what I'm saying. Introducing Beam Dream. Beam is the world's most innovative functional wellness brand with unique products for everything from sleep to recovery.

So lately I've had an urge to wear it. And I have to admit it's a little bit of a provocative thing for me and that itself just seems ridiculous. I mean, I'm really wondering, so I'm a liberal. I've always identified as a liberal. I think I'm more absolutely center left at this point, if not center. So what's up with the American flag these days? And why does it feel within the liberal community as if this is some kind of, I mean essentially flying the rebel flag? Where are we at? I remember back during the Bush years that, the W Bush years, being told that if you're an American traveling overseas, do not wear an American flag on any way, shape, or form because it was kind of perceived at that point as being essentially a fascist dog whistle. People would, and I don't know if that was that ever true or was that just a liberal myth to make us feel guilty? Okay, time limits up. Thank you. I get this question. You know, I understand what you're saying. And I look, the flag represents the flag. It's our nation's flag, you know. It's been commandeered by a lot of people on the right. And I think there's value in kind of taking it back. But I think the reaction that you've gotten, that you've seen, you know, I had a boyfriend years ago who put up an American flag. And I talked about it early on in the podcast, put up an American flag in front of his house. And I was like, what are you doing? And he's like, putting up the flag. I was like, why? He's like, because I love America. And like, yeah, I couldn't argue with that. I don't know why it was so unsettling to me. And I called my sister Susie and she said, oh, yeah, I mean, yeah, it's like any kind of nationalism is going to be set off like kind of alarm, alarm bells in your body as just as a Jew, like nationalism is kind of scary. And we react to those gestures of nationalism in that way. It's just kind of a knee jerk way and it makes sense. But I also, I love American iconography in that way in our that our flag, what it represents to me, what it represents to others, what it represents to other countries, what it represents to other Americans is all is different. And you know, in that way, it kind of makes it art. It's a symbol. It means what you want it to me. I mean, obviously I wouldn't say that about like a swastika, although it is like, isn't it like an Indian symbol of peace? Now I'm looking at it is, but I mean, I think the more popular version or the more it unfortunately not sees made it famous. So it's like, you can't go like, I mean, peace. There's a peace sign you can use. But yeah, it's it's a flag of this country, you know, use it how you want to use it. Take it back. If you, you know, like if that's how you're you said you're using it kind of facetiously or like as a I can't remember what you said, but yeah, it's it's it's yours as much as it's anyone else's. I mean, listen, Colin Kaepernick. Kneeled, you know, to the during the what's this? What's the patriotic song they do at the NFL, whatever, you know, the flag basically kneeled to the flag to honor the freedom of speech that our soldiers fought for so that he could peacefully protest the violence against black Americans. What pants what Trump what Trump's followers decided it meant has nothing to do with the truth of what it meant by the person who did it. And he told us over and over again what it meant, but that didn't serve them. So they had to just not hear it. I don't know if this is answering your question or anything that you're looking for other than it's okay to wear the like American flag stuff if you want to. And what it means to you is what it means to you. You know, and I know that like, you know, this kind of gives like people who want to who love the Confederate flag, you know, licensed to take what I said and apply that to that. And that's fine, but it's not analogous. I mean, there is no one ideology tied to the American flag per se. There's a difference between, for instance, the German flag and the Nazi flag. But at the end of the day, there are just flags. They're just flags or pieces of cloth. They aren't anything. They're just symbols made of cloth. Teams and illusion of oneness and yet of separateness. I guess. Am I still talking? What else? Hey, Sarah, it's Mike sitting around smoking some weed. Good. I enjoy listening to your podcast. Just curious, what's one of your favorite meals that you like when you're high? I don't mean snacks. I mean, an actual meal. I'm going to say sliced curry chicken for me and maybe some dim sum and sticky rice. Ooh. Anyways, just wondering what you like. You know, my answer is going to include snacks because when I'm high and even when I'm not high, I tend to eat like just a plethora of snacks as my meal. Anyway, my brain goes to hot grape nuts, scoop of vegan vanilla ice cream. Oh my God. The best. It's like eating the crumble part of like a apple crumble or something. So good. Ugh, but it's kind of good for you. I also love popcorn. I'll make a big popcorn, put a milkadamia butter, like a tablespoon of it, melted on it. And then I splash some, it's called amino acids. It sounds like acid, but it's called amino acids. It's like the company's called Bragg with two G's amino acids. It's basically like soy sauce that's maybe a little better for you. It's still hella sodium, but I put amino acids on it because I like my popcorn kind of wet and also it gives it like a lot of flavor and oh, that's so good. So I put another thing I put on everything is this mix of all these tiny different seeds, like chia seeds, hemp seeds, all this stuff that Tig notaro makes and she gave me a huge jar of it. And it's basically like instead of salt, it seasons just anything you have and it's just, it gives you so many excellent nutrients for your human body. What else? I also made like a, these are health, I'm trying to eat healthy snacks. Obviously I also have a lot of chocolate. I like Lindor chocolate truffles. I'll have a banana. I'll have a couple halo oranges. I'll have, I made like a healthy nut mix. Like I read online all the like healthiest nuts, bought them all, put them all in a big Tupperware also included pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and tons of dried cranberries, which Rory bought in bulk and we make a joke that we're out of dried cranberries because it's just the biggest bag you've ever seen in your life. How many dried cranberries can you eat? It turns out a lot. And then I shake up the Tupperware and now it's just like a perfect mix and then we have a scooper because Rory doesn't want me to put my dirty Jew hounds right in there. I added the Jew part because you know we like to center ourselves. What else? Hi Sarah. My name is Adam and I have a TV question for you. Now if I've been listening to your podcast for the last several weeks, hearing you rhapsodize about all the various TV shows you've been enjoying lately. I've been thinking to myself, I wonder if Sarah used to watch Taxi because Taxi is my favorite sitcom of all time. Even to this day it's my favorite and for my money it's possibly the greatest ensemble comedy in television history. And I can just see you as a little shaver up in New Hampshire, like late 70s, early 80s watching that show enjoying it and maybe getting a little inspired to move to New York yourself one day. And just yesterday I found on YouTube an interview that you did a few years back with Glenn Whipp of the LA Times in which you come right out and say that you love Taxi. I was like, yes! I was so happy to learn that we had that in common. So Sarah, please tell us a little more about your Taxi fandom. What did you like about the show and what does it mean to you? Thank you. And let me just say in parting that you make each day a special day. For us your podcast listeners, you know how by just your being you. Goodbye. Beautiful Mr. Rogers dismount there. Yeah, I loved Taxi. I want to go back and watch some taxis. It's just the best wedding ensemble. You're so right. And there are so many classic episodes. And there's so many great besides the brilliant cast. Great guest actor appearances from Rhea Pearlman who's Louis de Pomma's love interest and Charlene Woodard and maybe my favorite episode, one of my favorite episodes where she plays Nina the new Cabbie who's in love with Alex and she's just filled with just everything you love about New York City embodied in this actor. And she's still acting like crazy today. I see her and stuff all the time. I always get so excited. Jeffrey Tambor was a big guest star on that show. There's an amazing episode with Ruth Gordon again with like Judd Hersh Alex Rieger or she makes him as like her personal driver. My friend Henry Phillips who's a brilliant comedian, please check him out. And he also made two movies about comedy. I'm in one of them. They're both amazing called Punching the Clown. And the second one's called Punching Henry. Really in terms of movies about comedians, phenomenal. Anyway, Henry Phillips, you're saying why are you bringing up Henry Phillips? He was not on Taxi. No. His father was a great character actor named Bill Wiley. And I have actually talked about him before on the podcast, but he was on an episode of Taxi where he played. There was an episode where I think that the Cabbies were on strike and they all had to get different jobs. And Elaine got a job as a secretary to some executive and she couldn't find who it was. And it was played by Henry's dad, Bill Wiley, who just sneaks under the radar and never says anything and just to keep the status quo of having a job. And she inspires him to speak out and say his opinion. And then of course he gets fired. But he was also on cheers. He would come on every once in a while as a tour bus, a tour guide, bus driver, who would bring the tour, the tour to cheers so he could get a beer. But he was up for the role of cheers, of a coach rather on cheers. And he turned it down. This is just what's so brutal about show business. He turned it down because it was just a pilot. He didn't know if it was going to, he didn't know it would go on to be one of the great sitcoms of all times. And he had a job shooting at the same time that was concrete. So he took that instead, which was like the bad guy in Porky's too. So unfortunate. But what a great actor. And they still used him because they loved him so much. And we wouldn't have Woody Erelson if he was coach because he didn't die. Woody replaced the original coach. He was so brilliant. What was his name? I want to say like Nicholas Castellano or something. I always post that scene in one of the very early episodes between him. And I think we played it on the podcast between him and Alice Beasley, who is from Moonstruck, who plays his daughter. It's just so beautiful. I've posted it a couple times. You could probably easily find it. Am I still going on about taxi? Yeah, that's what I got for you. But yes, I love taxi. And we have that in common. What else? Hey, Sarah. It's your best friend Portland from Missouri. I hate to give away that much information because everyone's going to know who I am now. But fuck it. If you're listening to this podcast, you're cool as hell. So my daughter is an eighth grade about to move up to high school and has told me openly that she has already experimented with cannabis. What do I do? Because I know that she is going to continue down this road. Do I help her along the process? Do I ground her ass? Do I drug test her? Like that all seems insane to me after having been a user since I was 15 and gaining nothing but benefits from it based on the exact same reasons that she has. So I know you're not a parent, but if you were or if you could go back in time and wonder what your parents could have done different or better, like what the fuck am I supposed to do with kids and smoking now? It's legal, medically, but not recreationally. And I love your fucking face and feel like I'm talking to my best friend when I listen to your podcast. And I love you. XOXO. Well, I do have an opinion on this though. I have no children and really I'm not qualified to give you an opinion on this. But I would say in my opinion, you're already doing a really great job in that your daughter is letting you in. She's being honest with you and she is telling you stuff. And I think that's huge. I think it's really key for her to know that she can tell you absolutely anything and it's not going to get her in trouble. I think the worst thing is when kids find their parents unapproachable and they learn to hide shit from them. So I feel like you're already ahead of the game. I also think like a big mistake parents make is saying like drugs are dangerous across the board. Like all drugs will kill you. All drugs are dangerous because inevitably what happens is a teenager is going to try pot and they're going to find that it is not dangerous. And then they're going to think that drugs are not dangerous. When if you go listen, you know, smoking pot, it's not great for your lungs probably. It's certainly a million times better than cigarettes. But pot is not dangerous but can get in the way of your life. Meaning yes, use it medically if you need it recreationally as a treat. Sure. Or if it's actually something that makes you even like I believe Seth Rogen smoking pot all the time is what his body needs to be baseline normal because he is absolutely productive on it. You know, he can focus, he can learn lines, he can write, he can he does everything on it and he's incredibly productive and lives a healthy normal life. But I think a lot of people the downfall of weed is you know, don't make it your job. Don't make it your lifestyle. Don't become a stoner. But yes, enjoy weed or enjoy the benefits of it medicinally or recreationally sure. Then you can just say listen. Heroin cocaine, they will kill you. There's no casual use of these drugs. They will kill you. You will not kill you but you have to make it a treat. You know, just be honest. You know, maybe a five milligram edible. So there's no smoking your lungs to, you know, I think Vapes, I find them to, I think they're actually bad news. But yeah, smoke it. A water pipe I believe is like maybe the healthiest way to smoke. I don't know. But like the fact that she can talk honestly with you eventually she's probably going to bring up to like delics in which case maybe you provide a very safe haven for her and her friends like when she's a little older or just tell her like it's a real fucking experience. So make sure you're not like in a car or using large machinery at all, you know, in a safe space and. But I think you're really already ahead of the game. Just by having being a parent and having a daughter who feels absolutely safe telling you everything. What else? And good luck. What else? Schleppy, we are winding down. We're wrapping this thing up. Don't be surprised. I'm giving you fair warning that this is ending. This is the time in the show, Schlep, where I say subscribe, rate and review wherever you listen to podcasts. And check us out on YouTube if you like watching it. So long."
