    "text": " Bad government and bad policy can literally be deadly. Almost 100 people died in Hawaii's Lahaina fires. The most wildfire fatalities the country has seen in the century. But months on from the event, it seems like the media and local and federal governments would rather we all forget what happened. I'm Lauren Chen, and to uncover the truth about that day in the aftermath, including through exclusively obtained 911 calls, the Blaze and I travel to Maui for this first-ever Blaze original documentary. And this is just the start of Blaze Originals. A new docu series featuring your favorite Blaze TV hosts as we investigate the most important regions of our national theater covering groundbreaking issues and standing in the void left by the elimination of investigative journalism. Watch what really happened in Maui, a Blaze original streaming now on BlazeTV.com, and use the code Lauren plus to save $36 off your annual subscription. Today, more damning evidence that gender affirming care is actually kind of the opposite of life-saving. Mayor Pete finally visits Ohio and it doesn't go well. And Kyle Rittenhouse is sued by the man who admitted he pursued Kyle with a gun. We've got all of that and more coming up, but it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and white matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez. And a new study from Mercy Catholic Hospital in Pennsylvania shows that trans patients who undergo hormone therapy are up to seven times more likely to have a stroke than those who aren't prescribed hormones, six times more likely to have a heart attack, and five times more likely to develop a pulmonary embolism which comes with a significant rate of fatality. That's not all. The study also showed that people taking hormone replacement therapy had significantly higher rates of hypothyroidism and substance abuse disorder. This is, of course, on top of the studies that have existed for years showing that transgender people using hormone treatments are more likely to develop certain cancers, more likely to have liver damage, blood pressure, and blood clotting issues. But the potential risks of taking hormone therapy is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the dangers of enabling mental illness. Because once these people go under the knife and mutilate themselves, women chopping off their breasts, men cutting off their penises, their unhappiness with themselves isn't cured. Post-op trans people are still up to 20 times more likely to commit suicide, more likely to have depression, anxiety. Really strange that they call this type of gender-affirming care life-saving treatment when each phase of it makes you more likely to die. So why then are even our top medical experts pushing young adults and even children into a treatment with often devastating irreversible side effects? Well, newly released emails between the now-assistant Secretary of Health, Admiral Rachel Levine and Pennsylvania Children's Hospital, Dr. Roland Ornstein sum it up quite succinctly as we've known all along, it's all about the money. The biological male pretending he's a woman, Levin, who at the time was the acting Secretary of Health for the State of Pennsylvania engaged in a back-and-forth with Ornstein about how to convince the clinic to hire a social worker because of the financial gains that could be achieved due to the increase in surgeries. Now remember, Dr. Ornstein is a doctor at a children's hospital. Here we see Ornstein asking Levine as I'm trying to convince the administration about the need for a MSW Master's in Social Work position specific for the imminent gender clinic, I'm trying to put together a presentation regarding potential revenue, including downstream. The info from the 2015 report is great, but I believe insurance has changed since then with more coverage for surgery than previously. Now according to the National Association of Social Workers, one of their jobs as a transgender advocate is to push insurance companies to cover these surgeries. So the email is of course referencing the payout the hospital would be receiving as a reward for mutilating mentally ill people. Levine responded, you should be able to fund a MSW for evaluation and therapy for pediatric and adolescent patients in a program such as you do for the eating disorder program and is done at the children's hospital of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, presurgical consult for patients under 18 will most likely be limited to FTM top surgery that would be young women cutting off their breasts and that might be a rather limited group of patients, but Ornstein wasn't done. She writes again, I am trying to give them some numbers to help them realize the eventual ROI for this necessary position. Even if the patients under 18 who go for surgery might be limited, the patients we start with will eventually be over 18. So I still think it's worthwhile. In other words, don't worry if we don't get them as children. We'll get them when they're legal since we've already pushed them into this lifestyle and we will all profit greatly from it. Now if you watch this program, you already know this isn't the first time we've heard directly from the medical experts themselves that they are pushing these surgeries for financial gain. Vanderbilt hospital doctors were busted on tape calling the mutilations big money makers. Johns Hopkins Hospital is openly lobbying for insurance coverage for these surgeries so they can reap the rewards. With the hospital system so corrupt, it's a good thing we have such a mentally stable and competent leader over there at the Department of Health overseeing it all. Such a great example of beauty, grace, femininity. Mm, look at this right here. Look, can we show Barry? There he is. So much so this this subject of grace, beauty, elegance, that Miss Rachel is going to be the subject of an upcoming children's book celebrating women. Yay! The description of the book reads, As the first openly transgender government official to hold an office that requires senate confirmation, the first openly transgender four-star officer in uniform service and the first female four-star admiral in the commissioned corps, Rachel Levine faced many obstacles throughout her life but she persisted through them all and showed kids of all genders that they can succeed in their dreams too. Because who better to show young girls that they too can achieve their dreams than a mentally hideous man and now I want to vomit. Here to help me make sense of all all this that's going on. We have Supergar, host of Stu Does America and Matthew Marsden, actor and producer extraordinaire. This is a clown world. I'm like there are so many things I have to say about all of this transgender movement, the money being made, the doctors who are mutilating these patients out of greed and it's just that I have a hard time formulating sentences without having to use my swear jar. Well here you go. Thank you. You know if women had a good run, they had a few years there. If you guys would have done your job we wouldn't have needed men to step in and do all of your feminine duties for you like Rachel. It's really a fascinating thing and you think about Rachel Levine who I think is the deputy deputy? Yeah, assistant secretary. Yes. But like aren't we all 100% sure that Rachel Levine is going to get the main gig at some point? Yes. There's only promotion from here. There's no way that anything, unless it starts stealing luggage. I mean other than that it seems like that's the only way that this career arc can slow down and there's no reason to believe Rachel Levine is more qualified or as qualified as hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of other medical professionals. In fact it seems to be quite the opposite because all we ever hear from Rachel is hey you know we should be doing more to convince children that it's okay to change their gender with gender affirming care which is the strangest term ever as it does the exact opposite of affirming the actual gender of the person. It's really a stunning thing and it is almost parody. Like you know I've been doing the show with Glenn now for over 20 years. Wow I'm sorry about that. And it's amazing that I'm still around. But like we would use things like this as targets for parody 10, 15, maybe even five years ago. Say yeah and then eventually they're going to start naming transgender doctors to be in charge of children's health. And then here we are. All of the things that we used to satire are now just reality. It in some ways beside all of the destructive effects of this it makes the world a little boring because you can't exaggerate for effect anymore because everything that is crazy is already here. You're right. He's right Matt. He is right. I mean it's these are first world problems. You know you don't see them anywhere else in the world. You don't see these things where people are becoming transgender. You know I think like in Matt Walsh's documentary you see people like they're laughing at are you ridiculous? Like the people in Africa. Yeah right that's not happening. That's stupid. But now I mean as you said Stu we are at a place now where this is like seriously damaging. Like it's moving past like any kind of like whatever you know that they're just a minority. You know it's ridiculous. We all know that it's silly because it is. I mean it is it's make believe right. And now it's getting into damaging children which as we've said many times on this show like this is should absolutely be in a red line for everyone. And it's kind of like not really. You know people just we've seen this before off air that everyone just kind of carries on with their life and as long as it doesn't really affect you. No it does affect you. It affects everything about you. It affects what your kids are going to be up against. Like you said this is five years. Where we're going to be in 10 years. Where we're going to be in 15 years. When where are we going to get to the point. When are we going to get to the point where airplanes are going to start falling out the sky because of people filling quotas. It's funny because on that on that little piece you put it's like it's almost like they want to go out and they have to have a win as in it. It's the first blah blah blah. And the first do do do do it to do this and the first blah blah blah. It doesn't matter like that that is not a qualifier for someone who's good at their job that they're the first doing xyz. Right it's almost like they have to go along and tick the box instead of saying well look are they the best person for the job. Like really. Are you telling me that that is the best person for that job. I mean would you give that person would you let that person babysit your kids. I'm sorry I mean this is I mean look. No because as soon as you were done with them they'd be just too hard to have right now. I'm too insecure about myself to allow this beautiful woman to babysit. No. No because you would know at the end of you know you come home and your kids would be convinced that they were trans because that seems to be all that they're concerned about is making more kids trans and how can we be pushing more kids into this lifestyle and it's just so frustrating because you get called a bigot you get called transphobic if you say look there's a new study that shows that pushing people into this hormone therapy makes them seven times more likely to have a stroke makes them six times more likely to have a heart attack and this by the way this type of heart attack that it makes them more prone to is like the worst type of heart attack that you can have it's the most severe right. So it's like I'm actually really concerned for these people for the children specifically but like also for the mentally ill adults who are not getting the help that they actually need and who are in a very obviously vulnerable state and you guys are pushing these treatments on them that make them more likely to end up dead. I'm sorry that makes me transphobic I feel like it's the opposite. Yeah no I think you're 100% right and I think there's a larger issue here with the Biden administration and then the left in general which is like for a long time ago right there was a thing that people in the United States did far too often which was to consider let's say skin color as the first thing they looked at when they were hiring someone and then after that they would consider merit and then we all went through a period where we decided that was a really bad construction right we shouldn't do skin color first we should just look at merit and now the left has tried to drag us back into that same exact construction we will first look at skin color and then merit right you know we will still look at sexuality and then merit we will look at any number of characteristics and you see how bad these diversity hires are I mean Kamala Harris obviously isn't the best person to be vice president of the United States. Karan Shah obviously isn't the best person to be vice president of the United States. Hey Peter Pete Buttigieg is obviously not the best person to be transphractic. I mean the Biden campaign specifically mocked him about not being able to fit Phil potholes they were mocking him during the campaign because he couldn't do this one thing which was like the only thing he did in South Bend there's a hundred examples Rachel Levine's another one Sam Brinton I know where to talk about later another one you put people if you look at characteristics immutable in some ways and maybe with Rachel Levine not so immutable but characteristics that are not fundamental to job performance if you do if you look at that first and then after that you've sorted out 99.9 percent of your options and you're like okay there's four people who kind of qualify which one should we choose there's no way you're going to get the best person merit has to be the number one thing and honestly the only thing it shouldn't be about skin color or gender or sexuality or any of those things just judge people on how good they are at doing their job that's all that's it that's the beginning and the end of the process that's all it's supposed to be you shouldn't be judging people negatively because of these characteristics but you shouldn't put them ahead of the line because of them either that's wrong and you wind up with a crappy organization like the Biden administration is right now well what we do I think it goes back to parenting if you go back to parenting and you look at the participation generation right where they say you know everybody gets a trophy every another and no winners no everyone no there are winners actually and there are winners in life and there you know what you can figure out a lot about who you are by what you're not good at actually you know you can figure out a lot that you know you will not make it onto the basketball team if you're not good enough and that transfers so if you want to do something in life if you want to be an engineer or I guess what you got to work really hard to get there and then you'll get the qualifications which those qualifications normally in like science based like STEM stuff is shown that you are competent at doing something yeah right because then if you want somebody to build a bridge you want someone that knows what they're doing so the bridge doesn't collapse because in the end there's more destruction and harm that comes from that and what we're seeing now is more destruction and harm coming from people they're enabling people because they don't want to hurt their feels that's what it's about well you can't live in a world where you don't offend someone it just doesn't it can't the world just doesn't work like that it doesn't and it can't functionally so like I said now we are we are really getting to the point where they're cutting they're mutilating children I mean I remember when there was a big push against the female genital mutilation saying like this has got to stop now it's like hey come over come on we can you got 20 years of experience of doing this come on we'll hire you it has to end else you know there literally will be buildings that fall over there'll be planes coming out the sky because people are not being told no you are you are not qualified for that right you that is not who you are that is not is what that is not what you are and that's okay go fight figure something else out but what we do is we're enabling these people and it's not fair on them yeah like you said the end of the day there's harm that comes from that yeah every korean jump here press conferences like a plane crash it's like a plane coming out of the sky it really is really is and by the way I would like to point out later in the program we are going to talk about one of those diversity hires mayor Pete i'm sorry pothole Pete but we uh we're gonna take a quick break we will be back with more with uh kyle rittenhouse actually want to thank our sponsor first patriot mobile so thanks to all of your support patriot mobile really has emerged as one of the leaders in this parallel economy and they've got some really really great news if you guys haven't heard they now offer service with all three major networks so if you are still with one of the big three mobile carriers and you like their service but you really hate that they're taking a portion of your bill they're donating it to left leaning causes every month you really need to try patriot mobile they offer a performance guarantee so if you're not happy with your coverage you can switch between the three major carriers for free there's no risk to doing this well i mean you could risk that like you're actually going to fund uh causes that you actually believe in because that's what patriot mobile is going to do they are america's only conservative wireless provider they're going to offer the same coverage and they're going to take a portion of your bill and they're going to donate it to uh i don't know companies that support uh the second amendment they're going to donate it to making sure that um uh all of these school boards are overturned these liberal school boards and they've had a lot of success with that as well you got to try them out you can go to patriot mobile dot com slash news get free activation with the offer code news that is patriot mobile dot com slash news so kyle rittenhouse is uh being sued again this time by gauge growth growths who uh you may recall testified during uh kyle's original trial he was one of the men who kyle shot in self-defense um and he testified in the trial that he pointed a gun at kyle and advanced towards him okay and now he is suing kyle rittenhouse uh he's seeking economic losses damages for emotional distress humiliation loss of enjoyment of life and other pain and suffering on all claims this is kind of a playbook from john huber uh who of course is the father of one of the men that uh kyle also shot and he is suing kyle along with the wisconsin police department i mean they're just they're just targeting everyone here uh so gauge i guess is following in the steps of this other suit and i wanted to bring kyle on himself uh kyle who is a good friend of mine uh kyle i want to talk to you about this because it seems like completely frivolous that this man would testify under oath that he did pursue you with a gun and now later turn around and sue you okay can you shut some light on this absolutely it's ridiculous the lawsuit does not mention how mr gross scoot's pointed at me how mr kuber made me with the skateboard it's just it misses it's missing almost 90 of the facts of what happened and it's completely BS it's ridiculous it's stressful and honestly i don't even know what to say about this lawsuit it's just it's disturbing to see that the courts a lot of people get sued like this yeah i mean it does seem like they are just trying to just drown you in legal bills absolutely so what i think they're trying to do is they're trying to use me as an example and they're trying to put me in this mountain of legal debt so i can no longer defend this lawsuit and i don't want that to happen they can't we can't let that happen i mean it's not just you you know there are are people in the past who have uh you know exercise their right to self defense and then they find themselves uh you know getting arrested they find themselves in legal trouble it does seem like uh the new tactic here is to make people too fearful to defend themselves at this point that's what it seems it seems like okay if you're acquitted in a criminal trial you're found that you justifiably defended your life we're gonna sue you for everything you're worth we're gonna drown you in a mountain of legal debt and we're gonna make sure that you can never support your family and that you have no money the rest of your life and pretty much put the fear of defending your own life and like that you're gonna get sued if you defend yourself so you know i i i realize that this is a lawsuit and i don't um i just tell me if you can't answer the question but i had a thought on this so they're suing you for emotional distress couldn't you could you file a countersuit just like suing them for emotional distress because i mean if you want to talk about you know uh economic losses damages for emotional distress humiliation uh pain and suffering on all claims i'm fairly certain you could make quite the case that um you defending your own life resulted in you actually undergoing all of the all of these you know distresses and economic damage and so i'm just wondering if you've talked to your attorney about the possibility of you actually filing a lawsuit against against gauge i think that's a conversation i'm going to have to have with my attorney yeah um so that was was a good pc answer kyle i see what you did there you um so so okay so i want to dispel something that i know we've dispelled on the show previously but um when you tweeted out your gives and go for this mountain of legal debt that you are incurring um i i retweeted it and and i had a lady who said well i mean this seems a little greedy doesn't it this guy probably has millions from all of these you know defamation suits that uh that he's won i don't understand why he's asking for our help could you please help me clear that up once more kyle i haven't filed any lawsuits i haven't won any lawsuits i've been actually busy defending lawsuits and spending all the money that i that i make and that is donated trying to get over these these lawsuits they cost a lot of money and yeah i i haven't made any money um so thank you because it's very frustrating to hear people like i mean i just take all those millions that you made from the view and why don't you spend it on this um so yeah

britajaj finally decided to visit east palestine ohio and he was met by savannah hernandas reporter for turning point and also good friend of the program uh she pressed transpritations secretary pothole peat and uh this is very very bizarre exchange between not just people to judge but his press secretary who apparently did not want to do the like the one job that she was hired to do watch thank you so much mayor p why did it take you an entire two and a half weeks to actually get here to respond to east palestine will you apologize to the residents of this city for for the the slow response to the government slow response you have any apology i'm this press person i can go i'm just press charge i'm sure i know i can't i can't can we ask why it took him almost three weeks to get here i'm sorry i don't want to do this on camera what was his personal time off while there was a tragedy happening here and coming also as to why it you know he waited until president donald trump came here to actually make an appearance this is a very important question that people across america would like to know i'm happy to have a conversation with you i do not want to be on camera well please put cameras away i'm sorry we're on a public area uh so we are allowed as press and you guys i would like you guys to turn your cameras off you're on my camera well i'm on a con camera i would like your cameras to be off and then i'm happy to talk to you guys well if you are the press secretary of the secretary the department of transportation don't you think you should be able to ask questions from the american public that you serve i would like to do it without the camera on can i ask why i think that is a little bit aggressive why is it aggressive i'm on behalf of the american people i'm just asking why he has not been here until donald trump he's asked three several times to then turn the cameras off and they will not do it well they she's been able to walk away would you like to go inside i do not i will walk this way can i ask what the secretary is going to do with the picture of jenny care he took her the other day when he had to choose us and question i'll ask him to be seen i'm happy to answer your questions i would like you guys to not have your cameras on i have my camera up a minute ago if i turn it off you all have your cameras on i can see them you guys i'm happy to have this conversation i don't understand why what is the job of a press secretary if not to go on the record with an official statement from whatever department you are representing like i want to know how she got hired because we know peat is the diversity hired she clearly knows someone is friends with someone like how in the hell did she get to her position because she clearly is not equipped to handle it why would you not be able to go on the record with reporters with the press it's literally your one job i don't is it because she's worried that she's going to get caught in a lie could be uh certainly could be uh she certainly engaged with them long enough to like i mean you're already on camera yes you go to answer the question now there are like you know like communications departments are made up of a bunch of different types right now she's the press secretary usually that person's the most out front um there are some people in communications departments that don't typically go on camera don't like it and try to avoid it but she's standing there with them for minute after minute after minute after minute and she literally said when when savannah was asking peat she literally said i'm his press secretary i can answer your questions right she volunteered yes very very strange uh and uh you know again it's it's she also has nothing to say here right they've done nothing but it's been a terror they've done a terrible job and it's hard to answer questions from the press when you know you're trying to answer questions from the press about something where your boss has sucked right like it means it's been terrible uh since day one with this thing and i would it's not even fair to say he was terrible since day one because he didn't do anything for multiple days so day one didn't even exist to beat buddha judge uh it is a fascinating exchange though because you know look if you don't want to be on camera you know i mean she's not legally required to be on camera she could just walk away instead she sits there and just like keeps i mean you're on camera you do understand now you're saying on camera so either walk away or answer the questions would you rather just be sitting there saying i'm not on i don't want to be on camera on camera or would you rather answer the stupid question on camera that's probably the right path uh just but again they don't they have any interest in helping right like this is not they're only in defense mode and you could see it in her eyes something came out to the story came out today i think it was in politico that had sort of the back behind the scenes to type of stuff in in the buddha judge camp and they are just horrified about how this has gone i mean they you know just the other day a week or two ago washington post released a list of the top democratic presidential candidates uh and number one was of course joe by needs the sitting president number two was not come laharis it was pete buddha judge and like they've gone from that to this so it does seem to be you know they're on a sinking ship or a derailing train like it's just like how is it possible it's almost incomprehensible that all of these idiots found each other and decided to hire each other and now all exist within the biden administration i i genuinely it truly is incredible to me that there are so many people that are just completely incompetent at their jobs and we're all paying and we're all paying for them mmm congratulations i would answer this question but i'd like you to turn the camera off and quite frankly i find you both aggressive i mean come on i mean excuse me excuse me excuse me an angry santa over there like he needs to back off as well but but it's like officer officer officer she's filming in a public place like shut up it's like you are a press secretary that is your job it's like me turning up on set and saying oh act but you got to turn the cameras off i mean it's part of the job right you don't get to say no and like you said it's so right she spends like five minutes telling him how they shouldn't be filming her wow they're filming right it's like it's happy it is i don't know what what you know that you have a murder of crows what is it for like a collection of morons i think we should find a find a name for them like a collection please put your answers in the comments below what we should call them like a pete of morons or you know i don't know but uh but yeah i mean it's it's ridiculous and this is what happens when you elect idiots to to positions that they shouldn't have i mean we should have adults in the room when you're dealing with things like chemical spills i'm sure you like you were i think i think what you know we all know the way that works in politics right is they get together go hey listen i'll back off running against you if you'll give me this you know whatever it is this title they don't have any qualifications for doing it at all and the funny thing is is when they they leveled this accusation at the trump white house as well when a lot of the people that they put in place in the trump white house actually ran businesses and actually knew how to run things that they weren't career politicians uh but now you realize what happens when actually crap i didn't know swag off me it's the fan right you want competent people in place to deal with it and they just can't like it's it's it's you can tell they're panicking and she's like yeah she's like a karen right it was like you guys only had three weeks to come up with something to say you still have nothing yeah they can't because it's look like i told you off air this is way worse than what people realize it is like this is a very very serious situation down there in ojio and they are panicked because if people actually knew what was going on down there this would be a massive massive disaster yeah and it's been really interesting to see uh you know the other side of this which is of course the press i mean uh you know some reporters as you see are trying to get to the bottom of these stories but very few and like i my impression of the press for the past i don't know 30 40 years is every single time a company does something where there's a possibility that there's some negative side effect they all turn into erin brockovich right like it's immediate erin brockovich mode that all they're doing is interviewing random people in the streets like what's wrong with you what are you smelling it's like that weird that's how the media always handles this story every single time except this one for some reason this time they're like ah the company said it's okay go home drink the water no big deal it's really weird do you remember was it deep water horizon when they when there was that explosion is that what it was and they would do a fluting yeah it i remember that being on all day yeah they just show the oil it was on right remember there's like a little picture down the side it was like okay well how are we gonna insane how bad oil people were and all that but nothing now there's nothing it's really weird i mean like the deep water horizon was great because they you know they'd have experts who would release you know they would do interviews and they'd say well you know look it seems really bad to us but this is a giant body of water there's a lot of natural seepage there's and they would try to explain it in context and they would get attacked by the media who would say how why don't you care about that seagull over there that has oil on its feathers this is just the opposite they're just don't seem to care at all and i don't know if it's just uh you know sort of defensive defensiveness over the administration or maybe just the media has changed so much because that was during obama right wasn't it yeah wasn't deep water horizon during the obama administration but it's still battering but here's the thing it's it's still battering the company yeah do you know i mean it's not battering the response yes right now this is like you guys didn't well you did respond and you blew something up which was idiotic right so now it's like they actually caught i mean you could argue that they caused the entire catastrophe right because maintained in the railroads not good the explosion after the weather therapy was on maternity leave so you can't because that is true he had a hard time chest feeding so he had to take a step then by the way uh it was 2010 was deep water horizon so that was i mean it really does feel like the media's handling of that was a lot different than this and i don't know i don't know what's changed but it does seem like we are having a lot of weird first like all of a sudden uh the uh the democratic party really doesn't like russia i mean where did that start i i live my entire life all they did was like kiss up to russia and go on honeymoon i mean bernie sanders have bought like a condo in moscow and now all of a sudden they just can't stand russia all these things are just switching i mean to bring this to you of course there are big pharmaceuticals these people all they did was complain about every pharmaceutical company that was the only thing i could agree with that right and then all of a sudden fizer we love you we hate them all we love fizer it's just weird how all these things are turning around all at once something's going on yeah yeah that's understatement something's going on all right we got to take a quick break we'll be back a fashion designer from houston texas claimed that uh this you mentioned him earlier stew sam brinton this uh disgraced former department of energy official uh she says that he wore the custom made clothes that she had reported missing from a washington d c airport in 2018 this is one of them you guys who are watching the program you can see now all right i will keep keep it on that one keep it on that one for a second so i said well hold on if you look at the neck line it's not the exact same but some people are saying he was actually wearing it wrong so if you shifted it yes right it would be the same neck line so it's not just that uh uh clothing item there's more of them if we can yes there so there's another one at one is like it that looks the exact same exact same okay here's another one um and this woman's like hold on a second like look here she she tweets even his jewelry was in my lost bag this poor woman is like where the hell is my bag where the hell are my clothes and sees this like weirdo guy who works for the bighton administration showing up in all of her custom clothing that was stolen this guy's been doing this since at least 2018 this is wild it really is wild the fact that like this poor woman who just like lost her bag and like thought it was gone forever and then sees all of her stuff on some strange person from the from the bighton i mean it is gone from her forever yeah that's true i don't think she wants it back now yeah no it's really weird like you know again like it's a close back to the conversation we had earlier like i you look at the resume of sam brinton and like i think it went to an ivy league school and then i guess had some background and in the nuclear waste storage i don't know but it's like could this person possibly be the best person to be in charge of our nuclear waste i'd like it's just the answer is just no and like i think you know it's like dealing with something like whatever the heck he's dealing with right is something that causes chaos in your life right like just if the person walks in whether it's for nuclear waste disposal or you know selling happy meals at mcdonald's you would know as this person walked in that okay there there is a complicating factor going on however they're going to be are they going to be able to do the best job possible selling hamburgers i don't know they've got a lot of stuff on their mind you know i and i think that that is something that is natural for an employer to notice and price in to the higher it and it's the reverse that happens with the administration where they look at this as a giant positive we get to say like no one would ever go you can't name another person who was in charge of our nuclear waste of course not you can't name probably another treasure transportation secretary i couldn't i was like who i can't really think of any well now you can because you have really inefficient people doing terrible jobs so these jobs that are supposed to go completely unnoticed are now noticed we all know these people's names not because we wanted to get to know them but because they keep doing such a terrible job or stealing luggage yeah i i gotta be honest i wish i never knew about sam brittain like i wish i could the men in black flashy thingy yeah like i would just ponce your dreams yeah just be gone i would love it if i never knew about sam brittain but now i do so uh so is he saying that he's trans i mean i'm confused i'm like what is he don't i think i think he says he's non-binary non-binary yes he identifies as non-binary and uses they them pronouns uh uh so okay okay so uh this this woman so she's this is tansanian fashion right she's from tansania and and now is in houston which we tried to get ahold of her because i really i was like i don't know with her how i obviously again she's tansanian i don't know how good her english is but i would love to talk to her if she wants to have a conversation just just to hear from her like what like what went through your mind when you started uncovering these pictures after you realize that he was a luggage thief and you're like holy hell these are my clothes you bastard but uh so her husband actually told reporters that houston police said that they sent the case to the fbi in minnesota and apparently someone called them from the fbi and said i'm with the fbi i'm working on this case and um they gave the fbi this information and then they never heard anything so they don't they're like we don't know if the case is still on we don't know if they're non-investigating it and then the fbi wouldn't confirm uh whether or not it had been investigating can you imagine that you work your whole life to be an fbi agent you're like i'm gonna take them serial killers i'm gonna go out you know i want to get the unibomber and you get like a luggage thief that steals women's clothes and then goes out and where i mean it's just like we're becoming we're becoming a joke the country is becoming a joke and it's it's very very sad actually you know it's the saddest part about that i feel like you could just you could just remove the word becoming i were already there i'm just glad he didn't still mind yeah like that would be like what are you doing here close you're like it's not it'd be like you're covered i fear for my life every time i go to an airport i don't know if i'm getting up my luggage back i don't know if sam britain's gonna be there can you imagine we might it be like i've got one pair of underwear some sweaty socks a pair of jeans and a white shirt like that's about it yeah he's gonna look in your bag and be like nah he'd be like no no thank you but what what is it about the left that they they speak a lot about cultural appropriation mmm but they're the ones that are always doing it mmm hmm well he to be fair he may identify as tansanine uh right we never asked i mean he's they he's because he says he's they then who knows what else he can identify as these days so i think that's i got you back i got you all right it's all very confusing in my very simple brain all right we got to take a quick break we'll be back being tansanine has nothing to do with coming from pence here it's just your state of mind yeah exactly how you feel thank you former president donald trump accused at lana's district attorney of running a kangaroo court after a series of really weird media appearances by the four woman of the special grand jury that was uh probing his actions around the 2020 election uh watch this did you personally want to hear from the former president i wanted to hear from the former president but honestly i kind of wanted to subpoena the former president because i got to swear everybody in and so i thought it'd be really cool to get 60 seconds with president trump of me looking at him and being like do you solemnly swear i'm beginning to swear him in i just i kind of just thought that would be an awesome moment oh my god what the liberal white women are a scourge on this society and must be stopped i'm just gonna say it is that a what if she looks like she's 13 like what is this exactly that really a person like that was like an official court proceeding they always have these eyes why do they always look like this why do they always have these eyes we're carrying this they yeah are you hearing what she's saying is that like a they don't i thought i thought she was they them oh oh that's what i know i mean that is a hundred percent okay it's fine to be a good set of did you notice how many times she said i yes yes what's all about her what person would want to do that like why is why would that be exciting to someone like if people want to get out of jury duty not do it more not because trump broke her yeah she just want she just wants him to go down because she is broken and she wants to be part of that proceeding like she was yes she wants to be important but she got voted as the first the four the four women yeah the lead whatever i don't know what it's called any artist the lead juror that one that's who you want representing you right there the the crazy-eyed woman great great job good job at lanta uh guys thank you so much for being here thank you stream and subscribe to more blaze media content at the blaze.com slash podcasts"
