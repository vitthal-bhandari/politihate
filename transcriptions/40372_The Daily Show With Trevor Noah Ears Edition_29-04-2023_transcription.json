    "text": " This is Stephen Colbert, here to talk to you about the Late Show Pod Show, which is our podcast of the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. I'm here with my producer, Pekka Pekka. What can people expect on the podcast? The extended moments, for sure. For instance, if I'm talking to Tom Hanks for like 20 minutes, only 14 of that ever makes it to Eric, because of just don't have time. And Tom's a jabber jaw. You know, he's a chatty cat. But it's all gold, because it's Tom Hanks, and we put that on the podcast. We do. Yeah. That's value added. Listen to the Late Show Pod Show with Stephen Colbert, wherever you get your podcasts. You're listening to Comedy Central. Welcome back to the Daily Show. I live here in New York City, but my heart and liver damage are from my home state of Kentucky. Thanks to Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, Kentucky doesn't have the best reputation. So I wanted to show that there's a lot more than you think. Take a look. Kentucky and I have both changed a lot since my youth. But unfortunately, the changes the state currently faces can't be resolved with Accutane and 150 hours of community service. Kentucky legislators passed one of the strictest anti-trans laws in the nation. House Bill 300 would allow prosecutors to charge a woman with criminal homicide if she gets an abortion. Police can't enforce any kind of federal ban on guns. Banning gender affirming care. Taking aim at drag shows, rifles free speech. Trick or law, banning a mess. He can stop, he can stop. These bills are getting shoved through like a fried chicken sandwich in McConnell's lipless mouth. But do Kentuckyans really feel this way? Absolutely not. Kentuckyans are suffering because of their decisions. You can do things a lot better. It's like we're born to the falling upon death of years. It's a lot of straight white men, a lot of older men. I would say, and to Mitch in particular, the vast majority of American people are sick and tired of the guns. Turtle-based. There's that southern hospitality on this. But she's right. Kentuckyans aren't happy with their lawmakers. In fact, statistics have shown a majority support access to abortion, background checks on guns, and oppose the law on gender affirming health care. So how is this happening? To get more insight, I met a local journalist who's shining a spotlight on the politics happening in conservative states. There's only one way to have this conversation, and that is over-urban. So it's safe to say that a lot of these laws that are passing from extreme legislators are not reflective of the values of the people of Kentucky. So my view is we're seeing an extreme Republican agenda because our legislators are governing not like Republicans, not like Kentuckyans. If you look at the laws being passed in Kentucky, they're the exact same ones being passed in Florida or Mississippi. So these are much different states with much different priorities, but they had the exact same agenda because the Republicans in every state are just passing a list of things. Donald Trump and other writing Republicans like, and they're popular on Fox News. You know what? Let's just keep this flowing. I don't want to see this glass empty. Where do we go from here? Is there any solution? I think ultimately we have to, in the short term, shame them out of passing the most aggressive version of these bills. Criticize them enough to make sure that they are told when they go to church or when they go to the grocery store that you passed a terrible bill and acted like a bigot. Are you sure that shame would work with Kentucky Republicans? I mean, look at Rand Paul. If I got my ass kicked in my front yard by my neighbor, I would never leave my house again. I'm not saying it's a foolproof point, and I'm just saying that these legislators have to walk in public and live their life, and I do think you want to make clear that you have done something terrible. It might be the drinks, but I have an idea. What if we made change through the power of song through subliminal messages? We could write a country song. No one's tried that yet. No one's tried that. We'll sing it together. Okay, because we know how it goes. It goes here in Kentucky. We got bourbon and horses and a woman's right to choose. We have great education, well funded, well supported, a boost for all. It looks cool. This is so good. Okay, we got to record this. The irony is that even as the Kentucky legislature becomes more extreme, Kentucky's citizens are trying to bring the state together. Citizens like Edward Lee. Edward Lee, an award winning chef, founded the Lee Initiative, a nonprofit seeking to increase diversity and equality in the restaurant industry. And he's achieving this on a national level as well. Chef Edward Lee, owner of 16 Magnolia in Louisville, has been invited to the White House to cook for the U.S. and South Korea State Dinner. When it comes to politics, he has a more grassroots approach. There are people in power here that have their agenda, but there's some belief in me where you stay and you fight the good fight, and you build community and make sure that people do not feel marginalized, that people do not feel alone, that people do not feel like they're the only ones in this fight. And to me, that's stronger than any political movement. We have done dinners here where we have brought different groups at the table to sit down and talk things out. And I would say at the end of the dinner, you still disagree. The only difference is now you see the other person as a human being. Do you think this level of humanity and kindness and outreach that you do could ever exist in the Kentucky legislature? They come here for dinner. I can ask them. Has Mitch McConnell ever? We don't serve Intel. You don't serve Intel. We've been here 21 years. I'll say that everyone's been through here. How many times have you spent in this food? I waited tables for 10 years. That is against everything I stand for. I know a thing or two about spitting in food. Despite not taking my advice, Ed loved me feeling hopeful, so I sobered up and hit the streets to see if other people shared Ed's vision. You have to have hope, because otherwise you wake up and you live in fear. And that's not what we in Kentucky do. We get up and we go to work and we take care of our families and we're good to our neighbors. When something bad happens in the state, everyone rallies together, and the good fight still continues on. We are the solution and we truly have got to become much more forceful and active. I think we can make it uncomfortable enough for those who are in charge of the voting, who are in charge of representing us. Yeah, make him uncomfortable. Slippo's laxatives, Key is car, put a bag of shit on his doorstep. You don't think the problem with that only makes me look bad. That would not achieve the goal I have. As it takes all that time to shit in the bag and fight on fire. That's right. Right. Thank you. You know we can get some good bourbon around here? Well, at my house. Oh, leave the way. Although, you know, it's a calico. Actually, you know, I actually have a spine if you don't mind picking up the tab. I've racked up quite the middle. You say Kentucky is a generous, right? Hey, everybody. Stephen Colbert here. You know, I have my own. We have the show has a podcast, the Late Show Pod Show. And here I'm here with the producer Becca. Becca, what are we doing? What is this? So, the Late Show Pod Show. It's everything you love about the Late Show, the monologue, the lead guest. And here's, am I correct about this? That you actually get things in the podcast often that aren't on the show, because we had to cut things for time. And so, you'll get more guests. You might even get some jokes or some more meanwiles or something like that. We didn't get a chance. Certainly conversations with Lewis and the band that you don't get. So, you get more stuff. If you don't listen to the podcast, you're losing money. It's true. It's true. TV, you can only put so much. You got to get those commercial breaks in, but the podcast, we can keep going. That's the great thing about podcast, is that the real estate is enormously cheap. Yeah. And so, you can just shovel anything in there. And there people go, thank you. Listen to the Late Show Pod Show with Stephen Colbert, wherever you get your podcasts. I use the internet. Let's talk about wellness. It's a $1.5 trillion industry, and I'm obsessed. I've tried it all. I drink mushroom coffee. I've done ice baths. I've tried meditation apps. I gave my meditation app an ice bath. I don't know if it worked, because my phone won't turn on. But like a ski trip with Gwyneth Paltrow, wellness has a dark side. And that is what I want to talk about in tonight's installment of Long Story Short. Now, you might think that the term wellness started in the 90s, back when white women invented yoga. But it's actually been around for at least a century. And until very recently, there's been zero government regulation to make sure that wellness products are legit. A company could claim that their pandasim and protein powder will give you that glow. But they don't have to show receipts, so it's no surprise that they sell a lot of snake oil. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force reviewed 84 studies involving hundreds of thousands of people over 30 years. The task force concluded there was little or no benefit in using vitamin and mineral supplements to prevent cancer, cardiovascular disease and death. There is a new study that found some of those melatonin gummies that are so popular actually contain way more of the hormone than they advertise. Wellness influencers promoting products like colloidal silver drops they say can combat where there is infection. Non-prescription products that contain colloidal silver are not recognized and safe by the FDA. There's a lot of buzz around teetoxes, but dieticians and doctors will tell you, detoxing is a myth. There is one ingredient though that takes some teetoxes to another level. It's called cenoleaf, and thing is, cenae can also cause stomach problems, cramps and diarrhea. After using cenae for a while, you might not be able to poop without it. That's right, if you take some of these products, you might be as full of shit as the influencers who sell them. Look, I get why people want to believe this stuff works, but if just drinking tea was the key to looking snatched, the British Royal family would look a lot different. But look, the truth is you don't have to spend a single dollar to try a bullshit wellness trend. Just go on social media and you'll find plenty of ways to jeopardize your health for free. Advocates of the saltwater flush claim chugging water mixed with two tablespoons of salt is a healthy way to clean out your colon, but experts are issuing stern warnings. Dangerous as f***. It literally may come for your bowels. It's the latest viral health trend with nearly 40 million views on TikTok. The claim that putting tape on your mouth at night can help you get better sleep. It's a trend that has some medical experts sounding the alarm. You're risking things like cardiac arrest, it can induce seizures, there's a lot of risks to it. Doctors are warning against a viral wellness trend called perineum sunning. They say it's not worth the risk of sun damage or even skin cancer. Just a general rule, never try a trend that seems like it was invented by the guy next door with binoculars. Please, please do not try that at home. If you want to see a sunburned asshole, just watch the next presidential campaign. That's the last we'll see a hem, nailed his ass. But maybe the darkest side of wellness is that too often it's not even about wellness. It's about targeting women's insecurities. Whether it's eliminating your wrinkles, flattening your abs, or the industry's favorite targets are extremely disappointing vaginas. Apparently, it needs a full Renault down there. Talkin' detox pearls to stay clean, vaginal eggs to tighten its core, and of course gummies to improve its taste. Cause it's not enough that your vagina can regulate its own pH and be a pleasure center and deliver a baby. It also needs to taste so good it gets a Michelin star. We don't need any of this. The vagina is a self-cleaning organ. It's not like you need a tiny Roomba in there, gettin' all those hard to reach corners. In fact, if your vagina has corners, please go see a doctor. But the fact is, the reason the wellness industry is making so much money off women in the first place is because of doctors. The American healthcare industry is constantly failing women. Whether it's doctors dismissing their symptoms or telling them that their pain isn't as bad as their claiming, or prescribing them less medicine than men for the same issues. And keep in mind, this is all even worse for women of color. And it's happening as the courts and states are rapidly eroding women's access to reproductive healthcare. And all of this is stressing me out so much I could really use a pan to see them in smoothie. Like, meditation app when I need it. So it's no wonder that women turn to wellness despite all its faults. Because what's more ridiculous? A healthcare system that denies women treatment and tells them that their pain's all in their head? Or this? So long story short, until American healthcare takes women's concerns seriously, we're gonna continue to be targets for alternative solutions. So the next time a wellness brand tries to sell you a product, here's some advice. Pretend like you're a doctor listening to a female patient. Don't take their word for it.
