Own a piece of history. Just a good old boy. Never meaning no harm. A man. A legend. A legal immigrant. Doctors of Bastion, Gorka. Yes, I am a legal immigrant to the United States but in the UK I did grow up on American culture. That was the theme tune for the Dukes of Hazard. I loved all of that stuff as a kid. But I was imbued with a British sense of humour. We're going to talk a little bit about Monty Python but let's introduce our special guest for our one on one. He's a guy who comes on the show regularly for a little bit of political analysis, trenchant analysis but now we have the luxury of the whole hour with him. He's the co-founder of the CEO of that superb website, the Federalist, Sean Davis. Welcome back. Thanks for having me. Sean, are you a fan of British humour? Do you like absurdities such as Monty Python? I think the drier and more insulting and absurd the more I like it. I love British humour. All right, why am I not surprised? Knowing you, that is not a surprise at all. All right, let's go back in time. Let's go back 30 years, 30 past years to a film that caused a bit of controversy at the time as blasphemous but it didn't cause controversy because of this skit. A skit? No which I couldn't make today. Here's the life of Brian. Where was I? I think you finished. Oh, right. Furthermore, it is the birthright of every man or woman. Why don't you shut up about women's stand? You put it in a soft. We'd have a perfect right to play a part in our movement, Reg. Why are you always on about women's stand? I want to be one. What? I want to be a woman. From now on, I want you all to call me Loretta. What? It's my right as a man. But why do you want to be Loretta, Stan? I want to have babies. You want to have babies? It's every man's right to have babies if he wants them. But you can't have babies. Don't you oppress me. I'm not oppressing you, Stan. You haven't got a womb. Where's the fetus going to just take? You're going to keep it in a box? Any humor that can use the word gestate as part of the joke, that is pretty grade a humor. Where are you going to gestate the fetus in a box? That's Monty Python. Sean Davis, it's in the news again. Why? Because John Cleese, I don't think he's a trumster, but he doesn't like political correctness. And he's going to make the play of the life of Brian. And he's being told to edit out that skit. I wonder why? Do you have an inkling? Oh, yeah. It's because reality is extremely offensive to lefties who just don't like the way things are. So reality must be changed. It must be snuffed out in order for them to feel good about themselves. But the fact that this, I mean, I could see you over the Skype connections we're playing in the clip. You know, you were griming. I couldn't control myself. That's humor, you know. Stan, why'd you keep talking about women? Because I want to be one. Call me Loretta. That had people rolling through the aisles in the cinemas in 1979 or whenever it was. Today they want to cancel that. Help me understand what is going on. You're a business man. You run one of the most successful news sites out there. But we see just one example. Help me out here. I'm not a business man. I'm just a guy with an accent and a microphone. We see Target lose $10 billion in a week because of its Satanist designed, tuckable, transitioning swimsuits for boys who want to be girls. $10 billion in a week, Sean. And then we find out that Kohl's is doing the same thing in their store. I mean, how is this happening in America, the land of for-profit success? Well, I think there are a couple reasons. I think there are some business reasons. And I think there's some spiritual and moral reasons. On the business side, I think every single major institution in the country, and that includes corporate America and Wall Street, has been taken over by these Wokies and what they are weaponizing against just normal businesses. Kind of just want to sell the stuff they want to sell. And that's it. Is this ESG, the scorecard? And it's almost become the firmware of corporate America that if you want to get equity investments, private equity investments, if you want your debt issuances to be able to go through so you can invest in capital and whatever, these big companies, BlackRock, they're going to come in and say, you know, we're looking at your ESG scores and you don't have a pride month. You don't even have a pride day. So we're going to knock you off some points there. And oh, we don't like that you don't have a DEI program. So oh boy, that's going to be another negative on your scorecard. And then suddenly, you're scoring so poorly on the totalitarian ESG index that they're just not going to give you money. And this is how they end up extorting companies into doing this kind of stuff. Now with Target, I think that's probably not exactly right on because Target really is patient zero of the trans insanity. You'll recall maybe 10 years ago, nine years ago, I don't have the exact date. Target was the first major retail corporation in America to do the transgender bathrooms, to say that we're going to let men and women's bathrooms. It was a huge deal back then. It was unthinkable when they came out and did that. And now, not only did they get away with that and made billions doing it, now they're starting to do a little Trojan horse game with transgender clothing and targeting children for castration and sterilization. Target has been bad from the beginning. So I do have some sympathy for these bigger companies that don't want to be in the culture war, but are being extorted and bullied into it by places like BlackRock. I have no sympathy with Target. Target's a true evil believer here. They've been bad from the get-go. And so they don't have any excuses other than they're just awful. And that gets to the second issue, which is the moral and spiritual component here, because it's impossible to avoid. I know conservatives, people's libertarian bent, they like to think that the free market guides everything. As long as there's a free market, everything will be fine and everyone can do it. They want and happiness will be maximized. I like the free market. This believes that the free market fixes everything as a fairy tale, because we do have a spiritual and moral component here, which I think is the real driver of the rot that we're having to face in the country right now. It's why marriages are declining. It's why half a kid, they're born out of wedlock. Church attendance is down. We are very quickly turning into a wicked, rotten, people incapable of self-government. You'll recall it was John Adams who said that this republic that they had designed was designed for immoral and virtuous people. And I'm sorry to conclude at this point, that's not us. Yeah. The argument that I've heard all the way to express this, America isn't you don't have to be a Christian to be an American, but your values have to be Judeo-Christian. It was designed for people who have that value set. So your take is interesting, because I've heard this many times before, that it's because these corporations hired all these gender studies Wokesters who worked their way up through the system and then became the head of HR. And then I thought, hang on a second, I mean, the C-suite can't take on a 30-something Wokester in the HR department. But what you're saying is that the pressure is coming from the outside, from these totally ideologically, politically correct investment corporations like BlackRock. So for you, it's more the external forces being exerted. Well, I think it's a little of both. But we never hear about the external forces. We just hear about these little pink-haired freaks who are 23 and come in and think they understand how everything works and they should rule the company. Obviously, they're a problem. They're a huge problem. But it's not just an internal problem to the company. It's also an external business problem and then an internal individual societal moral problem. I mean, that's what makes this so frustrating. There's no one easy answer. So I think the boycotts of Target are great. You shouldn't be shopping in there given what they're trying to do to your kids. But that's not going to be enough to arrest this leftward slide that we're facing. We need to be firing on all cylinders. It can't just be, oh, the free market fixes everything and then we're set because the market and the corporate institutions have been captured here. Yeah, we're talking to the CEO of the Federalist. Follow him on Twitter at SeanM.dav. For those who doubt this moral component, let me just show you something. Here is the British designer of the transgender swimsuits for little boys who is a Satanist. This guy is wearing a t-shirt. He's got horns on his head. And he's wearing a t-shirt that says Satan respects pronouns. This isn't a theory, even if the guy says, I'm not a Satanist. I just like the way Satan stands for rebellion. That is a direct quote from the designer of targets, children's swimsuits for boys who are pretending to be girls. It's thefederalists.com. We're going to talk for the whole hour with Sean Davis.

Come on to me, the little ones. Better a millstone were wrapped around the neck of someone who harms a child. Well, let's help those who are most vulnerable. Over a million girls and boys in America have a parent behind bars. They are vulnerable. They feel guilt for the sins of their parents. Let's get them to a safe place this summer with the prison fellowship. It is called the Angel Tree Camp. $200 per child provides them a Christ-centric safe summer camp. That could be you. Donate as little or as much as you can. Go right now to SebGorke.com and click on the Angel Tree banner at the top. You could be literally saving a life. You can call in your donation as well on 888-206-2794. That's treble 8, 206-2794. Or just go to SebGorke.com in the Angel Tree banner. I've got an idea. Suppose you agree that he can't actually have babies, not having a womb, which is nobody's fault, not even the Romans, but that he can have the right to have babies. Good idea, Judith. Would you fight your presses for your right to have babies, brother? Sister, sorry? What's the point? What? What's the point of fighting for his right to have babies when he can't have babies? He's symbolic of our struggle against oppression. Simbolic of his struggle against reality. I'm sorry. Just bloody genius. Every word in that skit is genius from the life of Brian. It's, we're fighting for his right to want to be a woman, fighting against the oppression. Not even the Romans are responsible for the fact that he can't have a baby. Oh my gosh. God bless Monty Python. I'm Sebastian Gorker. This is America. First God bless you, every single one of you who have donated already to our prison fellowship program. This is the late Chuck Colson's amazing annual initiative to get children who have lost a mother or father to the prison system to a safe Christian summer camp this year. Just listen to one of the boys and his incredible take of what he learned at this Christ-centric summer camp. It is a great camp for kids to go to. Everybody loves you, cares for you, and it's a great camp. Learn about God. The best part of the injury was, for me, would have to be the activities when you get to play, in the gym. You get to go tubing in the lake, wayboarding, water weenie. What I learned the most about Jesus was that even though your father has been incarcerated and in jail, you still have a father up in heaven. Even though my father is incarcerated, I still have a father in heaven. Truly beautiful. Let's get as many children as possible. There's over a million who have a parent behind bars today. If you donate $200, that's one child to go to a summer camp. You can call in your donation to 888-206-2794 or just go to my webpage, sebgorker.com and click on the angel tree banner. It's one of the most blessed things you can do this year, the number. Treble 8206-2794 or just go to sebgorker.com. That's S-E-B-G-O-R-K-A, sebgorker.com and the angel tree banner. We're back with Sean Davis, he of the Federalist Book Market right now, thefederist.com. Follow him at Sean M. Daff. Sean, you're very correctly diagnosed. How did we get here? In terms of the multivalent answers to where is this insanity, this denial of reality coming from, let me flip it. What were conservatives doing as the nation, I'm going to be clear here, as Western civilization was slouching towards Gamora? What were the good guys? What were the conservatives doing? Did we just not see it? Did we have scales on our eyes? Were we too busy running companies and making money and making sure our kids had a new pair of shoes for the next semester at school? Explain to me how it seems as if we wake up one morning and 12-year-old girls are getting double mastectomies because they think they're a boy. Yeah, it's horrifying. I think the best example I would use to describe it is what we lived through during COVID. We had basically every single institution in America fail to do its job to protect our country and to protect our liberties. We had our government just completely abandon sanity, tried to lock us down. We had schools shut down for something that wasn't a risk to children at all. We had churches agree to close their doors and say, you know what, maybe God didn't really mean it when he said we need to worship together every week. People are sick. There must be an exception in the Bible somewhere for that. I think what has happened writ large in this country over the last 30, 40, 50 years is similar to what happened during COVID. It's just a little trickier to see because it zoomed out quite a bit. As we had people who just assumed everything would go on the way it was going on forever. Things were good and things had always been good in America and why wouldn't they always continue to be good? We allowed these little things to change over the time, whether it was the sexual revolution where we decided that sex doesn't really need to be connected to marriage. It's not like the point of it is to raise children. We'll just free sex for everyone whenever they want. We'll pretend there are no consequences. Then the net is abortion. Well, if I could have sex all the time whenever I want, I should just be able to not have to deal with the consequences of that. We're just going to have abortion. And then so right there, right out of the gate, starting in the 60s and 70s, suddenly marriage is being devalued. Child rearing is being devalued. We throw God out of schools. We decide that religion and faith is something that belongs within the four walls of a church on Sunday. And then slowly over time, year by year, we end up to where we say, you know what, marriage, it's just for everyone. Anyone can get married. It's just all about how you feel. And also boys can be girls. And if you disagree with that, then obviously it's because you're bigoted and you're probably racist. And so we as a country have made all these little compromises along the way. And for some reason, as we made them, we didn't think that they would have any larger effects down the line. We thought that that ripple in the water from this little thing would just die and wouldn't go anywhere. And so we said it's turned into a massive tidal wave that's threatened to destroy our entire culture and our way of life because we've completely eroded the way that the foundation of what this country was built on. So is it really naive a day on our behalf or just not realizing the death of a thousand cuts? I think it's definitely part of that. We make these little compromises and somehow think there won't be consequences. But there's also a component here that I think is rooted in the Christian faith, which is that we're all fallen and we're all sinful. Without God's grace, we are completely and wholly corrupted by sin. And we forget that because in America, things have always been good in America. We became the richest, most prosperous, most free nation in history almost overnight. And so we thought, well, yeah, just think things are great here and they'll continue to be great. We will be unique in how we defy what has happened to every other civilization in history when they lose their way. And so I don't know if we were just sleepwalking, if we conned ourselves into it, but we're susceptible to the exact same things that have triggered the downfall of every other great civilization before us. And yet we somehow pretend that we're special and we won't be the ones who face the consequences for these things. Yeah, yeah, I am. I even have a good friend who's a conservative radio host who talks about boot edge, edges, husband. And I go, hang on a second, you're a conservative. A man cannot have a husband stop it. It's these small concessions and even even subconscious acquiescence of the battlefield to those who want to destroy everything that we hold sacred.

Sean, I want to get back to the big strategic stuff I love discussing that with you, but let's get prosaic for a second because it's a kind of tactical consequence of everything we've discussed. The debt-sealing talks, your response to the idea that yes, this is a great success for conservatives that we're only adding $4 trillion to the debt. How should we really look at this? It doesn't matter how much you polish a turd, it's still going to end up a turd. I think this debt limit bill is just a big steaming pile of turds. I get why the people who negotiated it want us to pretend that it's somehow a great victory, but it's not. A good example is we were promised over and over again as Republicans ran for the House after they took the House that at the very least, we're going to get rid of this $87 billion that Biden and the Democrats wanted to give the IRS to hire new agents to come after people like you and me. They couldn't even manage that. They got rid of, I think, a billion and a half dollars of that. That's before we even get into the overall levels of spending. They're out there saying, oh, we're going to save trillions and trillions of dollars. They couldn't even get back to the pre-COVID levels of spending, like 2020 pre-COVID baseline level of spending, which means that every year from here on out, no matter how much money they save according to their spreadsheets, we're down a half trillion dollars. We're spending a half trillion dollars more every year for eternity because they couldn't even get back to the level of spending that we had before the COVID inflationary spike. So I think this bill is a total mess. It's an embarrassment. And I think they just need to go back to the drawing board and do their jobs. And what should be for those who love America, given the fact that we don't have a manga or GOP, we don't have a manga, America First GOP, what is the right way? Should the 20 be in transigerent? Should they boycott everything, given that this is? I mean, I believe that checks and balances were actually meant to create gridlock. That's what the founding fathers actually wanted. What is the best way to proceed given that we don't have control in terms of America first? Yeah, the easy way is just basic negotiating and basic leverage. The houses who controls the purse, it's Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, they call the shots on the stuff. They're the place where these bills have to initiate. Why are they preemptively surrendering to the White House, which didn't put together a plan, to the Democrat one runs in it, which couldn't even pass its own plan. You have an opportunity here to use the leverage given to you by the Constitution to demand actual structural reforms and changes. And yet they didn't do any of it. And I just find it so ridiculous. There's an old maxim that asks, how does a company go bankrupt first slowly and then all at once? Well, countries are no different. And we're careening towards bankruptcy. We're $30 trillion in debt. And that's just what we already owe. Right. That doesn't take into account Medicare and Social Security. We're probably $100 to $200 trillion in debt. And until they actually turn this far around, they're still heading towards the cliff. I don't care if it's 70 miles an hour or 65. I'm not going to pretend that pumping the brakes for five seconds is somehow progress. You actually have to turn the car around if you want to save this country. And nobody in Washington seems interested in doing that. And the fact that we have somebody like Mitch McConnell is the quote, unquote conservative leader for us in the Senate. Yeah, it's a huge problem. There's nothing conservative about him. I mean, it's interesting. We heard lots of doomsday scenarios about, oh, we're going to default. We're going to default. No, we weren't. We were not going to default. We're constitutionally obligated to pay interest and pay on the debt. What was going to happen is they were going to lose money that they're shuffling into the Ukraine gravy train. So it's interesting how we hear all these threats at Oak. Ram is not going to get a Social Security or you're not going to be able to get your health care is Ukraine for one moment felt imperiled about our cash flowing to it because it doesn't seem like it has. And that kind of tells you everything you need to know about the what the priorities of people like Mitch McConnell are. And they're not our priority. I haven't heard that phrase before the Ukraine gravy train. We're talking to Sean Davis co-founder CEO of the superb Federalist the Federalist.com. Follow him right now at Sean M. Dam.

Maggoneficint. I'm going to share with you a clip from a video that's gone viral in the last 24 hours, which is weird, very weird because it's an event that happened second week of May. So where was this video hiding? It is the commencement speaker, Juan Fatima Mohammed, City University of New York's Law School. This is a student talking to her fellow graduating students at a law school in America. And we did all of this in spite of the racism, in spite of the selective activism, the self-serving interests of CUNY Central, an institution that continues to fail us, that continues to train and cooperate with the fascist NYPD, the military, that continues to train IDF soldiers to carry out that same violence globally, a larger institution committed to its donors, not to its students. So the idea is, Sean, that you'd have a valedictorian commencement speaker in New York at a prestigious law school, not only get to say the fascist NYPD that is securing that building, but then also get cheers, jubilant cheers from her fellow students. This means the situation is dire. My question to you is, where is the conservative patriotic leadership, apart from the 20th on Capitol Hill, President Trump, the odd surrogates here and there? It's as if we're Gulliver and we're asleep in Lilliput. It is. I would take issue as one comic you made. Let's not throw the term prestigious around so willy-nilly. There's nothing prestigious about what that young woman just did. But yeah, no, we've had this movement in America, especially when it comes to education, they call public education, I call it government education, where for 20 or 30 years, the right has kind of just mouth, oh, we love government education, we love government education, and not really done anything about it. And it reminds me of the old saying, don't send your children to Caesar and be surprised when they come out Romans. Don't send your kids to these Bolshevik communist madrasas and be surprised when they come out Little Marxist, like that young woman. We have just decided that we can send our kids off for eight, nine hours a day, not just for five years or eight years or 12 years or 16 years, but in the case of this person, 19 years of schooling, why on earth would we expect these students to turn out any other way when we know exactly what they're being taught in these schools? And it might be CUNY, it might be some other state university, it might even be a private boarding school or a school that you thought was safe. It's not just Republicans, and trust me, they're a huge problem. They have done so little to address any of the actual problems we face. But we've also got a problem with parents where they just decide to outsource the raising of their kids. And I get it, life in America is expensive now. Our awful government has made it that way. You often need two incomes just to survive. But you can't send off your children into these communist Bolshevik madrasas and then be surprised when they turn out to be just woke awful little ninnies like that woman. It's a natural consequence. And so we need to start taking ownership of how we educate our children instead of just sending them off for 16 or 19 years and being shocked when they turn out to be just awful little communists. And beyond, I love that phrase, if I remember from now, and I'm going to call public schools, government schools, but beyond schooling, beyond what's happening at these camps of indoctrination that are, you know, erstwhile colleges, if we look at society in general, and especially as you mentioned, COVID, the nation built upon the pioneer spirit, rugged individualism, totally genoflected and surrendered at the altar of, you know, collectivist little fascists like Fauci. Where are the, you know, the Tocvelyan leaders in America? Are churches, if you might church, the Catholic church was fine with the masks and the shuttering and everything else? Do you see any sign of the original America coming back? Oh, it's definitely there. It's not like that type of personality has evaporated. You look at kids coming out, you know, they're 14, 15, 18 years old. I can think of kids in our own family and people in our neighborhood. They're looking at all this insanity and they're thinking new people are absolutely nuts and they're completely radicalized and right-wing because of all this nonsense. So that attitude is out there, but, but at the leadership level, that's what I find the most disheartening. Where are leaders? What are they doing? They seem to just be bending the knee and bowing before whatever government institution tells them they need to do this or that with COVID being a good example. You had churches out there not preaching the gospel but preaching CDC guidelines to the flock. And we especially see this in political circles. Where are the leaders? I mean, where are our leaders? I used to work for Tom Coburn in the Senate. That man was a leader. He had no problem walking into a room of senators and tell them they were all a bunch of morons selling out the country. And he slept fine at night because he knew he was right. Where are the Tom Coburns of the current political class? Because they seem to be pretty few and far between. Do you have an answer for that rhetorical question? Where are the Tom Coburns, Sean? I mean, I'll tell you, I know Chip Roy, he's a good friend. He's great. I think Dan Bishop is doing great work. They're starting in the house just like Coburn did, but I kind of want to see someone come in a Samson-style provocateur and just start tearing down the pillars of all these institutions and say, enough is enough. I don't care if you hate me. I don't care if you're going to cancel me. We've got to stop this nonsense because if we don't, we're not going to have a country any longer. Yeah, I like that image. I like that analogy, a sample like individual. I think President Trump is going to be that person if we can get him elected for a second term when it comes to federal government and the executive. But we could do with some of that in the Senate. We could do with more than 20 patriots in Congress. Let's mean, in the meantime, get all the rhetorical ammunition we need at thefederalists.com.

Sean, every week, almost every day, there's new evidence of how we live in a police state. The latest is last week, the Department of Homeland Security spending millions of dollars on training, on materials that have these kinds of diagrams in them. The pyramid of far right radicalization with the American Conservative Union, the Heritage Foundation, the NRA, the Christian Broadcast Network, the GOP, red MAGA hats leading all the way to what? To white supremacy and fascism. I have to ask you a question in broader historic context. When I moved to Hungary after the fall of communism, a Hungarian philosopher wrote an article that became very famous called the Land of No Consequences because he asked the question, how can it be that after 40 years of communism, of gulags, of people getting killed, intimidated for political purposes, nobody paid a price? Are we slowly becoming the land of no consequences? If you're a Democrat, you can literally get away with anything? Yeah, I'm not sure it's happening slowly. We have a federal government apparatus which seems to be led by DOJ and FBI. It's turned into an American stazzy. They spy on us, they leak against us, they manufacture fake crimes against us. Perving example is an FBI attorney named Kevin Klimsmith who completely fabricated an email so he could use it against a Donald Trump campaign surrogate and try and put him in prison and get him spied on. So yeah, we've got a huge problem in this country that the left faces no consequences and the right gets rung up on things that never happened. We've got 30 seconds left. Nevertheless, do you remain an optimist about this nation, Sean? I'm an optimist generally about from a spiritual and moral component. I know where I'm going at the end. I've got a Christ who redeems me, but as far as this country is concerned, I wouldn't say I'm an optimist so much as I am deeply, deeply concerned about the trends that we're seeing right now. He's already won because he knows what our Lord and Savior did for us on Mount Golgoth 3rd 2000 years ago, but it's up to us here to make sure that there is a pale reflection of ultimate justice here on earth as well. And that's up to us. God bless you, Sean Davis, for doing what you do. Please bookmark the Federalist right now, TheFedris.com and follow it, Sean, M. Dab. I'm Sebastian Gorker, wherever you are. Keep your head on the swivel. Watch your six. Hold the line. Never give up. Never give in. And stay frosty. Our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. I know not what costs others may take, but as for me give me liberty or give me death. The world will little note a long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. And not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall. I can hear you, the rest of the world hears you, and the people. And the people who knock these buildings down will hear all of us soon. And we will make America great again. This is America first with Sebastian Gorker. Greetings, dear friends. Greetings. Welcome to the next three hours of your life. And it's going to be an amazing three hours. I hope you had a blessed Memorial Day weekend. It should be slow for news on these three day weekends. Not this time. The debt ceiling negotiations continue 22 amongst the Patriots on Capitol Hill. Jim Comey, who's been so silent for such a long time, finally arrayed his ugly head. We'll be sharing with you what he had to say. Target, yes, Target has lost $10 billion in the last 10 days. Thanks to their transgender children's bathing suits. Ken Paxton is under assault in Texas. Joe Biden has given a statement on whether or not he would pardon his predecessor, President Trump. Jane Fonda, Hanoi, Jane is back. And Moscow has issued an arrest warrant for Lindsey Graham. But that is all pitch. It is all irrelevance considering who our first guest is today. No monologue today, dear friends, because we are honored to have with me the man who I emulate, try to emulate every single day on my humble radio show, my Salem colleague and friend, my rabbi. Yes, I'm a Catholic. It's okay. Dennis Prager, welcome to America first. Aside from just loving being with you, the joy of going on your show is your introductions. I only regret my parents were not alive to hear them. Well, my mother thought I'd end up in prison. So for what may I ask? Oh, I'm glad you asked, this will crack you up because I did no homework in high school. That was enough to relegate me a criminal. Was that a prisonable offense in the Prager household? Yes, yes, exactly correct. All right. Well, first things first, let's keep it in the family. I want to say hello to the newest member of the Prager family. I do believe he goes by the nom de plum of Mr. T. Mr. T. We salute you. Well, Mr. Tobs, Mr. Tobs, Mr. Tobs. Do you busy? Yes. I love it. Yeah, thank you. I love it too. We actually, it was not our name. The people, the breeder that we got him from in Pennsylvania, he was the son of Mr. Chubs. So they named him Mr. Tobs and we love the name. And does he have a similar character to the late great Otto? Well, he's still a puppy. I can only say that it does seem to run in the English, a bulldog family, a temperament that is so serene that it is instant love with this breed. And what about his reaction to your cigars, my my ass? So far, so good. I have to say he does appear in my fireside chats. Where Otto was, there we never thought of naming him Otto the second or Otto junior. Otto will remain. And then this is the truth, etched in our memory. We miss Otto, but Mr. Tobs, a handsome fellow. All right, let's get down to business. It is fine. Wait, wait, wait, one second. There are no handsome English bulldogs. What is this? Let's put his name up again. Let's put his picture up again. There's something attitudinal that that faces like, oh, I love a bull. I love a bull. I agree. Handsome is the problem. No, no, he's like Mr. T, the original Mr. T. He's got attitude. He's definitely got attitude. Let's get down to business. It has finally been revealed the scales have fallen from our eyes. We now know that Dennis Prager is a white supremacist. He's a neo-Nazi. Thanks to the DHS funded, taxpayer funded pyramid of conservative radicalization. He's even above the National Rifle Association. He's even above the Christian broadcast network. There he is. Prager University, turning point USA, Breitbart, unbelievable that this was funded by us, the US taxpayer, your reaction to this pyramid of radicalization, Dennis. So people should understand that I don't take it at all personally. There, I think I have a good analogy. Just your question has provoked this. I didn't say it even on my own show. So many of your listeners will not know, but in the middle, in the middle ages, there was something called the blood libel. And it was made up by Jew haters who said that Jews right before Passover would slaughter Christian children to use their blood to bake matzah. So the lie was so enormous that Jews never thought all were insulted. They were afraid correctly. They'd be killed. And in fact, all the Jews of England were expelled based on that charge. It was a horrible thing. But it's very interesting. A very famous Jewish thinker of the late 19th century said this actually had a somewhat positive impact on Jews. Because when you're when you're hated and you're called all sorts of things, you start to wonder, is there any truth to that? Because if people say men give birth enough, people start believing men give birth. So they said, no Jew believed every Jew knew what a grotesque lie it was that Jews did that. And so it actually liberated Jews from taking any of the stereotypes seriously. So this is a grotesque, and for me a Jew to say this because the blood libel has almost a religious status, so to speak, in Jewish history. But this is the this is a modern day equivalent of the blood libel that that Prager you or any of the other organizations prepare people to be Nazis. I mean, I've spent my life, I wrote a book on anti-Semitism, obviously a chapter of which is about Nazi anti-Semitism. I just wrote a column about six months ago on how evil it is to deny the Holocaust, to think that that I would be a head of an organization that prepares people for Nazis. Do you know that this week's you'll love this said this week's Prager you video we put out one a week. I mean we put out many for kids, but some of them bought one major video every week. The one this week is on is on millerd Fillmore. And I looked at Alan Estrin. And I said, how are they going to exactly show how our video on millerd Fillmore leads people to Nazis? It's so vile. And to think that there was government involvement, this should scare everybody. I'm laughing because the only alternative is to cry and I prefer to laugh. But this is very scary a shed. Yeah, no, I, you know, I'm glad you maintained your sense of humor. I want to put a photograph up on the screen of this person who is at the University of Cincinnati. His name is Michael Laudental. He's the person who was paid to put that threat assessment together. I do believe he's still teaching and a researcher there at the University of Cincinnati. Dennis, what is your message? We've got 60 seconds left. What is your message to that young man? So he proves something I have been talking about a lot on my show and writing about. How weak the human conscience is when there is no God above to whom one feels responsible. He sleeps well knowing that all he does in life is lie. He smears those with whom he differs. That's it. That is his entire purpose on earth to smear. And look, I believe a good God will judge him. So I am at peace with that fact. But again, he is a living proof of the weakness of the human conscience. Yeah. Thank you, Dennis, for joining us today. We give our best to you, your muse to Mr. Tabs. Please support the organization that is doing more to save America than most. It's PragerU.com. But I will share the news with you that Dennis has given up cigars this year. If you want to give him any, I will take them in his stead. In the meantime, follow him at Dennis Prager.
