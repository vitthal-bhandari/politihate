    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at BlazeTV.com slash The Blind. Today, parts four and five of the Twitter files are released. Thousands of migrants are caught on video pouring across the southern border and the Biden administration's transgender agenda is dealt a legal blow. Gosh, darn ya hate to see it. We've got all that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to The News and Why It Matters. I'm Sarah Gonzalez and today's episode is brought to you by Healthy Cell. They've got a really fantastic multivitamin. My whole family takes these religiously. They've got a bunch of stuff to help you with sleep, with focus, immune boost, whatever you need that they taste delicious and it is going to be a gel that you are going to just pop back and it's going to give you maximum absorption. You can go to healthycell.com slash news. That is healthyCELL.com use code NEWS for 20% off of your first order. I am joined today. Bye. Jason Futtrell, Chief Researcher of the Glenn Beck program also joined by believes TV contributor John Doyle, host of Hek Off Kami, who does have content out. This is true. Yeah, gotta go check it out over at the YouTubes. I mean for now, because we're about to go through these Twitter files and I just like to remind people what happens over at YouTube and Facebook is probably quadruple what we've uncovered at Twitter. So who knows how long even this program will be allowed. Someone did like a little meme and it was had like an iceberg and it just said it's Twitter for you saw that. But underneath it, all of it was everything we don't know about all the others. I'm sure it's extensive. Oh, it's gotta be. And you know, you gotta wonder if we ever will know any of those about those other companies, probably not. So let's get to the, I feel like anytime, so we tape early on Friday and a little earlier than normal and it's burned me so many freaking times that like news will drop after we've taped the show, but before the show actually airs. And so I think that that was what happened here in this particular situation. Twitter files part four dropped and I was like, oh, cool. So the show that we just taped is totally irrelevant. Now that's great. And the Fauci files might drop really soon. Yeah, well, please don't judge me. Maybe they dropped by the time people are reading this. I don't know. But so we've got the fourth installment and the fifth installment of the Twitter files. The fourth revealed new information about the actions that led to Twitter banning President Donald Trump after the January 6th riot. This was given to blogger Michael Shellenberger and he revealed that Jack Dorsey was actually on vacation at the time of January 6th and all of the events that led up to that point and left Twitter's overwhelmingly progressive staff and senior executives in charge while he was gone. Yol Roth, who is former Twitter global lead of trust and safety, played a large part in banning Trump and Shellenberger revealed back in 2017. Roth tweeted, yes, that person in the pink hat is clearly a bigger threat to your brand of feminism than actual Nazis in the White House, which is totally unbiased and objective, as you would expect. January 7th, Jack Dorsey emailed his employees saying Twitter needs to remain consistent in its policies, including the right of users to return to Twitter after a temporary suspension. And he later excitedly de-m'd his colleagues that Jack Dorsey had approved repeat offender for civic integrity, which created a system where five violations, which are strikes, would result in permanent suspension. One of the people in his little chat said, progress and asked, does this affect our approach to Trump, who I think we publicly said has one remaining strike, or does the incitement to violence aspect change that calculus? Roth responded to that colleague, Trump continues to have just his one strike remaining. This is for everything else. So Trump was still, at that point, allowed to be on the platform. There was perhaps one person, one colleague, who expressed some concern over, you know, free speech and perhaps that this is kind of a dictatorial problem. They said this now appears to be a fiat by an online platform CEO with a global presence that can gatekeep speech for the entire world. Another tweet showed a conversation between a confused senior executive and Roth. The executive asked, Jack says, we will permanently suspend Trump if our policies are violated after a 12 hour account lock. What policies is Jack talking about? Roth said, for internal awareness, this would be any policy violation, not just related or limited to elections. So, he also said that due to unique circumstances that Twitter was dropping its public interest policy, which previously had let Trump stay on that platform despite the violations because what Trump had to say was deemed to be, of course, relevant to the public sphere. As remember, previously they had said, well, I mean, we can't shut down what a president has to say. This is a world leader. Clearly, what he has to say is important to what happens globally and we need to keep him on here. So, they altered their processes and in real time in order to, you know, adapt to the situation that the company was dealing with and get what they wanted, which, of course, was the removal of Donald Trump. So, I want to, it's a lot. So, but I want to catch you up to speed on everything that's happened and then get your take on Twitter files, part four and five. So, part five was published by Barry Weiss earlier today. And she said that January 8, the Washington Post published an open letter signed by over 300 Twitter employees that they were, you know, demanding to Jack Dorsey that Trump's ban that began. They said, we must examine Twitter's complicity in what President-elect Biden has rightly termed insurrection. Weiss also noted that on January 8, Trump did tweet out the 75 million great American patriots who voted for me. America first and make America great again will have a giant voice long in the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form. So, the Twitter executives at that point were trying to figure out if that particular tweet violated any of their policies so that they could ban him. Because again, they're looking, they're searching, they're clamoring for a way to ban this guy and permanently suspend him. And the staff assigned to evaluate the tweets, the tweets decided that he had not violated Twitter's policies. They said, I have a hard time saying this is incitement. It's pretty clear he's saying the American patriots are the ones who voted for him and not the terrorists. We can call them that right in parentheses. From Wednesday, there was another person, Twitter policy official, Anika Navaroli, who said, I also am not seeing clear or coded incitement in the DJT tweet. I'll respond in the elections channel. And Weiss then noted that later, that same woman would go on and testify to the House January 6 committee. For months, I had been begging and anticipating and attempting to raise the reality that if nothing, if we made no intervention into what I saw occurring people were going to die, quite a different tone than what she had on January 8th. So, they kept going back and forth. We've got a couple more tweets here. You can go ahead and throw that up on the screen. Twitter safety team decides that Trump's tweet is also in not violation. They are unequivocal. It's a clear no violation. It's just to say he's not attending the inauguration. And less than 90 minutes after those Twitter employees had decided that. Vijaya Gaddy, Twitter's head of legal policy and trust asked whether it could be coded incitement to further violence. So then, a few minutes later, the Twitter employees on the scaled enforcement team suggested that he may have violated the Twitter glorification of violence policy if you interpret the phrase American Patriots to refer, of course, to the rioters. I mean, you see this happening in real time. They're like, wait, but if we pretend that this means this and then we pretend that this means this, we actually can get him on this. So, they said members of the team came to view him as the leader of a terrorist group responsible for violence, comparable to Christchurch shooter or Hitler. And on that basis and on the totality of his tweets, he should be de-platformed. And then there was an all staff meeting with Gaudy and Jack Dorsey and Twitter announced Trump's permanent suspension. So quite a lot there, a lot to unpack. Again, I feel like I've said this several times since all of these Twitter files started coming out. It's not that we didn't know that these things were going on. It's just that the left continued to call us crazy people and conspiracy theorists and far-right nut jobs for suggesting that Twitter was using their platform to silence conservatives only and that they did not have a double standard. And that's the thing that I want people to take away from this. I want to get your thoughts, gentlemen. But there clearly was collusion for all the talk that the left had to say about Russian collusion, Russian collusion. You can't interfere in elections. That's interfering with democracy. That's a threat to democracy. Okay. Well, they're suspiciously quiet on the left in an entire social media platform interfering with democracy, as they would call it, especially when you're talking about what we already know from the previous Twitter files. We already know that they were having meetings with the FBI with the DOJ. Clearly, the government was influencing what they were censoring and what they were not. And it's just very frustrating to see the left continue to kick the ball to the other side. And you're like, okay, you guys called us crazy for all of these things that we were saying. Now, what are you going to say? Because this clearly was going on. Do you actually care about collusion? My guess is no. One of the weirdest things on this is the lack of Jack Dorsey's presence in a lot of this, which I'm not even sure if I completely and totally believe just yet. But it appears like he even knows going on. It appears like he was just like the multi billionaire all of a sudden from Twitter. And he was just going out and party and everyone's while being the public face. It kind of appears that way. Because if it's not, then he perjured himself to Congress. Right. I saw one back and forth between Musk and Jack Dorsey when Musk says, why weren't you guys doing anything about, you know, it's like child porn, you know, it was like running rampant. And he said that's not true. And then Musk fired back with like some actual receipts on it, which was kind of interesting. But no, you're exactly right. We knew all of this stuff was going on. We just didn't know exactly how it was going on. And these little slack back and forths also never use slack. I don't even use a slack here at work. I mean, like, you know, I'm saying, you never know when this stuff's going to come back and I'm happy to hear that. But these little back and forth kind of show how it went and that one little rant that you are the the timeline. I think that was on January 8th when they're trying to figure out how to they're trying to figure out how to get rid of him. And they're trying to figure out what rules they can bend or shape. But the progression is hilarious. So starting right off the bat, they're like, he's, you know, when he says, Patriots, it's clearly talking about the people that voted for him. There's clearly no, I think there's no no violations. They knew it right from the beginning. And then all of a sudden that one chick that which I can never pronounce her name, Villager, whatever, she was like, wait a minute, what if it's like encrypted 3D chest type stuff? Right. Right. And then all of a sudden it spins out of control to where he's Hitler and part of a leader of a terrorist group. Absolutely nuts. But I mean, oh my gosh, like, when you talk about like all the other platforms that are doing stuff like this, I bet it is worse because it doesn't sound like it was a top down. This is how we're running our company. This is who we're going to censor and all this stuff. It didn't really sound like it was working that way. It was like some of the people behind the scene just manipulating it on their own. But I mean, places like Google for crying out loud. Like they, I mean, we've seen their studies when they purposely mess with the search results so that they can basically brainwash people. Influenced elections. Yeah. I mean, this is just a small tip of the iceberg. I don't think we'll find out from the other, some of the other companies, but they can't deny it anymore. Yeah, the danger is not abroad. The call is coming from inside the house, John, when it comes to interfering in our elections and threatening democracy. Is that movie Black Christmas? Is it in the 1970s slasher reference? No, very timely. Yeah, it's interesting to see like the way that they act on Facebook, you know, your relatives calling you a Nazi for disagreeing with them. That actually has infected like the literal, you know, Twitter institutions and all these other institutions where they think that we're like actually Nazis. And this was kind of our fault because I think that it was considered to be a very large, like celebrated moral crusade for Americans to have our involvement in World War II. And then we allowed for, I think, education to focus largely on that when people are young, but then because the left controls the education, they defined being a Nazi as simply being anti-communist and being like relatively socially conservative. And so now, because Trump supporters are, you know, anti-communist, relatively social conservative, therefore, we are Nazis. And I like to how he used the phrase, these are actual Nazis implying almost he understands that like they've always used that as just a buzzword. But then this time, they're actual Nazi. And then even then it's like not even the case. So yeah, I completely agree that it is good that this all came out. And I have seen some like sort of cynical takes from a lot of people who I think are younger and kind of like dopamine starved where they view a lot of politics as just entertainment. And so they're like, oh, well, we already knew this. This isn't anything new. And it's like, well, do you want to be entertained or do you want to actually like take the country back? Because this is a prerequisite to kind of making people know that this is actually happening. We're not crazy. And if it's just Twitter, like he mentioned before, we started taping. Imagine what else is infected if this is just Twitter coming out now. Yeah. This is what's crazy is this has become Elon Musk. Like it's almost like he wants to take this on more than he wants to go to Mars now. He made a tweet, I think it was for sure. I think it was today where he was like, if we don't destroy or defeat the what is it called? It's called the Woke Hive Mind. Yeah. Then we've lost it all. I mean, he's gung ho. Yeah. Well, I mean, imagine, you know, I had this conversation, I know we got to take a break in a second, but I had this conversation with Chad last week where, you know, when it when all of this first started coming out and he said that this was a violation of the First Amendment. You know, and this was the government colluding and all of this. And people were like, at the time they had not exposed any government entities that were involved in it. And I said, this is the same thing that people said when President Trump was like, they spied on me. They were doing that, you know, and that you're like, all right, crazy. That sounds a little conspiratorial. That's because he had seen what was behind the curtain already. And when you do that, you sound like the crazy person because you know so much. You give a little bit and no one else has the context. And everyone's like, yeah, right. That's not the government wasn't involved. And I said last week before it ended up being true, I was like, I promise you, Elon Musk will come out with more to show that the FBI and the DOJ and that there were government entities that were tied to this. And I'm sure he has proof that Joe Biden's team is still going back and forth with Twitter or maybe not to this day, but was up until the point of Elon's, you know, takeover. So it's just it's it's I feel bad for him because a lot of the things that he's saying, he's getting pushed back for. And it's like, he has seen behind the curtain. And I'm sure that it makes you sound crazy. But really, he's just seen way too much to be able to process. Really quickly, just as a preview, Musk tweeted his pronouns. This is cute. He tweeted his pronouns earlier this weekend where my pronouns are prosecute slash Fauci, which a bunch of people were like, well, hold on. Are we is the next Twitter installment going to be on Fauci? Are we going to get some of that dirt? He said, Oh, it is coming big time. So stay on the lookout for that. Or just, you know, watch the news and why it matters. And we'll get the info to you. We've got more to come first. We want to thank our sponsor, Patriot Mobile. So, you know, typically, when you see an offer for a free iPhone, it's usually too good to be true. Just like freedom itself, nothing is free.

Last night, a massive caravan of more than a thousand illegal immigrants crossed the southern border of the United States into, of course, El Paso, Texas. Here's a look at that for those of you who are watching. Um, poi, that is crazy. Wide open. I mean, if you'd talked to the Biden administration, they would say that the borders are closed and secure. I beg to differ from not just this, but the multiple multiple videos that are coming mostly from our friend Jorge Ventura over the daily caller from Bill Malusion, the sky Fox News correspondent who has been doing impressive work on the border. By the way, I am in touch with our very own Yaku Buoyans who is in El Paso right now and dealing with some, he's been sending some videos. I just need to make sure to get clearance before we can show them and maybe talk with him while he's out there. But there's some really, really bad stuff going on. So before the migrants crossed, Mexican police escorted nearly 20 buses full of migrants into a Mexican city across from El Paso and then released them at multiple NGOs. So then they walked from the NGOs to the river across illegally into El Paso. And, um, let's see, the, the Chihuahua Mexico governor said right now between 1200 to 1500 migrants are coming through Jimenez in the south of the state guarded by the federal government. There's no more space in the shelters. If they arrive in, uh, CU Dajuaras, we will look out for them, but we are urgently calling on the federal government for help. Um, look, I, when we talk about this issue, the, the thing that is the most disturbing to me is the left, um, the left's monopoly on claiming compassion for these people, right? You have, if you are compassionate, if you're a compassionate person, these people just want a better life. You let them in is what we hear from the left. What could possibly go wrong? Well, the thing is, is that there are a bunch of human traffickers who are bringing children and women over here. By the way, repeatedly raping them along the way. And, uh, if, if the women and children actually end up making it and they don't die or are left to die along the way, um, it's not a good situation for them. And oftentimes they are put in the hands of people who are just going to traffic them sometimes for the rest of their lives. So it's just difficult to, to comprehend the compassion argument coming from the left. Uh, this morning on that note, Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a statement on human trafficking in Texas saying, my office has received details concerning the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services transferring illegal alien children to the custody of adult criminals, including sex traffickers. My human trafficking and transnational organized crime division is carefully reviewing those details and determining whether and how we can bring justice to these monsters and save these poor kids. What's more, we will get to the bottom of how the Biden administration is facilitating these horrors since we know its open border policies are a key driver of human trafficking and child sex trafficking. Um, I just want to give kudos to Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has been really tremendous on this particular issue and on suing the Biden administration when he can. But remember, he can't do it all. And it seems that we have a governor who is unwilling. Trust me, when I tell you, a Rourke would have been a lot worse. I'm not saying we should have not voted for Governor Abbott. But what the hell is he doing, allowing this to continue, knowing that the federal government is not what is the federal government going to do? We see what they're doing. So grow some balls and do something and stand up to them, rather than just continuing to allow this to happen. Oh, but he did do something. He declared an invasion. Right. And did what? Right. He declared it on Twitter. What the hell else has he done? Yeah, I don't understand what they're doing. And that seems to be more of kind of what we see from Abbott, which is disappointing. But ever since COVID, a lot of lip service, but not a whole lot of follow through, which is pretty much the GOP, you know, inflammation, you know, over the past forever. I remember back during the Obama time when we were talking about the border, they were getting hundreds and hundreds. And his DHS secretary at the time was it? Shane Johnson, Jensen, something like that said that, oh, if we get a thousand people coming across the border, then, you know, a day, then we'll have a crisis. Well, this was that video was a thousand people plus just in one sitting, the border patrol said in the past 48 hours. So yesterday in the day before, they had 16,000 in a 48 hour period, 8,000 per day. So you're eight times what you would have declared a crisis for back under Obama. This is the dish. This is the dismantling of our country right now. It's obviously there's there's side effects like this where you're having human trafficking, which is awful, horrible. What else is going on besides that? I mean, fentanyl is being brought across. People are dying from that. But beyond that, it's just not sustainable. They know this. They knew this when they started seeing them migrants showing up to places like, not migrants, when you say this illegal alien showing up to places like Martha's Vineyard or New York, when a couple of thousand drove them to call in the National Guard. Like this is this is a crisis. We can't handle this many. 2000? Okay. That's a couple of hours here in Texas in Arizona. Right. That's all that is. And one, yeah, one spot, a couple of hours. Yeah. One small border town doesn't have the capacity to be able to handle that much of an influx of people. John, on the on the topic of compassion, I would say let's have some compassion for the American people. This doesn't seem compassionate to any of the American people to bring all of these people in and cause all of this destruction. Oftentimes they're not properly vetted. We just discussed child sex trafficking, human trafficking doesn't feel very compassionate to your fellow citizen. No, it's exactly the opposite. And the oath that they swear when they swear no to uphold the constitution is for the American people. I mean, the American government exists for the American people. And they swear an oath to the constitution, which was written. I mean, it even says for ourselves and for our posterity, meaning our descendants, not descendants from all over the world. We're not this like economic zone for everybody to go to if they want a better life. I mean, where are we supposed to go if we want a better life? I mean, we have to stay here. I think it's Ronald Reagan that said maybe like if America falls, there's nowhere else to go. And that's absolutely true. And you're importing these populations who are fundamentally incompatible with American culture. And the voting reflects that even on the second and third generation. And the Democrats know that there are only a few cycles away from passing the amnesty, getting all these new voters. And that's going to be basically irreparable for, I think, the GOP in terms of winning another federal election again. And even if you look at the economic benefits that people say they bring, if you look at like what that actually is proportionally, I think something like 98 or 99% of all of that increased GDP just goes to themselves and like added wages. So you know, you'll have people coming in from India or from China who come and they serve as an executive or they do something. The bottom line is that America and the West broadly speaking built the entire modern world. We have that class of people who have the innovation and the excellence and all of the things that can do that, you're not going to convince me that it's actually like, oh, Americans are so bad and so dumb and dull that we actually need all these other people coming to fix our country. It's like, no, that's exactly the opposite of the case. Yeah. You know what pisses me off? It's because I worked in LA for a long time. And a lot of this, you know, bleeding heart crap you hear from not only from like, like, that's now like far left position is now to have open borders. That didn't used to be the case. Left-wing populist used to say we need closed borders. Because we have videos from Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. Bernie Sanders. Right, exactly. But you get these people in Hollywood and they're all helping to push this too. And even the city they live in is built to basically have a big wall of mountains in between them. They're over the hills, what we used to say. And then the other side of the hill, the valley, that's where all the people that served them would go. That was their housekeepers, that was our gardeners, that was like all this in service. So they were fine with saying this on TV. But as long as all the people at the end of the day, they could wave to them and they had to make the long trek back over the hills and go into their little cage over there. They were fine with it. They are such hypocrites to this day. I cannot stand it. I think about what I hear out there. And oh my gosh. Yeah, it's bad. By the way, I know we got to take a quick break. But Governor Doug Ducey over in Arizona, of course, the outgoing governor there, he is he's ordered construction to go back to the Mexican border to continue installing hundreds of double stacked shipping containers to fill the gaps in the border wall. This is after the Biden administration asked him to stop and Arizona filed a lawsuit and said, no, I think we're going to go ahead and protect our borders. It'll be interesting to see how Arizona handles it once Katie Hobbs shows her down replaces Ducey in January. She said she's planning to weigh, quote, all the options for settling the shipping container issue after she takes office, which is very cute that she wouldn't take a stand one way or the other until she I mean, of course, safe and secure election. One, that particular one without fortifying it, because how could she possibly fortify it as the secretary of the state? Oh, okay. Well, I'm sure I'm sure it was fine anyway. So it'll be interesting to see how she how she shakes out on that. It's obviously an issue that affects, you know, people who live in Arizona as well as Texans and Californians. And I just think it'll be interesting to see what the ramifications of letting all of this influx illegal immigrants in what the ramifications are going to be for the next couple of years, because they are going to continue to get worse and worse the longer we get into it. All right. When we come back, let's talk about federal court blocking the Biden administration from forcing Christian doctors to perform transsexual mutilation services. Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen. But when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Over the weekend, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit agreed with a district court's opinion that the Obamacare mandate requiring facilitation of sex changes posed irreparable harm to Franciscan alliances exercise of religion. This is a Catholic health care organization of 12 hospitals and many provider offices throughout Indiana and Illinois. And the court ultimately found the transsexual mandate unlawful and granted Franciscan alliance a permanent injunction so they will no longer face multi million dollar penalties for refusing to perform sex change operations that violate their religious beliefs. According to the religious liberty group Beckett who filed the lawsuit on behalf of the plaintiffs, they said the mandate made no exceptions for providers who believe those procedures to be harmful or object to them on religious grounds. And it applied to all patients, including children, while only the plaintiffs in this case will presently receive protection from these rulings. This and related rulings will of course provide legal precedent for future lawsuits. You got to believe this is like this issue I guess is going to go to the Supreme Court just like all the other religious liberty issues that have to go there because you know I guess the left the left can't stand it when you do not abide by their I don't know insistence that it's okay to mutilate children, to mutilate adults even, to bake a cake celebrating a transgender gender trans gender reveal cake. I mean it just they just don't seem to get the whole religious liberty thing. I guess because none of them actually believe in God. Well, their God is you know their party. I think they're their political party at this point. I'm starting to lose count of how many things that the Biden administration has gotten shot down from in federal court because and it's it's amazing to me that that's not a bigger story like this is not a this is not a surprise but it's it's very telling to the American people. This is the Obama campaign day. Yeah, yeah, I mean but how many others I mean just recently about the the student loan forgiveness much of other things he's doing things that are blatantly unconstitutional. Just doesn't give a quick excuse. The moratorium on on paying rent. Which wasn't that the one that at the time he said he knew that it was unconstitutional he was just going to do it anyway. Yeah, okay. I mean that right there's an impeachable offense. Yeah. Just that right there. Yeah. I cannot believe so you mentioned in that it included children in this. I don't okay. Yeah, that's that's unconstitutional trying to force people you know religious people doing something that's against the religion. But I mean the fact that it's legal for doctors to perform operations or prescribe drugs that mutilates their body on a minor should not be legal. Period. Our none. That's insane. I think it's 47 states allow gender affirming care for minors. 47 states. So basically the vast majority of our country children are not safe. There's only three states that have restrictions. That's insane. And one of them is not Texas. No, we're fighting for that in January. No, and that pissed me off because I read that and I was like no, no, they said something. They refused to take it up. That's all they said. They said they were going to look into it. Get out of here with that. Look into it. I know. I know. I know. I know. There was a list that came out like two days ago that said Texas is only like the 26th most conservative state in the country or something. That's wild. Like below average or something. It's a California coming in here. And we were supposed to be I mean look I'm an immigrant to Texas. So I won't all assimilate. I'll say yeah. But it was like a joke. I mean Texas was supposed to be so crazy right wing conservative. That was like the butt of jokes for these people for so long. And even like in Florida for example where they had the don't say gay bill that was supposed to prevent this. They just said okay you have to wait until fourth grade to start. And I thought about that and I was like wait a minute. When did I first have like the talk about that in school? And it was fourth grade. That was the first time we got the boys in one room, girls in the other room. Okay here's what's going to happen to your bodies. Here's what's going to happen to their bodies etc. And it's like we've lost so much that now they're just cementing okay that conversation. You have to wait until fourth grade. But then they're also going to learn about like anal sex and genital mutilation and stuff. Like that's the state of where our children are in this country. And you mentioned the Supreme Court that reminded me of you guys probably remember this a lot better than I do. Remember during the 2000s when they would not shut up about George Bush and the unitary executive theory. Like they made so many movies about this. Like George Bush is literally Hitler. He's ruling as a dictator because of this obscure legal interpretation or something. They would not shut up about this. But now like Biden's just like I'm just going to do this. And if I'm the president then it must be legal. And they're like so true. It reminds me of the point that we were talking about earlier with immigration. When you've got the Supreme Court arguing now for affirmative action at least they were recently. And they actually said in federal court or in the Supreme Court and it's on the record now, well why don't you just control instead of for race for economic factors. And they literally said well because when we control for just economic factors you get too many white people. And it's like I feel so badly for all those like high IQ white guys in the middle of the country who if they were simply allowed an equal playing field they could become the engineers and people. And they would get infiltrate Twitter and they would just be like oh woke. I don't know about that because they've never heard of that. I mean if we're in a brassica or something but because the where government is structured all of those people have to get pushed under the rug and shoved out to make way for these new Americans to come in from all over the world. Yeah. On the issue of the trans issue I want to get back to you just for a second because I think it's so important to highlight the travesties that a lot of these people oftentimes they are minors but sometimes they're adults that they're going through being told that they should transition to another gender when in actuality it's doing more harm than good. A lot of detransitioners coming out and telling their stories. One of them is Chris Beck. This is a retired Navy SEAL who became famous after a 2013 CNN interview where he announced that he was transgender. He has since detransitioned and he said that the past 10 years of his transition destroyed his life watch. We're you heard our kids kids are dying and I don't want that to happen it's killing me because I helped do that. CNN and how they use me part of my image is is hurting these kids and I want to make sure the whole world knows everything you see on CNN with my face do not even believe a word of it. Everything that happened to me for the last 10 years is just it's just horrible. It destroyed my life. I destroyed my life. I'm not a victim. I did it to myself but I had some help. He certainly did. He said that traumatic things you know happened to him while he was a child and that he was you know how he was raised was not an excuse for a psychologist to push their agenda and that's what happened. He also said as we say so often it is so freaking easy. The medical community is like human rights crimes, human rights abuses. He said I walked into a psychologist office and in one day had a letter in my hand saying I was transgender. I was authorized for hormones. I was authorized for all this other stuff. They are not doing the due diligence. We've talked to Chloe Cole on the program. They're not doing the due diligence that they need to do and that these people again oftentimes minors deserve these minors, these people who need mental illness treatment, not someone to give them a piece of paper saying here you can chop your penis off. I almost had to use the swear jar. You can chop your penis off or you can chop your breasts off. Here you go. I talked to you for 45 minutes. Let's schedule your freaking surgery. I mean it's again self-sensoring your welcome edit team. It is freaking criminal what they are doing to these people who truly need help. I like look I know I'm I'm going to toss it to you guys for just last words on this but it is so enraging to me that it's like these people need help and the medical community is just completely abandoning them and saying no you should we're going to participate in your delusion oftentimes making this absolutely worse for you. Last word. That is correct. I think that once we take power we should really start to get into the weeds with things like the eighth amendment, cruel and unusual punishment. It's not cruel if they did it to kids and we just do it to them in public and it's not unusual if we normalize it. We just do it so often. It's like oh that yeah it happens all the time so I think it should happen to them too. All the doctors who are performing these surgeries on kids. Yeah. Oh my god I totally agree. The people he called out media some of these doctors definitely big culpability and I was getting very pissed off as I was listening to him blame everybody else because I was like bro you're not. He did take responsibility. Yeah you're not. He did take some responsibility but there's just a lot of weak willed people out there that really pissed me off and it surprises me coming from like someone like you know a Navy Seal. I don't get that at all but I mean some of the people I guess I should be careful with the way I say it but seriously though like you were a guy have some balls and a lot of this and a lot of this. He might not have this. He might not have this anymore but and that starts with heads of families. Yeah. You know raise your children right raise them to have a mind of their own voice of their own. These drones that were spitting out into colleges and out into public that's got to stop. Yeah amen. All right we've got to we got to take another quick break we'll be right back. Yeah I just don't want to get out of here. Russian state media is mocking the United States for trading Brittany Greiner for convicted arms dealer Victor Boot aka of course the merchant of death instead of former military Paul Whelan. Let's watch some of this and I'll read you what they're saying watch. He said he is a hero. A decorated Marine covered in metals. He only has one. No two. No three problems. His first problem is that he's white. The second problem is he is a man. His third problem. He is a heterosexual. This is not something that can be forgiven today. It's just a catastrophe. They said yes here Breiner beats him with every aspect. American voters were given a choice. A hero he suffered while serving in his father land. A metal covered hero who suffered during his service to his father land. The United States or a black lesbian who put on drugs who suffered for a faith with hat sheets. So that's I mean listen Putin is bad but where's the lie I would say gentlemen. Yeah well first off he was not a decorated Marine covered in metals that was an embellishment. He was a dishonorably discharged Marine. Still a Marine. He can't take that away from me so he's still a Marine. But also not a spy. But that's one of the points that I've made before is that he never would have been recruited to be a spy because he was dishonorably discharged. That would have immediately knocked him out. So it's total bull crap and trumped up. What's crazy here is that our media, mainstream media for pointing this out will call us spreaders of Russian disinformation and propaganda. I think something that Russia is very very good at is providing because they're all about nationalism. That's what controls their state. So people will say hey they're the Christian leaders in the world. No they're not. They're not the Christian leaders in the world. But they do talk a lot about Christian values and stuff to galvanize their people. And it's also a lot of this like they're stepping out against woke. They're being anti-woke and they're stepping out against that. The crazy thing is they're doing that propaganda for their people to galvanize them. We're calling something a truth that they're talking about. We're saying hey look yes that is true. But we're not spreading Russian propaganda for saying look that is true. And it absolutely is true. The thing that Griner has is she's black, she's female and she's a lesbian. Obviously they're not going to get the white dude out. Obviously it's ridiculous. It's really sad. And the Victor Boot, him being traded for, should have been traded for a spy or multiple spies. That's how bad he was. Yeah well I know that's like what is so fascinating to me. It's just how weak this administration is that they're doing a one for one trade. As if Britney Griner, that trade, that exchange is as valuable as a Victor Boot. If you're going to do that trade and it's not a one for one like a spy or someone comparable like Jason said, it's multiple people. You're getting multiple American civilians out for this exchange. You're not just like oh yeah sure one for one. Take your pick for the merchant of death. If I had my tin foil hat on I would say that that was intentional to demoralize American patriots. To think that you can go and serve your country and become a marine and then the government is going to pick somebody who is openly hostile towards the country that you love so much that you risked your life to serve for it. And who's also not even a relevant cultural figure. I mean this is the most famous thing that this person's ever been involved in. Who's also hooked on drugs as everything else that they mentioned there. So I think that that really does discourage normal people from just pursuing things that would be good for their country. It's this, it's the invasion. All this stuff happens and you've got conservatives who are really involved in politics. Imagine how many people have just dropped out and just given up and they just want to ride the decline, pursue earthly pleasures and just get high and just get through life without actually pursuing anything greater because it's like what left is there to pursue. You've also discouraged people going into the military and law enforcement. But you've encouraged countries like Russia and China to just take random Americans if they go as tourists off because they'll trade anything. You know what I mean? You're encouraging more abductions across the world over this. I mean I really you could make so much more of a point of Russian collusion with this particular trade under the Joe Biden watch than you could with Donald Trump. Certainly none of this happened. The invasion of Ukraine, all of that conveniently didn't happen under Donald Trump's watch and I want to to read you here specifically for you, John, because I know you are Donald Trump's biggest fan. Trump wrote on truth social about this matter. I turned down a deal with Russia for a one-on-one swap of the so-called merchant of death for Paul Whelan. I wouldn't have made the deal for a hundred people in exchange for someone that has killed untold numbers of people with his arms deals. I would have gotten Paul out. However, just as I did with a record number of other hostages, the deal for Griner is crazy and bad. The taking wouldn't have even happened during my administration, but if it did, I would have gotten her out fast. Your response. Well, that's really the genius with the branded administration because you've got all of the tens of billions of dollars funding this proxy war in Ukraine simply to throw like the cent off the trail. So they don't actually understand that there is collusion between the Biden administration in Russia because of Brittany Griner in particular, who was like obviously this genius calculated political actor who they were trying to leverage, but they didn't want people to know about that collusion so they were funding this proxy Oregon's Russia. Jason, last word on Trump's remarks. I think he's exactly right. I mean, there was no reason why this guy should have gone out. I mean, all the people they claimed to care about people in Africa, he was funding all the Africa wars for crying out loud. Who is he going to get secure arms for now? Russian military? Russian mercenaries that are now in eastern Ukraine? Yeah. Your biggest, you know, like flagship issue that you love right now? Yeah. I mean, it goes against everything. It's a nut. Again, in regarding his statement, where's the lie? We've got more to come. We'll be right back. A few weeks ago, sports writer Grant Wall complained on Twitter that he was detained at the World Cup in Qatar for wearing a pride shirt. Yesterday, the same Grant Wall collapsed and died suddenly during a game at the World Cup. The circumstances around his death are unclear. He previously said he had bronchitis after catching a nasty bug at the World Cup, visited a clinic for some meds. His brother, however, believes that Wall was targeted and killed for supporting LGBTQ issues over in Qatar. I completely unrelated YouTube. I also would just like to know his status of how many vaccines he had. Maybe he got a booster before he went overseas. I don't know. But what I do know is it's always very fascinating to watch Americans travel to other countries and become shocked to learn that they don't tolerate LGBTQ communities as much as America does, where they're so oppressed here. John. Yeah. You know, I'm praying for him, but there is this sort of weird. You're praying for him. He's dead. Yeah. Well, you can pray for somebody's soul, which I am definitely doing for this guy who hates me. Well, hated me probably past tense. It is interesting to see how the remnants of the anti-war left who were like, there's all these different cultures and everyone was like, and then they go over and they're like, oh, no, I don't like your culture. I'm going to try to antagonize you by wearing this t-shirt and you know, expressing my proclivities and ways that are inconduced with your culture. Yeah, so they're so oppressed, Jason. It can go both ways either or. The bad thing is we'll never see a real investigation on sudden adult death syndrome. Right. Right. Yeah. Sad. Don't worry. There's not it's again. How is it sad if it makes me happy? That's a joke. That's a joke. We'll see you tomorrow."
