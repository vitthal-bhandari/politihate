    "text": " Good morning and welcome to Rising. We have a smashing show for you today. Brianna, what do we have? Well, the New York Times reporting that Europe's economy is taking a nose dive amid the war in Ukraine. That's quote literally posing a threat to the country's living standards in industry. We discussed earlier this week how Russian sanctions have backfired and caused a spike in energy prices, some of the highest inflation rates in their own risk of recession. The Times said this quote several countries including Germany, the region's largest economy built of a decades long dependency on Russian energy. Now an 80% increase in prices presents a historic threat in Europe. As plans for factory closings rolling blackouts and rationing are being drawn up in case of severe shortages this winter. Now the UK government announced a freeze on gas and electricity bills for the average household at 2,500 pounds a year for the next two years. Meanwhile, the EU is seeking mandatory cuts in electricity use during peak hours. Here's the EU Commission President yesterday using some familiar messaging on the proposal. And this is what is expensive because in these peak demands the expensive gas comes into the market. So what we have to do is flatten the curve and avoid the peak demands. We will propose a mandatory target for reducing electricity use at peak hours and we will work very closely with the member states to achieve this. Interesting to hear that flattened the curve rhetoric. Someone of my ideological bent might say that we were being prepared to accept shut downs and limitations and things that COVID was a tester on for a society that's more greatly managed by government and has more infringence on your rights and when you're allowed to water your grass or turn on the sprinklers or use energy. That's terminology that's used in times of scarcity and I think we should look at and point to the source of the cause of the scarcity in the first instance. You know that there's a pandemic obviously you do want to minimize the number of people who are getting ill and at the time earlier in COVID dying from it in this case this is an economic issue that is really pointed. But what is interesting here is that unlike in the United States of America they are flattening the curve by simply capping out-of-pocket energy costs at an enormous expense to the government. But they are saying we are going to subsidize the cost here in a way that when we bring it up the United States is considered to be you know the height of socialism even though it was the very policy that very much Republican Richard Nixon implemented in the 1970s as we had a guest Richard Wolfe talk about just last week. But all of this comes after Putin threatened to cut off all energy supply if western countries imposed a price cap on Russian oil and gas and China is seizing the opportunity for cheap gas according to Bloomberg. China is lapping up liquefied natural gas shipments from Russia for a bargain. That allows China to then resell the gas to Europe and Asia at premium prices. Which just eliminates the purpose entirely eliminates the whole thing. We're not going to you know we're not going to buy from you because we're mad at you so they'll sell to China but we're still going to buy to China. It's so stupid. It shows how economically destructive and impoverishing, immiserating these policies are. Yeah the idea that there was an ethical source of gas when we know that the whole planet is ruled by the OPEC cartel was really a kind of silly misnomer to begin with. Again I think I did a radar a couple of months ago teeing up the human rights abuses and the issues that we should have with Saudi Arabia with all of the issues that we have or are said to have in this moment with Russia. And it's the idea that you're playing favorites between these two sources of oil and deciding that you're going to sanction it and kind of publicly villainize Russian oil specifically for this crime and not all of the crimes that Saudi Arabia has undergone is really it displays the kind of mercenary root of all of our foreign policy. The leaders of the world including the leaders of our government, the leaders of European countries, the leaders of Russia and the leaders of China are all mutually deciding to make us all more miserable and poorer for their various geopolitical ambitions. Yeah and profit. And profit let's not forget the extent to which price gouging has been a big part of both this oil story and a lot of the other prices that continue to be high even though many of the supply chain issues that caused them have diminished. You could have profit and less suffering though. You could have a certain degree. The profits are high because bar goes are being placed and trying to get around them. But that's actually not true as we've discussed a little bit on this show. There has been a lot of reporting and research that shows that the extreme profits that companies have seen during the course of the pandemic go way beyond profit. It's price gouging up the term with the real meaning which means that companies are using the cover of their being a supply chain crisis to raise prices and keep them high because they know they can justify and ordinarily the consumer base would get very angry, boycott products and other companies would compete and undersell them. But this is the problem markets aren't neat and markets aren't efficient. But the market is prohibited. Government is prohibiting who you can buy stuff from, where you can do that you're not having markets operate. So yes, the markets are all out of sorts. Well I'm talking specifically about price gouging and people who have, there was just a market call. There was a response to- There was just a market call that was supported, if not yesterday than earlier this week, that people who listened to the three M corporate call noticed that they were saying congratulations for pushing up prices on these materials. So no one, they're literally slapping themselves in the back for keeping prices high on in this case, they manufacture mass. So in this case, literally, you know, tools, PPE that are keeping people safe in the context of the pandemic saying, you know, we've resolved a lot of these issues that artificially were keeping prices high because of supply chain. And now we're going to continue to keep them high to squeeze as much out of the public as we can in this moment. That's been happening with oil. We saw earlier in this, you remember, we talked about this, but the price of oil per barrel was not correlated to what was happening at the pump because again, they knew that all of the kind of public conversation about supply chain issues enabled them under the cloak of night to continue to keep prices high. My understanding is- You price gouging or the sudden increases in prices are an economic development to keep down. You have shortages if you don't do that because if there's more people who want the thing than there is the thing available, they raise the prices and some people stop by and they have shortages. I see what the Mr. Taines say. So raising prices in general profit is different than price gouging. Definitially, price gouging is when people raise prices more than they need to to turn a profit and keep them high in order to- I don't think that's what people describe as price. Usually- I've heard price gouging referred to when there's rushes on products during weather emergencies and things like that. So they say they're price gouging. Well, that's because they're going to be lines out the door for this product unless they raise the price. No, supply and demand. I'm describing a very specific phenomenon, Robby. I'm saying the same phenomenon. Again, this is three, no. When you have people admitting on their market calls that they are intentionally keeping profits higher than they need to turn a profit. They're keeping prices rather higher than they need to turn a profit because they know they can get away with it. That is a very different thing than saying, oh, they got to do what they got to do. And in fact, if we're going to talk about the kinds of things people have done in emergencies, emergencies like the ones Europe is going through right now where they're facing winter. It's a country where during the summer they experience a lot of harm because they don't have, you know, they have had a hotter than usual summer. They don't have air conditioner. Now they're going into it because they don't get- doesn't get that hot in any places there. Now they're going into the winter when they actually do rely on their heating systems and they simply aren't going to be able to afford oil because of the prices of oil. The country is getting access to the oil so there's not exactly the supply chain issue, but it is very expensive. Artificial constraints are being placed on the supply of all these things by government policy. We could keep prices down more if we were not sanctioning Russia. I mean, if- Of course, of course that's true, Robby. But Russia has nothing to do with going on with mass manufacturers prices. But mass manufacturers are intentionally, intentionally driving up profit at a time when historically, what I was trying to get to before is that historically, and during time of crisis of war, like what Europe is experiencing, what you had was companies, the government frankly, capping the extent to which these people can raise prices to prevent price gouging. Of course, they're not trying to drive businesses out of business. That doesn't help anybody if the people can't manufacture the goods that you need in the first place. And you need the working, the workforce to actually still get paid. But what they did was they capped the price of goods because they understood that there is a point beyond the profit that you need to keep your business going. That ultimately comes out of the pocket, the average worker, during a moment of crisis. And you can disagree on a policy level. You can decide and sit here and say that you think infinite profit is a good thing for the world, even in the time of crisis where people are hurting. But that is literally what some government- If you charge something, if you charge more for something that people are willing to pay for, someone else can come along, offer the good at a lower price, unless there's an artificial constraint on the supply of it, usually because of government subsidies or embargoes or regulations to stop people from competing. The whole point is what is every time? Well, that is a government-managed cartel on artificial concern. I don't care if the government are not Robbie. I'm not allergic. I'm not married to the government. The government isn't my best friend. Saying it's the government doesn't make me like it. The point is that these are government cartels, the OPEC cartel, all of the anti-monopoly laws we have are because companies work together to agree to keep their prices in lockstep, to screw over the consumer. This is like basic anti-monopoly antitrust law. This is what happens in America. But the reason we're at the mercy of this cartel is because we don't have enough alternatives domestically or we're sanctioning or refusing to engage in the energy trade we have in the country. If our government allowed for more domestic competition, then we would not worry. It's a government-caused issue that cartels power. That is the argument for antitrust law. There is no competition because companies buy up the competition and you can't prevent that without, yes, I'm sorry, government regulations that prevent these massive mergers. That means that we only have like four eyeglass companies in the entire country and we have this diversity of labels on our products in the supermarket, but they're all made by the same three manufacturers. We only have four major meat manufacturers in the United States of America. And that's why the meat industry- And the ability to believe in invariably because of government policy that prevents competition. No, Robbie, it could be because we don't have- No, Robbie, literally we- this could be- don't have the antitrust laws that prevented- That's ridiculous. That's totally ridiculous. That prevented those kinds of conglomerations from coming together in the first place. That's literally what happened. And not- I don't know what to tell you, Rob, because that's just very much quite literally what happened and that's why we had- Biden did make an effort with some policy to try to address the gouging that was happening. Very specifically- Every time we talk about the- the baby formula, we see artificial constraints imposed by government to rent cheaper, better, perfectly good alternatives from other countries from being used here. This is true of food. This is true of energy. Robbie, there are a lot of different causes to the baby formula thing. There's no issue with saying, of course, you know, or, you know, with the cursory look at- Province standards. Province standards companies are not the problem or not the main problem. Let me finish the point. If you raise a point. There's nothing wrong with saying, cursor, when you look and make sure there's a basic safety standard being that, of course, you should lift whatever barriers there are to importing baby formula in the crisis. But you cannot ignore that the crisis happened because of there was negligence along the line, including within the FDA, not following up on a whistleblower report of the factory not being safe. If you have choice- No, wait, let's not forget that the reason that that factory shut down was not because of the government, but because the factory made poisonous baby formula that killed two babies. And if we have choice and competition and we have other companies that make that product and we allow them to do that, we're not so reliant- I think I agree with it. Right, being reliant on one big central entity, whether it's a government or a corporation or whatever, to supply the thing, is risky. And we're seeing the downsides and the risks and dangers of that. So I'm not disagreeing with you that that's a bad arrangement, but I see a lot of collusion and working together between the major firms, and the major firm also wants to be the only firm, and they use the government to get that. And they- They do. They do. They have used the government by lobbying with millions of dollars to roll back the antitrust- Look at our pharmaceuticals. Yes, they lobby to get control of the government because they know that the government has tools to protect the people. Does the government- Why do I agree with that? Does the government use those tools? Often it does not because it is captured. That is the whole point. So I'm not arguing that there are not these flaws in government, but the- I'm saying these flaws will be exacerbated with a bigger and more powerful government with more authority- No, the solution isn't- The solution is- The solution is- The solution is- The solution isn't less government. The solution isn't letting the people who have corrupted government to then they can get their own way have a less-a-fair opportunity to- to exploit the entire population. Well, I thought we were agreeing. Serious philosophical disagreements. Well, I don't even remember what we were talking about before we got on this subject, but meanwhile, several countries in the EU have taken to the streets to protect- to protest the soaring energy prices and voice opposition to the EU and NATO. In Germany, people gathered to protest the government sanctions against Russia and increase energy bills. In Prague, upwards of 70,000 people gathered to demand neutrality in the war and action on energy prices, while in France, resistance signs flooded the streets over Macron's handling of NATO and economic conditions. Friend of the show and leftist economist Richard Wolff heated a warning to the US over the uprising saying it's a quote, omen of what's to come. I don't know, Robbie. I- I would like to think that there was that same kind of revolutionary spirit here in the United States, but I know I think part of what our conversation, you know, revealed, and I think many people do feel like you, is that there is this- I'm sorry, what- from my perspective is complacency and a belief that things can't be better. The best we can do is to let market actors screw the population in whatever way they can. If a government is to step in, we are mad at the government for intervening on the behalf of us in Europe, their government is responsive enough, at least- or some of these countries, at least there's a response of enough, that they're at least say, oh, we're going to cover the cost of your high oil. We have an entire city in Jackson, Mississippi, the capital city of the state and the United States of America, who is having to fight its state legislature for the funds to actually fix the water pipes so they can even have clean drinking water. We don't even have that level of expectations, so do you think we're going to have people in the streets protesting? Our government has stepped in, and their- in their stepping in was saying, we will continue this war, whatever it takes. That was their- that was their stepping in. Yeah, I mean, it is interesting. We spoke to Miley yesterday here on the show about some of the sociological political cultural differences between here and Europe, and why it is that I think that even though they have obviously this new conservative prime minister and these many conservative aspects of their government, they still- those conservative parties still yield a certain base level of social benefit that we don't have in the United States of America. Well, certainly our Republican party could learn- should learn something from the conservative party of England. America, despite is a more, I would say, more right-wing country than England, but the conservative party in England is much more politically successful over my lifetime or over the last 15 years. They've been- they've been how long have they been power? Almost that entire- it's been a long time. Republican parties have not- the Republican party in the U.S. has not exercised anything approaching the level of dominance over our- the U.S. political system compared to the conservative party, even though you'd think America, the U.S. would be a more favorable landscape for a conservative party than the U.K. So it's very, very- Lots of reasons for that, including I- I'd have to say that they got their Marshall Plan and a certain expectation of social safety net and social support, and then the- the laissez-faire America, we- we've- I mean, I never said that being for the social safety net isn't popular. It's certainly popular. It was Trump's singular good political insight was to not run against the social safety net, and he was somewhat successful for a time. All right, that was a fiery debate to kick off the day. Usually we ease into things, not we chose violence today, but I'm looking forward to radar coming up next. Priana, what's on your radar? Well, the question is, why is Stacey Abram struggling with black men? At least that's a question asked by a recent New York Times article, which laments that Abrams, who has long been championed as a strategic genius who architected the 2020 Georgia Congressional wins that got Democrats the Senate, is falling behind in her own bid for governor. While Rafael Warnock is pulling ahead of opponent Brian Kemp by about five points, the New York Times notes that Abrams is trailing and that her campaign lacks the quote, energy of her congressional counterpart. Specifically, the Times points to pull results that show that black men, who are a key part of the constituency that brought Abrams so close to defeating Kemp in 2018, don't seem as motivated to vote for her this time around. And given how much the Democratic Party has praised Abrams for her ability to turn out voters in other people's elections, some are asking why she doesn't seem to be able to deliver for herself. Did she receive unwarranted or unearned praise for her role in the 2020 Georgia Senate races? Praise that would be more accurately attached to less visible activists in the state, or alternatively, is her own flailing electoral career evidence that the Democratic Party's choice took a focus on expanding the black voter base rather than courting and persuading existing voters of all races is a bad one. Abrams' defenders are right to note that the comparison to Raphael Warnock's race is a little bit apples to oranges. Abrams faces an incumbent, Warnock has the incumbency. Warnock also has the advantage of teeing off against one of the weakest Republican candidates in the field. Herschel Walker, a former football player, a politician, has been dogged by controversy. For example, he offered one of the more unique critiques of the Inflation Reduction Act, saying that, quote, a lot of money, it's going to trees, and we have enough trees. At one point, he used a laminated special deputy sheriff badge to British his fake law enforcement bona fides, and he's currently facing new television ads run by Democrats emphasizing violent threats he allegedly made against his ex-wife. There was even a sort of zany controversy about how many children the man actually has. Brian Kemp, by contrast, is a much less controversial figure to run against. Not only does he have the benefit of incumbency, he's been pushing back against Abrams by characterizing her as a sort of carpet bagger, whose campaign is benefiting from the generosity of, quote, out-of-state billionaires. But to really understand what's going on here, beyond the simple identity story being sold by the Times, we have to take a closer look at the messaging promulgated by both campaigns, including TV ads. Kemp has issued ads attempting to tag Abrams to defund the police movement. So do you support defunding the police? I support the vision that is underlying that crime. So yes, to some defunding. We have to reallocate resources. So yes. In response, Abrams has said her remarks were taken out of context, and she has responded with her own ads touting her plan to support law enforcement. If elected, let's watch. As a legislator, I worked with the GBI, with the Sheriff's Association, and with our police departments to ensure that they had the resources, the training, and the support they needed. I will support law enforcement and law enforcement agrees. She's also said she'd support raising some police salaries if elected, and that she'd expand training for officers specializing in mental health and social services. Now, you don't have to either support defunding the police or have a Blue Lives Matter flag flying in her house to think that this messaging is convoluted and completely lacking in credibility. Abrams quite rightly understood, as many of us did in the wake of George Floyd's on camera murder, that increasing funding to the police while doing nothing to address the roots of crime leads to the kind of civil rights abuses that shocked the conscience of the nation in 2020. But instead of explaining what it would mean to spend government money more wisely, Democrats have been running away from sound criminal justice reform policy ever since, choosing instead to do a bad impersonation of Republicans that absolutely zero people believe. After hearing this ad, I'm not sure why the New York Times points to black men as the source of Abrams problems and acts confused. It's obvious that the issue is one black woman, and her name is Stacey Abrams. Look, although as a progressive, I have long had substantive criticisms of Stacey Abrams. I've always admired her peer political skill. She came close to being the first black or female governor of Georgia in 2018 for a reason. Although her primary win was championed by many in liberal media as a win for so-called identity politics, she very smartly eschewed a hyper-specific racial message in our campaign, choosing instead to emphasize inclusiveness in her movement. As I wrote back in 2018 during Abrams's first run, quote, when Judy Woodruff of PBS NewsHour asked how Abrams planned to solicit non-voters, Abrams didn't pivot to identity-based issues. Instead, she called for education, jobs, and leaders committed to making sure government works for everyone. At the center of that, she said, it's a conversation about expanding Medicaid in Georgia. If there's any doubt about who everyone includes, she went on to explain, quote, I want every voter rather in the state of Georgia. I want every independent thinking voter. When Woodruff asked Abrams to respond to a New York Times article claiming Abrams had signaled that she is unlikely to spend much time pleading with rural whites to come back to the Democratic Party, Abrams objected. Quote, that's a mischaracterization of the state. Number one, in rural communities in Georgia, it's a very diverse community. A third of rural Georgia is African American. She went on to emphasize that rural or suburban, most Georgia, share the same values. She made clear that she would not pander to certain negative conservative impulses like xenophobia, saying I'm not going to pretend to be a conservative to win. But she didn't frame that laudable choice as prohibitive of creating a broad multiracial coalition. Stacey Abrams still displays that acute political intelligence. You can see it in a clip from her debate with Kemp that went viral just last week. Let's take a listen. A question is, why are you encouraging people to break the law for you in this election? Mr. Kemp, you are very aware that I know the laws of Georgia when it comes to voting. In fact, I am one of the foremost experts in the state on expansion of voting rights. And I have never in my life asked for anyone who is not legally eligible to vote to be able to cast a ballot. What I've asked for is that you allow those who are legally eligible to vote to allow them to cast their ballots. And in fact, we took you to court in 2016 and a federal judge said that you illegally canceled 34,000 registrations. You use the exact same system, the exact match system, that is under dispute right now. Now, I realize that in the next response, you're going to say that it's a function of my organization because your tendency is to blame everyone else for the mistakes that you make. My responsibility as a leader is to see a problem and try to solve it. When I saw that we had 800,000 unregistered people of color in the state of Georgia, I started an organization that has reached into every county and increased those registrations. When I saw that people were being unlawfully denied the right to vote, I worked to make certain that we held you accountable. And as the next governor of Georgia, I will continue to do my job to make certain that every legally eligible vote that gets cast gets counted. Say what you want about her, but she is sharp. She can cut through false equivalence is like butter. She can make an argument. Yell law. Gotta give you a little credit. But being smart isn't what put Abrams on the map. What drew people to her was the perception that she was a real fighter for all people. But over the years since her first run, she has been framed by the Democratic Party as primarily an identity candidate, someone whose run will benefit black voters, perhaps exclusively and implicitly to the detriment of white voters. And she's lead into some of that herself as well. Compare her 2018 interview to this one, which followed Biden's MAGA Republican speech last week. Lindsey Graham is not getting the rioting in the streets that he wants, but he does seem to have intensified Joe Biden's sense of urgency of what is at stake here. I think that President Biden clearly articulated what is at stake. But I want to urge caution that we not be distracted by the carnival barkers that we see in a Donald Trump or Lindsey Graham. And we ignore those who are just as dangerous to democracy like a, like a Brontesantis or a Brian Kemp or Brad Raffsenberger. It is not simply those who yell and scream that we need to be afraid of. It's those who are architecting the very overthrow of democracy that we are seeing play out across this country. And we know that in the state of Georgia, Brian Kemp has architected a bill that was promulgated across this country that is undermining elections as we speak, because it is making it difficult for voters to be able to cast their ballots and have those ballots counted. We know that right now, thousands of Georgia voters have been challenged because of an unlimited elector challenge process that was put in place by Brian Kemp and Brad Raffsenberger. We know that black county election officials were removed from their offices because of SB 202. And we need to make certain that we understand that the slow motion erosion of our democracy does not require the loud and raucous behavior that Lindsey Graham threatened. It also happens when the sitting governor refuses to testify in a trial and instead seeks to cross the subpoena that is summoning his voice until after an election, because he doesn't want the electorate to hear what he has to say. Look, Abrams makes compelling points about real attempts at undermining an election result that absolutely must be addressed. But it has consumed her entire messaging, crowding out the substantive conversation she used to do so well. A conversation that led all Georgians, rural and urban, white and black, male and female, know that Abrams would fight for them. Democrats want Abrams to embody the least political viable path it seems that when it framed her as a radical justice hero, whose focus is voting rights while downplaying the appeals to economic populism that she used to make. At the same time, they want her to tack right on criminal justice issues, joining Biden and his cause to fund the police harder, even as Republicans are calling to defund the FBI. Instead of living genuinely in her truth and pointing out that increasing funding to the police does not correlate with lower crime rates, that it's an issue of big government waste and that the money would be better spent on programs proven to prevent crime in the first place. Instead of pointing to the events and who vaulting as evidence of police and aptitude and the civil liberties violations that police heap on poor people of all races, she is juggling a clumsy message of police are good actually. That wins her no votes and loses her credibility with a very constituency she's apparently failing with, black men. The Times notes that Abrams campaign has begun a series of conversations with black men calling the events Stacy and the fellas. She's conscripted local celebrities like Atlanta rapper Young Jock and radio personality Big Tigger. At one event, she said bluntly, if black men vote for me, I'll win Georgia. But why would they? Georgia's incarceration rate is especially bad even in the context of the United States, which imprisons more people than any other country in the world, including China, which is many times bigger, and which is regularly criticized by Americans for authoritarianism. And for $32,000 a year, the cost of incarcerating someone in Georgia, I think many people across the political spectrum would support sentencing inmates to, I don't know, punishing semesters at Berkeley rather than the state then it's in. 50% of Georgia's prison population is black. 400,000 Georgians are on probation, bringing a total number of residents who are under some kind of criminal justice supervision to over half a million people. That's 400,000 voters disproportionately black males that Abrams is pitching with a message that emphasizes from the police over the inequities that resulted in a mass incarceration crisis. Make it make sense. Democrats seem to believe that they can thread the needle of ignoring the interests of black voters while emphasizing the value of having someone with a diverse identity in office. But this has the effect of alienating white voters who see nothing for them in the historic nature of Abrams candidacy. And black people are unhappy with this too. White people aren't happy with this. Black people aren't happy with this. Who wins other than the smug consulting class of the Democratic Party who championed this demographics is destiny narrative instead of substantive politics. Abrams is flagging because she's given up on persuasion. The thing she was actually good at before the Democratic Party got its claws on her. But here's what really makes me crazy. Instead of acknowledging a substantive critique of her campaign, the liberal media is blaming black men calling them misogynistic even though Abrams is also falling behind with black women. According to the recent Atlanta Journal Constitution poll, Abrams is only polling at about 80% with black voters overall. Democrats need about 90% of the black vote to survive in the state. Only the very last line in an article focusing on Abrams' low black turnout provides a real clue as to why she's falling behind. It reads quote, one possible reason for the lagging support for Democrats. Nearly one third of black voters disapprove of President Joe Biden's record as president. Well, now we're cooking with fire in common sense. Abrams has tied herself to Biden's anti-black big police state agenda. Instead of co-signing Biden's worst instincts, she should fight for the people of her state. Call Biden out for remaking on his promise to send out $2,000 checks if Georgia voters won him the Senate. Call him out for remaking on his promise to cancel all student loan debt for graduates of public universities and HBCUs earning less than $125,000 a year. Show some of the fighting spirit and understanding of the diverse multi-faceted needs of rural and urban Georgia in your state. Indistense yourself from albatross that is Joe Biden, a man who has never been a friend to black people. I suspect Abrams won't follow this advice and that she'll lose. But what a waste it will be because she really has political talent. And as a younger woman displays a real progressive populist Bonafide. Somehow the left will be blamed for Abrams pivot right and Democratic voters will be propagandized rather by corporate media drones into believing that Abrams lost is evidence that progressive politics can't win and that they should double down on running fake conservatives nobody wants instead of real populists. It's failing in Florida with ex- Republican turned Democratic opportunist Charlie Christ just as it failed with a number of blue dogs who lost down ballot in 2020. And meanwhile disgruntled Democrats will continue to find other more conservative outlets to express their preferences for common sense economic populism. Don't say you haven't been warned. Yeah, I was never as impressed with Stacey Abrams as virtually anyone else I guess. I was confused when she was being put on like magazine cover after magazine cover felt like a lot of eggs being put in one basket. Just an expectation that she's going to be a national Democratic figure even though she never quite got there. I mean she did pretty well that first time but I mean close enough doesn't matter she didn't win. 100% really gonna lose this time. Yeah 100% so I had just joined the intercept started my journalism career when her last race was happening. And what I observed at the time was that there was a huge gap between how she was being covered and framed in her primary race with Stacey they were both named they had the same name I think they both had the same last name. But the white the other woman was white and Stacey Abrams was framed as being this identity politics candidate who was you know running on being the first and all of this stuff. But when I actually looked at their materials Stacey was very Abrams was very disciplined and talking about you know an inclusive message white voters a part of it roll voters a part of it. And it was her opponent who kept talking about being raised in a trailer park she had this ad she got in trouble for because it's superimposed Martin Luther King's face on her face. It was like a mess there was a lot of this really hard identity messaging. And what I learned is that a lot of pundits they'd simply say oh a black person is in this this is an identity candidate and it wasn't fair to Stacey at the time. And I think her success was largely because she had a populist message. But now you know four years later it seems as though she has become a creation of the Democratic Party machine with all of those magazine covers and stuff. And she's leaned into that to her detriment. She leaned into it she was pushed to lean into it but she leaned into it nevertheless. Well thank you very much Priana and we'll have more rising right after this. California is scorching the state has dealt with triple digit weather for the past week or so forcing the state to rely heavily on natural gas despite trying to phase out fossil fuels. About half of California's electricity was powered by natural gas this week while just under a third was produced by renewable energy. Here to talk about this push pull of energy resources in the Golden State is LA Times reporter Sammy Roth. Welcome to the show. Hey happy to be here. Yeah we're great having you tell us more about how bad the situation is getting. Well I mean it's been it's been real hot here up in Sacramento it hit 116 which had never happened before they had an overnight low of 77 which also tied an all-time record and you know I've been I've been sitting in my apartment in West LA just sweating every day so it's you know it's bad and I mean on the power grid this definitely illustrates that as ambitious and aggressive and as far as California has come with some of its climate policies you know this is this is one of the challenges that needs to be worked out as California doesn't doesn't yet quite have the solution for this situation. So when you say that you know there's obviously been the shift I presume that the increased need for air conditioners to keep people cool is putting a strain on energy and that is why there's there has to be an increased reliance on natural gas as opposed to cleaner energy sources. That's exactly right so basically what's happening is when it gets so hot people crank up the air conditioning and the California power grid had previously set a record of 50,000 megawatts of demand we we smashed through that on Tuesday and hit 52,000 megawatts so a big jump but really the hardest time is in the evening when it's it's staying hot and people are you know still using their air conditioning and yet all of the solar power that we've got in California which there is a lot that that's all you know basically going away and so these gas plants are ramping up to replace it that that's what happens in the evening when it's hot typically. That's starting to change because there's a lot of batteries coming on to the grid and california so these big lithium-ion battery installations paired with solar panels we're getting record amounts of that but that's still you know relatively in its infancy and has a long way to go so right now gas has been the big solution. Hmm well the boiling heat has brought California dangerously close to widespread power adages prompting the state to issue a flex alert urging residents to conserve energy here is governor gavin newson making his plea to california's on tuesday everyone has to do their part to help step up for just a few more days individuals the state industries business all doing their part to help reduce strain on the grid and today and tomorrow afternoon after four p.m. in particular please turn your thermostat up to 78 degrees or higher and avoid to the extent possible using any really large appliances you can visit flex alert dot org to learn more about what you can do california's you've rallied before and we can do it again the abama impersonation is something else i saw some people also dating on the internet that has seen that he was wearing a sweater it was in a pretty crisp environment himself how are people taking these power power rationing choices or the fact that they're being asked to do so at this time. Well it's interesting i mean california has had to issue a bunch of these flex alerts now it's been more than a week and we've seen it every day and especially since we've had other instances of this the last few years i think you're seeing diminishing returns so at first you saw a pretty good bump of people saving power it's gotten less and less as they've become sort of more uh inured to it but interestingly when things were really bad on tuesday the state state sent out this emergency alert to tens of millions of people on their phones basically begging like please save power right now um that created a really significant response and is probably what actually helped us avert rolling blackouts on on tuesday the strong response to that alert. I have to imagine some people are not happy about having to cut back on certain things or feel that it's the government's responsibility in the state to have managed this situation better to prepare for something like this is there you know what's the the angry side of it like yeah i mean definitely there's some of that i mean you've got you've got people who really don't like to get these requests and that's understandable it's it's hot you know you want to do what you have to do to stay cool and that's a balance i think one one thing to keep in mind here is long term is california and other places look at getting fossil fuels off the power grid and and balancing you know how to you know how to reduce emissions and get towards uh towards all clean power there's definitely a role for for customers and you know people people like us to play in in helping to balance that there's programs in california now that that pay people to cut back at particular times or that you know you can let your utility cut back at a particular time and you can get compensated for that you know you get people with electric vehicles with batteries and with home storage systems with solar that can contribute power to the grid when it's needed so there's there's sort of a you know a way to put this all together that that hopefully will work out but it long term you know it it definitely cannot look like you know frantically asking people to cut back when it's 110 degrees out there you know the the way it's happening right now is not the way it can happen long term it's not going to be sustainable yeah this is kind of a horrible catch 22 where the fact of people having to rely more on natural gas the fact of the state having to rely more on natural gas exacerbates the high temperatures that are causing this crisis in the first place and i can imagine that some people are going to be using this as an opportunity to say a score one for fossil fuels but of course you're going to have to run your air conditioner more and more the more that we experience global warming that are the result of the fossil fuel burn and i am you know i i i wonder what you think about where the off ramp of that cycle might be what's the attitude about these alternative fuel fuel sources in in california at this moment yeah i mean this this is where the rubber meets the road right here i mean it's solving for this particular situation when it's when it's hot and hot over multiple days and hot over the whole western u.s so the whole grid is strained that the california and other states need to solve for i mean there's effort i mean it's it's being worked on i mean the the utilities in california have been ordered over the last few years to bring huge amounts of new solar and battery storage online they're starting to look at offshore wind that geothermal power which can can provide clean electricity 24 hours a day the legislature just passed a bill to keep the diablo canyon nuclear power plant online in additional five years at least um so that you know that's one other option for for ways to sort of keep the lights on without fossil fuels but it's it's definitely not uh not guaranteed yet you know how this is going to work or what the mix is going to be there there needs to be a way off of gas but nobody's really sure what it is quite yet any relief expected just in the next few days or temperatures expected to come down yeah i think that tuesday and wednesday we're the worst days overall for the state um especially because of those high temperatures in in northern california it looks like by saturday we should be starting to go back to you know maybe not normal but not uh not record breaking panic conditions well sammy rah thank you so much for joining us today very happy doing and we'll have more rising in just a minute stay with us the guardian reports that an online hate forum their terminology called kiwi farms has been shut down after users of the far right forum harassed and stalked allegedly a trans twitch streamer klara syrenti syrenti alleges that people from kiwi farms swatted her sent police to her house etc eventually syrenti fled her home here some of her story on cnn earlier this year when syrenti began using the platform to talk about trans rights she caught the attention of kiwi farms an notorious online form that has been used to organize transphobic harassment campaigns the first thing that they did was find the obituary for my dead father and use it to find his memorialized facebook page they were able to find a picture of my dad on the front porch in my childhood home and from that use google maps and figure out where that was located after syrenti's home in ontario was swatted she moved to a nearby hotel but her harassers tracked her down there remarkably using this photo of her cat on her hotel bed they were able to cross reference what they saw on the bed sheets with every other hotel in the city until they found out that the specific bed sheets only had a pattern in this one hotel that i was staying at eventually she says her uber account was hacked allowing the online bullies to track her location it was then she decided to leave canada coming here to belfast in norden arland to stay with her friend and i thought that if i got far away and went to a different continent they wouldn't be able to do the same thing and then it turned out i was wrong somehow her harassers tracked her down in belfast one of them even came to the apartment building she is staying at taking this chilling photo full of trans slurs and posted it online okay so kiwi farms something everybody's been talking about so this has been taken down uh this this forum where there was a lot of kind of her organized harassment against trans people trans activists also and this was new i just saw this um or i saw yesterday um it has also been scrubbed from the way back machine the internet archive which is very interesting because uh like they don't usually do that um and in fact they've gotten uh very sternly worded requests from people like the church of scientology to take down things that they generally don't unless it violates copyright so this is a pretty big step um look obviously i'm not going to offer any defense of this forum whatsoever it sounds like a really vile place engaged in you know potentially potentially criminal behavior the people on it at least i mean that is criminal behavior making false reports yeah stalking people etc you know so to the extent and i can understand being what is it cloud fair the the web hosting service um i guess if they don't want to be complicit in criminal activity you might take an action like this but we should be a little careful here i i mean i suspect you'll agree that the tendency you know to just vanish things from the internet if they make people uncomfortable now this is obviously going way further than just making people uncomfortable but it i think can set a bad a bad precedent the especially the internet uh the the way back machine offers a lot of helpful accountability in cases where people want to disappear things that ought to be left up in the public kind of knowledge yeah so you know you've been consistent about you know not attributing you know not blaming people who weren't directly responsible for things that they might have facilitated and things like that but you've also been clear that you thought that swatting was a line that was the should be drawn absolutely yeah i think it was what who margery taylor green was being swatted a couple weeks ago so it seems clear that this is beyond the pale and there's a level of stalking frankly and um genuine endangerment that comes when you swat someone when police arrive at your house with guns drawn and what have you um that justifies you know some of the measures that have been taken against the site the the focus of the conversation now it seems as largely on whether or not the way back machine over reached and earlier this year when our t was banned in certain areas and people shows were taken down including journalist abby martin who had an rt show in which she was very vocal about criticizing um russia for example for the um the annexation of of kri-mia she lost a lot of her archives and only was able to restore some of it because her mom happened to have have them all on like cd ron in the house right so there is something i think that we should keep an eye on with respect to permanently stripping content from the internet because so many of us believe that the internet is kind of forever and we don't keep those kind of hard copy back backups that are are part of our broader historical archive and contain information that i think a lot of us think is useful and valuable in this case it's not clear to me and i i'd like to know more about whether or not there were there was concern that if the way back machine kept her personal information up it would continue to put her at danger and it's so with their possible right and it's impossible to to take some of that off without taking off the whole record i agree with you i could certainly understand the way back machine having a policy of not preserving right your address or something your telephone number if you're a private person uh right i i i in fact think social media sites should have policies against allowing stuff like that to be published now of course there's a difference between going back to what you were saying there is a difference between the individual and the platform right so a lot of this was being organized by by kiwi uh on kiwi farms not by kiwi on kiwi farms so maybe it's so pervasive that you could credibly say that's just like what the site is and what it does but obviously very obnoxious and very bad behavior is organized on twitter and on instagram and on uh facebook and those sites are not you know thrown up off of the the internet the hosting service service the way i mean this was a criticism i think a very fair criticism when uh can't even remember what they were called the uh in after the january six when the uh the right wing parlor parlor yeah got uh got thrown off because yes because people on parlor were engaged it's very bad potentially criminal activities i understand but so were people on facebook yeah so it's it starts to get very uh and wasn't there some censorship of uh paypal or shutting down of paypal accounts and things like that so yeah when the u.s law treats the user and the platform as distinct entities it's a very clear and it's unique to u.s law section 230 saying the platform is not the speaker the speaker is the speaker you can arrest those people if you made a if you made a false uh report to police even without making swaddin more criminal it's still illegal you gotta you could prosecute those people you could prosecute people for stalking you can't prosecute the platform for stalking you can prosecute the platform in some unique cases having to do with sex trafficking and some other things because the law is very specific and that's the u.s approach which is different than then like the european approach actually the european approach is more much more favorable to to uh you know disappearing things from the internet so you can petition google under european law and say i want this google result of me gone and google has to consider the request the right to be forgotten the right to be forgotten yeah well look this is what people like zephyr teach out argue you know she she you know has these robust conversations where she says well if the platform is acting like a publisher should it be treated like a publisher which which i think is a great way to think about it because if this if kiwi farms is exercising editorial control exercising censorship control to a certain degree with its platform then at what point do they have so much control over what's actually being said on the site that they can't hide behind the idea of being a neutral third party right i mean the law currently basically says no matter how much even if you exercise editorial control no matter how much moderating you do you are still not being counted as the speaker of the information um because and frankly that is not a totally wrong way to approach the situation but they wanted to make it clear that if you take down if you if you want your site to take down like harassment and pornography and everything we're not going to suddenly treat you as a publisher because you did some kind of editorializing now that but when that law that was conceived in the 90s before that you know our current climate of political censorship was a kind of a topic some of the algorithm there's been an argument that changes to the algorithm which actually literally do promote certain kinds of content are different than a kind of a moderation or censorship regime and that maybe that does cross the line over to right publishing right but you have i i can see that argument certainly but it is in the undercurrent law it's just that would not fly i mean so many courts have said that wouldn't fly so it's interesting i think we ought to be very careful even though this sounds like a uniquely bad site where some really stuff was bad stuff was having her stalking people harassing people doxing people even if you don't like them even if they're activists for cause you're totally against that is never pro it's just utterly disgusting behavior criminal behavior truly criminal behavior don't do it so just but but despite all of that you know i i have concerns about just disappearing things from the internet we we are more on the under u.s law and u.s tradition we're kind of we're free speech maximalists i don't think that's the wrong approach but where you make free speech you know where you make privacy kind of the trade-off between speech and privacy yeah it's interesting it's tough you're not the only one with that concern matt taiyibi uh tweeted i've been you know he's obviously kept his finger on the pulse of these issues and has been uh what kind of free speech watch watch dog of sorts tweeted i've been concerned for a long time about the disappearance of old material the way back machine doesn't seem to have much of a purpose if people can ask to have old published work taken down i don't care about the subject unless it's libelous or illegal it should stay up all right so these are the competing camps and i'm sure that this conversation won't end anytime soon we'll have more rising for you after this texas has inserted itself into the center of the sexual and reproductive health conversation once again this time a u.s. district judge ruled that religious employers do not need to cover hiv prevention drugs and their health plans 150 million american workers enrolled in employer sponsor health care plans stand to be impacted by the ruling which judge rito connor handed down on wednesday he sided with a group of christian conservatives that the requirement under the infordable care act to cover the prophylactic drugs violated their religious freedom thereby violating the constitution one of the plaintiffs in the case said he was against paying for a health insurance plan for his employees that covered hiv drugs because they quote facilitate or encourage homosexual behavior which is contrary to the doctors sincere religious beliefs the ruling will most likely be appealed by the federal government so i think we're going to have another debate on our hands on this one i'm surprised by that ravi from a libertarian perspective why do you think that your ability to get health care we have an employer based health care system in this country it's not how i would design it but it's what we have absolutely not how we design it either why should you work for depend on what uh... determinate treatment you can get i would not i'm against forcing um... companies employers from covering medical expenses for things they oppose morally to be clear i do not oppose this morally i absolutely would include it in a health plan not morally because that's a specific difference the constitution doesn't say you have a right to impose your morals and other people it says you have a right to to to to not be not a positive because it's your choice to work for this person and impuged and so many people are asking what is the religious belief that is being undermined by prescribing uh... hiv prevention medication where in the bible does it say that shout catch aids again i i do not agree on a from a moral religious perspective i don't agree with this policy at all i absolutely would cut i'm not opposed to gay marriage or gay behavior or anything of the nature but my i'm allowed to have a different view for someone else if that's your view just as i would i would not force you to bake a cake for same-sex wedding or pay for an abortion if you oppose it i would not make you pay for that which which is this is a drug that you take um to prove to prevent you from getting from contracting um hiv if you then engage in risky sexual behavior again i don't have any opposition whatsoever morally to that but i don't think you should have to cover that if you do so it might be news to some people but folks other than gay folks can get hiv um many populations are just a proportionate proportionally affected including black women by hiv in africa gay men are not even the majority of the people who get in right here in america at certain point the fastest growing population of people contracting hiv this was some years ago i'm not sure if it's still the case was in fat black women many people are exposed to hiv in the context of a relationship or even a marriage because their partner has cheated and so this idea that a prophylactic drug that can be used in many different contexts by many different people is being prohibited on the basis that there is this extremely attenu attenuated connection with a quote unquote gay lifestyle seems to me to be obviously a stretch and really speaks to how the religious exemptions can be exploited to basically punish populations and attack basically minority groups in the exact way that i would argue the constitution quite explicitly prohibits look i have no again disagreement on what you've just said regard i think it doesn't make any sense that's not if i was an employer i would not have that policy i wouldn't have any of these policies but you could and the courts and the courts are malleous the district or district or act i think it's a straightforward application of the religious freedom act which imposes a least restrictive means um look employer based health care is a really dumb system i think we agree on that medicare for all absolutely is a much more you know i don't even disagree that it would be improvement over employer based health care because we run into situations like this the government can subsidize or just cover this uh this this drug in general that there are all sorts of other ways that don't force a a private employer to cover something that they are religiously opposed to it does not bother you that others me i'm just saying let me get the question out of the rabbit you i don't know where you get your insurance i don't know if you get it from the hill or private insurance i get it from my other employers for a reason reason no no not even true i get it from my wife her employment with the federal government so there you go what a tangled web art system is okay so what i'm so many employers i can't keep them straight at this point so your your if your wife's employer decided that they don't believe because let's say they're uh scientologist they don't believe in pharmacy um uh mental health drugs if they decided that they didn't believe in penicillin because they're one of these you know free range folks that exist they could decide based on their own religious beliefs that nobody can measure nobody can test nobody can prove it's just belief that you and your family doesn't get protection seems like a bad organization to work for it seems like a bad way around the country i mean it's a this is a bad system but in the absence of any real movement frankly on the on the issue of the universal health care a single-payer health care system frankly even from the progressive unprogressive in congress who are no longer talking about this issue much to the chagrin of many people in the bernie movement it seems like an enormous violation of people's rights to tell them that they cannot potentially get life-saving health care if their employer decides on a win to target them in their community philosophically the violation of rights is imposing or forcing the person providing the thing to do something they don't want to provide if in the case of a cake where someone has to literally make use their labor and draw designs that might not be in accordance with their own belief system i frankly agree i think a lot of folks obviously in kind of instinct black and white who's more liberal sided with the gay couple in that cake instance but i always had a really hard time uh figuring out what would happen like how can you make it to that you know a gay couple gets to have access to a wedding cake but not a you know i as a cake maker i'm not forced to draw a swastika or a confederate flag or something yeah exactly exactly and i do think that there's a difference between saying i'm not going to serve you because you're gay versus i'm not going to make a cake that says something about homosexuality or like validates it in a way that is against my beliefs but i would argue that that is what's happening here constructively these people have decided that the people who are taking prep are gay and that is why they don't want to fulfill those prescriptions or pay for those prescriptions even though that is not even true and even in that kind of like exposes the extent to which this isn't about religion in the least because it is a drug that is taken and available to anybody to get a sexual transmitted disease which can be caught by anybody in any context and again the whole truth i don't have a religious marriage the justification doesn't make sense to me i mean i'm not even a particularly religious person but i respect their right to hold beliefs that don't make any sense to me and this could easily this could also be applied beyond the situation to um covering what a trans gender affirming hysterectomies um abortions other things at all those cases i would say you should not be compelled to to pay for something you're morally religiously opposed to in i mean i would i would extend that as broadly as possible through all of society because i believe in voluntary associations and voluntary trade-based relationships um if if you don't work for you should you should work for again our employer based health care system is very bad but um but you should and if it if it is of a vital government interest to provide this drug and maybe sure it maybe it is there are there are according to the law the government has to use the least restrictive means possible to achieve this end if it conflicts with the religious objection so you could just subsidize you could do something else you don't have to compel someone to offer it they're religiously opposed to it i think that this decision should be a rallying cry for everyone who has been arguing so vociferously over the past few years for medicare for all as much as there is hand ringing about the oppressiveness of the state and how the state can dictate your behavior and become authoritarian which is obviously something that everybody should guard for the incredible bigoted overreach that the court has been these courts have been facilitating but get between individuals and their doctor and what should be one of the most private and sacred relationships that we have in this country is really unconscionable and the idea that the bible which i promise you says nothing about Prat or HIV and yet we have all of these conversations about constitution and originalism and textualism and how you know we just had in the dobs decision elito saying that you have to be able to find precedent for this these kinds of rules back and back in time this religious exemption which was supposed to be about allowing individuals to be free from having the government tell them what to do has now been weaponized as a tool to allow religious institutions to exert their will their religious will on their employers which is a perverse bastardization of what the founding fathers immediately intended as president bill clinton said when he signed this law religious freedom act the government should be held to a very high level of proof before it interferes with someone's free exercise of religion we can never be too vigilant in this i mean honestly robbie i've been to law school i've taken a take in a class on race religion a lot and when you look at the the case law the government frequently decides that people's religious liberties are not more important than the government interest of i don't know preventing hiv panda from spreading and all of the help implications of that regularly people are either heads are shaved in when they join the military or when they go into prison despite their religious beliefs people's social security benefits are denied because they're native americans who spoke for any of those things who smoke peyote as part of their religious training the courts are all over the place and are very happy to infringe on people's religious rights a million in one time it always comes down to whether or not they think one religion is a real religion or fake religion and i think that is exactly the kind of establishment of religion the government picking and choosing which religions it wants to protect and it has an interest in not upsetting that that that is that that is exactly the kind of establishment the establishment causes trying to prevent you would you and i would probably agree on a lot of those cases um the the seek muslims having to remove their garb in schools or even carrying they carry knives that was an issue um the peyote of course all of these things are things i would probably agree with you on but like in those cases i also find i also see the argument for why this is violation of someone's religious rights but we disagree again today well another another reason to continue to support and fight for medicare for all to actually have a like a freedom freedom of choice and liberty personal liberty issue that's william what's at stake right now as we have um concerted is passing these rights increasingly across the country uh to protect the the right to to commune freely with your doctor that's what's on the stake uh more rising for you after this yes oopsies social media giant snap ink that's the company that owns snapchat reportedly allowed leading democratic campaigns and party committees to unwittingly tap into a repository of republican voter data to better target their midterm ads this is according to axios per the report the company was unaware of the blunder and is taking steps to correct issue oops we just gave access to democrats to all of this uh information on that uh republican company had a republican polling firm or it's a it looks like it's uh you're all your favorite people the coke it's a kind of coke affiliated group but um yeah you know they're just harmless mistake oh oh no sorry uh yeah these mistakes always only go in one direction as far as i can tell but i don't know maybe you have a bernie versus hilly vid direction the mistakes go although yeah then the bernie campaign make them some kind of access something they shouldn't have i mean not that i recall i i just conveniently anything like that i remember bernie apologizing to hilly i mean i don't care it's totally different whatever yeah i don't i don't i don't remember i mean i know that many bernie supporters are frustrated that at the idea that bernie had shared his information with the democratic part his voter rolls and many leftists are concerned about getting text alerts from like that or work and stuff now when it to us those are very different political camps and affiliations but it is interesting here when i first saw the story of my thought was well democrats can't do anything with information anyway they're so strategically in that that like it's not going to help them but like what is really going to do with it uh that's a good point uh yeah i mean snapchat is claiming this isn't that big a deal and i don't know that it is but uh certainly the firm uh which is affiliated with the political and philanthropic network founded by uh charles coke full full disclaimer as always whenever charles coke comes up i also write for magazine called reason where the coke's have been donors in the past um the data was used to target snapchat ads by groups including the democratic national committee the democratic senatorial campaign planned parenthood etc there's no indication the advertisers knew they were using this data um you know i think it's a reminder to that like this this sounds like a security lapse or screw up on their part now previous screw ups i wrote a camberge analytic uh facebook that whole thing when you later learned out what camberge analytic was actually able to do with the data it had from facebook it was totally unimpressive it was it was like virtually nothing what do you mean it was it was a freak out over nothing um no you would agree with this it's the uh the whole idea that oh no you can tell russian are targeting bernie voters with like corrective for that it's that whole plot line all over again it also there okay so my critique is the idea that it is wrong for people to spread stuff that they agree with just because the source may or may not be rushed if you agree with it you agree with it but the the fact of them having such effective targeting because they have harvested your personal information from using these sites and being of the slightly different issue um and that that was the camera the camberge analytic it was in their interest to greatly overstate what they were able to do with this information and make it look like they could like hack voters brains and they they now had this exact sort of subliminal messaging capabilities with this data it was no it was amateur hour it was so much less impressive than what it's then the what the scary thing sounded like they were target they were able to target a very small slither a sliver of voters such a small percentage of the overall people on facebook like the odds that you saw even saw anything that was because camberge analytica had done something or had it was it was it was a drop in the bus so what we're talking about here i presume but these things are going to be more my sorry my point being these things are going to become more common because data it like you can't it is very hard to keep the status secure it is what we're finding out that there leaks all the time that these companies are very they range from cautious to not cautious at all with who gets this kind of information and in the future just like the information on you know what things you like what's your interest are what the social media profile of you is that information is going to be impossible to keep private so what's confusing here is if the is the idea that this is information that helps republicans target likely republican voters on issues that republican voters care about so there is a similarity between the rush example and is it a bad thing if russia russians are putting out messaging that says uh... you know the government is mean to black people if the government is in fact mean to black people you know if the democratic party gets access to a bunch of information but who is a republican and what they like unless they are planning to change their agenda and turn it into the republican party's agenda it's not exactly clear to me what they do with that information well no i disagree with that because they could i mean you could engage in all sorts of malfeasance in theory like you could send those voters you'd say oh this person is not a real republican or they're not uh... you know that the ads aren't like secretly coded as approved by the r and c they're still from a democratic actor well they could do something like what they did to the guy in uh... peter mire in michigan where they and that's what i was going to say is that i can imagine a world where they push their weird arguably not effective will see commercials that try to make the gop look really good like the worst the more rat rat rat ratacle candidate look like the better candidate and you know doing the pie-piper strategy but generally speaking i i do think that a lot of this um you know a lot of money is spent a lot of ad money is wasted because it's not the ads aren't connecting with the people that you need to connect with and i constantly marvel at the skill with which these these vendors are able to target who i am and what i want shopping these days oh yeah i almost never shot from stories and where it's open instagram and it magically knows that i was you know thinking about jogging pants two days earlier and it shows me exactly the kind of content that i want to have that experience at all i mean it usually it shows me that i was thinking about jogging pants if i literally bought jogging pants and then that's the thing i need least is now jogging pants because i just bought them and that's all i'm seeing advertising so well that that certainly has but i did actually look up jogging pants yesterday on this. it's pretty fun. now oh my god you're the ads. it's you it's you. we're placed brianna with uh with a false person. i have i have experience even having conversations with people or being at someone else's house and they googled something that we were talking about and then getting home in my instagram showed me images of something a vacation spot you know a kind of you know uh consumer good and it is it is eerie but it's balanced against this feeling that it is surprising and accurate like if i were being hit with objects and items that i wasn't you know interested in substantively then i think would be a lot more irritated with it but it's not irritation that i feel is this this eerie for boating. i mean it's a mere ear to know me so well. you know you used to watch the television and you would see ads for all these things that are totally irrelevant to your interests because they're just trying to guess what the demographic is you know a very wide range of people watching tv used to see commercials for you know for cars a lot or for cereal or for things i'm not gonna but if you're watching fox or some cable news channels you're getting advertisements for a geared to a much older audience if you're getting you know it's all like that now it's getting better and and even on the tv right it's sometimes or i think is this a conspiracy theory i don't know if it is or not that that because it's your cable service provides like Verizon is providing me, file is providing me my my cable service and my internet service so is it based on my i don't maybe this is a total conspiracy theory i thought there was some validity to this i don't know that they can because you do see different ads based on that even on the tv now but it's a long way of saying it's not even though it's kind of creepy it like it is better to see ads that are more relevant to my interests in general right you're not you're not actually saying that's bad yes and no i mean there was a story some years ago about how uh women and his remains right or you know a lot of my friends are not pregnant but they got spanned for some years with information about there was there was a period there in my early 30s where everything was about um freezing your eggs like non-stop ads on facebook to get your eggs frozen yeah it's a wild world up there it's a mixed bag but and we'll see if anything actually comes of this if there's any um uh you know recompense that has to be made or whether or not this is a little bit of a just another day in the life of the media story we see if i start seeing non-stop ads for like Dungeons & Dragons, Fair Fennelia on tv that's when i'll know that my theory is correct that's real though more rising after this former United States secretary of state in 2016 democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton commented on president biden's prime time address about threats to democracy that he gave last week let's watch i think he did a very important service to the country in giving the speech that he gave because too many people are not yet aware of how fragile our democracy is and i'm not going to second guess the language he used because there has been so much uh that has gone beyond anything i ever would have dreamed of starting with january six but so many threats of violence and and you know concerns that people are expressing about the country you know coming apart and all of that so i think he did a real service and i personally thought it was a strong and necessary speech so that was in response to a question question from elissa fara about whether or not he did a misstep in being overly broad and how he characterized many trump voters as being a part of a fascist movement what do you make of hillary's response i mean do you think even if she thought that was dumb and he shouldn't have said it is she gonna say that on tv probably not so it's it's like clearly careful what her is not part of the problem yeah she's not she's not just saying anything real i mean she's she's so a team player and i'm a forebident at least but why like this is what's so frustrating to many people that even at the end of your political career even when someone she just also news this week was that she said she was never going to run for president again even when you're completely taking yourself out of the court court just saying it that cops were hurt around the world no like it's it's it's frustrating for leftists as well to look at bernie and say okay you're done like you're not running for president again you know you're you're safe in your seat at what point are you is the excuse of saving your political capital for for something else can it stop being a legitimate justification for not saying the truth i mean it's also believable though that she thinks that was the an entirely correct way to characterize people because if anything but i didn't learn it from her it's not well that characterized people it's how she characterized people and it was you know widely believed to be one of her major political missteps during the campaign yes but she can never concede having made a political misstep has she admitted that maybe she should have visited michigan or pennsylvania no that's very small somehow it's pretty small like joseon it's russia it's you know the excuses just pour in yeah and uh and i'm sorry so so like what she has to say about this she has no expertise um at all yeah i i will say props for asking the question because if if you watch that part of the interview you know she's given far a dagger eyes the whole time she's asking and then it is it is frustrating because look i have seen other politicians do a medical in fact my radar was on stacey abrams she had a moment earlier in the campaign cycle where a speech a kind of a fiery worked up speech she was giving in front of a crowd was contextualized as republicans as her saying that she didn't think that georgia was a good place to live she said something like you know these stats about maternal mortality and stuff are really bad and you know the state should be better and i saw her in an interview i think would join and read actually where she acknowledged look i should have phrased that differently i shouldn't have said that obviously i love georgia because you know i was living elsewhere i grew up actually mrs. cipi i came here because i chose georgia as a place i want to live and she just imagined hilla reclinted doing that you came out because you never would she would never apologize to the american people she thinks the american people should apologize to her right right so she feels about it and that is her fundamental fly i would argue that is in fact why she's not president of the united states because when she was getting legitimate good faith criticisms from the left and others and and the right frankly some of the criticism that the right was making she really was a wall street chill she really did spend all her time getting paid exorbitant amount of amounts of money for these speeches and things like that you know she does have a record to just to have to defend and excuse and apologize for it from the 90s with her she's one of the foremost philosophical advocates of of war right throughout the her third senate tenure and her sister was his worst biggest mistake it was one of his biggest mistakes right his biggest foreign policy mistake and she was the architect of it right and instead of internalizing those critiques and pivoting and apologizing in a world that i think was open to it because the alternative was Donald trump she refused she said it's my turn and that's why she's sitting as a host on the view or as a as a guest on the view instead of uh in the oval office right now well she also had this to say about accusatory language on both the left and the right fascism is a very big word i know that but so is socialism and the republicans call every democrat who wants people to have health care a socialist uh so i think we do need to be careful with our language but i think the problem is if you go through the hallmarks of authoritarian regimes uh you see too many characteristics unfortunately uh on our republican side and my most fervent hope is that republicans themselves will begin to reject all of that verbally vocally in their voting and you know kind of reconstitute the republican party to where it used to be and not the you know party of trump i do think this was actually fair criticism from her because oh and i saw many hasan who you like so much he did have a pretty funny clip of like oh republican so outraged that they would get called fascist and then he it was just a clip of so many republican pundits and politicians calling democrats fascist and her point that right the socialist word is is thrown to people who actually deserve it to her right you you would be a friend that she deserved it well well herself identify as democratic socialists proudly and uh and there and they're outraged that anyone would dare call hillard clinton a socialist i'm sure right that's what i'm saying but and i actually i agree with that criticism and i have long warned that if you actually the republican tendency to call everything socialist is dumb because the boy who cried wolf well and and also they're calling things that are sometimes are broadly popular socialists so then people will think that like an economic system based on states a one party system a state suppression is a good idea because you've described it as socialism well there there should be a better conversation that the guitar we had a little bit yesterday with nathan robinson about authoritarian socialism um and how authoritarian can authoritarianism can reared head in any context including capitalism which is the context that we're all obviously talking about it here right now uh we're reared its head in socialism a lot historically but will it's reared head a lot more in social and capitalism because most countries are capitalism and any bad thing that's happening on the right world you can attribute to it being in a capitalist context because we basically snuffed out every socialist country on the place the earth on the face of the earth but you know that this time that robin and i can go on about over a very long time so we will move on our producers do not want us to have a lot of socialism capitalism they've made right now we'll be back after this cnn ratings are continuing to tank as ceo chris lick attempts to remake the prime time in morning line-ups all in an effort to make the channel more centrist according to the new york post a cnn insider said that even though lick quote knows what he's doing he has his work cut out for him many changes have been implemented at cnn since lick's arrival including a laissez-faire approach to editorial less partisanship fewer blaring breaking news banners and recently the cancellation of brian stelter show reliable sources so i certainly understand why some a new person would come in and say this is a ship that needs to be righted literally righted by moving the ship a little to the right i get that you know they were the cnn plus uh debau- like total debacle you know they're kind of they're they're trump they don't have trump to to beat up on any more maybe they will again in the future but right now to the extent their their business model was just to scare people about the trump threat it's not it was only working you know so much and everyone's taken the ratings dip you know post-covid kind of departing the news so i totally understand why they would want to take a new strategy i think the question is whether you know whether they're even capable of winning back some people who feel who feel alienated it is the case that people used to think of cnn as the centrist news network right that was the straight news network yes yes i can barely even remember i'm too young here's the problem like straight news doesn't mean a kind of neutered passionless uh point of viewless i think way of talking about things i think that there's a format obviously it's what we're doing here where you have genuine ideological diversity that's one way to do it just have panels that are comprised of the opinions that exist in the world because what happens when you try to design a news network a political party a point of view around this fictional person that's right smack and dab in the middle of a bunch of polls tell you that person literally does not exist the amalgamation of all of the views that are out there create a weird golem of a person that nobody is interested in and isn't is it real i told an anecdote in a in a radar a couple of weeks ago about how early uh planes and the air force kept being crashed by pilots and they couldn't figure out why and it's because they had designed the seats based on like the average pilot but nobody actually had the the measurements of the average pilot and they had realized they had to make things a little bit adjustable to make the plane stay in the air it was all of the user error sounds apocryphal it is true and it's basically what's going on here with CNN yeah and our own show is a good metaphor because i would never describe us we're certainly not centrist you're not a centrist i'm not a centrist uh centrist what we were balanced because we have enough different strong views but they balance each other out because we have a range of people who knew and me and the other hosts that come through these chairs and i think that works we have an audience but uh so just just having you know right blah kind of moderate centrist takes on everything is not really what people want i mean they want some of it is just news they want the news covered some of not you know not everything uh it requires an ideological perspective or let alone a strong or extreme ideological perspective but they want us to bring the perspectives we do have to the news whenever possible so it's an interesting task to kind of you know change gears i it's probably not impossible it's not impossible but they have to hire different people these people fully don't understand it's clear to me what makes yeah tucker Carlson or fox news more generally appealing when you read what democrats think about why trump won or why people are watching fox they literally can't get beyond well people must just be more fascistic now people must just like be more racist now people must be more bigoted now and obviously they don't want to compete on who can be most bigoted so they don't compete at all they don't understand that there is a sincere investment in a populist movement where people are frustrated by all of the neoliberal politicians on both sides of the aisle that voted for policies that sent jobs overseas that voted for naphd all of these kind of things that was core to trump's 2016 approach that those kind of stories are core to what happens on fox news now i think that there is obviously an ideological bent and a kind of there's a reason why cherry picked stories are presented in the way they are on fox news but there is a left version of that i think the fundamental problem is that the left version of populism a more sincere populism is directly antithetical to what these the the advertiser base of those shows want i think right populism still maintains the status quo in these important ways they're not trying to perform our health care system they're not trying to raise taxes on the rich they're not trying to check down the military industrial complex even though there are these you know marginal voices on my right who absolutely do no one's trying to shut down the military industrial complex except a small number of left-wing people and and a slightly larger but still quite small number of right-wing people well sure quantify that as well the the the pro yet so i think that that is part of why you don't see a left fox because the ideas that the left broadly holds are all not just the the interventionism stuff not the foreign policy stuff but all of them are so threatening frankly to the advertiser base and the corporate status quo that they don't know how to do it and they don't and they also do i think value and i really understand what's happening in the media space i mean msmbc is is more of a it's not quite a left fox uh but i i mean the the chris hayes rachel mattow uh for a while was much more in the trump years it became much more defiant resistency everything about russia kind of fair there was i would say there was more left policy probably not okay you're y i see rolling your eyes because even if i would say chris hayes is probably the but well no i'd say many hasan is the best leftist on those shows followed by chris hayes and i wouldn't put rachel mattow anywhere near the left to be honest i don't i've never really heard her advocate for any basic social scandinavian style programs she was antagonistic you don't think she supports basic scandinavian social i've never heard say anything and formerly i would presume she wants those things i've never heard her talk about the candidates that were presented the 20 odd candidates that were running in the democratic primary in in 2019 in a way that made meaningful distinctions between what they were offering on that score to the american people i've heard chris hayes dabble in that and i've heard metty who is canadian and knows how terrible we have it here firsthand compared to back home um talk about it at length but the problem is for those two to three people that we just named i can name three literal republicans that have prime time spots on msnbc yeah literal republican the trump but when i was saying that trump years i think did move them in that direction um yeah so that's another point that you're point about covering the news i think that's right people want straight news but when your idea of what news needs to be covered is so focused on russia gate as opposed to labor organizing and that was an editorial judge but russia gate was an editorial judgment that was something that they substantially that not entirely cooked up but because there was underlying you know reason to suspect suspect what russia was doing but they decided this was the singular story of why trump won they bought i mean hillard clinton also decided that and they humored her and they made that all of the coverage was about how people people didn't choose trump they were they were tricked by a conspiracy a broad conspiracy the likes of which the us has never seen and that's why we got trump elected and we must cover it until he is you know he is imprisoned for his collusion in his crimes which is never going to happen though they primed audiences to expect it and they that was an editorial decision that this was the story just like the later the editorial decision the january six was the story the only story yeah because the alternative story is that it's partly their fault and their choice to cover trump with aids and elitics the election and by the way they pushed out a lot of contributors at that time and they built up to 2016 people who did not want to do non-sub trump covers coverage like melissa harris perry were literally dethroned and replaced by joy and read who was a scab basically that filled it on her spot as a substitute black woman who was put in there to replace her and who was willing to talk about trump 2847 and god as i would argue the result that we had today all right well tomorrow on rising uh we will hand off the baton to ryan and
