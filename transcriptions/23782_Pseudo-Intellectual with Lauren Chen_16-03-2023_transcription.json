    "text": " Hey, hey, Lauren Chen here. This isn't something that I enjoy talking about, but it's something that we need to talk about. Let's discuss trans children. So over the past year or so, there's been a lot of ground gained by the right when it comes to the issue of grooming children. And it's terrible that this is even a discussion, like I said, that we need to have, but let's live in the real world here. There are absolutely predators out there, LGBTQ plus, whatever activist out there who want to undermine the family unit and cisheter normativity by essentially brainwashing your child to believe that they are something that they are not and that the only way they can actually live happily and peacefully and as their true selves is by getting life changing, mutilating surgeries or doing things like going on hormone blockers and cross sex surgeries. It is evil. I'm not using that term lightly. It is flat out evil, but thankfully, red states are beginning to wake up and realize that, oh, hang on a second, it was maybe a mistake letting the left do whatever they want in terms of pop culture and the education system. And actually, if we have, if we have the political power to do something to protect our children, we should probably use it. This is where I know some libertarians out there are gonna be like, no, but if we ban child mutilating surgeries aren't we just as bad as the left? It's like, no, actually no, those things are not equal and I'm not a fan of big government, but I just, I don't see it as big government to say, hey, probably shouldn't be chopping off the breasts of a perfectly healthy teenager, but in any case, Tennessee most recently led the way banning gender affirming care. I think the left likes to call it four minors, I.E. things like surgeries or cross sex hormones, meaning that, hey, little Billy, if you wake up one day and decide you're a girl, actually they're not just gonna start pumping you full of medications. If you wanna do something crazy, you're gonna need to wait till you're at least an adult. Sounds reasonable to me. And we also have Mississippi that is joining the charge, Matt Walsh recently gave a talk about some legislation the state was introducing. I wanna thank the governor and the lawmakers here in Mississippi who have done the right necessary thing by banning the horrific medical abuse of children. I'm extremely encouraged to not only see this law being passed, but to see the national movement that we have been able to build pushing back against the gender ideology madness that has a stranglehold on our society. And on our children for far too long. And that's not all. The winning keeps happening. Really, I'm feeling my red states lately. We have this from Florida today, ban on healthcare for trans youth to go into effect in March. More is coming. Fine says we also have this from CNN, South Dakota governor, Chrissy Noem, signs bill prohibiting gender affirming treatment for trans minors. This is exactly what the right should be doing when and if we have any political power, we need to start going on the offense. There are gonna be libertarians in this classical liberal saying, but oh, this is too much. What if someday the left uses their political power against you? It's like they're already doing that. The left is already full force trying to disenfranchise right wingers, conservatives, any way that they can. I mean, remember the whole COVID thing? People like me were bartering, going to a restaurant. So I don't think we need to worry about us scaling things up lest the left retaliate. They are already retaliating to the best of their abilities. Let's at the very least try to keep things even. So this is all good news. If you are a parent, I very strongly suggest you make your way to one of these red states. If you're somewhere like California, where your child actually could be trans without your knowledge. And unfortunately, Texas, we have not seen them pass anything like this. And in fact, we have that one case of the Texas couple where the mother and father separated and the husband or ex-husband was trying to oppose the son's gender change. I don't think he was successful in the Texas courts were complicit in this. So, you know, there are some red states out there that need to be doing a little bit better. But overall, this is absolutely the right direction. However, I guess anytime you have a push, there's going to be a poll or maybe I got that the wrong way around, but in light of all of these wins against the groomer lobby, Joe Biden himself, the president of the United States, he took it upon himself to come forward and defend child predilation in the name of trans ideology. I'm not even kidding. We have this clip that's kind of making the rounds at the moment. What's going on in Florida is, as my mother would say, close to sinful. I mean, it's just terrible what they're doing. It's not like, you know, a kid wakes up one morning and says, you know, I decided I want to become a man or I want to become a woman or I want to change. So the idea that, oh, it's not just like a child woke up one day and said, I want to be a man or a woman. And they, you know, start the surgeries. I'm guessing that's the point Joe Biden was trying to make. He's not very coherent, but I, you know, I have a translator in my head that I'm working with. We've heard from the trans listeners that actually, sadly, far too often, that is actually what happens. I think, you know, we would all like to believe that there is this very, I guess, rigid protocol that's being followed, that no hormones or anything or surgeries are being given unless there's maybe years and years of living as one gender versus the other. But that's actually, that's not true. And we've had the transitioners say very, very sadly, that no, I was kind of rushed into this. There were doctors that were like, yes, just affirming, affirming, affirming. No one really challenged me on this. And so it was one day I woke up and I had double insectomies and I will never breath feed, right? This is something that I think once would have been too offered for it to happen, but it's happened multiple times. We have these people coming forward in the UK. There are actually some D transitioners who are suing government run health care clinics for, I guess, the lack of oversight. So yeah, I mean, I do think that some kids just wake up one day, decide their different gender and everyone has to go along with it or else they're accused of bigotry. So sorry, Joe Biden, you're wrong there. And the idea that it's sinful to not let kids mutilate themselves. OK, there's a difference between being nice and being kind. I feel like I have to say this far, far too often. Whenever the Christian right stands up for their principles, the left likes to say, oh, I thought you're supposed to be kind and tolerant and open. It's like, I don't know what Bible you're reading that makes you believe that the Christian stance should be to let people do whatever they want and whatever makes them feel good in the moment. Because that's not what Bible teaches. OK, as Christians, we are beholden to the truth and we are beholden to Christ's word. OK, none of that what is in the Bible supports letting children mutilate themselves. Less trans activists out there get upset. Like I'm sorry, I would go to war for my little girl. So you better believe that I have no problem offending some trans pervert on her behalf, right? I could not care less what these messed up adults have to say. This is about protecting children. And I think this is also just a great example of how slippery the slippery slope is. When I started making videos maybe six years ago at this point, the whole idea of like, you know, this trans craze different pronouns, it was relegated specifically and almost exclusively to Tumblr, to the point that I had people conservative saying, why are you why are you focusing on this? This is just fringe nonsense. Well, now just six years later, we have the president of the United States himself coming out in favor of gender affirming surgeries for minors. Like can can we all just take a moment to appreciate how quickly this has happened? How quickly this issue has snowballed? And so absolutely conservatives need to draw a line in the in the sand here and say no more. There are people out there going to say, well, this isn't as important as, you know, the national debt. This isn't as important or X, Y, or Z. I'm of the firm belief that actually two, three or maybe even four things can all matter at once. And yeah, as a mom, I do think that this is a hill that is worth dying on, but I digress. Let's finish this Joe Biden clip. I mean, what, what, what are they thinking about here? For human beings, they love their feelings. They have inclinations that are, I mean, it just to me is, I don't know, it's cruel. And the way we do it is we make sure we pass legislation like we passed on same sex marriage. You mess with that, you're breaking the law and you're going to be held accountable. OK, so there is this narrative that the left is pushing that, you know, it's so cruel actually to deny children, these surgeries that basically if you tell a trans kid, they're not actually trans, you're basically driving them to suicide. So they often say, like, would you rather a trans kid or a dead kid? And it's kind of funny because it's like historically these surgeries, these medical procedures were not available to children at all. And somehow we didn't have just boatloads of children committing suicide because they weren't able to get double mastectomies. It's almost as if a lot of these groomers, these healthcare professionals, they're implanting these ideas into kids' heads that didn't exist there before and wouldn't exist without their interference. And then they're also there to swoop in and say, hey, I have a solution that not only provides more money to big pharma, but that also supports my political ideology and the desire to overturn cis heteronormativity. See, it's all tied together and it's all very, very insidious. And, you know, a lot of the people who are saying, like, oh, you just hate kids, you want them to die, they don't understand that this is being done to protect children. And actually, I want to celebrate the fact that on the right, I have seen very few people saying that, oh, yeah, you know, the little girl who cuts off her breasts and then regrets it later, she deserved that because she just made the wrong choice. It's like, no, I think there is an amount of compassion that we have to show these young children here because they're really, they're being failed by the adults around them. This is a failure on society's part. We can all agree that children cannot consent to things like buying alcohol or, you know, taking on huge loans unless they're 18, which is, I mean, I'm not a fan of that. That's a different conversation, but it's like, we have to have grace and compassion for the kids who are let down by their parents, their school system, by the medical profession, because ultimately they are the real victims here. And it's just so frustrating when I see left is accused of the right of hating trans kids. It's like, no, this is for the kids. Protect the kids. And, you know, studies do show that if a kid has gender dysphoria or whatever, they're confused. Guess what? Most of the time, the vast majority of the time they grow out of it. It's almost as if being a teen is confusing and it's always been a confusing time for people throughout history and different cultures because there's hormones, your body is changing. There's nothing wrong with being a little bit confused. The answer is not to resort to surgery. And I'll be damned if anyone at least tries to tell my little girl that, yeah, no, she, her body is wrong. And the only way to fix it is surgery. I mean, we can all, I would hope, agree that trying to offer a little girl, a breast enhancement would be messed up. But for some reason, taking the boobs away, that scene is, that scene is OK. This is no longer a fringe issue, right? The president of the United States has come out in favor of trans kids. This is something that I think does require the full force of legislation. If we can protect these kids, it'll be worth it. And, you know, anyone who might say this doesn't happen that often, why is it even worth the time? Well, again, once is too many and there are D transitioners who maybe they don't represent the majority of kids out there, but I'm sure they would have been very happy if there had been lost in place that would have protected, you know, their boobs or their downstairs parts, whatever it may be from these mutilating surgeries. And in a perfect world, not only would we see that these procedures are banned, but I would also love if, you know, the medical providers who actually went against their oaths and did harm to their patients, I would love to see them prosecuted, charged in some way, losing their license, whatever it may be, whatever we can do to make sure this stops here and now. But that's pretty much all I have to say. And as always, I would love to know what you guys think. Are we going to see more red states following the example being led by places like Tennessee and Florida and simultaneously? Will we see blue states like California double down on the fact that, no, we're going to welcome all the procedures for the kids. I mean, California essentially is a sanctuary state for mutilating kids right now. Are more blue states going to follow suit? Let me know down below. Until next time."
