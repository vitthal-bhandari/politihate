    "text": " And we're back for another episode of Keep It. I'm your host, Iron Madison III, and once again I am joined by Cara Brown and Lewis for Tau. Oscar Fun Fact, I was the stunt double for Eddie Redmayne and the Danish girl. All the crying in the mirror, that was me. The news keep it fans. Cara, Lewis, and myself will all be in Austin this weekend for South by Southwest. It's my favorite Texas. If I had to rank them. We are doing two shows that weekend. First we will be appearing on Lover Leave It on March 9th at the Moody Theater. The show is at 10.30 p.m. and tickets are still available. That's Sir Lee Little Ginger. John Lovett. Is he a ginger? I think I would call him a ginger. Chez Nott? I'd call John a lot of things, but I don't know if he's a ginger. And then Keep It will have its first live show on Saturday March 10th at 3.30 at the Fairmont Wisteria Room, part of Tune In at South by Southwest. The show will also be streaming live. Fairmont Wisteria was my favorite character on Knots Landing, and I'm so excited she'll be there. You should see how excited he looks at it. He looks so excited. Our first live show will be streaming on the internet if you cannot make it to South by Southwest. But if you can make it, we'll be live from the podcast stage. If you have a ticket to South by Southwest, you have a ticket to the show. So stop by and see us. And I promise John will not be there. You. John won't be there, but Lewis will be in a nice tight shirt for you. That's right. You're posing and severe. Some house cleaning about last week. I know we were very worried that Stacey Dash might win an election and that we would have to go to the 44th district and stop her. But apparently that district is overwhelmingly black and Latino. And I don't think she's going to win. I love you. She can move back on to the Oscar race. Also apparently you can, that's congressional candidate, you do not have to live in your district. You just have to live in the state. Which is so stupid. That's crazy. You don't even have to live in the district with the people that you're representing. No, which I should have remembered because that was the whole drama with John Ossoff when he was running. Right. That woman kept saying, you don't even live here. But yes, she's talking about the fact that she does live in her district. No, they don't want her to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Live in another district. Social. Social probably lose and get evicted. Anyway, the Oscars were this week and Stacey did not show up at them this year. She was nominated for three though. Yeah, she was nominated for Shape of Water. Yeah, that's right. And worst animated short being Purcell. Stacey Dash. We watched the Oscars together. We did. Yep. We had a grand old time. We had some sandwiches. A lot of yelling from me. Lewis was plugged into his laptop. I looked like somebody in Apollo 13 like getting people back down to Earth. But I was actually just tweeting about. Also, can I say, watching him with Lewis was great because he was like a personal Siri or was like Lewis, when was the last time so and so was nominated and then like two seconds later, he had the answer. I put my finger up. Google anything. You asked me, how old is Rita Moreno? And I said, I believe 86 and I was. And she was 86 years old. Moving up later in the episode, I am actually going to pit you against Lewis, Cara. With help. Yes, I'm going to let you use Google and we will see who's better. And I'll use my brain, the other Google. All right. Yeah. So I'm not that good. We'll see how it goes. You sound like a Samsung commercial. Anyway, the show was fine. Cara kept complaining that it was seven hours long. It was so long. It was always long. Was it always like almost four hours long? Yeah, girl. Oh my gosh. Really, I think in my mind, it was like three and maybe, you know, the DVR goes over a little bit in case it spills over like three hours and seven minutes. Like we are in our three and they haven't handed out best screenplay, best actor, best actress, movie director. I was like, we got five more categories and I wanted it to go on and on. I'm like, oh, hold it out. I want there to be another montage. Can we do a montage of just the montage? And I think that was what was driving me crazy. The montages, it's like you would cut those out. We're in and out in three hours. Also the camera angles. I don't know who would listen. Never directed an award show. I'm sure it's not easy. However, up the nose, do you think that's the most flattering angle? The angles were actually pretty wild this year. Crazy. The set is always huge, but I think with, you know, the crystals that they wanted to put on display on stage just highlighted how cavernous the stage was. Right. Everyone was wandering around for what seemed like 20 minutes to get to it from. They were all lost in it giant De Beers commercial. Viola Dayles could even walk in her outfit. I know. Because it was too tight and they made her like, they made her, they made her part walk all the way to the stage. And by the way, do you know what music they played while she did that? The Austin Powers thing. Guys, what? I don't believe she played many men at that. That and yeah, the montages were I like Oscar history and I get that it was the 90th Oscars. So they really wanted to celebrate, you know, the history of the Oscars and the magic and how people, you know, enjoy looking at a clip and being like, oh, I've seen that movie. I've seen that movie, et cetera. But like at a certain point, it felt like. Montage is and the clips, you know, when they're announcing the nominees and they would show a little clip of the performance, those were like 30 seconds long. It took like five minutes just to get through all of the best picture nominees and it didn't like enhance the ceremony for me. Like if you haven't seen the shape of water, that 30 second clip is not going to do it for you. Like just cut to Guillermo and let's go. I think this is the one show that I could watch for five hours a year. I would just like, look, if you're invested in the drama of it, it's just, you know, I'll say is this, there are entire golf channels. There are entire football channels. I don't watch that shit either. One day a year, I get to watch Leslie Manville sneer in an audience for a four hour ceremony. And I'm just going to cherish that moment and perhaps bring poppers for that moment. I like a sport with a time limit. Like we're in it. Like there's a clock. There's a finite amount of time we're doing this. Let's we got things. I know I kind of agree with Lewis. I really enjoy Oscar season and I wish that it were sort of like the Olympics. You know, you just had like two weeks of ceremonies and people playing games. You have the wacky racist star Francis McDormand as Penelope Pitstop and Dastard Lee is Gary Oldman. I don't know. I would watch. I would add to this joke except I only know Penelope Pitstop from that show. So I'm sorry. I feel like I'm making Penelope Pitstop joke every week here because that's the only one I know. No, I get it. Then long, but I really do sort of love it and appreciate it. I mean, I feel like we watch it all day too. There's the red carpet. There's everything going on. And we're in LA. Yeah. So it really is most of your day because it's like three o'clock when all of this gets started. Yeah. But let's jump into the actual show starting with that red carpet. Oh, man. I was watching the E pre show and I didn't do the math. I was like, why does it feel like no one is talking to me? And where is Julianna? I thought that she was sitting in like Taos, New Mexico, like doing commentary. And then I realized, oh, C. Chris works for E. Nobody's talking to him. Now I get it. Right. So Ryan C. Chris had sexual assault allegations against him from his former assistant. He said that he used to hug her creepily without her consent often when he was wearing his underwear. The allegations were apparently independently investigated by NBC and E. But she denies that the investigation was like real. And so he still went ahead with being on the red carpet, which is very weird. Of course. It's surprising, I think. Yeah, because I feel like everyone else who's had a allegation against them has sort of at least taken a step back and been like, I'm not going to make this situation about me right now. You know, I never thought that in the situation with the Oscars, like Casey Affleck would have more class than write a secret to not show up. But see, I wonder if this is the beginning of some sort of backlash because you already have dumb, dumbs coming out and being like, is this on which hunt? And are we just are we are we moving too quickly? Are we going? You're just firing people right away without investigations and all of that. Never mind that they're private companies. They can do whatever they want. They can fire people. And so I wonder if it was him being like, you know, I didn't get fired and like, fuck you. And I'm still going to show up and I'm still going to do this. Like I wasn't surprised that he still did it. Yeah. I was like, of course he did because also it's like he has an ego and he doesn't think he did anything wrong. Like most of these dudes don't think that they did anything wrong. Even if you know, you weren't charged criminally, it's like you did something creepy, but they don't really see a problem with that behavior. And so he doesn't think he did anything wrong. So of course you showed up. I mean, he was already doing shows like the previous week with Kelly Rippa just being like, she came out during the week and just gave this nice supportive speech about how he's her friend. And he's always really nice to me. And I'm like, yeah, I mean, Ryan Seacrest is going to be creepy to you girl is your show. Also, furthermore, you think he would just step back because he would obviously make half the people on the red carpet uncomfortable to talk to him even just during the one talk to him barely anybody talked to him. Alison Janie hugged him, which I mean, that's why learning that couch should have went. Alison Janie is seven foot one. I assume she couldn't even see him and just and just hugged, hugged randomly. One of the actresses nominated for best actress stopped by to talk to him, Taraji P. Henson talked to him. And I actually want to turn this over to Kara because everyone said that Taraji shaded him on the red carpet and you being, you know, the judge or shade court. Was it shade? The universe has a way of taking care of the good people. You know what I mean? I agree. And then it's the next person that she spoke with. She was asked, how are you? And Taraji said good. Now that I'm in your company. Ooh, that's super shady. The shadiest part of her Ryan Seacrest interaction was she sort of gently grabbed his chin, which is super condescending. And it looked like she sort of looked like a sexy witch. I just, I just, yes, exactly. Like I just hexed you and you don't even know it. And so that I found very shady. So you know, I saw some headlines that said subtle shade, which is redundant as I have told you over and over again in shade court. But I think it was kind of shady. I mean, she gave the full head tilt and the full like, you know what I mean? Like clown from it eyes. Yeah. She knew what was up. But here cat gets more pay than me. Ooh, yes, cat Sadler jokes. Always bring that back. Because nobody wanted to talk to Ryan Seacrest, they kept cutting back to, you know, the talking bobbleheads that they had on E doing whatever. No, it was like Julianna being like, darkest tower. I mean, you've got to admit makeup. They're just like hyperventilating. So the Oscars were filmed at the Dolby Theatre where they usually are. And across the street at the Roosevelt Hotel is where these e-correspondents were with crowd of people behind them. And it was made to look like they were hanging out in some just garden party watching the Oscars and you kept having people come over and make cocktails and do whatever. I don't know. And never in an interview with like Francis McDormand. These people are not supposed to be talking that much during the pre-show is the problem. Forever. And this year they were like, so Julianna, you're leading it. Julianna's got a riff for like three hours. Like dear God. She doesn't have a tight five either. So she did have to make some stuff up. I was actually on E by the way. I was a part of it. Oh, I did not ask. Go ahead. All right. Well, you know, someone did. All right. Lewis. Can you give us their name and phone number and we can verify that they actually asked? We had asked you to be here during Black History Month. That's true. Traips an end. Carpet bagger. Climb to you people, yes. Anyway, the carpet. Yes. The carpet was fine after that. And then the show started. And Jimmy Kimmel gave his model line. We can't ruin this one. This is a special year. This is a big one. These are the 90th Academy Awards. This is history happening right here. Our friend Oscar. Oscar is 90 years old tonight, which means he's probably at home right now watching Fox News. Of course, no. He's probably as best as somebody is going to be at this job, I think. He's the right combination of sarcasm and sincerity. And I usually think hosts are lacking one or the other. Like they don't go funny enough or dark enough or they don't go appreciative enough. And he has sort of a knowledge of movie history, I think. So it was actually for me mostly a pleasure to watch him host it. I liked him. I've always liked like he's he's won me over, you know, since the man show, which I completely forget that that's why we even have him in the first place. Yes. Like talk about a and Ben Stein's money, co-hosted by Ben Stein among the world's worst people. Go ahead. He co-hosted Ben Stein's money. Yeah, honey. Won an Emmy for it. I forget most of Jimmy Kimmel's past. Right. You know that there was the man show and he was at some point attached to Adam Carolla and then he decided to let Adam Carolla be the villain that he is and just sort of skate away, scott-free. He's sort of a brand new Jimmy Kimmel. Right. You forget and especially this past year. Looks great now too. I'm just like, I'll go make over. He's been one of the more outspoken late night hosts where he's like talking about healthcare and talking and not just ripping on Trump to be funny but actually talking about issues in a real way and trying to inform people. And I think he tried to do that with his monologue. I didn't like where he's like, we're Hollywood. We're leading the charge against sexual assault. It's like, okay, relax. Yeah. You're a part of the charge. You're in the mid to back. Settle. But I didn't like Tim. Leading the charge. I mean, maybe in doing it perhaps but in curing it. Like he's starring in the profiler. I get it. He is very good and I have actually come around on Jimmy Kimmel since he cried over a lion on TV I think during the week of Ferguson. But that was actually a very good monologue that just sort of, it built on what Seth Meyers had done at the Golden Globes. And this one just really went there. It didn't even feel sort of like he was trying to do jokes like hit punchlines. He was literally just going beat by beat like this is the shit we're talking about and we're going to talk about it and I don't care who's uncomfortable. Right, right. Although I do wish he had handed the mic over to Tiffany and Maya after they had showed up. We are so happy to be here but a little nervous too because a few years ago people were saying that Oscars were so white and since then some real progress has been made. But we when we came out together we know some of you were thinking are the Oscars too black now? But we just want to say don't worry. There are so many more white people to come to. So many. We just came from backstage and there are tons of them back. And not just movie stars. There are white people walking around with head sets, white people with clipboards. Now I'm personally not a fan of white people with clipboards because I'm always wondering what are they writing down about me? They're here. Them presenting together was beautiful. It was amazing. I didn't expect to have the reaction I did to seeing them. I just screamed Thelma and Louise reboot to know in particular. They are a perfect duo. Also just Maya Rudolph is one of those people where she's amazing but sometimes it seems like it's been a year since I've seen her and it was so refreshing to see her again. Well it was also very refreshing to see her up there with Tiffany Haddish because you know my Rudolph was the only black woman on SNL forever and I feel like most of America didn't even know that she was black because they kept having her play random like white seeming characters and she was surrounded by just a sea of white people and I don't know seeing her on stage with Tiffany I was like that's Maya. And when's the last time we had two black people presenting, two people of color honestly presenting together at the Oscars. Like that can't be that often. Yeah they threw together a bunch last night like Kamal and Lupita presented. Right but this felt like I was like oh wow two of them. It was something like it felt different. But especially two women of color was shocking. And that they were just so funny together. And Tiffany were that dress again. Good for you girl. Yeah. Next year my dream is that Angela Bassett and Ellen Clegghorn perform and do a bit. Actually they just do full vaudeville. I just want them to dance. Also Paul Thomas Anderson, Maya Rudolph's longtime partner and he brought up at the Gotham Awards that he wanted to work with Tiffany Haddish and I guess there are rumblings that it's going forward and maybe Maya might be in there. That long ass ceremony will be worth it if we end up with a Maya Rudolph Tiffany Haddish like Thelma and Louise reboot. I will concede that. I'll take out Turner and Hooch any combination. Any duo. Butch Cassidy and she ready. They also made a few changes to the ceremony this year. Number one that Karen noticed while we were watching was those big ass envelopes with the huge lettering to make sure that nobody mixed anything up. Costume design in giant letter. Look if you're giving an envelope. On the front. So it's like if something was happening the entire audience could be like wrong one. You could see on TV. Right. Like you're not reading the right one girl. You know Fade Dunaway was like the fourth billboard better be this giant envelope. I need to read it like a night chart. And then they also had they kept showing the envelope for best picture that they had on like a little easel backstage on like its own altar. And I'm surprised they didn't just have like bulletproof glass behind it also. But they're like don't worry guys we're not going to fuck it up this year. And they kept making jokes about it and they had Fade Dunway and Warren Beatty come back out and present again after their La La Land Snafu. And I get that some people thought it was cute but I think it was dub. It was rude honestly to moonlight. Because I know that the moonlight crew turned down the opportunity to present best picture I believe. They turned down the opportunity. I think Jimmy Kimmel said that they asked if moonlight they wanted to come back and sort of like give their speech again. Like we will you can give your speech again. Something like you know like come back and have a moment. I didn't read it as that they asked them to present best picture. They're like you can come back and sort of finally get a chance to say what you wanted to say which is not the same thing. So I don't know that they got that offer. So I think that first offer is rude. Right. I mean first of all you know they said what they had to say at the end of last year's ceremony. And then the academy has just proceeded to continue to make jokes about it. And you know just sort of lean into like the fun and the camp of it. And we keep ignoring the fact that the people involved in this great movie last year basically had their moment ruined forever. I'm sorry I was reading the Wikipedia entry and on the Oscars and it's still like La La Land one until producer Jordan Horowitz stepped forward and I'm like can we get rid of La La Land in the narrative. I feel like Jimmy Kimmel at one point also said it was hilarious or he said something like that was like that's not funny. It's not funny to bring back these two people who screwed up the biggest moment arguably in some of these people's career. Also for a film that I think Lewis told me was the first film with an all black cast to win best picture. And it's like it's not cool that you screwed that up and to not sort of recognize that you ruined a historic moment. Also I understand there was camp value to that moment but it really felt out of control. Like it was not comfortable to watch. So it's like to put that to juxtapose that with the historic nature of that victory is unfortunate. Speaking of also fade down away did not look like she wanted to be there. Can I say that like I got to come out here again and I didn't want to do it the first damn time which is why I just snatched that envelope and like let's go. She was just. But by the way any footage of her we can get is priceless because she's such a particular old school type of celebrity who like gets a salad and is like the lettuce isn't soft enough. So mean 70 some things I want it. Speaking of mean 70 something. Francis McDormand. Not 70s. All right. Hold this right. This is a good question. I'm thinking she's in the 61 range. This is the first year that best actress and best supporting actress were both over the age of 50 since the 1981-82 ceremony. So first of the dorm and it's only 60. I said 61. I said in the community of that they wouldn't fire me on the prices right. Okay. She looks great. She had maybe one of the best moments of the night. Totally. She won for three billboards a movie that. Outside my tolerance. Apparently exists and she did actually have a very good performance in it. I will admit that I really enjoyed Francis in three billboards. I don't like three billboards but I enjoyed her and I enjoyed Sam Rockwell. I was happy for him too because I love Sam Rockwell. It is this weird feeling of I don't want to say I'm rooting against these veteran actors. Like Alison Janney, same thing. I don't love that movie. I'm happy she has an Oscar but the world has put me in this position where I met at them. Francis was best actress for three billboards and she used her speech to talk about inclusivity in the industry and she asked all of the female nominees in every category to stand up so that they could be applauded. People could look around at them and she could say. How few of them there were? There was seven. There was one woman who stood up and was in a sea of people alone. Like you see her looking around like. She was horrified. She was so, I mean it was still a great moment but it was like damn. If I may be so honored to have all the female nominees in every category stand with me in this room tonight, the actors. Marilyn, if you do it everybody else will come on. The filmmakers, the producers, the directors, the writers, the cinematographer, the composers, the songwriters, the designers. Come on. Okay, look around everybody. Look around ladies and gentlemen because we all have stories to tell and projects we need finance. Come talk to us about it at the parties tonight. Invite us into your office in a couple of days or you can come to ours whichever suit you best and we'll tell you all about them. I think Emily Gordon tweeted or she had on her Instagram the fact that when she stood out she was over there like in the corner like away from other people because she was a screenwriting nominee and she was like no idea if anyone else was actually going to stand up and she was doing it. And like Francis was, I loved how Francis was like a Meryl stand up because everyone else would do it if you do. And Meryl is in like the Louis XIV seat where she's just in the middle like puts both arms down, shoots up so then everybody has no choice but to follow that. Meryl at the Oscars is pretty much Oprah at like the Globes or any other ceremony. Oh yeah. No, the Oscars always feel a need to address her because she's sitting there in the front and I'm sure she's probably like stop talking to me. No, the Oscars are Meryl's legends ball. So that moment wasn't even suppression because I was rewatching Francis's Oscar win her previous one for Fargo and she used that speech to talk about the fact that she loved that people were financing movies with women with very good roles like the one she had in Fargo and it's just it's kind of heartbreaking to see that she gave that speech like 21 years ago. Yeah. Here she is saying the exact same thing like give us roles, give us work. And she brought up the word inclusion writer at the end and some people didn't know what that means. I mean most people did not know it. Most people didn't know it. It means I thought it was where Adam Ripon got his harness that he wore. Oh my god. You're going to be on the match game after this, honey. But the inclusion writer was a term created by Stacy L Smith who directs the Annenberg inclusion initiative at the University of Southern California. According to her, the inclusion writer is just a stipulation that actors and actresses can ask for or demand to have inserted into their contracts which would require a certain level of diversity amongst the films cast and crew. Basically, the idea is that 31.4% of speaking characters are female even though they represent little more than half of the US population. Women represented 4.2% of directors and just 1.4% of composers and 29% of speaking characters were from non-white racial ethnic groups compared with nearly 40% in the US. So the idea is to take characters, not even main characters. They're not saying like you need to replace all the men in your movie with women and non-white people. They're basically just saying the other characters that you see in movies don't make them white. You see a doctor, you see the neighbor, you see like the person's kids best friend who has to come over, make them non-white. And I think it also speaks to the idea of challenging people who have the power to, it's sort of recently Jessica Chastain and Octavia Spencer were in a movie together and Jessica Chastain basically demanded that they get the same salary. And Octavia Spencer is a black woman who would usually get paid less than this white actress. And so Jessica Chastain is in a position where she is a powerful movie star and she can say to people, she can say to the powers that be, I'm not going to do this, I'm demanding equality. And I think really with someone like Francis McDormand saying that, you're talking to the people who one have less to lose than others to speak up. And like you were in a position where it's like, are they really going to say, sorry Jessica Chastain, you're fired from the movie now, they might, more likely than not, they're just going to give the black woman her damn money. And that's a victory. There was kind of a particularly rad moment there of Francis McDormand being like, to all the other Francis McDormand's in this room, which is like, you know, a significant number of the nominees who have that kind of power, like we can wield it in exactly this way. That was like a very interesting, specific Oscar rallying moment, I thought. And it's helpful to point out that Francis said that it was something that she learned about only a week ago at lunch, you know, so it's not something where, you know, I remember when George Clooney was going off about like Oscar So White and being like, I've always been a champion of diversity. And then like you looking at his films and being like, there are never any black people in your movies. George Clooney, Francis, you know, is someone who learned about this. And I truly believe that she wants to now help her films, you know, have slightly more and the crew and the crew, because that's the other thing. Like when you look at all of the technical awards and like, I don't even want to know the stats on people of color and women getting nominated in the technical awards. I'm sure it's even more abysmal than all of like the acting awards and the writing awards and like female cinematographers and women know how to do special effects too, guys. Yeah, I mean, there's a lot was writing on Greta Gerwig at the ceremony just because she was like the only woman nominated in these major categories except for Rachel Morrison, who was, you know, the first woman nominated for cinematographer. 90 years. Yeah. And then you even had Jordan Peele being like the first black person to win for best screenplay, which means you know a black one as a one. Only time I think a black woman has been nominated in the screenplay category was co-writing ladies sings the blues, the Billy Holiday biopic from the 70s with Diana Ross. We've heard. You know what's crazy? Right. Let me tell you about Billy Holiday. I also think it's crazy when the Oscars, I don't know if they did that this year, but before they'd be like, how he buries the first black woman. It's like, why are you saying that? That's embarrassing. Like, you're like, Hey, isn't it cool Jordan Peele is the first? No, it's not cool. It's embarrassing. It's terrible. Right. You shouldn't be highlighting that like it's a like a fun fact. I mean, this is the Academy that still loves to show that clip of Adrian Brody assaulting how he buried on the stage. So I don't really think they've gotten the memo. Yeah. I was going to say the amount of times I've seen in a montage they call me Mr. Tibbs because we still only have like four iconic black quotes. It's pretty say-ing. Getting wrong. I got nothing on me. I had to remember Denzel in what's the- Trinity. No, no, no, no. What's the when he wants supporting after? Oh, glory. And glory. Because I was like, what's he doing in that tent? Yeah. I couldn't remember the movie. I was like, Oh, yeah. Glory. Forgot about that. I want to say also that the Francis, shall we say, stunt, our favorite word on this show was so refreshing after a number of strange things throughout the ceremony. First of all, being Kobe Bryant winning for that Dear Basketball short. Have you seen Dear Basketball because dear God, first of all, it is among the worst things I've ever seen when an Oscar. It is just pencil drawings of him shooting baskets and being like, you know what? I love basketball. Then, then of course there were charges against him that were weird. And then Gary Oldman winning and who having to present it to him? Jane Fonda, who's the queen of hating people like Gary Oldman. So that was also hard for me to watch. I feel very rude that they did not cut to Leslie Manville's reaction during Gary Oldman's speech because I wanted to see her wither and glare. Wouldn't it be amazing just to be clear. Leslie Manville and Gary Oldman used to be married if Gary Oldman won and just Leslie Manville rose and gave a monologue to the camera about why this was so stupid. She should have Kanyeed him. Yeah. Oh, my God. I mean, can you imagine? Let's write that spec. Has anyone ever been Kanyeed at the Oscars before? Are they too dignified for that? There's not Henny being passed around in the audience. Well, we had the streaker, you know. That was very momentary. Nobody jumped to the podium, I don't think. No, the only dramatic things are people being like either not wanting their Oscar. Like George C. Scott and Marlon Brando, yeah. Or people just being shady when someone wins and like not clapping for them. You know what's a good shady moment? Lee Grant, who won in the mid-70s. She was blacklisted for years and she won for a sporting actress for shampoo. She goes up there and she's got like the hardest bangs of all time. And she goes holding the Oscar. She goes, Oscar and I had a fight about 20 years ago. He's changed. I know I haven't. The first housewives tagline, 1975. Yeah. I mean, I remember when Eli Kuzan. And some people didn't clap for him because he named people to the blacklist. So there's always moments like that where you have to look for reactions in the audience. Yeah, like when Roman Polanski won. Yeah, exactly. No one's ever going to do a snatch that Oscar. More Hennessy at the Oscars I think would solve a lot of my Oscar criticism. I have to say, by the way, you know how Jennifer Lawrence I guess was like drinking wine throughout the ceremony? She the first person innovates smuggling wine into the room. Right. Yeah. It's been like 90 years and finally people are like, yes, more of that. I mean, I feel like I was a battalion was drinking at the Oscars. Must be real. I do think there are some actors who like to drink and I do think she was one of them. Yeah. And took a second. So we got a Times Up montage too, which, you know, in contrast with the Kobe Bryant and the Gary Oldman and Orion Seacrest of it all felt sort of like the Academy trying to have its cake and eat it too. And it was nice to see, you know, like Mirasarvino and other people there, but it did sort of feel like it was just tapped into the ceremony and then we can move on. Yeah. And we had to. They knew that there's no possible way they couldn't have done something. Yeah. And so, you know, it was like, well, you know, we got to do this. So. So seeing Mirasarvino and Annabela Ciara and Ashley Judd, it was just cool to see them there looking like movie stars, which they should still be, you know. So even if that was illusory, it felt in some way, compensating for the horrors done to them. I did object to the fish fucking movie being in that Times Up montage. Oh, that was weird. It was talking about the diversity and everything that's happened in Hollywood. And then there's Sally Hawkins, like, pumping a fish. She's signing I Love Gills to her husband. To her gay brother. But I forget what their relationship is in the movie. It had a gay person and a black person in it, which means that it was diversity. That's right. Nevermind that Octavia Spencer was playing the same character from the help. I think it was a crossover. I would actually say it was even more the same character from Hidden Figures, like the same sort of sausiness. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe there's a new movie where we find out that Octavia Spencer is just a time traveler. She plays a character who is all those people. That's right. Oh, God, I love her though. But speaking of the shape of water, a lot of people called it a quote unquote safe win. And I'm not exactly sure what that truly means. You know, I didn't think that the film was my favorite of the year, certainly, but it wasn't safe in terms of picking, you know, the darkest hour. Yeah. That movie really has a kind of like magic realism quality, you know, like Gabriel Garcia Marquez, something like that. And by the way, I mean, we make jokes about the fish clocking for the rest of my life. I'll make jokes about the fish clocking. It does make it a very unusual best picture when I do think, you know, I mean, it's like kind of a cinematic fairy tale in certain ways. So maybe that feels safe. But just the turns in the movie are at first surprising and weird and even a little uncomfortable before it resumes its whimsicality. I would just say that the problem with that movie is in the last quarter, then it becomes predictable. Then literally I'm sitting there watching the movie thinking, I know this is going to turn into some water ballet where we don't know if they live or die or go on romantically forever. And that's of course what happened because I'm a real smart. Well, we've seen we've seen splash. Right. Yes. I think less about the actual content of the film, it seems safe in that, you know, the director was a Mexican man who was sort of overdue. So he's not, you know, another sort of blonde white dude running an Oscar. The movie start a woman. Like it was all, but it's like, well, yeah, but kind of. And like, I guess we're giving it to another man. Like it felt like Justin, you know, Octavius, you had a black person in the movie who got to talk a little bit. Yeah, queer character. So it wasn't like a crazy, just like it's, you know, the big short or something where it's just like, here's 45 men talking for three hours. Well, you know, yeah, it's definitely in the sense that the Oscars loves to one. In reward men for lifetime achievements more so than they do women. Yeah. The best actor category is literally men winning for roles that they should have won years ago because the Oscars seems to have some sort of vendetta against young men being talented. Oh, yeah. But they routinely give it to young actresses like Jennifer Lawrence when, you know, they should be giving it to an older actress in that category who actually turned out a better performance. Right. Best actor is very like Al Pacino sent of a woman. It's very Daniel Day Lewis and Lincoln, things like that. I feel like they're also waiting to give Denzel another Oscar. They're like, let us just give you one more. Of course. Oh, fine. And then like these are the movies he's picking and they're like, I guess we got to nominate them for this. Right. You know, and then for director, it often feels that same way, you know, if it's safe, it's safe in the way that we love to celebrate men for telling these kinds of stories and not celebrating when women tell these kinds of stories. And it's safe in contrast to get out more than anything because that was like, I actually for like two seconds, I allowed myself to think that get out might win best picture after Jordan one. And I think really like the shape of water is safe. If you consider get out the other option. Well, it also just tells you that, you know, La La Land came this close to winning last year, shape of water won this year. If you want to win a best picture, Oscar, or at least get nominated, you need to do a film that is an ode to classic Hollywood. Yeah. I mean, like, I can't be set in classic Hollywood because of Kelsey's or try that. Yeah. Didn't work out. I actually think it's a little bit of a misnomer when people claim that Hollywood is super obsessed with the first ever best picture set in Los Angeles is crash, which is like 10 years ago. And I think the way about the shape of water also is exceedingly rare that a best picture is just about a woman. I mean, the last one was million dollar baby, you know, and then Chicago. And then I think before that, like terms of endearment, I guess you could argue Shakespeare in love too. But it's just super rare. And the fact is, I think we're living in this age where we're fooling ourselves and believing we're really like, you know, exalting these stories. The fact is a lot of people actively hate women's stories. So I think putting it out there and getting a best picture win for a movie starring a woman is still a triumph in a major way. And you probably know that specific statistic better than me, you know, the idea of the correlation between best actress winners or nominations with what's been nominated for best picture. It's like shocking. Only recently. I mean, that's something that the six to 10 best picture nominees has helped a little bit. Then you get movies like Filomena and an education in the best picture, a racket. But before that, no, like go right down the list. Like things nominated for best actors are rarely nominated for picture. And they are almost always nominated for things like makeup. We like marginalized them. But everyone who's usually nominated for best actor, the film that they're in is usually nominated for best picture. All right. Because we relate to them. That's our story. Relate to men. When we're back. Lewis versus a computer. And Kara. Kara's running the computer. So that's a very important part about it. She is the computer that Ort Hettish is. I love your hip current references, my God. Coming from you. I know, please. No. Where's some Patico? Did you just do a monologue about shampoo? Yeah. It touched everybody in the room. I made it universal. I just like that movie. You know what I made. Mm hmm. So, you know what I mean. I'm a fan of the movie. So, I am going to ask Kara and a computer and Lewis 10 questions. And we'll see who gets the most right out of 10. First, we're just accuracy. Yeah. Just shout out the answer first. Okay. Okay. First question. This is a category I call name the winner. Okay. I'm going to name nominees. I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to be in a Yeah, it's not very friendly by the way Wizard of Oz and Wuthering Heights. Well, that went well. Okay. Okay. I actually by the way I don't feel bad because it's Google not me. That's true. It's for the record. We'll try another one of those Crouching Tiger hidden drag 2000 gladiator Yeah, gladiator beat crouching tiger hidden dragon and Brockovich traffic and chocolat Mm-hmm. Can I tell you something? I've never seen shock a lot never got nominated for a best Yes, it is Was he the original Casey Affleck the Oscars used to love him. I mean that movie I think the Oscars used to love him until we made the tourists and 17 Pirates of the Caribbean movies the chocolate was only the third best supporting actor black nominee ever That's right Best original screenplay 1962 Arabia Splendor in the grass no, that's technically 61. So I mean you're looking at the 62 ceremony. I'm gonna go What is it not Lawrence of Arabia? No, it says winner 1962 splendor in the grass. That's it for 61 It's like the the ceremonies in that year This is a trivia thing that people fight about all the time William Minge wrote that yes 61 splendor in the grass Hold on. That's not what I'm gonna go the apartment. That's the year before what's going forward? Sweet bird of youth now one more second divorce Italian style. Oh, that's really hard. Wow All right two to one I accept Have you seen divorce Italian sola no have you seen it? Oh, it's plucky. I bet Wait, is that not Gina Lilla Brigida? Who's in that? Daniela Rocha. Oh very good. No, I love an Italian movie All right, that's supporting actor. Okay, give me a year 1973 John Houseman paper chase I'm positive John Joel Gray. No, that's definitely God damn it. I don't understand this Why is Google hold up Google if you're listening 74 Are you putting these? What is what is this? It's a bone of contention with trivia people like if you're talking about the 1973 Oscars Do you mean honoring the films of 73 or the actual the year the ceremony took place? I would argue you're oh you always want to say it's for the year the movies are so no It should be the year that the Oscars when he says 73 got the award. It's an SEO problem That's the that's the issue Google. I can actually name all the best supporting actors from that decade if you want me Robert De Niro 75 George Burns 76 Jason Robards I think this game is over and I think that this taught us a very important lesson about Google SEO and gay people who are on the spectrum maybe And I'm playing games with you again We're back We're back keep it Keep it is brought to you by IFC films is the death of Stalin a comedy of terrors from the creator of Veep and in the loop Steve Buscemi and Monty Python's Michael Palin lead an award-winning ensemble in this hilarious political satire Which reinterprets the true events of Soviet succession in Moscow 1953 when tyrannical director Joseph Stalin drops dead and his parasitic cronies square off at a frantic power struggle To be the next Soviet leader. I don't know anything about history. So I'm not gonna make any jokes about Joseph Stalin I don't want to offend anybody and lose this podcast The one line is fly fast as the political fortunes fall in death of Stalin though And critics are already calling it a masterpiece One of the most hilarious films of the 21st century and the political satire we need right now Rolling Stone calls it brilliant and reminds you that any resemblance to modern world affairs is not a coincidence The death of Stalin in theaters March 9th And now the part of the show that everybody tunes in for it's keep it What are we saying no thank you to this week Kara this week? I'm saying no thank you to Not Peter from the Bachelor. I believe his name is Ari but from now on we're just calling him not Peter Who should have been the Bachelor and the finale was this week and he picked a brunette and then he dumped her like a day late I mean not a day later in real time, but the way we watched it so he basically brought cameras into like a meet-up with her and was like yo I think I like that other girl more never mind even though you're my fiance and I propose to you on TV like a minute ago and Also, she's like sobbing Understandably and she's like just go just go and he's just sitting there and I'm like I can't even fathom Something doing that to me because they know that they would die So it's hard for me to even put myself in that situation But I just like one I feel like I don't know how much the producers know I never know with that stuff But it felt like even for the Bachelor kind of a new low like you're setting this woman up to just be Completely humiliated and usually they humiliate themselves on their own. You don't need to help them So I don't watch the white seasons of the bachelor. I don't either This seems exactly like what I would expect from the show given unreal Right, it seems like something Rachel would have orchestrated for the end right you have to pick someone else For this big dramatic moment after you've already picked her Yeah, like you've already picked her and I think it was something like you know when when they get engaged or whatever They don't get to see each other for a few months while the show is airing because they don't want people to know who won But they'll do like sort of secret Coordinated meet-ups where everyone makes sure that they can spend time together and no one sees and it's like you did it during one of those Dude and like asked for camera. I assume cameras aren't usually there the producers had to know he was about to do that Girl, I think you should sue all of them. You probably signed a contract. Give it a whirl Get me on the jury. You're getting all the money. I bet in our contract. It's like your engagement will be ruined You know listen if it just elbow could get Molly out of that game. I'm sure he could help Whoever this plucky brunette is Lewis, what are you keeping this week? It sounds like I'm about to tell RuPaul to keep it but his apology was so sufficient that it won't be a keep it to him I'll get to who it's for what happened this week was RuPaul in an interview with the Guardian was talking about trans women and drag and Basically he was talking about how the lines are blurred when somebody is trans and like basically treating them like Olympic athletes who are Doping or like you know giving themselves some sort of advantage By transitioning he even tweeted something shady like You can dope and still be an athlete just not in the Olympics like he was spilling some sort of tea Right. It's like you're literally saying trans people are flow Joe like what? I have no guesses to what that's about but you did not dope either way that do not sell a flow Joe's name Some people would argue the sport has been ruined ever since 1988 moving on But what drove me crazy was so there were two sides on Twitter like people were really met at RuPaul Some people defended RuPaul, but what bothered me was Bob the drag queen who's a former winner of the show He's great. He's hilarious. He said something like sometimes I think our community is just tearing itself apart something along those lines I just want to say I think this is one of the ways in which the gay community is very productive We I mean like maybe we're a little tougher than we need to be a little bit more insulting than we need to be sometimes But to me this was like one of those good in-fighting situations that unifies our message makes us realize like This is an insulting thing to say about trans people RuPaul eventually came around too after trying to double down on his original statement And I just don't think this is a read in our community that both sides had points and were mad about it Right. There was this notion to from some people on Twitter the fact that we shouldn't be calling RuPaul out, you know because he's done so much for the community But it's also this community that he's talking about doesn't have the platform and the celebrity that he has so how are so they Supposed to reach him besides tweeting at him totally also. I mean, I'm not new to the idea that celebrities I love mess up sometimes. I think a perfect example would be Joan Rivers who you know legendary comic I would say I personally owe a lot to that style of like Making fun of men to their face just like she's revolutionary whatever She also if you remember her e-show basically believed writers should be her slaves and she didn't correct it or figure out a deal for them So that's a part of her legacy forever Unfortunately, RuPaul meanwhile has apologized so that as far as I'm concerned is now wiped from his record for the most part Right and it's reasonable for people to call him out You know the joke on like Tyra male from America's next top model in his show used to be called she male Yeah And he changed that even though he put up a fuss about it and he put up a fuss about you know using the word tranny on his show to Even though you know transgender people told him that that was a slur Right and you should not use it even though it was fun that he was throwing around you know like in the 80s and 90s like it's 2018 now Right That's also it's just that's part of being a trailblazer is you know in certain ways People are going to expect you to keep that up and they're going to be critical when you don't I thought it was a very productive conversation for the LGBTQ community to have I'm gonna wrap it up with my keep it which is Oscars related in the sense that for some reason ABC decided to ruin my evening by airing an alic Baldwin talk show After the Oscars, I think we all caught the first few minutes of that show and went What are you doing? Also, I mean my main thing with that which I wasn't even really listening the chairs They have them facing each other have you ever seen a talk show in the history of talk shows set up like that? Like the whole point is you so all of the shots are over the shoulder. You can never see both of them at the same time It's like there's a reason they pivot the chairs so that you're sort of yeah Each other and it was crazy. It's very old tv. It reminds me like Tom Snyder Frost Nixon Baldwin is asking Jerry Seinfeld about The sneakers he wore when he first appeared on the late show also here's the thing I think Alec Baldwin is a pretty good interviewer that said nothing about me is ever saying I need Alec Baldwin to talk more and be on tv I just because that's gone awry a half dozen times And why does he want to do this? He's also spent the past few weeks like defending Woody Allen defending Gary Oldman Attacking women on Twitter and basically being a trash box So I really don't want to see him, you know talking to celebrities right now Because I don't want to hear him chiming in on These important conversations that people need to be having right now and Also just to debut that first episode where he's talking to Jerry Seinfeld and Kate McKinnon after the Oscars. It just felt so Unnecessary to pop culture or the cultural conversation right now. There was like When did you film this? Let's be honest. You probably won't be watching it for long. There's no way that's I mean, please I think that's no way that is lasting Beyond this megan kelly is still walking tight ropes with bears Right now. So anything's possible frantically serving a brunch and saying aren't we having fun? I think burn notices still on tv. I don't know. Alec Baldwin might last a few years I Thank you so much for being here I'd like to thank myself Thank you care. Oh Separate entities we rarely get along That's keep it Turner and hooch any combination Any do well Butch Cassidy and she ready"
