    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you. No matter how dark things have gotten, if you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on the screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind Today at BlazeTV.com slash The Blind. Today, charges have been filed against the St. Louis gun couple. Joe Biden says his VP shortlist includes four black women, because apparently that's the only criteria now. And the AP says it will keep white, the word white lowercase, after the recent decision to capitalize the word black. It's a crazy world, but we're going to make sense of it today and it starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez today joined by the one and only America's favorite cowboy, Chad Prather. And the crowd is so thankful that there's only one and the future Texas governor. Can I say that yet? That is true. You can say it. Okay. I wasn't sure. The keep Texas great. Yeah, pack. Pack. That's what we're working with. Yes. So. You know, they said, you mean keep Texas red? And I said, I do mean keep Texas red. True. Because at the end of the day, I believe conservative values and politics. Well, not even the policies. Conservative values are the things that are going to keep us the most free and prosperous. Yes. Now, that doesn't mean I can't get along with people who are blue. Right. But well, the problem is that I do believe in a red Texas. The blue doesn't really want to get along with you. Well, that's true. And if you look across the world everywhere, blue policies have been infecting people. And communities, you it's been exactly that. Yeah. It's been bad. Yeah. Well, so it's me and Chad today. I didn't mean to turn it all into that, but I could talk about me for a whole hour. You're stuck with us today. And I will say, for those of you who were wondering, we are about to get into the news headlines. But for those of you who were wondering, I know I got a lot of feedback. The people were mad that you were gone for so long, Chad. And they were like, have you blacklisted him from your show? I'm like, no, why don't you ask him why he won't come on my show? Yeah. I had stuff to do. I'm back on the road where tour would be an Oklahoma City this weekend. Six shows Oklahoma City this week. And we were just in Tempe, Arizona, blew it out and had sold out shows. People are tired of this stuff. Jimmy Kimmel's sister Jill opened for me all weekend long. Jill Kimmel did. Yeah. And she is, she has her brothers politics, but she's a sweetheart and she's a great comedian. And she said, I almost didn't do this gig with you because she said, another comedian called me up and said, well, you're going to get coronavirus if you go in that crowd because you know they're all mouth breathers. And I was like, that is hilarious, man. I used it over and over again on stage because it's just so funny. We can take a joke. Yeah. Right? We can take a joke. But she's a sweetheart and she was good. And she said, you know what? She goes, normally I kind of make myself scarce when I'm not on stage. She said, I hung out with you and your crew, which are all conservative folks. Very outspoken. She said, I had the best time I've ever had with, with a team who was traveling with a comedian. And she said, I'm in love. I just love you guys. I want to work with you again. That's awesome. They will flip them all. We're flipping them all one person at a time. I just started with Jimmy Kimmel's sister. So y'all can pick somebody out there. Exactly. You can pick a sibling. I'm a conna. Hey, rooster, mcconna. Hey, go for him. Yeah, mcconna. He should be pretty easy. He's he's in Texas. All right. So the McCloskeys, which is of course the infamous St. Louis gun couple who you'll see for those of you who are watching on television. Yeah. And he's not wearing shoes, which I find to be so interesting. But the couple who was outside their home defending it when Black Lives Matter's protesters, I'm sorry, Black Lives Matter rioters broke in to their gated community, broke down the gate and started walking through it. Now according to the McCloskeys, they were yelling threats. They were saying, you know, we're going to we're going to kill you and that's going to be my bedroom up there. Now this is all of course, according to the couple. So they were outside their home defending their property, which you are legally allowed to do, Chad. Am I am I mistaken? You are legally allowed to do in Missouri. There is a castle doctrine is a standard ground. Yes. So apparently they, the circuit attorney, Kim Gardner in St. Louis decided to file charges against them. Now this has been a long time coming. There's been a lead up to this. They had to the police came to their home. They seized their weapons. They went through a back and forth. They kind of knew that this was coming, but they actually have gone ahead and filed the charges. St. Louis circuit attorney has filed charges against the couple because they waived their weapons in a quote. This is this kills me in a quote threatening manner at peaceful, unarmed protesters and it is illegal to waive weapons in a threatening manner at those participating in a non violent protest. And while we are fortunate, the situation did not escalate into deadly force. This type of conduct is unacceptable in St. Louis says the circuit attorney, Kim Gardner. So what do you do? Look at that screen grab right there. I call them Ken and Karen Chad, bro. Right. I'll throw myself under the bus. You really did. Chad, bro. I mean, okay. So can we obviously their trigger discipline is for lacking? It's awful. Horrible. Especially he was he was, but they were frightening. I know. I mean, they're waving the guns packing forth past each other and she's holding that thing like she's done found her laser pointer. I just love making fun of them. I mean, he will be the Halloween costume of October. If this thing stays in the news cycle very much longer. Oh, gosh. Let me ask you a serious question. Have you ever had a gun pointed at you? No, it's not a good feeling. No, I can't imagine it would be. It's not a good feeling. I've had guns that I've known are unloaded, known for a fact and still have them pointed at me either for a photograph or doing some kind of a sketch thing or whatever. But then I've had actual guns that people could have used pointed at me. None of it's a good feeling. So to flack somebody like that in a wave of gun around somebody that is that is that is it's a bad handling of a firearm. It really is. Is it illegal? We're going to find out what the court says there. They weren't catching some flack. I mean, the rioters were saying some things. They busted through the gate. These people, I mean, I can't. I mean, and by the way, they're not. These are not Republican conservatives. No, they were Black Lives Matter supporters. Right. I mean, until this point, I'm not sure about now. Right. So that's, you know, so here you have these people who maybe don't have the best control and they don't need to be flagging people with these guns, you know, waving the barrel at them and things like that. But how hard of a criminal case that is. I don't know. I don't know what you're saying to see how that goes. But then again, you know, I got Roger Stone on the show tonight on my show. We talked for 45 minutes about how the rule of law, you forget it basically these days. I mean, if they decide they're out to get you and make an example out of you and especially if it'll make a big splash like I firmly believe they did what they did to Roger Stone because he's so flamboyant. Right. They made him an easy target. I mean, used to be on info wards. It's a huge supporter of Nixon. All these different things about him, the way he dresses and then we got outspoken. went after him. I have no doubt that these folks, I mean, just look at this. This is circuit level media or circus level media right here where they can get a lot of mileage out of this thing. So I wouldn't want to be in their shoes quite honestly because the media drives the narrative unfortunately even in the rule of law these days. Well, and that's what's so scary because while Governor Parson of Missouri, he did say that he would pardon the McCloskey's if necessary. And I know the Attorney General has gotten involved. He has also said he was trying to move to dismiss the charges. But I think really the issue is okay, maybe these people got the publicity that they would need in order to get that sort of thing, you know, pardoned. But how many people who don't have this publicized, who don't have, you know, a video, a viral video, how many people are going to get stuck having to pay for doing something that really was their lawful right to do. I mean, this is a class D felony if they're found guilty. Let's say the governor didn't pardon them. If they're found guilty, they could face fines as steep as $5,000 and up to four years in prison, four years in prison for doing something that looks to me like is legal. He got the $5,000 in his pocket right there in cash. Look at him, man. These people live in a museum. It's fantastic. They do. I mean, you've seen the pictures of the inside. Oh, yeah. Yeah, which more power to him? God bless America. The if it had not been for the camera footage that you see, it would just be a he said she said, right? But of course, what they say is as you pointed out, people were saying that's going to be my bedroom. This is going to be my house now. We're going to kill you. We're going to break all anyway. We're going to burn this. It did break through the gate and get in there. And I think the word is and I didn't pay attention, scrutinize this story, but they were on their way to the mayor's house in the same neighborhood, right? Well, they I think they thought it was in the same neighborhood and then it ended up that they were not in the correct neighborhood, which is not shocking to me if that's the case. I mean, I just when I'm here, I want to I want to shout get off my lawn. Like every time I see this video is getting on my lawn. Yeah, I want to go full blown Gavin McKenna son. But I mean, so so what constitutes I mean, I guess my question is, if you own a gun, you have it to defend your property, to defend your life. Guns to tool. Right. Like what else are you supposed to do other than I did hear a lot of people who criticized them at the time and they said, well, you should, I mean, they shouldn't be out there holding the guns. I mean, they could be in their house. And I'm like, well, how are you going to deter someone from coming on your property if they don't see that you're ready to defend it? Well, two weeks ago, or a week and a half ago, you had black militia members who were marching on Stone Mountain and they were saying some pretty strong things. But I defended their right to march with those rifles. I defended it because that is well within their constitutional right, at least how I believe it and how I interpret it. So if you have the firearm, if you have the weapon and you find you're in a situation where you need to use it, you got to pull it out of the closet. Right. You do point it at people. I think that ultimately comes down. It's right there. That's what it was. It's the discomfort of pointing a gun. But let me just tell you something, America, if this crap continues the way it does, there's going to be a lot more guns being pointed at people. I mean, you had what 70 people shot in Chicago over the weekend? Yeah. 70 people, you won't talk about a place that needs a socially distance is Chicago. And Lori Lightfoot, the mayor is doing nothing about it. She said, you know, we handle this. And Trump's like, let me help you. No, right. They can't get it together. Yeah. It's a bad deal. Do you agree? By the way, we talked about Trump sending law enforcement into what he said at Seattle over the weekend. Do you agree with President Trump's decision to do that? Not necessarily. You know, point out yesterday, he said it was it's been 51 days. It's not like long enough. Let's clean it up. Right. And what do you do when you have these governors who who just in Mayors, who just won't do it? And I've said over and over on even on this show that we're starting to see the little despots, you know, show their head with these. That's why I mean, I have said, as a conservative, I've said this my entire life, I said government starts with yourself, then in your family and your home. Okay, then your community. That's why the person most important to me is my state rep, my mayor, my my rep in Washington. Who are those people? Because Donald Trump and Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and George W, they're not coming to my house to see how things are. I don't plan on that. But we're seeing that these mayors and these governors, they're starting to dictate a lot of things. And then when they don't do their job, when they don't clean this mess up, because again, at what point time is a is a governor going to step up and have an unpopular opinion when it's the right constitutional thing to do other than trying to appease either the scientific medical or media masses. And I'll hush right there. But all of these governors across the state, the only one that I've seen that has any cajonas recently is Brian Kemp in Georgia, Chris, you know, I'm in South Dakota, Rhonda, Sanis is showing some some intestinal fortitude there. So how about Greg Abbott? I don't think he makes that list. What do you think? No, they doesn't right now. And I say that as a guy that supported Greg Abbott for years. I did tell voted for Greg Abbott. I've been for Greg Abbott. I don't know what happened to Greg Abbott. Did you see the tweet that he tweeted out? I sure did. Coronavirus story. Yes. I retweeted it. I said this has all the trappings of an urban story or an urban legend, right? And it's like the person that went to the coronavirus party in the coronavirus and died. And they said, I thought it was a hoax. Yeah. And then they died. Yeah. It's thought it was a hoax. I was going to prove it was a hoax. And the governor of Texas is tweeting this. Yeah. I mean, you're the what 12 13th largest economy on the planet. And you're tweeting a fake news story from what Express news or some kind of thing like that. Party foul Steve wouldn't tweet that out. I mean, it's just ridiculous. And I said, this, this, come on, man, this is you when you start trying to back up your decisions to mandate masks in the state by using a fake news story about a 30 year old who ought to have enough common sense not to go to a COVID party. But then is in there apparently licking the toilets. I don't know what the story said, but gets coronavirus and dies. Well, I'll tell you something. What a lot of people in this 30 years old have died today in Texas and it had nothing to do with coronavirus. You mean people die? People do die. One. And you know what? You would harm my grandmother. Your grandmother is going to die to 100%. We've got more to get into including just well, I don't know about all of us, maybe you, but I'm going to live forever, including Joe Biden, who says his VP shortlist. Well, it includes four black women because that is the only criteria now is color, apparently. First, I want to thank our sponsor Candid. I'm smiling a lot these days, even though there's not a whole lot to smile about when you look at the state of the country. But do you know why I'm smiling a lot these days?

Joe Biden said yesterday that his short list of vice presidential contenders includes four black women. That's all he would say. He would not say who they were. Here is a little bit of Joe Biden talking with Joy Reid of all people. I'm sure he was very proud to be proclaiming this to a black woman herself. Here is what Joe Biden had to say to Joy Reid yesterday. Most African Americans that I've talked to on a daily basis are very concerned that black women in particular have been the heartbeat of the Democratic party for a long time. Really short you up in places like South Carolina. Are you committed to naming a black woman as your vice presidential running mate? I am not committed to naming any but the people I've named and among them there are four black women. So that decision is underway right now. And by the way black women have supported me my entire career. You all act like all of a sudden there was an epiphany in South Carolina. I have had over a 96% 94% rating in the state with the eighth largest black community in the United States of America Delaware. And so they're the ones as that old saying goes that brought me to the dance. I have been loyal. They have been loyal to me. And so it is important that the my administration I promise you will look like America. Both as from vice president to Supreme Court to cabinet positions to every major position in the White House is going to look like America. So I guess that's what being a vice president is about then is who's loyal. Who's most loyal to you. That's what I heard. All you people is what he said. Okay. I give it to him like the guy answered the question appropriately enough in that I've named some people of that list for our black women. He's already said though that he's going to have a woman. He's already said that he's already said that like he's he's been more specific in the past. But then it's like that he could have stopped with that and just been yeah I've given a list of people. There's some black ladies on that deal. I mean, you don't even say ladies is black women. Yeah, right. Are there any midgets on there Joe? I mean, what are we talking about? Are there any dot Indians? I mean, come on. Let's you want to be racist like that. Let's just come on. Let's really race us forget political correctness as a as a humorist as a comedian that gets to go out and tell jokes. You guys are freeing up the game for us. Like it used to be we couldn't talk about anything that that objectified a woman. Me too is so 2019 anyway. You couldn't talk about blacks, whites, fat, skinny. You couldn't talk about men, women, gay, straight now. It's all out the window, man. We're going to pick a black woman. We're going to I mean, do you really need that level of condescension for someone to say we're going to have a White House that looks like America. Okay, so you're going to have a White House, a cabinet of staff, everybody that has 13% African Americans. Is that what you're saying? I mean, that's really that's what America looks like. So is that what we're going to do? Is it really the skin color? Are you are you choosing somebody based on the one the point 001 to 6% of the genetic makeup, which is their melanin that separates them. You have a skin color. I have a skin color. I've never seen a White person. I'm not White. This isn't White. I've never seen a Black person. I've never seen a Brown person. Never seen a Yellow person. Never seen a Red person. We're all basically just different shades on the same spectrum, right? Because we're not that different in the grand scheme of things. Now, what do you mean, Jody? You mean skin color? Do you mean the culture? Do you mean the community? Are you picking people out of the Black community or the Black culture out of the Black skin type? The skin type really qualify you to get something that other people don't have. What about their qualifications? Are you going to look at their IQ or is IQ, is that racist? What about their EQ? Their emotional quotient? Is that going to be racist too? So I got a lot of questions here, Joe. I got a lot of freaking questions. I don't think he can answer. Are you Black enough? What happens if you're like Keith and Kevin Hodge, the Hodge twins? And you go back to their great, great, great grandfather who the reason they got the name Hodge is because he was a White man came over from Ireland. You look at their DNA, the 55% Black. Well, I would hope because a member of their own party who served as president who was the first African American president, the first Black president, the single White mother, White, right, was half Black. So it was a single White mother, but I don't know in 2020. White grandparents, I mean, exactly. So but hey, look, here's the deal, man. No matter what color your parents were, if you're dark enough, Sean King, claim to be Black, you know, because whites have all the privilege, you wouldn't want to claim to be White, right? In America, we have all the, well, you don't, because you're a POC, but whatever color that may be, you're kind of shiny. But I mean, you go out, you've got the pregnancy left. But hey, if whites have so much privilege, how come nobody that's half Black, half White wants to claim the White side of their, of their, you know, DNA or of their ancestry? They never want to do that. That doesn't make any sense. But we're going to pick a Black girl. We're going to pick a Black woman. This whole thing is just, I mean, the condescension of it. And there was actually a news article that came out in 2018 that talked about how just based on the rhetoric, how the left is far more condescending to the Black community than anyone else. I mean, look at these things, how they immediately go into pander bear mode as soon as Joy Reid asks a question, look, look, you all, all you people, all you people, what people, Joe, all you people, let me just tell you something. You dance with the one that brung you. That's not how I want my vice president to be chosen. Dance with the one you brung you. Does that mean you're going to be dancing with Barack Obama forever? Because you'd be completely irrelevant if you hadn't been vice president. The man has, he doesn't know what day it is. He doesn't have two brain cells to rub together, right? He can't even figure out if his sister is his wife. So here's the thing, you know, he says, we haven't had a whiff of scandal in eight years. Oh, you've had a whiff of a lot of things, Joe Biden. Who can imagine Donald Trump who has built this economy and then watched it crash because of all the attacks and then the coronavirus that have come his way? Here's the guy who's proven he can build the economy. He can create jobs. He can do these things. And you're going to go ahead and cast your vote for Joe on the basis of, hey, corn pop like to me. And then my legs, they get blonde in the summer and you can rub my leg here. And I'm going to dance with the one who broke me. And we're going to get a person with different skin color to be the vice president. And I'll never be a lion dog face pony soldier ever again, Jack. It is. It's pretty racist, pretty racist. Did I say too much? No, I want to midget. Well, that ain't the right word, but I'm purposely saying it ain't the right word. I think you're going to get that. Let me, let me give you according, according to bookies.com. Let me give you the, the, the, the people who they think are at the top of the list. Kamala Harris is it even odds? Susan Rice, of course. Okay. Atlanta mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms. So you got coronavirus. Oh, she's okay. And then, she's being sued by the governor of Georgia. Oh, good. And then sounds about right. And then, of course, Stacy Abrams. Now, I want to know if Elizabeth Warren, she's already identified as Native Americans. So she could identify as black and then maybe she can be in the, I mean, she could identify as a lot of things. I mean, if you ever seen such white wokeness in your life as Elizabeth Warren, and here's the thing, you know, Joe Biden, at the end of the day, it's controllable. It all does come down to who the vice president is going to be. Now, everybody that ran on the democratic primary were radicals except for Joe Biden. Joe is just kind of at grandpa that they thought would be gentle enough and well known enough and respected enough, because he's been around and he's been in the public view for long enough. They're like, well, he's got a chance of beating Trump. There's no way these radicals are going. Do you see Marianne Williamson said that the media and everybody made her look crazy? Honey, you had a hand in it. But, but they were so radical. The DNC knows that those people can't win against Trump. So they had to bring an established name. So what they did is they found a Joe Biden who they can control. They can control that guy. So it did people say, well, six months in Joe, they're going to kill Joe. He's going to get 86 to then it's going to be whoever the vice president is. Yeah, keep the change of filthy animal. No, here's what's going to happen. All they got to do is say, Joe, just you need to kill him. You were president. You were 46. You were president. Well, I mean, even so. I was happy going back to the basement. Oh, great. Even so, you know, they don't even think they, I think that that's likely, but I don't even think they have to do that because if you look at all of these plans that he has signed on to since he's leaving him, right? He will do whatever the people closest to him tell him to do. He's signed on to the Green New Deal and all of these other radical plans that were basically burning ideas that he's now signed on to because he's just a talking head at this point. He's speaking of talking heads. You know what he said? He said that if he's elected, he will continue to give Dr. Fauci. There's Fauci right there. Little bobblehead. Should we wear masks? No. Should we wear masks? Yes. Yeah, I was going to say it depends on the day. What his answer is we've got more coming up first. We want to thank our sponsor Keaps. So if you have noticed, maybe your hair isn't looking as full as it's used to, or as it used to, I know men, you men, Joe Biden's racist, I'm going to get sexist for a second. You men, you don't want to go to the doctor. You're all embarrassed about every single thing that you could possibly be embarrassed about. And so you just stay at home and you don't go to the doctor. And then if you have hair loss, you're just going to keep losing your hair and you're not going to do anything about it and you're going to be secretly embarrassed about it. Or you're going to finally go to the doctor and then you're going to visit the pharmacy and try not to go broke just to avoid going bald. Let me give you a better option. It's called Keaps and you can do it from the comfort of your own home.

A teachers union in Florida has sued the governor and the state board of education over an executive order calling for schools to open five days a week for in-person instruction in August. And they said, any sensible person, this is the union president, any sensible person would tell you, we have got to get the positivity rate down. This is a life or death situation. We don't want to be reckless. We don't want to be irresponsible. And that was, of course, in response to the school's reopening in August per the executive order from governor DeSantis. Can I call you? I guess I can't call you governor yet. Not yet. Okay. Well, future governor. Tell me. Goobernatorio. Stop it, goober. Who's right? Who's correct here? Was governor DeSantis? Did he go overboard by by a little bit? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Really? Yeah. I mean, okay, you want to get the positives down. I get that. But that's all they said is the positivity rate. And then say this is a life or death situation. Like, isn't it anytime you leave your house? Isn't that a life or death situation? It is. I mean, that was the point I was going to make. I mean, when it comes down to just starting to throw around executive orders to do this or to do that, it starts to get a little bit tricky and slippery because if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that. And it's not anyone's situation at all. Everything's tied, right? You throw the pebble in the lake and it's the ripples, right? Well, the ripples that are way out here, the rocks already sunk to the bottom and the ripples are still going on. So you don't know with legislation, and executive orders and policy and mandates and these things, that's what's so scary. See, I don't think that mandates and liberty go in the same sentence at all. I don't think you can have one in the other, right? So that being said, Florida is an interesting situation, right? You have a lot of people coming from a lot of different states, a lot of tourists in there, even Disney World opened up, but it's limited in terms of how you can function at Disney. There's a lot of things going on. I appreciate Governor DeSantis on some of the things that he's done in regard to open it up for tourism because let's face it, businesses are going to go south if you don't have that. But let's talk about the schools for a second. Okay, here's what people forget, right? And I know it's different in different places, but just by and large, let's just throw some some ideas out there. One, it's not just about teachers. There's cafeteria workers. There are environmental services, there are landscapers and grounds keepers. There are administrators. There are all these people, there are teachers, aides. There are people who depend on these schools for a job, right? Let me go one step further. How many kids in America, unless they go to school, don't eat? They don't eat. So that's an issue. Now I understand people will say, Chad, they still provide the meals. And in many cases, many school districts, they do. They still provide the meals. But if you don't feed your child at home, what makes you think those people, those same people are going to come by the school and pick up their sack lunch in order to feed the kids? It's just not going to happen like that. Well, what about the rise in domestic abuse and domestic abuse? There's domestic abuse, suicide. We don't even have the numbers of suicide specifically. One of the most charted group, yet, that's been out there in our recent history, is veterans. We don't even know how many veterans suicides are happening right now. We know it's just through the roof because we can't chart those because right now there's too many other things being charted in the medical community. You know that song? That's something by Nickelback. Look at my photograph. So I rewrote that. I saw me and said, look at my COVID graph, pile by research staff. Everybody's in a bed. Oh, Joey's dead. And then it's like, nobody can do the math. And that's kind of what we're looking at in all of this stuff. You know how many people I have come in contact with just in just in the last couple of months who said, you know what? I had it. Nobody knew it. I had it. I went back and tested positive and they said, yeah, you had it and all that stuff. And how many? See, we see the horror stories. But we're talking about, let's say there's a bridge, it has a 99.95% chance of staying up while you cross it. I'd feel pretty good. I'm not going to swim the river. I'm going to take the bridge. Right. Why in the world are we changing everything? Especially when it comes to kids, when it comes to kids who are testing like what 2% of cases are smaller children. Yeah, I mean, maybe positivity rates, but certainly. Rate, but they're not getting sick from right. They're not dying. Kids are resilient. Well, first other than the outliers, don't. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Let's talk about that for a second. That's that's the thing. And I feel like we're kind of getting into this. When you call this show, the news and why it matters. Why does that? Why does this story matter to you? Okay. I'm going to tell you why, because when we talk about statistics and we talk about the population of a country and we talk about trends, don't individualize that and make it about you. It's not about you. We know you are that one person that can't eat bread because you're gluten intolerant and no matter. Yeah, I get it. Okay. Well, I get it. And I said that because by God, that's immediately triggering 5% of the audience. We can't make policy off of just you. Exactly. It's not going to happen. So we're talking about the general people that are out there. They're not getting it. Children, by and large, have less of the receptors in their head than adults do in order to capture that coronavirus. Okay. So they're just not doing it. It's so are there some out there? I mean, we've got a headline where it says 85 babies in Texas tested positive. Yeah. Over what period of time it failed to tell you that. And well, and even the public health director said currently, currently, and not true. And also where? Where? See, I keep catching flak because in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California, the flare-ups are happening at the border because you still have people who are coming over. They're basically medical tourists who are coming across. Yeah, people who are coming across back and forth. There are American citizens. There are American citizens who choose to live in Mexico because it's cheaper. Yeah. And they come across the Rio Grande every day to go to work into America. Now, what do you do when the when the COVID crisis is spiking? Right. How do you stop that? So you can't do it. It ain't a bandana around your face either. That ain't going to fix anything. So I know my thing tends to be an unpopular opinion with 50% of the people that are out there. And let me go on record to say I'm not anti masks. I say wear them. I wore one in the airport and people like I thought you were against masks. No, I'm for personal choice. You don't want to wear it? Don't wear it. But I think gate agents fault that the governor of this state has mandated that people wear masks in public. So what am I going to do? Bitch and her the whole time? Yeah, I'm not going to do that. Yeah. Well, as far as the schools go, you just hate to see the teachers unions running the show. Let me just it's not about the kids when it comes to the teachers union. And look, we have the T the TEA here in Texas, right? And the teachers unions at the end of the day are are the power brokers. They are the ones that create the whole thing. You responded on Twitter to a young lady who said, well, the state is recommending that we write out our wills. She's 24. She's 24 years old. I'm like, what are you leaving behind? What are you? I mean, I mean, my kaboodle. I mean, with my poly pockets in it. I mean, I don't mean to be facetious in insulting, but you're going to get there. I got to daughter your age. So yeah, I'll be a little condescending. Uh, what really, really, really, really 99.6% recovery rate. I think you're going to be just fine. I think you're going to be just 1.5 million people died last year of tuberculosis. Nobody talked about that. Where your mask? You didn't wear it in the flu season. And let me tell you another thing. These people want to say, well, my grandmother, my grandmother, oh, shut up. You smoked in the same car. We can grandmother for 30 years without even rolling down the window as a courtesy gesture.

All right, the Associated Press on yesterday announced that they will continue to keep the term white, lowercase in racial, ethnic, and cultural senses. Now, you probably, if you didn't see the other part of the story, you're thinking, well, duh, of course, they're going to keep the term white, lowercase because that's just how it's said. And why would you capitalize the word white? Well, they actually decided last month to capitalize the word black when used in racial, ethnic, and cultural senses. So black was capitalized. They've come out and said that white is not. Now, they're reasoning for the decision. See what sense you can make of this chat. There was a clear desire and reason to capitalize black. Most notably, people who are black have strong historical and cultural commonalities, even if they are from different parts of the world, and even if they now live in different parts of the world. That includes the shared experience of discrimination due solely to the color of one's skin. And there's less support for capitalizing white because white people do not generally share the same history and culture or the experience of being discriminated against because of skin color. Yeah, well, that's just not how the world works is it ask any Asian ask any Asian who spend any time in Asia. And they will tell you that race for them is a big deal. Japanese are not very welcome in the Philippines. Things World War II. They're not the best friends with the Chinese. They differentiate between different provinces and different villages. Now, I spent a good portion of my formative years in my 20s, not riding my will to go teach school, but I was in third world countries. I've said that over and over again until I'm blue in the face. Togo, Benin, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Nigeria, especially in West Africa. Now, you can go all over those places in Nigeria, which is the size of Oklahoma and Texas put together. It's a very big place. It's almost a subcontinent. I mean, it really is large. You go into Lagos, right? You can go up to Abumashaw. I spent a lot of time in Abumashaw. You can go over to Eku. You can go up to Joss. You can go to Abuja, which is the federal capital. You don't go to Canoo, though. Canoo. You don't even even the Nigerians in the south. Don't go to Canoo. You know why? Because that's in North Nigeria. North Nigeria is very Muslim and it's very very militant, very radical. And they hate the black Christians from the south. So it doesn't really matter about the nuances of your skin color, because if I showed you a Nigerian from Canoo, and then I showed you one from Abumashaw, you would say, they're both Nigerians. But they would say, go F yourself. We are not. And then they would cut your head off. But now the ones in the south probably wouldn't, but the ones in North definitely would. You don't go up there. So, let me just say that the New Testament was written in Greek with the exception of a few words, which are Aramaic. The Old Testament was written in the Hebrew language. Okay. I took both. I taught both. They do not. Now, yes, modern. We do use capitals, but in Koine, marketplace, Greek, which is what the New Testament was written in, there were no capital letters. So now, how many times do we talk about Jesus and as Him, capital H, I am or God, capital G, O D, or all of these different things we capitalize as a sign of respect and reverence didn't exist in the original text. It didn't exist. So tell me why the AP matters so much when I talk about a person that I have to emphasize the nuances of their skin color in order to respect them, because they must be so weak, they need to know that as a people, I respect them. I'm woke enough to respect them. It's ludicrous, it's insane, there's no making sense of it. And where this ends is history repeating itself with a whole lot of hate, a whole lot of hate, a whole lot of animosity, a whole lot of violence. And you can take the progress of the civil rights movement of the 60s and 70s and throw it all out the window. You can take the legacy of Malcolm X, Medgar Evers, and Martin Luther King Jr. and toss it out the window. Just go ahead and scrape them out of the history books while you scrape them things, because their influence doesn't matter anymore. I mean, it's true. We just talked about the Florida schools. This is what they're teaching your children. This is what they're going to teach your children. Black, capitalized, white, de-emphasized, and not capitalized, I guess. It's a crazy world we're living in today. All right, back in a minute. I thought you weren't just calling Black. It was being African American, right? Yes, I can't keep that. All right, yesterday's poll. If the election were held today, who do you think would win? This was, of course, yesterday. I put everyone on the spot and said, the election is held today. Gotten to your head. Who's going to win? 86% of you said Trump, followed by 9% of you who said Biden. Kanye coming in. 4.5%, almost 5% Kanye, who had a really unfortunate series of events last night on his Twitter that, I don't know, did you see this? A little bit. He had some deleted tweets and we're wishing Kanye all the best. Today's poll. He's passed it. I guarantee you by the day he's on to the next. Yeah, well, today's poll. Which vice presidential pick would be the biggest disaster for the Biden campaign? All right, biggest disaster. Kamala, Elizabeth Warren, Stacey Abrams, or Gretchen Whitmer. Gosh, that's a hard one. You got Stacey Abrams, but then you got Elizabeth Warren too. Yeah, Stacey Abrams. It'd be a night. Gretchen Whitmer, I mean, she is. Well, now, when you say it's you, it would be a nightmare. Would it be a nightmare for us? That's true. Whitmer, she's a little dictator, right? Yeah. And I don't trust Elizabeth Warren at all. I don't even think the Democrats in her state like Whitmer. Kamala Harris is a radical and then Stacey Abrams is a radical, but she's also inept. Yeah, she's just she's a failed. Yeah, I mean, why do you keep throwing somebody up there that can't? I mean, it's like better. Well, I'm just gonna say they have a knack for doing that. Loser. We'll see you tomorrow, guys. You're back. Thanks for listening to the news and why it matters.
