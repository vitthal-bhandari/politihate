Instead, we are broadcasting from my home. Actually, so if you hear screaming children in the background, that is because there is a hurricane that is currently hitting the state of Florida. The current status as of this morning was that this thing was trending from a cat four into maybe a cat five. It is likely to hit Orlando. It's likely to hit the panhandle. It really is kind of hitting the middle to the upper end of the state. We are not in that part of the state, but the sort of dirty side of the storm is hitting where we are. So that means that we didn't want too many of our employees coming into work today because obviously it's not particularly safe on the roads. According to the Wall Street Journal, Ian Senser was forecast to approach the West Coast on Wednesday afternoon. The storm strengthened to a cat for Hurricane early Wednesday. It's expected to make landfall between Tampa and Fort Myers to shift south from the earlier forecast that puts a lot of people directly in harm's way. Almost 2.5 million people are under an evacuation order. Right now, the latest forecast say that the storm surge could be the highest up to 12 feet from Naples to the Sarasota region. If what happened in Cuba is any sort of indicator, things could get extremely rough. Cuba's entire electrical grid was knocked out on Tuesday night. And this thing is strengthening as it enters Florida. It's going to essentially hover over Florida, apparently, for the next 72 hours or so. According to the latest tracking models, it's not going to actually come off the East Coast of Florida until basically midday on Thursday. So one of the problems here is that it's not ripping through particularly quickly. It's really taking its time to move over the state. It's going to cause extraordinary loss of property. We'll see how many lives it costs. Now, normally in these situations, when you have a natural disaster, everybody sort of comes together no matter your political persuasion. Unfortunately, we now live in a country where this is no longer the case because the governor of Florida is Ron DeSantis. This means that he's very good and no bad. So look for very hot takes from the media about how this is all Ron DeSantis's fault, both because of global warming and also because Ron DeSantis is a very bad man. There's sort of pagan element that has taken over the radical left that suggests that things like COVID, natural disasters, this is actually some sort of divine revenge for right-wing governance, but only when it strikes a right-wing area, when it strikes a left-wing area, then we don't know why such a thing would happen. When it strikes a right-wing area, it must be because the gods of COVID have descended or because the hurricanes have decided to punish Ron DeSantis or some such nonsense. The reality is, of course, a natural disaster is a natural disaster and thoughts, prayers, resources all need to go toward the people who are directly in the path of this thing. Ron DeSantis yesterday, the governor of Florida, he warned of the conditions across the state. Schools across the state have been shut down. People are staying home. He was warning people if you're directly in the pathway of the storm to get out as fast as possible. Here was the governor yesterday. There's still uncertainty with where that exact landfall will be, but just understand the impacts are going to be far, far broader than just where the eye of the storm happens to make landfall. In some areas, there will be catastrophic flooding and life-threatening storm surge. And so if you're on Florida's Gulf Coast from Naples all the way through the Tampa Bay Area and some of the counties north of that, that could be something that happens and it will certainly happen in some parts of Florida's Gulf Coast. Meanwhile, the president of the United States said that his administration was on alert to help the people of Florida. He was president Biden yesterday. My administration is on alert and in action to help the people of Florida have approved Florida's request for emergency assistance immediately upon receiving it from the governor when they get received it. And I directed my team to surge federal assistance there before the storm hit. FEMA has already deployed 700 personnel in Florida and the governor has activated 5,000 state National Guard with another 2,000 guards coming from other states. There was some controversy yesterday given the fact that President Biden for most of yesterday had not called governor DeSantis, which is not the usual procedure. Normally the first person you call and there is a hurricane about to hit a state is the governor of that state. According to the New York Post, President Biden called three Florida mayors on Tuesday. As Sarah Kane Ian, near Florida's west coast hours before reaching out to Republican governor Ron DeSantis. Apparently he first spoke with Tampa Mayor Shane Castro, St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch, Clearwater Mayor Frank Hibert, Castro and Walter Democrats, Hibert is a Republican. The president waited a fairly long time to call. This prompted the FEMA administrator to have to go on national television and explain why Joe Biden had not called Ron DeSantis as of yet. As we say, Biden corrected that late afternoon after there was enormous blowback for him not calling Ron DeSantis because the two obviously are political rivals. Here was the FEMA administrator trying to explain this away. We've made conversations with the mayors. So is there any reason why not the governor? Again, we have a strong team that's in place supporting the governor right now working side by side with him and his staff will continue to stay engaged with us. That would be avoiding the question. Obviously Joe Biden was under pressure to call DeSantis. So in fact, he did call DeSantis again. This is like baseline baseline sort of stuff. Apparently, according to the White House, press secretary, Karina Champier, the steps the federal government is taking to help Florida prepare for Hurricane Ian were discussed. The president and governor committed to continue close coordination. This is not the first time that DeSantis has handled some sort of crisis in his state, but a crisis of this magnitude is a completely different beast. Obviously, in Florida, we've had the Surfside building collapse where a couple of hundred people were killed when buildings on the beach just fell down, literally just fell down. And governor DeSantis handled that very well. This, however, is a major hurricane and is going to cause complete chaos in the state because again, you're talking about a hurricane that's essentially the size of Hurricane Katrina, because it's trending toward a cat five as it nears very, very populated areas. Now, this has not stopped the media from immediately jumping into. Let's discuss this through a political lens because this is what they do, of course. So one member of the media tried to say to Rhonda, he had not actually prepped for the hurricane, which of course is really silly. DeSantis has been warning for days. I mean, even before I went into the holiday of Roshana, they were warnings from DeSantis and the governor's team about if you're in the path of the hurricane, get ready to leave, make sure that you baton down. The hatches make sure that you have all the resources necessary. A media member tried to go after DeSantis on this yesterday and DeSantis just glock him. I'm an administrator, Chris Wells said today that she acknowledged concerns that of Florida's as we said, lacks response to the storm so far. And that give me a break. That is nonsense. Stop politicizing. Okay, stop it. We declared a state of emergency when this thing wasn't even formed. We've had people in here, you've had counties doing, they've done a lot of hard work. And and honestly, you're trying to attack me, I get, but like you're attacking these other people who've worked very hard. And so so that's just totally false. I don't think we've ever certainly since I've been governor declared a state emergency this early, we made sure that we were very inclusive with it. We said that there was a lot of uncertainty. And then we've worked to make sure the preparations that have been done and all the stuff you talk to the people at the counties when they've needed something stuff gets there very quickly because of what Kevin and his team have done. And the members of the media, homo radical are doing exactly what you would think they would be doing MSNBC's Joy Reid, who's one of the worst people in all of media, she suggested that this is going to test Rhonda Tantis. After all, he's a bad, bad Republican man, who's bad. There was Joy Reid yesterday. Florida prepares for a monster storm with land ball expected tomorrow. Governor Ron DeSantis is going to be quick to the test for us to actually do his job. When he's used to spending most of his time hanging out on Fox News and owning the libs, is he up to the task? It's just unbelievable. I'm sorry, Rhonda Tantis has an approval rating well above 50%. In the state, he's going to win reelection in a walk come November. Any governor who's in charge of a major state in the middle of a natural disaster is put to the test. The notion that Rhonda Tantis' chief mode of governance in Florida has been to go on Fox News is an absurdity. But it is pure Joy Reid to suggest, of course, that this is really the first time that Rhonda Tantis has ever been put to the test. Meanwhile, Tom Lemon over on Tiana tried to do the routine that we frequently hear with regard to global warming, which is anytime there's a singular weather event that is really out of the box and kind of crazy, whether it's a freeze in Texas or whether it's a large hurricane about Teotampa. We hear people in the media immediately jump to this must be due to climate change and global warming. Now, here is the deal of climate change and global warming. You cannot trace any single weather event to climate change. It's not possible. Everybody, every climatologist will tell you this is not climate denial. This is simple fact. Climate is whether over a large period of time, any single weather event cannot be traced to a singular trend. There is just no way to do that. But members of the media, because all they do all day is just respond to headlines. What they like to do is if there is a singular weather event, they immediately start saying, well, this is because of global warming. I live in Florida. Up until now, this is an extraordinarily calm hurricane season. There's literally nothing up until now. And last year was a pretty calm hurricane season. In fact, what the data tends show is that there's very little correlation between the frequency of hurricanes and global warming entirely. When it comes to the amount of damage done by hurricanes, that has been going down fairly consistently. If it goes up, it's typically because the hurricane is hitting a very populated area. So people build directly in the path of a hurricane, then the damage numbers go up. But that has little to it is called the target effect. It has very little to do with the intensity of the hurricanes. 300 years ago, if a cat five hurricane hit Florida, it hit like seven people. Today, if a cat five hurricane hits Florida, it's going to hit three, four million people. So, obviously, the amount of damage is going to go up, even if the frequency of the hurricanes is the same or lower or the intensity is the same or lower. But people in the media don't actually want to give you the truth about what global warming does and what can be traced to global warming. So instead, what they point out is that when there is a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, for example, and it moves over warm water, it tends to intensify. And so because of global warming, that means that the water is warmer. So that means that the hurricane is more intense. The question is more intense than what, because that water has been warm for a very, very long time in human history. The Gulf of Mexico has been known for its warm waters for pretty much as long as we've known about the Gulf of Mexico. And beyond that, there is no actual there's no actual data demonstrating that hurricanes are becoming more frequent. Anyway, put all that aside. Don Lemon thinks that he knows things. So there's this extraordinarily funny exchange last night on CNN, Don Lemon had on the NOAA administrator. Okay, this is the actual this person works for Joe Biden's administration ahead of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Okay, and and Don Lemon decided to ask him about global warming. And it didn't go amazing for Don Lemon. Here was a here was Don Lemon. Listen, I just I'm just trying to get that you said you want to talk about climate change. But what what effect does climate change have on this phenomenon that that is happening now, because it seems these storms are intensifying. That's a question. I don't think you can link climate change to any one event on the whole on the cumulative climate change may be making storms worse. But to link it to any one event, I would caution against them. Okay, listen, I grew up there and these storms are intensifying something is causing them to intensify. I gotta say that's really, really funny. So just to get that straight, that was the NOAA administrator saying what I said, right? You can't trace any singular weather events to global warming. And Tom and Don Lemon's like, yes, but I am from Florida. And this is worse than it was when I was a kid. That's I'm sorry, that that is not actual data, Don. Okay, you know, when you were a kid, all the adults looked enormous. That doesn't mean that the adults got smaller as you got older. Like, it's so stupid. This is how members of our media treat childhood members like, well, you know, when I was a kid, it used to snow even harder. I mean, I remember the snow drips being like eight feet tall, right? Zero, two and a half feet tall. That would be the reason, right? These are the people who love the science. Okay, so bottom line, you know, all of this don't follow any of the politicization. There's going to be an extraordinarily large scale attempt to preemptively claim that Ron DeSantis is botched the hurricane. Because I remember when they did the St. George W. Bush, the hurricane Katrina, that was really botched by state and local authorities. The problem was that the local authorities in New Orleans were Democrats. The governor was Democrat, but George W. Bush was Republican. So it became a national issue. And so on this one, watched through the media to immediately spin into Ron DeSantis is a terrible person. It's all his fault. If somebody got killed in Tampa, it was Ron DeSantis didn't nuke the hurricane or something. Like that is where this is going. So just be on the lookout for that sort of media coverage because it is just inaccurate. And in the meantime, if you're a decent person, pray for the people who are actually in the path of a major hurricane that likely will be tearing roofs off buildings and harming a great number of people. And if you have it in your in your budget to give some charity, do that to you. That would be an actual useful thing that you can do over the next 72 hours as opposed to watching the dollars over CNN and MSNBC blame Ron DeSantis for a natural disaster that is rather actually frequent when it comes to the Gulf Coast. Okay. Meanwhile, over in Virginia, the Democrats are fighting mad. They're fighting mad because Glenn Youngkin is actually keeping one of his promises. One of his promises is that he is not going to allow transgender policy to change how children go to school. So what he means by this is that he is no longer going to allow people who simply identifies a member of the opposite sex to walk into the bathrooms at public schools. And this follows hot on the heels of a story that was largely broken by the daily wire, in which a student dressed in a skirt allegedly went into a girl's bathroom and sexually assaulted a girl. And so, and then was told by the school board and loud and counted the sort of stuff never happened to give transgender bathrooms. It really is no problem whatsoever. So Glenn Youngkin has now changed the policy and he has gone back to the original policy, which until the last five minutes was considered not only normal, but perfectly logical that boys should go peepee in the boys room and girls should go peepee in the girls room and that boys should not go peepee in the girls room just because they say that they are boys and that girls should not go peepee in the boys room because they're not capable of using the urinal. I mean, like this is this is really not difficult stuff, but apparently it's now driving outsized outrage. So according to BuzzFeed News, students at almost 100 schools in Virginia on Tuesday participated in walkouts to protest. A proposed policy put forward by Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin that would heavily restrict the rights of transgender students and how about the rights of girls not to be in a bathroom with a teenage boy. That seems like a pretty big right, but apparently no, no rights privacy for girls who actually would like to go to the bathroom in peace that a teenage boy in there saying he's a girl. No, no, they have no rights. It's only this particular set of people who apparently has rights. Under the new policy, parents would be given the decision making power about whether their child expresses a gender that differs with their child's sex while at school and what pronouns their child uses at school because this is the other part of the policy left really objects to the left with like to kidnap your children and allow the teachers at the NEA to explain to your kids that they actually are a member of the opposite sex to socially transition them at school and to never tell you. This is the left actual position. Hey, this is the position of people who are opposing young kids policy because all young kids policy says is that if a kid comes to school and says, I'm Bob, but I'd like to be called Jill, that you have to call the parents and tell them. Apparently, this is very bad according to the left. You should socially transition them at school. And if you refuse to socially transition them, then this means the ervegett and you should definitely not tell the parents because you never know Bob, Michael, home and mom and dad might take out the belt. So the teachers are your real parents. Randy Winegarten is really your parent. Horrific childless Randy Winegarten who again is her relationship to children over the past couple of years has been to simply prevent them from going to school and wreck their lives and force them to wear masks at two years old. She should be in charge of your children. That is the person who matters most of all. The proposal says that a student's legal name and sex cannot be changed without an official legal document or court order, which makes a lot of sense. You can't just come in and tell the teachers one day that you wish to be called G-GIM and your new name will be trans-dinosaur and they just start calling you that stuff. Instead, you actually have to go through a legal process to change your name. You would in a normal country. And the policy says that teachers and other school officials must refer to each student using only the pronouns appropriate to the sex appearing in the student's official record. In other words, if the student comes in and says, I'm a G-GIM and the teacher looks at you and your boy, the teacher is perfectly well of an his right and should in fact call you he him. Transgender students would also be forced to use school facilities that match the sex assigned to them at birth. So the original policy from Democratic Governor Ralph Nordam who is quite fond of the idea that abortion should be allowed up to and including apparently after birth allowed schools to let students use their chosen names and pronouns that reflect their gender identity without needing any legal documentation. So a bunch of these students walked out. All that's happening right here is that a bunch of teachers work for the NEA decided to rabble rouse among the students. Then the students are like, hey, I get out of class. This is how protests work by the way when you're in high school. Very few of these students are really, really involved with these issues. The number of trans students in Virginia is vanishingly low. But if you can get a teacher to excuse you from class, are you going to go or you're not going to go? You're going to stay in class and do your math homework or are you actually going to walk out of the school and pretend that your social justice warrior? According to BuzzFeed news, so often in issues around education, students are excluded from the conversation, especially queer students. Yes, if there's one thing we know about America is that LGBTQ people don't get enough media coverage. They've totally been excluded from the conversation. They're utterly silent and are in our media landscape. This is according to 17 year old Casey Calabia who helped organize and participate in the walkout on Tuesday. Getting this opportunity to have people listen to what we have to say all across Virginia is really imperative to making sure we're not excluded from conversations that will quite literally change our day to day lives more than just one second. But first, did you know that thread count is a myth? Turns out it doesn't matter how many threads or sheets have if they are not the best quality threads possible.

You may have noticed that the economy seems to be on the tipping point lately. We are probably already in a recession. We already have massive inflation. But if you haven't looked over your budget in a while to see how you can save on your bills, you really should, especially because you may have racked up that credit card debt and that can just eat you alive.

Now, it is not just a bunch of foolish youngsters who are walking out of class to protest this or their teachers as pushed by the National Education Association of the American Federation of Teachers run by people again like Randy Winegard. It is also the actual White House of the United States. And this is the important thing to remember when it comes to social policy of the left of the United States. It is promoted at the most radical levels by the most radical people with the most radical power. You're talking about the presence of the United States promoting the idea that if your 15 year old girl goes to school and she's gender confused for any reason whatsoever because she's been watching TikTok. She goes to school and she says, I wish to be treated as member of the opposite text. All of the teachers, all the other students should be forced to say that she is a boy and parents should not be told about this because after all, the parents might be, this is like the policy of the White House in the United States. And here's Korean Jean Pierre saying just that yesterday. Students across Virginia today walked out of their classroom to protest the governors, the guidelines restricting the rights of transgender students. Does the White House support their students? We believe and he believes transgender youth should be allowed to be able to go to school freely, to be able to express themselves freely, to be able to have the protections that they need to be who they are. Again, I have not seen these reports, but I can, we can say with all confidence and you all know have covered him for some time. When it comes to this community, he is a partner and he is a strong ally. Okay, so parents should not be part of the conversation. Teachers, Joe Biden should be your old grandpa telling you that you're actually a member of the opposite sex. Glenn Youngkin, new governor of Virginia elected on precisely this basis. Glenn Youngkin, he came back at this pretty easily. He's like, so basically you're saying you want to cut parents out of the loop. If you're against the guidelines, it means you're against having parents involved in students' lives. And I don't think that's where Virginia is. Virginia spoke loudly last year in our election that parents were really important to have involved in kids' lives. And so I think this is a chance for us to reflect, please read the guidelines and then work towards making sure that we do include parents in these fundamentally important decisions. Okay, but the fact is that our elite case in the United States, they actually just believe that they should be able to run the social policy top down. And this isn't just true for social policy, it's obviously true for economic policy as well. The only problem is they've botched it every way it is possible to botch this thing. So on the domestic front, obviously, you've seen the federal reserve keep those in these inflation rates incredibly high by keeping the interest rates incredibly low for far too long. And this has now led them to have to ramp up those interest rates really fast. And this means, of course, that we are likely to see a significantly harder landing than would otherwise be the case. And they're going to have to ramp it up even faster according to Susan Collins, the new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Wall Street Journal reporting. She said she is committed to bringing inflation down to 2% even if it means slowing the economy. Collins, in her first public remarks, was Boston Fed leader said Monday she supported further interest rate increases as projected by federal reserve officials last week. They showed the central bank raising aggressively through next year's by rising fears of an economic slowdown or recession. She said in a speech prepared for delivery Monday at the greater Boston Chamber of Commerce quote, accomplishing price stability will require slower employment growth and a somewhat higher unemployment rate. Returning inflation to target will require further tightening of monetary policy. She said history has shown price stability is a precondition to achieving maximum employment over the medium and longer term. This, of course, is exactly right. The only problem is that this would have been completely unnecessary if it hadn't been for the Federal Reserve botching this thing and for the Biden administration, pouring money, just pouring it almost physically into the American economy. Meanwhile, home prices have started to dump. So this increase in interest is starting to bite in the economy. We've seen these the fastest slowdown in home pricing in I think my lifetime at this point, actually, according to the Wall Street Journal, US home prices slid in July from June, the first month of the decline in years of the way to sign that higher mortgage rates are starting to weigh on home prices in many of the country's biggest markets. Home prices are still rising on a year over year basis. Even though the pace of growth has slowed, the national index rose 15.8% in the year that ended in July down from an 18.1% month, housing economists expect home price growth to slow significantly by the end of the year. July's report reflected forceful declarations and Craig Lazaro managing director at S&P Dow Jones indices as the Federal Reserve continues to move interest rates upward. Mortgage financing has become significantly more expensive. We now have mortgage rates that in many cases are exceeding 7%. A year ago is 2%, 3%. We're talking about historic lows. Now we're talking about highs that we haven't seen in most of my lifetime. So the experts are doing an amazing job. Larry Summers who was warning about all this former Clinton Treasury Secretary, he said yesterday, listen, a hard landing is extremely likely at this point. Neil said that unless we get a miracle on the supply side, unless we get a lot of happy news on the supply side, it's likely to be a hard landing. I think that's right. And I don't know what reason there is for thinking that we're going to get some kind of sudden major increase in productivity. I supported the inflation reduction act and a number of other steps that are directed at strengthening the economy's potential. But none of those policies have serious arguments associated with them that they're going to produce huge supply side benefits quickly. Okay, well, with all of that said, the administration's take on this is not that they actually are going to get things under control. So they're going to blame Vladimir Putin. Now, as I've said before, if you are not a fan of Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine is pretty much everybody's not a fan of Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. The stupidest thing you could do to undermine that, the support for the pushback is to blame all economic problems on that invasion, because that would obviously suggest that the way to bring those economic problems to an end would become to a negotiated agreement, which by the way, may be correct, but that's not the position of this administration. So Tony Blinken, the secretary of state, he continues to suggest that all economic problems on planet Earth are basically due to the Russian war in Ukraine, which is not true. Okay, just on a on a fiscal level, it is not true. We had massive inflation in the run up to the war in Ukraine. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated a lot of those problems, but it doesn't matter whether it's true or not. What matters to Tony Blinken and the Biden administration is finding someone to blame who is not the experts, who is not them. We saw the aggression, the threat of the aggression mounting from Russia against Ukraine last year. We warned the world about it, and we tried everything possible to avert it through diplomacy. Unfortunately, tragically, President Putin pursued his aggression nonetheless. And now the Ukrainian people, but also the world, are reaping the consequences. We're seeing the consequences and everything from rising food insecurity to the energy prices that we've talked about. So it's profoundly in everyone's interest for Russia to stop its aggression. Okay, well, you can lecture Russia as much as you want. But the fact is that Russia is not going to stop this unless they have some sort of off-ramp. So once again, the experts are wrong. Okay, the experts keep saying that the harder we push Russia here, the better it's going to be. The reality is that some off-ramp is going to have to be provided at some point here, or things are going to get an awful lot worse. Vladimir Putin right now, he has staked, his entire legacy on not completely losing the war in Ukraine, which means he is threatening tactical battlefield nuclear weapons. He is also calling up a million reservists, and people are trying to leave the country to avoid being called up are now being arrested. Meanwhile, Russia yesterday ran a sham referendum in the areas that it annexed, in which it essentially claimed these are now parts of Russia. According to the Wall Street Journal, Russia is set to formally annex occupied territories in Ukraine after staging referendum that involved coercion, threats, and in some places, soldiers going door to door and forcing people to vote at gunpoint. One of the things that I always find really funny about these force votes is if you're going to do a force vote, shouldn't you at least give it the appearance that is contested? And why bother having a vote if the results are going to be 99% in favor of annexation? Like why do you even bother doing that? It makes no sense at all. If you're trying to fake an election to make it look as though you're going through some sort of democratic process, when you'd be like, that's a 63-37 result, instead they're like, what if we go 99% in favor of annexation? Then everyone will believe that it was a free and fair election. Kiva and Western governments have described the voters a sham designed to confer a be near of legitimacy to Moscow's seizure of Ukrainian land seven months on from its invasion. They could also enable Moscow to claim any effort by Ukrainian forces to recapture the territories amounts to an attack on Russia itself. That would be the idea is that now you've invaded Russia because we claim this territory and so we're going to come in. We're going to re-invade into Ukraine because you're now the aggressors. Residents in the occupied areas that Russian soldiers compelled them to vote guns drawn and a choreographed show of support for Moscow's plan to make their regions part of Russia. They said some Russian sympathizers were brought in from other regions to cast their votes at polling places to create the impression that it was in fact a regular vote. The official results ended on Tuesday afternoon and again, basically 100% support. According to official results, 93% of voters in Russian controlled parts of the Zaparigia region checked the box and paper joining Russia in Wuhanski it was 91% and Harrison it was 87%. Yeah, man, those are not real results obviously but none of that matters. What really matters here is that Russia continues to make aggressive moves. Meanwhile, things are getting extraordinarily dicey over in Europe with regards to oil and natural gas supplies going into the winter. Very mysterious and bizarre circumstances happening with the Nord Stream pipeline. According to the New York Times, explosions under the Baltic Sea and the rupture of major natural gas pipelines from Russia to Germany appeared to be a deliberate attack officials across Europe said on Tuesday deepening uncertainty about European energy security and ensuring prices and fears of burning short of fuel over the winter. This is so weird because again, Russian controls Nord Streams one and two. So if they wish to simply shut off the gas as they've done before they could or maybe they just don't want to be fined by the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund or something and so they're faking it. But it's really unclear at this point why exactly they would blow up their own pipelines but that seems to be the going theory in Western circles is that it is not in fact a Ukraine attack or an American attack that it's somehow a Russian attack on their own pipelines get very strange scenario. According to the New York Times, three separate leaks erupted from both Nord Stream one and two which were already caught up in the conflict over Russia's invasion of Ukraine sending swirling seams of methane to the surface of the waters off Denmark and Sweden. Tap Polish and Ukrainian officials blame Moscow, Russian state media suggested US or Ukrainian involvement. Denmark's prime minister, Mattet Fredrickson told reporters while on a trip to Poland to open a new undersea pipeline that will carry Norwegian gas. It's hard to imagine that it's accidental on Tuesday evening. Jake Sullivan, the president's national security adviser called the incident apparent sabotage in a tweet again unclear exactly why Russia would sabotage its own pipelines. They've done this sort of thing only in the sense that they've suggested, oh, we had a pipeline breakdown. Oops, not our fault. Oh, that's so sad. You don't have your gas. Oh, that's that's too bad. It's possible they're doing this again. But again, if Russia really wants to essentially broaden its word to Europe, there's no reason for them to actually break the pipeline. Apparently Nord Stream two had never gone into service. So it really didn't have any immediate effect on the oil supply. Nord Stream one has been shut down since August. But the leaks hammered home the message to the Europe and its energy infrastructure are vulnerable, even if Europe succeeds in its mission of weaning itself off of Russian energy. The CIA had warned in June that Nord Stream pipelines could be attacked. They declined to say that warning identified Russia as a possible attacker. They had reached no conclusion about who's responsible. Bottom line is things aren't going to get a lot more dicey in this region.

Meanwhile, these same experts who have presided over record inflation, they've presided over the slowing of the economy, they've presided over the blowing out of the Western debt, and they're presiding over radical increases in energy prices. They continue to maintain that the most important thing in the world for Western citizens is climate change. They continue to pretend that this is a thing. So Janet Yellen, who apparently may be on her way out the secretary of the treasury, formerly a not particularly good federal reserve president, she says that climate change is the biggest threat to everyone on the planet, a climate. Let me touch on the risks of climate change to our economy. Of course, unmitigated climate change is an existential threat to everyone on our planet. In a world that continues to warm, regions that are prosperous today may eventually become unsuited for productive economic activity. In many regions, human mortality is projected to rise and labor productivity to fall with the size of the impacts depending on the degree of warming. So again, they're just going to continue to push on climate change. Now, the general publics in these areas, I have a question, general publics in Europe, in the United States, are we supposed to believe that the top issue for these publics right now are things like transing the children, climate change, blowing out the spending and handing it over to experts. Is this really the thing that we're supposed to believe? Because it's not true. It turns out that we had elite global left wing rule during COVID and people didn't like it. They didn't like it so much that one of the most popular people on the world scene just into our Dern, who is the New Zealand Prime Minister. You'll remember her as the great heroine of COVID. Everybody on the left in the media, they suggested she was amazing because she shut down the island where the hobbits are. And she said that no one could come in and that no one could go out. And then she stopped death, except that she didn't vaccinate anybody. And so when COVID actually hit the island, there were some people who actually did that, well, now just send to our Dern. She continues to call for social media crackdowns because it turns out that left is when people are actually made aware of its consequences. People don't like it very much. So here was our Dern yesterday suggesting that she needs social media crackdowns. So combine all of these issues, climate change. She said, by the by this is the reason, by the way, she says that there ought to be social media crackdowns. So people can't freely discuss issues surrounding climate change. Because if you're going to transform the world economy on the basis that over the next 100 years, the climate is going to warm somewhat slightly, then you have to be like, if that's how you're going to, you do need to shut down the free speech mechanisms because no one is going to buy that. Here was just send to our Dern, New Zealand Prime Minister and great heroine of the left. This week we launched an initiative alongside companies and nonprofits to help improve research and understanding of how a person's online experiences are curated by automated processes. This will also be important in understanding more about mis and disinformation online, a challenge that we must as leaders address. I can say with complete certainty that we cannot ignore it. To do so poses an equal threat to the norms we all value. After all, how do you successfully end a war if people are led to believe the reason for its existence is not only legal but noble? How do you tackle climate change if people do not believe it exists? How do you ensure the human rights of others are upheld when they are subjected to hateful and dangerous rhetoric and ideology? Ah, so just shut down free speech. You'll notice that on the back of bad policy always comes the call to shut down free speech. Just send to our Dern again, remember a year and a half ago, she was the greatest hero of the West. CNN would play clips of her, MSNBC would play clips of her. They're not playing clips of her now because she's about to lose an election. According to one news in New Zealand, Labor leader Justin Ardern has remained steady in her preferred prime minister rating, but Nationals Christopher Luxon is is he's dipped a little bit. It doesn't matter because the national party is now outranking Labor. The national party is a 37% labor is at 34%. In the party results, again, national with the ACT has a plurality. Labor with the Green Party is coming in second right now. So this means that translated to seats, Justin Ardern does not end up in the majority here. So that this unbelievably popular left-wing politician is now not particularly popular. It turns out that people basically left-wing governance. It's essentially like a temporary high. It's like you took a pill. They have a temporary high and everything feels amazing. And then the come down in the morning is just brutal. And people are reacting to that. And that is what you're seeing internationally. So now you're starting to see a reaction internationally. As we will talk about in a second, the reaction to the reaction is that everybody who doesn't like left-wing governance is a fascist. This is the way this works. But internationally speaking, what we are watching is a right-wing move, a right-wing nationalist move. And this is across the board. So one of the figures who is now leading this is the new prime minister of Italy, a woman in Georgia Maloney. So Maloney is not in fact a fascist. There's an attempt to paint her as such. She is not. Georgia Maloney is the head of the brothers of Italy. They carry 26% of the vote in Italy. The other conservative parties brought the total up to 44%. So she is the undisputed leader of a conservative coalition. They'll have a majority in Italy's new parliament. The media immediately, because this is what they do. Her main pitch, this is the pitch that she's making. It's making her popular with right-wingers in the United States. Her pitch is family, God country, things that the right has been castigated for in the United States. People on the left are, of course, calling her Benito Mussolini. So what exactly makes her Benito Mussolini? Well, here is a clip of Georgia Maloney speaking in 2019 at a conference about family. And let's just say that there are a lot of people across the world who are not on board with the climate change, open borders, trans to children agenda of the international left. And she speaks pretty well for a lot of those people. She says, this is about what we are doing here today. Why is the family an enemy? Why is the family frightening? There's a single answer to all these questions because it defines us, because it is our identity. Because everything that defines us is now an enemy. For those who would like us to no longer have an identity and simply be perfect consumers lay it. So they attack national identity, they attack religious identity, they attack gender identity, they attack family identity. I can't find myself as Italian Christian woman mother, no. I must be a citizen at gender, at parent one, parent two. I must be a number. Because when I'm only a number, when I no longer have an identity or roots, then I will be the perfect slave at the mercy of financial speculators. The perfect consumer. That's the reason why. We inspire so much fear. That's why this invent, inspire so much fear. Because we do not want to be numbers, we'll defend the value of the human being. Every single human being, because each of us has a unique genetic code that is unrepeatable. And like it or not, that is sacred. We will defend it. We will defend God, country and family. Those things that discuss people so much, we'll do it to defend our freedom. Because we will never be slaves and simple consumers of the mercy of financial speculators. That is our mission. That's why I came here today. She quotes GK Chesterton, famous British conservative. She says, fires will be kindled to testify that two and two make four sores will be drawn to prove that leaves are green in summer. That time has arrived. We are ready. Thank you. Okay. So this speech went completely viral on the right for a reason. Now when she's talking about the attack on family, the attack on traditional rules and institutions, people all over the West resonate to that. Now her little spin there, that the reason that people are doing this is because there's sort of a global capitalist order that is driving people to be individualist consumers. That is a very sort of fundamentalist, integralist idea that is taken root on parts of the nationalist right. But she also happens to be a fan of tax cuts and more financial freedom. And it only because Italy is heavily, heavily regulated. So again, you cannot hold by the idea of individual property rights. And also that those individual property rights must be undergirded by institutions that promote virtue. That is actually the theory of Adam Smith, Adam Smith, arch capitalist, right? He is the person who wrote before Wealth of Nations a theory of moral sentiments, right? Which is all about the idea that morality has to actually undergird the markets in order for the markets to properly work. All right, you guys, we have run out of time. We're going to be getting into a lot more including the left's reaction to the right's reaction, namely, everyone we don't like is a fascist. You're not going to want to miss it.
