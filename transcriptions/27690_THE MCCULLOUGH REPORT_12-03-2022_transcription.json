Our soul, the challenges of a generation call out. Future generations hang in the balance. We choose liberty. This is the voice of a nation. The Venetian. The Venetian. Now, Malcolm. I mean, many of us would think we'd come to the end of this pandemic and more of an endemic stage. A lot of people are struggling with long COVID. And what are the results of that? A lot of questions come in here about long, long haul as COVID syndrome. Because of the impact in our bodies and so much we still don't know about this. But one of the things just recently and Dr. McCullough was there with a group of other folks. In Pennsylvania actually, the Capitol Bill in Harrisburg. Very interesting in a event they had. There was a study I want to touch on and start here about the messenger RNA. And the fact that from what we're seeing from this study is it stays in the body far longer. Dr. McCullough says here, it shows the messenger RNA is in the lymph nodes. Months after the vaccine has been received, this is proven. The vaccines are not leaving the body. It's found in the lymph nodes at 60 days. The thought in the FDA briefing book was that these vaccines were going to be in the body for a day or two. And that is a fact. That's all. That's what I keep saying. That's what they keep saying. General immunity and then beyond Dr. McCullough says here. So I want to start there and talk about this messenger RNA. Let's bring on Dr. Peter McCullough now. This is our 16th Q&A here. Dr. McCullough is an academic internist cardiologist, epidemiologist from Dallas, Texas. I don't think anybody actually even needs to know your bio anymore. Everybody knows that on the planet you've been, you certainly have become a media icon at this point. I'll tell you, you spend more time on the camera and the mic. It's incredible. People really appreciate your commitment to all of this. But what do you say about the messenger RNA and the fact that now what the study is showing? Well, it's great to be back on the other side of the microphone. And no doubt about it, Malcolm. I've given over two dozen public programs, either myself or in teams for lawmakers, doctors, and then big public programs. The most important part of the program, people wait for hours is the Q&A. And that's what we're doing today. The update on the biology of the messenger RNA vaccines is not good. In a paper from Holkin and colleagues, they've demonstrated now in tissue that the messenger RNA vaccines are in the lymph nodes and other tissues at least 60 days after receiving the vaccine. These should be out of the body. They should not have this type of durability. The nucleoside analog caps on the three prime and five prime end of the messenger RNA appear to be very resistant to breakdown. Paper by Tony Caragoclas and myself, two of them, ahead of the Holkin finding suggested this based on the biochemistry of it. Now we learn very important paper. Marcus Alden, student in Malmo University in Malmo, Sweden, demonstrated that the Pfizer vaccine through a reverse transcript is called line one, reverse transcribes. And in fact, the DNA code that matches the Pfizer messenger RNA is installed into human chromatin. Now this needs to be verified. It needs to be confirmed. They were able to show 444 base pairs, what's called the amplicon. But many experts I've talked to have said, listen, it's right in the middle of the code, almost certainly the entire code of the spike protein for those who've taken the vaccine is now permanently installed in their DNA. And this was shown in human hepatic cell lines. And people are very uneasy about this finding, extremely uneasy. And it's now going to be probably a matter of verifying this, showing it independently. The next questions are, once this permanent installation happens, does the human body actually produce spike protein that in a sense attacks its own cells? The spike protein we know is dangerous, it shouldn't be in the body. And we certainly shouldn't have permanent code in our body, coding for this dangerous protein. Is it expressed under certain conditions like cancer or other diseases? Can the body handle this over time? And all I can tell people right now, there's so much biochemistry, more so out there. There are so many people saying, get this vaccine out of my body, how do I do it? I tell them, listen, the major thing is to not take a booster. We know the majority of Americans haven't. Do you know that anybody who's not taken a vaccine since October 1st is effectively unvaccinated? My back of the envelope calculation, Malcolm, is that 250 million out of the 330 million Americans that we have. 250 are effectively unvaccinated. The rates of vaccination right now, which basically means boosters going on in the United States, is the lowest of all time. Yeah. You know, I'm thinking as you say that, we could have done without all this drama, Dr. McCullough. Really, we could have truly, when we first talked to you and I, a couple of years back now on the COVID exercise here, if we had just reached for herd immunity and left all this, I mean, my God, the arm wrestling that's going on and the ridicule of people and the destroying of lives that is off the charts had they just stayed out of it, the political class, and left everybody the hell alone. I would suggest to you, we'd have heard immunity. We'd have been so far down the road. We would have been having any of these conversations. Now, that's just my opinion. Is that right or wrong? Three analysis agree with you. Subramanian, Campf and Beatty now suggest by real world data that the mass vaccination program has prolonged the pandemic and made it worse that we could have just got this over with, like SARS-1, and moved on in life. Instead, mass vaccination has backfired on the world big time. Thank you for saying that. I feel in my heart that is accurate, Peter. I really, really do that. What you say there is so, it's so real. It's destructive and it's really mind-boggling what's happened here. Let's get to some of these questions now here. Got a lot to do here on this Q&A. Heidi says, this is always my go-to place for current information on COVID without the sensationalizing influences of the media. Here you cut through the nonsense and get to the facts. Thank you. And that is the sentiment of a lot of people who appreciate these Q&As and the work that we have done here. And we hear you. We hear you, loud and clear. She says, I'm wondering about information on the new COVID strain, now found in all U.S. states, the BA2 or something like that. We have Delta back in June 2021 and had not taken the toxic jabs. We are in the hard-risk category and wonder if there is protection conferred by Delta for this new variant and what does that protection mean? Lesser risk of infection, shorter duration of illness, reduced severity, your thoughts. So Omicron is divided into two sub variants. The majority one that many of you had on the call today is BA1. That's standard Omicron. There is a second sub variant called BA2, which actually has some restoration of the code coding for the spike protein. It's called the S gene in the PCR primer. The BA2 variant is described as being slightly more infectious. But that's about it. The best we understand is if you've had Omicron, whether it's BA1 or BA2, you have full immunity across all of Omicron. And if you have immunity with Omicron, then you have back immunity against Delta. So right now, there's not much of an impetus for BA2 to take off and create a second curve since it's under the Omicron umbrella. Yeah. And I figured that was the case because I haven't heard anything about anything. And speaking of which, Dr. McConaughey, is there any indication beyond this BA2 or any signed at all, I'm guessing not, of any other kind of variant that's coming down, or is this thing now just come to the end of its run? We were following a variant described in a nursing home in Europe that looked like it was more lethal. That never really took off a hemorrhagic fever virus out of China. That hasn't taken off. Yeah, I can tell you, Malcolm, when things happen, the news cycle is so rapid that if there's going to be another variant that's going to fire up, we're going to see it. It becomes obvious. One thing I've learned is you don't have to look for it. It becomes obvious. Yeah. We've been following and talking with other experts about these other problems, like the hemorrhagic fever that you speak about, and the nip of virus and the mob bug and all of these things out of China, which is a whole nother story. We surely shouldn't be gaining a function in these laboratories, but that's another argument for another day. Some questions here. This one is from Alastair. My question is on the Novavax vaccine. There have been a lot of very concerned information come to light surrounding this new vaccine, which was sold to the public here in Australia as a more traditional protein-based vaccine. When in reality, it would appear it is not really the case. Could you explain the basic process used to create this vaccine and also comment on the speculated use of prions within it? Supposedly, the HIV-like prion called glycoprotein 120 previously used in HIV vaccines that has never been approved or commercialized in use within it. Okay. So the genetic code for the spike protein is known. And the unique approach that was taken by Novavax is basically to get a model, in this case, it's MOS, insect MOS model, to take that genetic code and produce the spike protein and then to harvest the spike protein. So it's an interesting approach. Harvest purified spike protein, again, loaded on a particle, what's called a matrix protein, and then injected into the body like a tetanus shot and they tested five micrograms or 25 micrograms, and it looks safe and effective with the legacy strains. Now, what's happened over time is Novavax could not provide assurances to the US FDA that they could make this in a consistent and clean fashion. They actually couldn't demonstrate good manufacturing capabilities. It's not uncommon for a new manufacturer. I was most enthusiastic about Novavax because it looked like it was free of systemic side effects. But when Omicron hit, the very first company to announce they're going to make a new vaccine was Novavax. So it looks like the Novavax vaccine will have effectively no coverage against Omicron. The Omicron spike protein is so sufficiently mutated away from the spike protein of the Novavax that we're out of luck. So at this point in time, many in Australia have looked at Novavax as well. This is a way for me to avoid a genetic vaccine. It's simply not going to cover the issue at hand. And I don't think anybody listening should take a vaccine to take the least injurious vaccine in order to have another three months of life and then take another vaccine. Yeah, that is the ultimate equation right there that you say. That's going to come up a few times on today's program. I'm certain we'll repeat what you just said. Let me say, I know Novavax just a moment so we can end a couple of these here. This one's from Jason. He's a 36 year old healthy male from Australia. He's been mandated to have two COVID vaccine shots to keep his job. And this is crazy stuff. I had COVID Delta late last year ended up in the ICU and not event for two days had plots on my lungs recovered. I'd take Closetin, NAC, Vitamin C, D, zinc on a dated basis. I followed Dr. McCullough's protocol. So with the mandate and the previous program, I heard Dr. McCullough talk about Novavax against this is where we want to correct the record a little bit, which is perfectly good. That's me talking now. He finishes and says, I went and got the first shot of Novavax a couple of days ago. No real side effects and I feel pretty good. Have I put myself in danger or should I get the second shot? I think it's dangerous. I've seen more than a few cases now where once they've had the respiratory illness and take the vaccine that the body's already loaded with spike protein. The last thing you want to do is give the body more spike protein, which is known to cause blood clots in its thrombogenic. I think it's a dangerous path to start going down. This reminded me there was a man. It's in the peer-reviewed published literature now where he took shot in one shot two of a genetic vaccine. Did find no side effects. Then he took shot number three and it was fatal. Wow. Everybody hear that. I mean, that's important because Dr. McCullough, a lot of people think if they take one or two, what the hell is the problem with the third one? Right? They don't think anything of it. That's crazy. Well, again, the snova vaccine is coming up a lot. And we have so many Australian listeners here. This one's from Kylie. Long time listener and follow-up. We have finally had no vax vaccine delivered to Australia. She used to be on a lot of safety data and the official government webpages are less than informative. Well, isn't that the case? My daughter has had a reaction to Pfizer. She's 17 years old. Heart issues, microditus and good old Australia will not give her an exemption for the vaccines. And it's like they want to kill people. That's me talking again. The question is, just wondering if there is anything Dr. McCullough has reported that on this that would be helpful to us. Well, I guess you're just seven minutes ago, didn't you? Yeah, I think once there's been heart damage with one shot, I think it's extraordinarily dangerous to take any second shot. The heart damage is caused by the spike protein. Nova vaccine giving the spike protein back to the human body, I think is dangerous. Yeah. So I'm glad we're flushing this all out now. This is so important, what we're speaking about right now. So I'm happy to get this right in the front of the program here. One last one on this from Sarah Jane. I know in the past, you said in theory, Nova Vax might be safer than non-MRNA, the messenger vaccines, because it will only produce a limited amount of spike protein in the body. Have you seen any real world data that may be in Indonesia or Singapore that can confirm the safety profile? I hear there may have been a case of myocarditis in the trials. I am a person who could use against this. This is why I bring this up again. She says, I could lose my livelihood for this choice. Wonder Nova Vax would be a safer alternative. I'm a woman in my 40s and healthy. You know, Dr. Macaula, this is what's sick about this. That's why I bring this up right away. These people are having to make life and death decisions based on just breathing and living. It's true. And the decisions are not for their health. There's not a single one of these people that seem to be concerned about COVID. It's simply a matter of, I have to take a shot to keep my job. I haven't seen any real world data on Nova Vax. In many ways, that's a good thing, because if we started seeing cases of myocarditis or the blood disorders, they're literatures so primed right now. There's a thousand publications on vaccine injury syndromes. We haven't seen those spontaneously arising in a literature yet with Nova Vax. That's it. This one's from Kim. Dr. Macaula, my daughter was forced to take the Pfizer shot for her job. Her second shot, she has not felt right since. She just got the second shot a couple of weeks ago. It's not felt right since. She's tired. No energy to the point of no energy, even playing soccer, her love. Is there anything she can do to purge these vaccines out of her body? A lot of people wonder that. I get this question. Every day, there's no proven detoxification programs. It's going to take time for some suggestions. Go to the World Council for Health. World Council for Health. It's a yellow and pink background, and they have a couple suggested protocols, but it's purely empiric. Okay. All right. Well, that's important. Steve says, first to say that I am so grateful to you guys that America are allowed and Dr. Peter Macaula for the information you provide. But I need to ask, why hasn't Dr. Macaula spoken out about what's come out in the Pfizer document releases? He is one of the members of the group that put forward the legal proceedings so that we get the documents now in 55 years. These documents show that for the pregnancies that we were reported on, the ones they actually told us about resulted in 100% dead babies. Where is the talk on this? Why is this not being discussed? It's abhorrent. What do you say to that? Yeah. As the listener pointed out, the first tranche of Pfizer documents have been released through the lawsuit, and there is a public health policy review committee, and I am the lead on the committee. We simply haven't had a time as a committee to sit down and set our tasks in front of us to have it fairly reviewed. But because this is out in the public, people can read the documents as they are now. The only top line I'm willing to give out at this point in time is clear within very shortly after the public release of Pfizer data, they had in the post-marketing experience, they had 1,291 unique special events of interest, almost as if the vaccine caused 1,291 new diseases. So more to come on this, but this was all about fair review, and now we need our ability to synthesize and review a large amount of data. So that will be forthcoming once we get the committee together to study this, yes? That's correct. Yeah. Please keep us posted on that. That's really interesting information there. Melinda says, thank you so much for all your research and help and understanding the mRNA vaccine to those of us who are unable to understand the messenger RNA technology. All the questions that I have not seen asked anywhere, if you have not had the vaccine and have to have blood and receive blood from someone who had the vaccine, will it cause the person receiving the blood to have the side effects of the vaccine, spike protein question not? In other words, how will the effects of the vaccine affect an unvaccinated person if they have to have a blood transfusion from a vaccinated person? This question comes up all the time. The American College of Clinical Pathology, as well as American Association of Blood Banking, American Heart Association, we're all notified of this concern early in 2021. It's possible someone freshly vaccinated could vaccinate and donate and give lipid nanoparticles. That would have to be very quickly after the vaccine, but more likely donate and give spike protein in the blood. The only thing I can tell you is that the response from those agencies is they didn't show much in the way of concern. And there are seroprevalence studies showing there's so many circulating antibodies among so many people now that probably the spike protein is mopped up by the antibodies, particularly in the concentrated products. So what I tell patients, they listen, if you need a blood transfusion and your life is on the line, take a blood transfusion. Okay, Robin says, I need some help if you can. I'm trying to find studies about how masks won't work and the dangers of wearing them. Now, this is, as I've reached this question here now, this is a brand new question that just came in, which is remarkable that this has happened. And she says here, I worked for the Von Trapp family. There have been brutal. They have been brutal towards those of us who are unvaccinated. And there are a lot of folks like this, actually. I've done my research and have made an educated decision regarding the vaccine. I've had COVID twice. It is my understanding that I have natural immunity and that it protects better than the vaccine in terms of protection from the virus. They will not recognize this and are making discriminatory decisions against their unvaccinated employees. Can you please direct me to studies regarding masks, vaccine efficacy versus natural immunity, viral load in vaccinated versus unvaccinated are sick to death of being treated like I'm a dirty disease spread in person? Wow. Gee whiz. Well, you know, again, all experts agree after six months, people are unvaccinated. So I guarantee everybody at her work who thinks they're vaccinated, the majority actually are unvaccinated because they've lapsed more than six months. So the vaccine is not a tattoo. It's not like something you get one time and you can identify yourself as that. So the majority of people at her work are unvaccinated. I can tell you that right now. So they're all the same. It is true. If you've had COVID twice, you have natural immunity, which is robust, it's durable, and you know, it's complete in terms of preventing serious outcomes like hospitalization and death. And so the naturally immune are far better than the vaccine immune on this. The best place to find the library of papers far and away is the Brownstone Institute. Go to the Brownstone Institute. There are collections of papers on natural immunity. Paul Alexander is one of the main contributors, but many have contributed to Brownstone. And then you can find the ones on masks and masks don't work and what have you. I think Brownstone is the best overall resource. Excellent, excellent. You know, this question, she says she worked for the Von Truck family. Here's the thing. People are going to have to make decisions in their lives to not go down these roads and go with other, I mean, that's just the way it is. In other words, all these things, Dr. McCullough, are becoming just political hot potato fire bombs. They know what they shouldn't do, but yet they're succumbing to these people to do what they shouldn't do based on these things that you've been saying from the beginning. They should stay away from. I think it's getting to a point now. People are going to have to move away from these people. There's no other choice. It's not worth your life or a job or a house. Well, to be fair, the last listener, Malcolm, she was saying, listen, how do I arrange my counter arguments? She's in the action stage of doing something. I think she's on the right track. The thing we want to discourage is the questions that are really oriented towards how do I save my own skin for a few months? How do I save my own skin and keep my job? Why do we get things oriented? How do we correct the problem at hand? The problem at hand is the mandates. That's a good point. Okay. Marta says, I received the first dose of Pfizer last August. That night I had trouble breathing. It didn't get better. About two or three months later, I started having pain in my left clavicle bone. I wasn't feeling right. In January, I was so exhausted that I could hardly wake up, let alone get up. In the end of January, I was taken to a walking planet. I had COVID and this area was X-rayed of the bone. And I was referred to an oncologist. Listen to this, this gets really pretty incredible. I know I not only have cancer, but I had it for just a few months. I was informed that it has spread so fast that I only have weeks left. The biggest masses are in my liver. I have cancer in my lung, pack a day smoker, spleen, cancer around my moth, eaten, clavicle bone. And now it has spread to my front brain. I believe I am dying because of the Vax, your thoughts. Boy, this is terrible. I can just tell you that the speed of onset of taking a vaccine and then feeling some clavicular pain, it's not, it's not conceivable the vaccine can cause a de novo cancer. So almost invariably the cancer was there for some period of time. You take the vaccine, symptoms bring out the recognition that in fact, something's there. So it's basically a recognition issue. However, there are more and more data suggesting a vaccine could accelerate the course of cancer. I refer you to Dr. Ryan Cole pathologist who's taken the lead on this. And there's hints, by the way, in the Department of Defense, epidemiologic system, the D-Med database that in fact cancers are promoted by the vaccines. Wow. And that's what I thought, yeah. All right. These next few are about long COVID. A lot of questions about that. Linda says, I have several friends that are having smell and taste issues since having COVID. Smells that make them nausea and unable to worry. I heard Dr. McCullough mention he was treated in patients for long haul COVID in one of the interviews. Thoughts about how we can, they're asking if they can even contact your office for help, but they're asking what can they do about this, these taste and smell issues, Dr. McCullough. Taste and smell alone. I've tried a lot of different empiric things in my office. I haven't found any solution for it at this point in time. It goes away slowly over time. If there's other neurologic symptoms, peripheral neuropathy or cerebellar symptoms, I'll use a combination of prednisone and fluvoxamine. Fluvoxamine has anti-COVID effects in acute COVID. Now three randomized trials, one from Brazil. Fluvoxamine also is basically a neurologically active drug that can be tried. But I think for the average, the ish person who's just trying to recover their sense of taste and smell is going to come back slowly over time. Yeah, it does take time. And Dr. McCullough, I've seen all of these impacts of long COVID in my wife, who, you know, the story there. But she's starting to get everything back now, including her hair, which was falling out at one point because of the COVID long haul. But she walks several miles every day. She takes healthy cells. She takes all of the things we talk about. And that's what you have to do. You have to stay at this. And eventually, I'm guessing, Dr. McCullough, there's a turnaround, which is kind of what Jamie's asking here. She says this next one, what is the best way to clear the dead C19 virus from your body to get feeling better sooner? My symptoms are gone after about 48 hours of illness using your protocol, but I'm still wiped exhausted, tired. I've heard it's from the level of dead virus in your system. It's only time, isn't it, that you have to... That's essentially right. The virus is in the body a lot longer than what we think. I think there is an opportunity, you know, our naturopathic doctors, and on the platform led by Dr. Henry Ealy, have really taken approach with nutraceuticals and vitamins. And I do think they do play a role in this post-COVID recovery syndrome, and the brand that supports our show, but I use clinically is healthy cell. And the healthy cell lines, I think, really do play a role in this long COVID syndrome. There is no doubt in my mind, Dr. McCallough. I mean, D has been taking that my wife every day. I mean, and you got to get out, you got to move your... Anyway, you'll have to be energized to get better. You got to take this stuff every day. I can't stress it enough, man. You know, we're learning this the hard way, but it's so important. Veronica says, I was wondering if there is any information on a link. Okay, here's one, between depression, anxiety with the COVID vaccine. I started experience in what I would call a depressive, sadness, hopelessness, and extreme fatigue episode after my first vaccine. I thought maybe it was just life, but after I got my booster, it got significantly worse. It kind of put the timeline of things together, and the vaccine is what only seemed to make sense. I really hope I can get some insight or hope from Dr. McCallough. I think it's conceivable that it's likely neuropsychiatric issues are among the 1291 kind of new diseases that the vaccines cause. The lipid nanoparticles do go into the brain. They do install genetic material that's taken up by cells within the brain, and it's certainly possible. And never before have we had a gene therapy delivered on a regular basis, and we know, in fact, that it crosses a blood-brain barrier. I think everybody should be worried with the shots of having the material go in your brain. Yeah, for sure. Sharon says, I was locked down at home for two years teaching online. I'm healthy, 67, unvaxxed, C19 naive, taking your supplements for months. I'm back in my LA classroom with religious exemption, and soon came down with symptoms just a couple of weeks ago. Sore throat deep, cough headache, sinus congestion, sneezing fever, rapid antigen test twice a week ago, always came back negative. Now two weeks later, feeling much better symptoms gone, but I now have cold sores on lips and an earache. Seems my immune system is weakened with the two-year isolation, she suggested. Was this only cron, do you think? Should I just continue with the supplements? Much gratitude to you, Dr. M. Yeah, I think it was omicron. What your experience is a reactivation syndrome. So the herpes simplex virus that causes cold sores is reactivated in the setting of an omicron infection. So what I advise is get through the cold sore phase and then get an antibody panel. The one I orders through Quest Labs, it's very good. It shows antibodies against spike protein, nucleocapsid is quantitative. And you ought to know if you've had omicron through the antibody test now. Okay. Joe says my wife and sister-in-law recently had COVID just a few months ago and are now experiencing a dramatic dramatic here loss. I'd mention that just a moment ago here. Other friends have reported the same after they had COVID. Is this here loss truly an after effect of COVID? Have you seen any of this in your practice? And by the way, none of them were ever vaccinated. So they're saying COVID itself is doing an out-the-vaccination. That seems to be the case, isn't it? Dr. McConaughey. It's true. Now I've seen this over and over again in my practice. And that's a sign of severe COVID, by the way. Is severe COVID hair loss and the hair will come out in clumps for months? You'll see associated nail changes and nails will be more brittle, they'll have hitting. The supplement to go to is biotin, biotin, 12,000 micrograms twice a day. And then also a good supplementation of general vitamins will be the way to go. It'll slowly recover. You know, I got to speak from experience, Dr. McConaughey. I got to tell you right now, my wife had incredible hair. She had beautiful head of hair. And she lost, she was, you know, women get frantic over this thing. I mean, let's face it, you know, you know what I'm talking about. And it got pretty serious for her with the hair loss she had. And she was like, you know, what am I going to do? What am I going to do? As somebody said to her, do you realize you're losing the hair? You better get a wig. That's how bad it was, right? Do you know it's not only is it looking better the way she does it now, but it's coming back. She's got all this new hair growth now. And everything else coming back. And it's like, like I'm saying, there is hope on this. You know what I'm saying? It does come back, right? It's true. It's the tincture of time you have to be patient. Yeah. And she takes focus with healthy cell as well for the brain fog and all of that, because that's the thing you've got to do. Take all this stuff. So you've got to reverse this thing is how you do it. And to get rid of this long COVID and all the problems with that, you know. Sheila says, what does Dr. McConaughey know about increased heart rate carrying on after the virus? No vaccination and not a serious case of virus, but the increased heart rate still around. Is this common? And are they see, are we seeing heart injuries after just having the virus, she's asking? I see this comment on me in my practice. We know the virus does get into the human body. And in fact, it probably does affect the adrenal glands and the sympathetic chain. There can be a reset of the heart rate upwards by about 10 to 20 points. And this can last anywhere from three to six months. If it's high consistently over 100, we use some short term beta blocker medicines to control it. But I've seen this in my practice and it clearly happens with the vaccines, but it happens with the respiratory infection as well. Okay. Last question on long COVID is from Brian. And this one's interesting as well. He says, I had COVID in October. I'm unvaccinated. Before I started really running down with COVID, I had ringing in my ears that I couldn't figure out. Now I still have ringing and I take all the vitamins. Shall I expect the ringing to ever go away? Have you heard about this? Have you done anything explaining why this occurs? This is one of the longest lasting COVID long COVID syndromes called tinnitus or ringing in the ear. And that, and I think the loss of a sense of smell, the olfactory nerve involvement. If it's really bothersome, I will try some prednisone and fluvoxamine over the course of a month. Some people that's so bad, Malcolm, they can't go to sleep. And so this is a serious infection. I guarantee most of the people were talking about with these. They didn't get enough early treatment. So the virus ripped their body for a long period of time. And many of us have experienced that. And again, as listeners know, I had COVID myself, went through a tough time. My wife had it very serious. And by the grace of God and the protocol here and Dr. McCullough and others on the platform, we were blessed to get her through that hurdle. No doubt about it. Dr. McCullough, we've learned a lot from COVID as a people. And I always say this. I mean, in the long run, I think we'll be that much better off. I've learned so much from our immune systems and our bodies and our lives. And it's been very controversial out there, very political with vaccines and masks and things like that. One of the things that I've been talking about and one of our new sponsors on the platform, I want to tell people right now is Genesis Fager. But here's what I want to drive to. And from your perspective, Dr. McCullough, as a doctor, as an MD and understanding these pitfalls, a lot of stuff came very political with the mask wearing and all of that. A lot of us knew the mask weren't working. But these viruses, like COVID or any of the variants or some of the other ones coming down the pike that you and I talked about moments ago here, part of the problem we're going to have to deal with, I think moving forward as a people from what I can see is being conscious of where we're at and the air around us. And when you think about all the COVID transmission, it was always done from the shared air. It was always out in the, it wasn't that it was on a surface or something, is that your breathing in and out your breathing infected air because it stayed up in the air for a little while. So what's happened is this Genesis Fager takes H-O-C-L, which is quite fascinating. And I have one of these and it puts an ultra fine mist in the air. So specifically, like if you have a party or an event or you have people in the house or your business, a lot of businesses, they absolutely need this to clean the area. But in your home as well, so this thing puts a fine mist and cleans it, it gets the pathogens. That's what I'm going to say. All the pathogens come out of the year with this thing. And it becomes part of the regimen, like you're doing like, I don't know, whether you do nasal decontamination in your nose and this sort of gets it while it's in the air. Does that make sense moving forward as, you know, whether our lives I'm saying, the fact that we should be conscious now in these areas from viruses and especially with people around in the area, a lot of people, that kind of thing? I think it certainly does. There's several principles. One is just the, as you mentioned, the pathogen laden air. And what comes to mind is public restrooms or frequently used restrooms. We have a whole variety of pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, the air is heavy and it's not moving. If air moves, six air exchanges in an hour, in general, less related to lower infectivity risk because the air is moving. There are good filtration systems. There's decontamination systems. Many of you have a senior citizen in your home. And if you ever gone into a room and it smells, we basically kind of musty and it, you know, that's actually a factor of dust, dust mites, and other things in the air. It smells musty for a reason. Well, so what this does is to tell folks, I want you to follow what I'm doing now. This Genesis fogger, it's a very handy little device, a hardware tool, if you will. You can put it right on your shoulder and it cleans the air. You put the HOCL, you dilute it, just like you do the other things, the povidon iodine sort of thing. And in fact, they use this for nasal decontamination. They put it right in the nose and it shows it right on the site and it cleans your nasal out as well. The HOCL, HOCL is in what I've learned about it now. It's in our white blood cells. It's very healthy. You can clean your fruits and vegetables with it. So that's sort of what cleans the air with this device. They've done scientific finance on it. There's all kinds of information back on the website. You can, I'm going to leave you with a site now. You can check it out for yourself. genesisoffogger.com forward slash out loud is set up with all the information you need and our listeners do get 15% off. We negotiated with the company. You get us a listen with the code out loud that you use and you're entitled to that. So check that out and see what you think. I have one. I use it. It's very, very effective and see what you think friends. We'll take a quick pause here. We're on a roll. A lot of questions here and we'll be back with Dr. Peter McCullough. You're listening to the Voice of a Nation. Listen to Malcolm, the Voice of a Nation on iHeartRadio or our free apps on Apple, Android or Alexa. It's time to rethink COVID disinfection, a study by Harvard, Drexel and Virginia Tech concluded, we don't have a single documented case of COVID transmission through surfaces. The reality is that COVID spreads mainly through the air. Shared air is the problem, not shared surfaces. The solution is the Genesis fogger, which uses natural HOCL to disinfect both air and surfaces simultaneously. It's perfect for home or business. NIH says HOCL may well be the disinfectant of choice for coronaviruses. There's nothing more natural or more effective. Genesis fogs at the precise particle size to combat COVID and other harmful pathogens. It's what's missing from your disinfecting protocol. Visit genesisvogger.com.

Welcome back to the voice of a nation here. It is Malcolm out loud, George Storley. This is our COVID Q&A, our 16th one with Dr. Peter McCulloch is here. Come with a whole litany of questions here. I want to get on to this now. This one is from Jana. Jana says, I'm a hospital pharmacist in South Texas. I always look forward to these COVID Q&As. We are on occasion using remdesivir in the hospital to treat COVID patients. When remdesivir first came out, I researched and learned to contain cycloxid-dextrin. You can, which affects the kidneys. I also learned that the antifungal V-Fenn contained cyclodextrin. Throughout the pandemic, I have thought the combination of two negatively affected my patients' kidney function. We know this is true. Myself and another pharmacist are slowly making the other health care providers aware of this possibility, but I feel our approach is more reactive and taking patients off the drugs. I would rather make more providers aware and be proactive with not using the combination in the first place. I've not been able to find information on this subject. Have you heard of this issue before, she's asking Dr. McCulloch, is the research on this particular topic? I'm trying to be vigilant, she says as a pharmacist, if other medications have this challenge here, this is a problem, isn't it? Remdesivir, we know this is a problem. Remdesivir is given over a five-day infusion in patients in the hospital, and the studies are clear. More patients die with remdesivir than in not getting remdesivir. That's the reason why in 2020 the World Health Organization says don't use remdesivir in COVID-19 patients. So the hospitals are still using it against the advice of the World Health Organization and the bad outcomes with remdesivir. So it needs to stop. It causes kidney failure, it causes liver injury, and there's excess mortality. And I've seen not only studies on this, but I've had people on who've been greatly and gravely impacted by this remdesivir. So to be sure, it is not a good thing from what I see here. This next one is from Johnal. It says, I am 68 years old. I have not had the COVID vaccination. I tested positive for COVID at the end of 21. Only symptoms were sore eyes and a little bit of running nose. The same day I received the monoclonal antibodies at the hospital. I went to the emergency room and found out I had blood clots in my left leg and both lungs. I'm currently taking 5mg twice daily of aliquis. I was told by my previous doctor just a couple months ago that I have to take the blood thinner for the rest of my life. When I mentioned it to my new doctor, she didn't say anything. I've been trying to research this and can't find information. Is it true that I will probably have to take this for the rest of my life? I'm suspicious there's some underlying blood clotting disorder since it was such minimal symptoms and the thrombus was so predominant. So I'd recommend a full coagulation, abnormality profile, hyperquagable profile. There's about 7 to 12 things that are checked. And then the other thing I've noticed, I've had cases like this, is be sure to get follow-up ultrasounds because the clots can be far more persistent than what we thought. I have one patient where the blood clots persisted for far more than a year. But ultimately the doctor has to decide with this patient based on the unique features, the hyperquagable workup and the serial imaging. Is it just a time limited use of the blood thinner or is it lifelong? Our next one's from McKenna. I want to ask Dr. McCullough a question about women breastfeed and while vaccinated. My cousin is doing July. Recently got her booster shot. She got really sick after. I want to ask if there's evidence of infant death linked to vaccinated breastfeed. And I've heard of cases but I want to be able to show real evidence that it may not be best of breastfeed after vaccination. It's in the US vaccine reverse event reporting system of a vaccinated breastfeeding woman having hemorrhagic death and the infant that was presented by Dr. Harvey Rish on Fox News, the Ingram angle. And almost certainly there are more cases that arise. Breastfeeding women should not take the vaccine pregnant women should not take the vaccine. They were excluded from the clinical trials. We always exclude them in clinical practice for these reasons. We must protect the women and the babies. Amen. Debbie says my question is are the COVID vaccine still in phase three trials? And if so, is it possible that half of the population is really being being given a placebo? I don't think so. They are completed their trials. It's in the public program. Everybody should believe that they, you know, when they sign up for the emergency use authorized vaccine, they are getting what they're saying they're getting in terms of, you know, truly getting Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson. And there's no placebo administration. One cannot receive a placebo unless the consent forms tells someone that there's a 50-50 chance of getting the real thing or placebo. Okay. Simon says, what are the chances that it could cause HIV test results as HIV has appeared on MSM a lot all of a sudden also it's impossible that the vaccine could be swapped out so the contents are different in each one. So for example, two Pfizer vaccines a person received actually contained two different things entirely. But they're asking mostly about the HIV. You've been hearing about this? The vaccines, in my understanding, they are as presented. They don't differ from shot to shot. There is some homology between a glycoprotein in the spike protein in HIV. And it is true that the very first Australian COVID-19 vaccine by the University of Queensland did turn everybody in the trial HIV positive even though they didn't have HIV. It's one of the reasons why it stopped. So if you go onto a fair search engine like Duck and Go and you type in Australian vaccine turns subjects HIV positive, you'll see it there. So it definitely happened. This has been heavily suppressed by the media. Now there's been concerns about HIV overall. And I think some of this is spurred by the World Health Organization, which advises in a sense in a negative way on boosters. The World Health Organization thinks that boosters potentially can weaken the immune system because we're loading the body with the spike protein. But to my knowledge, there's no direct connection between SARS-CoV-2, the vaccines, and HIV. And I could just pretty well predict the answer to this one from Ed. He says he's a young adult male 24. He has to get a vaccine for entrance into the military. Which one would be the best one with the least chance of problems? Not to share that with you. Again, we're going to have to get away from saving my own skin so I can be in the military or saving my own skin so I can keep my job. We have to go to the root of the problem. This is going to be just a few more months in the military and this is going to come up again and again and again. A vaccine is not a tattoo. It's not a permanent thing. It only lasts a few months and the risk's far outweigh any benefits. But also, if enough people stand up against this, then they'll need more soldiers and they'll have to wax these kinds of rules. Don't you think, Dr. McCullough? They do, but with the sentiment of these questions, people are still thinking they're going to save their own skin. They are still thinking the vaccine is like a tattoo. You get it one time and you're good. It's not the case. People are going to have to start thinking through this. And I guarantee this person has not talked up the chain of command and basically worked their way through. Who decided this and why? Do you know all five branches of the military are being sued right now? People are pressing the case and getting religious exemptions. This is about standing up as opposed to saving your own skin. I mean, what Dr. McCullough says there is so important. And I think what we're going to start to see in society as a whole is that these groups organizations, in this case, the military, as he says, all five branches are being sued. About everybody's being sued right now. But as this thing goes on, there's still so much. I guess what I would say to you, how many I'm thinking about the end and chapters of this thing and what they look like. And we've been, you know, sounded the warning for some time about these false choices that people have to make. You know, if enough people stand for what's right for themselves and their bodies, like in the case of military and what Ed asked a moment ago here, then I got to tell you what, when there's no soldiers on the battlefield or whatever that means, I guess they'll change the rules. Right. I mean, it's the same way like this through all walks of life as these groups and organizations and hospitals and politicians and jobs, corporates, continue to push some sort of a wicked, wicked agenda for some, these kinds of decision-makers on people to, you know, put themselves at risk, put their loved ones at risk for what? As Dr. McCullough says, for what? For just a few days, I mean, for what? For a couple of months, I mean, where is the trade-off people? That's the where is the trade-off. So these kinds of questions that come in when it addresses like, you know, what's the better shot to, which vaccine do you recommend to? It's like asking, you know, what's the, what's the quickest way to maybe not die or how do I, we don't know this. We don't possibly know this. It's not possible. So listen, we're getting, I mean, thousands of questions in here every day on these Q&As. And that's a common denominator where people are looking for us to help them with the decision that they have a very personal decision that they have to make. And that very personal decision is only one that they can make. But I can't imagine why somebody would take the risk, any risk of this when, you know, you're being forced to do so. Why bother? Why bother for anything? I would say fight it all the way to the very, very end. You know, this next one, for instance, from Jerry, he says, can the McCulloch protocol be generalized and used for other viral illnesses like influenza or the common cold? And I will answer that one. The answer is unequivocally, yes. I mean, all of the things that McCulloch puts out there in the protocol, friends, can absolutely be, should be used. The way I would describe this is it's a new way of thinking. It's a new way of living back to what I say about our health, you know, our health and well, me. And so the answer is unequivocally, yes, all of these things and the daily rituals we need to be taken. You know, that is the silver lining in all of this, really, and truly it is the things we've learned as people now, and our responsibilities to our own bodies and our own health and our own minds that I've been preaching about for years, well before COVID. But it's so vivid now, in my mind, the things we have to do, like just becoming before I come on the show here with Dr. McCulloch, and I was just talking about it. In fact, you know, I take my healthy cell, I take it all. I take the AMPM every day. I take the for the brain fog, I take focus and recall. I mean, and then I take the zinc, I take A, I take D, I take all of these things. And it absolutely makes a difference. In fact, just as Sean and I was, I don't know, I hardly ever get sick. And I was feeling a little weirdness in my nose. And now I realized the problem with our nose. I immediately went and started taking the healthy cell. And again, when you're doing that and you do use some things. And that's what we're like the fogger and decontaminate in the air and killing the pathogens. And like he was talking about the mites. And we were just talking even off air about that Dr. McCulloch and I were talking about. He's using the fogger in his home with his parents and stuff. As a health measurement to take out any pathogens in the air and to get rid of that sort of you know, that sometimes you walk in room and you get that sort of a dusty smell kind of thing. And it's because of the air we're breathing. And that's something we've all learned from this COVID. That's how these things are passed. These pathogens are passed through the air. So that's the way to stop that. You know, we're getting so many different excellent ideas in here and we'll request from very unique products that I I'm seeing so many so much value with. And there's a series of them now that I'm looking at and really Dr. McCullough and I are investigating many of these to see do they bring value to people? That's the kind of thing I really enjoy doing with the platform here is being able to bring these new ideas and new thoughts. You know, at the end of the day, it really is about a quality life. I mean, it's it's not about the quantity. It's about the quality of life and what we get out of it. And that's something we need to be focused on as people. And, you know, there's a lot, then a lot of damage here done from COVID. Surely over the last couple of years, people. And I absolutely pray for all the people we've lost, a family from all of this and the way it's been mismanaged. And you know, we've done these Q&As now with Dr. Peter McCullough, Dr. Henry Ealy, getting the information out there. And Dr. Ealy, so good about this. Dr. McCullough, that's why he just bought up a few moments ago. He's so accurate. You know, as a nature pathic doctor, being able to take a look at things we need to do to prevent these things or to minimize when, you know, whatever it is, whether it's a hemogragic fever or some other virus or another variant or whatever's going to happen. I mean, if you can't avoid it entirely, at least minimize the impact on your body. A healthy immune system will do that. That's the thing I've learned more than anything. Eat and write, walk and even to exercise, put the things into your body because without our health, you know, my friends, we have nothing. We have absolutely nothing. The best job in the world is going to help you. The best military branches are going to help you. The best relationship is going to help you. Nothing's going to help you. It always comes back to you, your personal DNA. You're taking care of you first. That's what it's got to be. So put yourself first more than anything. If there's anything we learned from all of this, that's got to be it right there. All your questions here, you can send in to Liberty at americaoutloud.com.
