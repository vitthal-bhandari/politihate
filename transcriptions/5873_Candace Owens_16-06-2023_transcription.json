    "text": " Wow, happiest of Fridays everybody. My YouTube band is officially over. It's over. I'm back on YouTube I'm out of YouTube prison and I've learned so much obviously They wanted me to sit and time out and think about all of the sins that I have committed on this most precious application And honestly, I learned a lot. I'm back and I can say I'm a big old Lesbo now. It worked I am I'm a big old Lesbo and my pronouns are Z-zims are they them Please respect them going forward. Well today. We're going to discuss the story that is trending I have a lot to say about it the Connor Mick Gregor rape allegations that just came out Later on because I am now educated about lesbians and gays and transgender and things of that nature I'm going to share with you the most interesting article that I read in men's health and I had to read it So now you guys are going to have to listen to it and your Fridays may I really not about to be ruined all that and more today Coming up on can of stones As you may know we've been in an ongoing battle with some of the biggest social media platforms out there last month Matt Walsh was demonetized on YouTube then Michael Knowles and I were both suspended for seven days Even Dr. Jordan B. Peterson was given a channel warning most of these so-called violations sent from our coverage of a transgender debate Being expected to adhere to vague arbitrary and constantly changing rules has become increasingly frustrating These rules contradict everything that we stand for however We will not stop speaking the truth We will not allow left to restrict us from reaching the audiences that need to hear this debate the most as our CEO Jeremy Waring recently tweeted if platforms like YouTube believe in free speech Then they must change these vague and capricious policies and their arbitrary enforcement in the meantime We will keep fighting and speaking the truth forever We can and it has become glaringly evident that we cannot rely on many third-party sites to support us Daily wire plus is the best platform for you to find content that is free from big techs vague guidelines So if you believe in our work and fighting for the ability to debate some of the biggest cultural issues facing us today Then now is the time to join us. What are you waiting for? Come up today and you will get 25% off your daily wire plus membership go to dailywire.com slash subscribe and join the fight Look, it's 2023 people don't like common sense You're a person and you dabble with common sense You're probably not a very well-liked individual and typically their response is when you say hmm That just doesn't make sense to me as you don't know you're not an expert I have a lot of degrees and stuff. How dare you think that you can interject with common sense You just go I don't know if you like one plus one might equal two and not these Infinite amount of equations that you guys have come out with people in this time and in this place in this age Do not like common sense But it's common sense that told me not to support the Black Lives Matter narrative and told me that that may or may not To end up as being a scam which it was it was common sense by the way that told me But I shouldn't support them me to movement seemed a little weird suddenly people are using a hashtag And I'm just supposed to believe every allegation that a woman makes simply because she's a woman literally hashtag believe women Was trending and what was implied there was women can't lie women never lie Except they do they lie a lot just like men lie a lot and I like to follow the facts And so today I would like to take you through an exercise in common sense So Connor McGregor has been accused of forcing an unnamed accuser to perform oral sex on him and Attempting to sodomize her in the VIP men's bathroom at game four of the NBA finals last week in Miami This story broke and people that just hate Connor McGregor wanted to believe it Of course, there's always those elements where people just don't like the persons. They don't even care about the story They're like yes, he's going to go down and For me, I was interested in this story because you guys know that I love the UFC I follow the UFC I have deep reverence for MMA fighters in terms of their sheer athleticism and Obviously Connor McGregor is a very big name in MMA fighting so I looked at this story and There were just a couple of immediate red flags that popped up for me. So I'm just gonna take you through her claims The woman claims that McGregor attempted to rape her Okay, the victim in the demand letters sent to the NBA the Heat and McGregor from her attorney his name is Ariel Mitchell and obtained by the post Claimed that she was forced into a bathroom in the arena By both Heat and NBA security after being separated from her friend Okay, the Gregor who was the only person in that bathroom allegedly emerged from a stall and Forcibly kissed the woman as security blocked anyone else from entering the bathroom Okay The victim was able to get mr McGregor to cease his assault by demanding he stop because she had to urinate Okay Then it goes on to claim that as she attempted to urinate He then didn't care didn't want to give her privacy and this is when the assault took place Which I'm not going to detail here because this is a family friendly show After the details stunning details very precise details of the assault that took place she goes on to say That's she was able to escape After elbowing Mick Gregor multiple times though She allegedly left her purse behind and says it was later held hostage by mr McGregor's security guards Okay, so let's just pause and say what are some of immediate red flags as a person? I don't have a horse in this race. I don't know Conor McGregor personally I don't have anything against this young woman who's making these accusations But what just jumps out at you immediately about the story Well, actually the first thing that jumps out is when she said that she was dragged into the bathroom against her will By security belonging to the NBA the heat and Mick Gregor at an NBA finals game Where one of the most famous fighters in the world is present? I don't know to me I'm just thinking if I am a rapist Maybe where I'm gonna rape a girl is not gonna be at game four of NBA finals because there might be a lot of cameras around And I'm a pre-famous person and I'm going to assume that there might be some cameras on me There might be a very large presence of media members seems weird that I would instruct multiple sets of security To drag a girl into a bathroom so that I could rape her and they all said this is okay I'm totally fine to do this in a situation this that's the first thing that just strikes me as a bit odd It's just not a place where you would think that you were going to get away with a rape Especially if you're a person as famous as Conor McGregor Second thing that jumps out to me is how she got free she elbowed Conor Mick Gregor the MMA fighter who breaks limbs in the octagon and continues to fight and Somehow manages to get free a woman a young woman. I'm gonna assume she's rather petite Conor McGregor Basically, if you've ever seen the movie 300 UFC fighters MMA fighters. Yeah, they are pretty much that's that's pretty much what you're seeing But an elbow that was it he was now and she was able to get free because in my personal opinion And I'm being honest here again. This is just common sense if an MMA fighter wants to rape me Okay, and I am close in a closed environment this individual. They're probably going to be successful 100% of the time because there's just no way that I'm going to be able to fight myself out of the circumstance now in my head I be thinking let me scratch let me get some DNA under my fingernails But the idea that I'm going to simply elbow an MMA fighter and he's gonna go owie and I'm going to escape a rape Doesn't really pass the sniff test for me personally, okay? Here I'm just gonna show you guys some footage of the Conor McGregor that we're talking about here Connor's busting made up Which in the Diaz world means absolutely not Because he will fight until he can't fight any longer As he was getting knocked out look at that Boom and then hammer fist out Yep that Carter McGregor Yeah, someone elbowed him that he said owie and then that person was able to escape because he's never taken an elbow Before and that would have just totally thrown him off and he just would have been in so much harrowing pain that Unfortunately, she was able to get out. So yeah Didn't exactly make sense to me and the red flags immediately checked out because then of course what emerged was actual footage of this young woman Willingly going into this bathroom with Conor McGregor because I guess in her mind she didn't figure that maybe there were cameras on him Backstage at these events their tends to be as I said media members everywhere So it wasn't even the footage that was from the arena This is just simple media footage because there's so many journalists that are around because again He's Connor McGregor. So here is the footage of her going to the bathroom with him. Take a look So you can see he goes to get her Holding hands with her. She's certainly not fighting him. They're just holding hands and walking into a restroom Tons of people around and then the security starts to block the other people from going in because that's what the security is Supposed to do when you are a famous person. They're supposed to keep other fans in an entourage from following you So what happened gosh? I guess their attorney Wasn't expecting this to be so immediately fact checked and proven to be inaccurate and Now her lawyer is completely changing their story Connor's team alleges that after they didn't respond to her demand for money She then turned to the media to apply pressure that what's really going on is simply a shake down Of course now they have this video evidence proving That at least some portion of her testimony is completely made up and just didn't happen this way She willingly went with him now her attorney has changed the circumstance of how she arrived into the restroom And the attorney says that McGregor said that he had to use the restroom Shortly after he got up a man in a Denver, nuggets Jersey walked up to her client and said Connor told me to come get you My client was under the belief that they were leaving and going to the Four Seasons Hotel as Connor had previously asked her to join him at his hotel room The man with the braids then stopped at the door of the bathroom when Connor grabbed my client My client believed that they were leaving but instead Connor took her into the restroom My client remembers having no less than six drinks that night and has admitted the parts that she recalls My client did not even recall who led her into the restroom until seeing this video Okay, so at first you sent out a demand letter at first She went to the media and said that she was forcefully taken in to this bathroom by security personnel now video has emerged We know that isn't true and your excuse has actually my client was drunk It doesn't remember how she got into the bathroom at all. Yes, she was completely wrong But hey, she had six plus drinks. Yeah, the real truth is that she thought she was going to his hotel room But I said she got taken into a bathroom an utterly different story So now we follow this and we say if your client can't even remember How she got into the bathroom? How are the rest of us supposed to believe her account of what took place once she was in the bathroom? was she blacked out going to the bathroom and then came fully to her senses and recognized everything that was going on Including the fact that she went rounds with Conor McGregor and one Successfully because she threw a couple of elbows. Do you want us to all believe that? Do you want us to just blanket believe women that like suddenly we're all capable of taking out Conor McGregor if we accurately place our drunk elbows in the right place or is it likely is it plausible? You're like is it plausible that your clients? Did think that she was following to him to do something inappropriate I don't not believe first story that she thought he was going to the four season's hotel But what was she gonna do with your client when she got to the four season's hotel? How about that for a question? She thought he was going to his hotel room to do what exactly to do what with a married man Who has multiple children and one on the way in his hotel room? What did your client think was going to happen? Were they going to discuss business? Did she think he saw her and they were talking and they had some conversations about going to the four season's hotel to discuss some a business opportunity or maybe she told him actually I've got these really strong elbows and I think that I have should have a position in the UFC I'm the next biggest MMA fighter and he was gonna go test that out at the hotel room or hear me out Is it likely that your client is a drunk groupie? Okay? She saw Conor McGregor She recognized him as a very famous person and like drunk groupies tend to do They are willing to sleep with famous people because they think maybe they'll have a relationship with them Or if they're super nefarious They think if I do have any sort of a sexual issue with them I can then demand money in the post me to era or I will simply say that I was raped and I will Trod this person's name through the mud which sounds more likely to you I Remain a person that is disgusted with the me to movement is discussed with women like this because what it does Is it makes real victims less likely to be believed when women like this who are too drunk to even recall any details About how they got into a bathroom are able to receive a bunch of media attention because they drop down a famous person's name We have seen this over and over again now to be clear. I'm not saying that Conor McGregor is not guilty He's guilty of a lot of things here. He's guilty perhaps of infidelity He's guilty of being really stupid because when you have this much fame you risk it all When you mess around with groupies that are running a rock at a NBA finals four games Okay, he is guilty of hurting his wife even these sheer allegations the fact that his wife is pregnant That is what he should feel guilty and ashamed about But guilty of rape I'm gonna struggle to believe that of course more information will come out and I'm assuming that her story will continue to change and that some Me too advocates will say well even if she got the complete story wrong It can still be rape if she felt violated after she left it by violated Of course We mean that she didn't get the check that she asked for because rather than going to the police She had her lawyer make a demand for money meaning my rape I'll forget about it as long as you write me a really big check the end of the day Don't just believe women. Don't just believe men always try to believe facts and that's all I have to say about that Okay, now it's time for some topics to sure I Just reminding you that Sam a big old lesbo they them lesbo zeezer because YouTube has put me in timeout And I have learned that it was wrong of me to be conservative and to believe in themes of common sense and to be somewhat Fearful of the extended LGBTQIA stuff when there's nothing to be fearful of you know Before gay marriage legislation was passed conservatives used to say that if gay marriage passed scary conservatives Bigoted conservatives used to say that if it was passed it would bring in this era of sexual perversion and those traditional conservatives Clearly were wrong because what it's really brought forth more than anything as I have learned is freedom So while I was in YouTube timeout I had to learn that Sam Britain you remember the guy the nuclear energy waist guy that was a part of the Biden Administration and used to dress up like a puppy. This was called pop play If you're not familiar with it and he had all of these photos from BDSM The Biden administration didn't care the reason didn't care is because Sam Britain identifies as queer and I wanted to learn more about What queer was I wanted to become educated about this topic? I don't want to be a bigoted conservative That's afraid of this stuff. So I went into the fire. I did some research and I'm here to educate you guys about what queer is This is according to Planned Parenthood very trusted source Queer is a word that describes sexual identities other than straight and cisgender Queer is sometimes used to express that sexuality Can be complicated. Okay, fair enough. It can be caught what you are sexually attracted to might be a little bit Complicated now some people might think that it's getting kinky and perverted But I decided to go deeper into my understanding of a queer identity by exploring what exactly pop play was I went to the internet and I consulted articles and lo and behold were the first things that popped up So I could better understand Sam Britain and these individuals that I'm seeing in pride for late parades that are dressed up in BDSM Leather strapped gear walking around like puppies on a leash I said I want to understand I don't be afraid of it Understand it and this men health article popped up and it said this the articles entitled pop play It isn't just a sexual kink. It's freedom And right there I knew that I had found the right article because right off of that it tells you that this whatever you're about to read Whatever you're about to hear me read to you. It is a sexual kink. Okay, it's freedom. So why don't you go get you some? Reading from the first portions of the article it says Some guys feel like they turn into an animal when they have sex But if you watched season two of Netflix's BDSM show then you know that others prefer to dress up as an animal when they do it Puppy play also known as pup play is a form of consensual Adult role play popular in the gay leather community who knew there was a gay leather community? I didn't now, you know Where people dress up and embody the characteristics of a dog Often these so-called pups where a leather dog mask and a tail Usually in the form of a butt plug Sorry, I'm sorry I'm learning with you They walk around on all fours Just a cough. This is educated. They walk around all fours bark and sometimes eat and drink from a bowl But these pups aren't strays They typically have an owner also called a handler or a master The owner may walk their pup on a leash pet them and shower them with love just like they would a real dog But unlike with real dogs the owner may also have sex with their pup The sex isn't mandatory some guys simply just get a lot of satisfaction out of being dressed up and treated like a dog So that's just a little bit of background I I didn't know that when I was seeing those people on leashes that there were butt plugs involved and now I'm educated about it So the article then goes on and talk about what the appeal of pup play is and just again to remind you This is not a sexual kink. It is freedom Sean not his real name says he loves the release of inhibitions that he gets out of pup play It's a way to escape any human problems and just have fun in the headspace whether it be in the bedroom or at a mosh A mosh she explains is when pups physically get down on all fours and interact with each other like biological puppies They lick nuzzle and tackle each other sounds like a dog park But it's humans that are dressed like dogs guys. What were you so afraid of that you? I don't know why I'm sure we're thinking that this was weird. It's just this is how they bond It says often there's no verbal communication other than puppy noises while they're mashing It's mostly just barking and similar quips Champ another person in his story is really interesting. He was drawn to pup play initially for the sex He says quote I found the animalistic and anonymous aspect of effing to be a huge turn on he explains Champ was aroused by the fact that people didn't know how he looked while he was wearing a pup mask Champ discovered pup play through the gay leather scene in the gay community Pup play is often a subset within the leather scene Since you wear a leather mask harness chaps and a collar as a pup In 2017 champ had his first experience with pup play at the mid-Atlantic leather weekend He had just purchased a leather pup mask and was being led on all fours by his handler He says quote a very attractive man came up to us and negotiated with my handler to take me back up to a hotel room And eff me it was so hot to be used by this guy in head to toe leather Okay It's amazing Should I stop reading the article are you guys enjoying this article? Are you feeling educated during this pride month now you can see why they're so proud? This is they're so proud of putting this in mental health. They are openly talking about this stuff in mental health And I'm sure if you are a conservative and you're listening to this you're starting to realize that you're Maybe not the same person here, right? It's like you're probably going okay. I didn't realize I'm so glad can't explain this to me in a way that makes sense because prior to I had all of these ideas that this might have been very weird and Kinky but now that we have learned from champ the dog who's a human what what what he sees about it I'm feeling more educated So I wanted to share that with you guys. I got curious about the author of this article because I don't know He's very boldly writing about this and I wanted to know more about him And it turns out that his name is Zachary Zane and he has a biography on his website The biography reads currently I have a weekly sex advice column at men's health titled sex plane it in the column I answer a diverse range of questions pertaining to masculinity ethical non-monogamy sexual insecurities and the lgbtq community I answer questions with actionable advice my column was such success that men's health had me co-author the book men's health best sex ever I also have a new monthly column on cosmopolitan titled Navigating non-monogamy my new book boy slut a memoir a manifesto is out now So I looked into boy slut and it turns out that he also operates. I don't know how else to call it's like a it's like a blog A sub stack is what it actually is and a bunch of people get to write Gay sexual fantasies and they just write about their gay sexual fantasies on this sub stack that's called boy slut And i'm just thinking how times have changed because if I had Lesbo sexual fantasies written on the internet using my real name and I went in for a job I don't know what the daily wire and they said oh, what are you right for? And I said oh I actually have a sub stack about lesbian pornography. I write fantasy Lesbo pornography I would think that that would disqualify me for the job But it's 2023 and if you are writing the sort of stuff and if you simultaneously have stuff on the internet Confirms that you like to dress up like a puppy and have sex with random strangers That is not necessarily pre-clued you from a job In fact, it might guarantee you a job which is why zakari zane also has written for the new york times rolling stone cosmopolitan Gq vice the daily beast allure self and nbc. Yes guys the problem isn't Uh the lgbtqia community as conservatives thought It's really just that you haven't opened your mind to what freedom might actually look like how am I doing youtube? speaking of not being disqualified for openly sharing your sexual proclivities We had covered extensively rose montoya the transgendered individual that went to the white house and decided to remove their top And obviously people were outraged, but I came rushing to rose montoya's defense because well after checking rose montoya's instagram Rose was pretty open about pore and hub dressing in bdsm hanging out in the nightlife rose Basically always was half naked and despite this and despite talking openly about sex and the things that rose and joys Rose received an invite to the white house, right? And then rose did what we tend to see at pride events where we see these pup events rose Got naked right? Well, it seems that conservatives have gotten to rose and that makes me very very sad as an out spoken advocate for Transgender individuals rose is now apologizing for Being naked at the white house and I just want you to hear what rose has to say take a listen In a quick moment of fleeting and overwhelming trans joy I decided to do something Unbecoming of a guest of the president at the white house loan celebration more so than ever before I have learned how Powerful and just how impactful My actions are and how impactful it is when we share our stories and experiences and how we do so with the world I want to take this moment to apologize for the impact of my actions I especially want to apologize to my black trans brothers and siblings Especially transgender women who are black because I understand that you all are constantly at a disproportionate level Impacted by the actions of others and especially by anti trans violence Okay Now what I expected that was a weird turn off of an exit that I didn't see coming Well, first off. I just would like to reiterate here. Have you never Went through a moment of sheer trans joy That was the reason that rose got topless sometimes you're just so overwhelmed by trans joy that you get topless Right. So that is a very adequate explanation. It's a good explanation for me I hope it sits well with you And then obviously it's still somehow about black people and it becomes necessary to just apologize to black people always That's a great reminder that no matter what you do this weekend Remember to stop and apologize to black people for something that you probably didn't do guys That's all i'm going to say about all of that All right guys, we have a little bit of time left. So let's jump into some of your comments This one is from jennifer garcia. She says hi kennas I just wanted to make a comment about Biden and him inviting all of a transsexuals to the white house How can he say that the bravest people that he's ever met I come from immigrant immigrant to chinese Mexican family military family Catholic who believes in jesus christ also i'm a lesbian But what happened at the white house was the most embarrassing this respectable thing i've ever seen It's already hard to be who i am but it's not something I need to parade about my sexuality is my sexuality I don't need to tell the world or have a pride month our military deserves more than that I listen to you every day. Thank you for all that you do for us That's a really good comment I it's interesting to hear you say that because I obviously have a lot of democrats in my family And one of them reached out to me after this and said that this this was the nail on the coffin Which was very strange because I didn't think that this would be the thing that would make her snap And she was like i'm officially a conservative i want to put my kids into a christian school I'm just very upset about the direction of the world and I can't believe what the democrat party has become And she said to me, I don't even feel that I became conservative I just feel about the left has gone so far left and i'm just where i've always been and I can no longer Agree with these things so in a weird way What happened at the white house did wind up being A major win for republicans and I do think that that is the reason why Biden backtracked It wasn't what uh, rose montoya did it was more of how democrat voters traditional democrat voters reacted to what rose montoya did Next comment This one is from satslana stavonovich Common sense is winning this gender thing appropriation of kids by woke activists and woke states in pro life should be stopped For common sense and women well-being sakes and not for any of the parties or ideologies I think I agree very much with that opinion and if you want a measure of how much common sense is winning They're trying to ban it on youtube And you only ban ideas when you can't win ideas when you are actually not winning the debate is when you say we need to start censuring the people That are willing the debate and obviously we are feeling that hammer a lot over here up daily wire But we're still in relatively good spirits about it. So I I like I said, I am Never been more confident about what my beliefs are and I do feel very much that we are inching ever closer to waking people up about just how badly This society has been nonsense All right guys, unfortunately that is all the time that we have for today as a reminder a shot in the dark is available now on daily wire plus You are going to love that series So be sure to click the link in the description and subscribe right now and be sure to come back tomorrow Just kidding on monday rather for an all new episode have a great weekend You"
