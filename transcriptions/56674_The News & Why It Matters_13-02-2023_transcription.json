    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Today, UFOs all over the place. Should we be preparing for an alien takeover, the project Veritas story contradicted by someone with firsthand knowledge and a professor says childhood innocence is a myth and you may not believe it, but he says babies are actually sexual. Yeah, we've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Saragans. All is happy Monday. I still have somewhat of a voice, but we'll see how long that holds up. I am joined today by Yaku Buyan's Blaze TV contributor and host of the bottom line, which everyone should be subscribed to and also Alex Stein, Blaze TV host of prime time with Alex Stein, which I also encourage you to go subscribe to it while it's still there anyway on YouTube. Yeah, before we get censored. Who knows? Who knows? You might have Alex Jones on soon. Who knows? They're going to show us all of that. Well, congratulations on lasting more than one episode. Yeah, and that's it. That's how they gave us. Glenn and Gavin said one, so we did two. So we beat expectations. Yeah, there you go. Well, I mean, when you set the bar really low, you can hit it. That's an essay. I achieved your goal. It's all performance from here, buddy. Yeah, it's all extra. Okay, so I actually, this is a really, really good guest selection, a good panel for today for differing reasons. Number one, this first story that we're getting into, we've got the conspiracy theorist, the resident conspiracy theorist here, who I hope will tell us if the aliens are going to come and take over. I personally, I'll get into the story in a second, I personally think that the aliens are monitoring us and they're like, yeah, we don't want any part of that. And then they're getting the heck out of here. They're like, yeah, you guys are a mess. We don't even want to deal with this. So let's go through kind of the timeline because it started to get really, really crazy over the weekend. So there were all these UFO sightings that were popping up all around the United States on Friday. There was a UFO that was shot down over Alaska on Saturday. And I'm calling them, they say that there are balloons, some of them that say that they're UFOs, but then they're like, we don't know. So let me walk you through this. So Saturday, the second one was shot down over Canada. Saturday, a radar anomaly was detected over over Montana. Sunday, an F-16 shot down a third UFO over the Great Lakes, which was over specifically Lake Huron. The Defense Department said in a statement that President Biden ordered the strike on the recommendation of military leadership after detecting an airborne object flying at approximately 20,000 feet altitude in the United States airspace. The object was detected Sunday morning. And they said that because of its altitude, it could be hazardous to civilian aviation. And it also flew in proximity to sensitive department of defense sites, had potential surveillance capabilities. But likely they said no kinetic military threat. So I want to play for you. This is the commander of NORAD. This is General Glenn Van Hurk, who was asked, is a very bizarre question by the reporter, like, we keep getting this question. So I'm going to ask you, because people keep asking us, so like, are we ruling out aliens or what? And he was like, I'm not ruling out anything much. Hi, thanks, Pat. And thanks for doing this. This is for General Van Hurk, because you still haven't been able to tell us what these things are that we are shooting out of the sky. That raises the question, have you ruled out aliens or extra terrestrials? And if so, why? Because that is what everyone is asking us right now. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Colleen. I'll let the intel community and the counterintelligence community figure that out. I haven't ruled out anything. At this point, we continue to assess every threat, our potential threat unknown that approaches North America within attempt to identify it. So what a wild time when the government is actually like, I mean, it could be aliens. I don't know. Seems a little bit weird. The first two UFOs that were shot down over Alaska and Canada on Friday and Saturday have both been described as cylindrical. And ABC News cited an unnamed United States official who was the first one. They described it as cylindrical and silverish gray and seemed to be floating without any sort of propulsion. So I just, are we, is this it for us? Is this just a scyop to get us to not pay attention to all the other things that are going on? Like what is going on? I'm going to go conspiracy theorists. Well, I think you nailed it. I do think this is some sort of distraction. And to be honest, when we talk about these balloons, America has a ton of balloons. We have, you know, spy balloons all over the world. So to think that, you know, China is the only person with a balloon, no, I think this is just pure distraction. You look at the massive explosion in Ohio, people are getting poisoned right now. We're going to talk about this. Yeah. I'm just saying there's just a lot of stuff going on in the world today. The Jeffrey Epstein list is getting, we're supposed to, there's like 119 names getting revealed on that. So there's a lot of stuff to distract us from at the moment. I mean, that sounds like a conspiracy there. But I'll just be honest, it's not a freaking alien. I don't think so. If the government says, oh, it could be a UFO, then it's not a UFO. That's all you have to know. If they want you to think it is, then it's not exactly which makes you think, okay, they already know exactly what it is, because otherwise they wouldn't be saying that. That wasn't much tinfoil hat at all. Yeah, no, that was quite saying. I actually, I expected more from you. Yeah, I mean, I'm not performing. But it's not an alien. I just want that out there. I'll say this to you. I've said to people, no, it's not an alien. 100% is not an alien. Plus, it's not unidentified. If you shut it down, there's debris, pick up the debris, analyze the debris. You could tell us what metal it is. Again, if it was, trust me, you would have known it's not an alien. I say this, not known conspiracy, where a lot, you can't fly a Cessna from Haiti to the US without an F-16 intercepting you the second you come into international, out of international water in our airspace. But we're going to fly a balloon from China across the country, because it's allowed to happen. Look, this may be the conspiracy theorist here for you for a minute, okay? This is this administration opening the back door to the United States to China to say, fly in whatever you want, fly over our facilities, track it down. Yes, we've got balloons all over the place as well. 20,000 feet is low. That's low here. Yeah, that's lower than a plane. You fly 30, 36, 40,000 feet just on chocolate coins. We are allowing this to happen. And so, we shoot them down a little late. As a lot of them, you've got to look at how the world looks at this and they go, oh, these guys are really weak. They're super, super weak and we're welcome, because we are, in fact, Biden is more pro-China than he is pro-America. So, but no, they're not little green men with, if you find one, bring them to me. Well, that's a conspiracy. I want to hurt him. Of course you do. Is that, well, they're actually trying to get us to start a war with China, supposedly. Is that what they're saying? Which, you know, I don't know. I mean, Joe Biden's into much business with China. I doubt it. Yeah, he's very, as Yaku said, he is very pro-China. Yeah, that's right. And Hunter has gotten a lot of wealth from China. So, yeah. Okay, so I want to switch gears here. And I want to talk about Alex, you alluded to it. But I think it is a story that people are missing because everyone is talking about all of this UFO stuff, all of these balloons, whatever it is, which I think is important. But I don't want to lose sight of a really important story over in Ohio. So, let me give you the, this has been going on for a while now, but it's just exacerbated and we're finding out more information about it. So, Friday, February 3rd, there were two trains in Ohio that collided, causing a really, really bad derailment in a small town between Ohio and Pennsylvania. This is East Palestine, Palestine. I don't know. I would say, okay, Palestine. It's a 50-trained car derailment and it caused this really, really bad fire. It lasted for several days. And apparently, they are now saying, Norfolk Southern is saying that these five train cars carried vinyl chloride. This is a highly toxic carcinogen linked to rare forms of liver cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, various forms of brain and lung cancers, and more. There's ethylene, glycol, monobutyl, ether, a bunch of stuff that I can't say. Isobutylene and officials are now saying, the EPA sent a letter to the rail company. Officials are now saying, we basically nuked a town with chemicals so we could get a railroad open. So, I want to play for you. I'm going to play a montage of this whole train derailment and I want you to really listen. It's hard to hear the pain in this man's voice when he is talking about how all of this transpired and the chemicals that this town has been breathing in this whole time watch. These aren't these aren't storm clouds. This is a burn off and he's bouncing. This is not storm clouds. Let's get it. This shows a Ohio cops arresting a national laser reporter for reporting on the situation and you can see all of the dead wildlife. Officials are claiming that the air and water are safe. Residents say they can still smell fish floating. They've complained about their eyes watering when they go outside and one woman says the noxious air killed her chickens. He started coughing really hard and just shut down and went very fast. I'm not kidding. This is within 10 miles of east palsy. So, the story was that they asked these people to evacuate as they basically blew up the trains to move them and but then they invited them back in. So, even one of the hazardous material specialists said I was surprised when they quickly told the people they can go back home but then said if they feel like they want their homes tested they can have them tested. I would have far rather they did all the testing. There's a lot of what ifs and we're going to be looking at this thing 5, 10, 15, 20 years down the line and wondering gee cancer clusters could pop up you know well water could go bad. This is what's happening in these people's homes and I'm sure that they have nowhere to go and they're being poisoned. Yeah, to Alex's point you can't help yourself but to play the scene of Bane in Batman. Just go you know how do you cause destruction? Look at that picture. How do you cause destruction and this is not conspiracy. When you look at what we are laying out in the air in this country the chemtrails and what we're doing. This kind of material traveling through a city by itself you know the dangers involved and when it happens and there's nothing from the administration there's no national outcry and retroactively how do you fix this? How do you it's already breathed in? Animals are dying and I always say the animals will tell you you know animals migrate before an earthquake comes they feel it. Animals are dying people are breathing things in you may not know for 15, 20 years of what you know what happened year and of course then you arrest the people who tell the truth. So which tells me that there's foul play here from beginning to end in how they handled it the cleanup of it sending people back home they should have evacked that whole place and locked it down with hazmat suits and said you want to give free money through covid and free money to Ukraine get these people out put them up in other cities you know break down this whole place and go in and study but no go back home children babies come on I mean the animals are dying what's happening to kids and what are people breathing in it's reckless I'll tell you that much it's completely reckless yeah another stain on this administration yeah it reminds me very similar to September 12th 2001 when the EPA said that the air around the World Trade Center site was fine and then you know fast forward 20 years and you have a massive amount of cops and firefighters that have terminal cancer and can't you know breathe or using some sort of oxygen device so I think that it's just very you know typical of the government for this massive thing to happen and it just gets no media attention so that's why I'm more worried about it it's like I don't have no idea what the offshoot of these chemicals and the glycogen and blah blah blah I know it's not going to be good but when the mainstream media is not covering this and giving this half as much attention as a balloon that makes my antenna go uh oh this is bad news yeah well our heart really goes out to anyone in that area um and especially the pets that got left there I feel bad for all the pets that makes me sick me too it really it really does make me um really sad and I mean yaku you brought up I think just such a great point which is you guys are spending billions of our dollars sending them to Ukraine and you cannot even take care of your own American citizens like what the hell are we doing here consistently right right every time every time every time they're faced with a choice they choose to put America last yeah I mean gee it's almost as if it's intentional well oh one last thing 10 for a hat Netflix is coming out with the show that depicts a natural disaster in East Palestine on Netflix yes look it up yes you're like

today with the offer code news over at patreon mobile dot com slash news that is offer code news over at patreon mobile dot com slash news all right so i want to get back to this uh project veritas ongoing saga so we talked yesterday for those of you who haven't heard we talked on yesterday last week about uh what's going on at project veritas seemed to be uh an attempt to oust james o'keef all of a sudden we heard that he was on pape leave um it was uh what february fifth or so and then there was a memo that uh leaked out that shows that a bunch of employees sent this memo to the board begging them to you know remove james o'keef or begging them to address it i should say begging them to address james o'keef's behavior they said he was unruly they you know there was a lot of hurt feelings which i find to be just hilarious like poor baby i mean like do you want to do you want a little pet on the head do you want to cooky like what do you want you want some more milk um and but but some of them in particular talked about these relationships that he had with the donors and that he was treating the donors horribly um one of them said james has become a power drunk tyrant and he is exactly who he pontificates on who we should be exposing and uh one of the donors who they talked about they said oh she came up and asked to take a picture with him and he was so rude and he said no and she was visibly upset she was so upset and we're just worried about how he's treating these people well this is donor diana remmers who came forward to refute all of these claims that james o'keef exhibited cruel behavior said the employees she said that uh the document completely mischaracterized her interactions with james let's watch some of her video watch hi there my name is diana remmers and i'm actually here in texico on vacation with my husband and um i've been made aware of uh allegations towards james of heat with project fairtose uh through the news a little bit on social media and whatnot and i realized actually one of the allegations and grievances towards james is about a situation that involved me with james in uh december i'm sorry november 2021 in florida david hortlewood's event where the allegations are that he was extremely rude to one of his donors which happens to be me and that's completely blown out of proportion um i asked him to take a picture and he you know had a lot of people running at him asking for different things and he wasn't thrilled about getting a picture at that moment but he did we have we actually after that we had a great conversation we've become great friends and i've had uh the best moron one and everyone he goes he's been a personal guest of mine at on a logo returning point event and i'm going to continue to support him and i'm really very disappointed in the petty allegations towards our absolute completely false and ridiculous so i will continue supporting james as long as he's with project fairtose because without project fairtose without james project fairtose is nothing so that's all i have to say just wanted to set the record straight and i hope everybody has a good day so again going back to this memo and they've not updated us at all the board right they were supposed to have some big vote on friday they had said these were the reports and then we haven't heard anything um probably because a lot of the donors have gotten together they've signed a letter they've retained a law firm um and they sent them a letter from this law firm saying uh we're telling you that this is actually going to violate a virginia statute of virginia law if you remove him and so it's just very fascinating because if you read did you guys read the entire memo from the the employees it read like a bunch of gen ziers who don't understand what it's like to be in a real job and were very upset that like they were held to you know a high standard right they were actually supposed to do their job they weren't there to be coddled they weren't entitled and they just seemed to be very upset about it now you hear something like this from one of the people who they said was horribly mistreated and she's like yeah no actually that isn't the case where all adults like he didn't want to take a picture he was really busy but he did and it was cool and we're friends now i don't know why they're using me as some sort of example of how james o'keepe is such a horrible person because i don't think he is very fascinating you know i had this conversation this morning that's exactly what i got from it i'm so over the feelings of this nation yeah i'm done with it okay yes and i understand we operate in the fruit of the spirit and we have to consider people's feelings but we can't run a country on feelings and you've got two generations here you've got you know millennials and gen z's that operate if feelings is their octane it's their fuel and if you hurt their feelings it means you don't love them so i read it as okay welcome to the real world you got a schedule you got to perform you got to earn it sorry and if your boss is having a tough day he's entitled to a tough day and get a little tough skin right shape up it's not abuse which your culture wants to tell you it's just called reality right all right so toughen up and the adults come out and they go wait a minute no guys an adult and by the way just because they are donors to james doesn't mean they own him yeah doesn't mean wherever he walks you stalk in the bathroom take a picture with a guy so i mean i've only had incredible interactions with him but again i can't help but reading that document in disco yep this is the world we live in right now feelings got hurt and because feelings got hurt the squeaky wheel wants to get degrees well and there's so it's just it was so dramatic like there was one part where an employee said you can't spit in an employee's face over a tweet true story well then they elaborate and it's like he was speaking so closely to them and he was passionate and he accidentally like got spit on them as he was talking much different you can't spit in a boy's face right well that's what this should be the biggest red flag is that they have to kind of misconstrue donors and try to create sort of drama and if this is the worst thing that james is every day put him on quote unquote probation or something you know you're not gonna just the guy started project very tough you're just gonna excumnicate him over a few complaints i mean he should at least if this if all these complaints are real let's just say they're all valid he should have the ability to correct those complaints because he is the top dog so if they're all given that ability you're like well something's fishy also don't for one second sorry sarah just count for a second that there are people that aren't in line with the true viewpoint of project veritas as lower level employees and whatever you go hey how do we take this thing down take down the top guy take down the foundation especially after he has the biggest video of the project veritas stuff it's just very unusual timing it really is that's why it's such weird timing i know there are a lot of people who are speculating like oh the board's been bought off by fizer which i mean maybe well that's i'm saying like i wouldn't i don't know if this is but i don't really think that i just show me some evidence right i'm just pure speculation but it just is just the timing seems very weird it almost seems like there is some sort of outside influence whether it's fizer whether it's whatever i don't know it just seems very weird that they're so motivated to get him out at this time when they're the hottest they've ever been yeah well and they're it's just they're doing such great work and that's what just really frustrates me about this isn't right now more important than what james is done yes that's what i'm saying and they they train james to your point you walk the guy as a board your job as a board is to give counsel then take a board and go hey james listen man are you frustrated are you little burnt out do you need to take a two month break bro do you personal you know but you don't the fact that they want him out tells me outside influence got the ear of people on the inside right and they're storing the pot in scripture tells you do not pick up another offense say oh but that donor was disappointed in the donor goes no not so much right that's quite okay that's stirring right right that's literally causing division yeah intentional well i mean it's just at a time when he is is anyone else doing the work that he's doing no nobody he's literally the only one who is doing the work right now that we absolutely need on the ground i mean you really have to wonder what the uh what is the motivation behind trying to oust him at this particular time it just doesn't seem to be good and again i i know people on both sides of this so i'm trying to keep as objective an opinion as i can but it's james o' keef and as much as the people in this letter wanted to say you know i i saw some of them like there's no project veritas without us i mean no no it that's like this is what an employee who looked at it you can't do this with that and he said oh watch me right watch me right you want to think that you're not replaceable you want to think you're irreplaceable you know what if you're a cog in the machine you're replaceable sorry to tell you you're replaceable they can train someone else who can do the job and you are replaceable james o' keef is not and i'm sorry if that hurts your feelings it's just that it's the truth so um all right let's uh let's go ahead and take another quick break but then when we come back oh i've got a good story for you guys childhood innocence is a myth according to a professor this one this one's head is about to experiment all right so i want to thank our

of doing both yeah so uh uh so he says babies as young as three months old have a sexual preference and not having to talk about and not having a talk about queerness is very white christian upperclass cisgendered and heterocentric so he of course he his instagram went bye bye he exposed he exploded and deleted his instagram but uh he had posted on his instagram previously about his mission to destroy the idea that children are too innocent to learn about sexuality and gender queer topics he said there is a common mythology that children live in this world of pure innocence and that by introducing or exposing them to real world adults are somehow shattering this illusion for him for them therefore there is a banning of topics and issues that children should not be exposed to as if they are not experiencing them already kids are never too young to learn about queerness by the way i'm sure it will come as no surprise to you that he says that if parents don't want to talk about certain mature topics with their children it was up to teachers such as himself good old mr willy to have that conversation with your child he said children are exploring and understanding gender association before they say their first words around three to four months old infants show a sex and gender preference in who they look at why is the fbi not banging down this guy's door right now because godly i'd sure like to see what's on his laptop mm-hmm yeah this is a better file that should be arrested this is a guy that most likely most likely have followed through on the act but this is also a guy that's a disciple he is a disciple because he's so unoriginal nothing about what he's saying is original Alfred Kinsey 1945 1952 performed sexual experiments on boys six weeks old saying that they enjoy no they want orgasm rewrites the sexual manifesto for the world's youth that's the same guy that then co-ops you heffner everything you know today comes from Kinsey's work Indiana University you discussed me because you fund and support the Kinsey Institute the Kinsey Institute the number one supporter of course of Planned Parenthood murdering children in the womb this guy's a disciple nothing he's saying is original it's copybook Alfred Kinsey report that's what he is and they believe it don't let these guys think this is just for likes by the way these guys will sodomize children they will abuse children and if we don't stop them this will become the norm so this guy should be investigated should be thrown under the jail not in the jail ten feet under the jail they should go look at every and they should actually go interview every single child that he's ever taught and ask did mr. Willy show you he's willy did mr. Willy try to touch you what did mr. Willy say to you but no of course the FBI's got other priorities right we're not going to defend children in this country there are a bunch of bastards yeah i mean it really is it's just like oh well this is just a conversation we should we need to have it's just a debate rather Alex this is a debate that we need to have an open debate on whether or not children should be sexualized yeah and i mean this is the weird thing for me it's the fact that he has access to children all day i mean he has these terrible views and there's a lot of people that have these views and they figure out how to ingratiate themselves within like the pre-k school system or some sort of like babysitter or some sort of daycare thing so it's just for me that's what's so scary is like not even just that these people exist but they're actually existing they're teaching our children they have access to the most vulnerable people plausible so i mean obviously this guy needs a full investigation but i mean he needs more than just an investigation but it's so it's so frustrating because that won't happen because his view is now i i wouldn't say commonplace but i would say that the academia is purporting it as like a valid viewpoint right so that's why i'm saying so now we're we're supposed to have an open debate here on whether or not children should be sexualized because they're promoting it as this valid viewpoint yeah i mean for him to say what a six month old has a sexual preference and all you know an incant consent basically i mean nobody this is why it's not going to be a debate even people when i get the messages when we go to the trans and when we expose that even gay people aren't on this even though they don't even align with it because they know it's apparent for children to be sexualized like this so i think this is a very niche thing i know it's becoming definitely more prevalent but the majority of individuals do not think that this is okay yeah do you know that we are in 48 states right now it's in every single curriculum in every state it's in texas it's every single curriculum it's sandwiched in between social studies and coloring for pre-k students our bill gets filed to wednesday in texas to remove all pornographic material from schools this is a war alex yeah this is a war where actually i'm going to say where are you church where are you conservative christian americans for standing up for the innocent they're telling you children are not innocent god jesus tells you that you put a millstone around your neck and drown yourself in the ocean then to what lead one of these kids astray never mind harm them sexualize them and abuse them the public outcry is not there yet sarah and that concerns me about america that we tolerate this that it's a topic of conversation that we don't go with fbi if you don't show up we're gonna show up like like they used to get bad guys out of town we're gonna show up and drive people into obscurity where they belong these guys should hide like rats in the sewer yeah they shouldn't be celebrated right by academia right and running around maps terminology um i i want to i want to go to uh one more school district here this is in new hampture and i so i am obviously not a man and i don't have man parts and i just want your opinion on this guy so this is a mil milford new hampshire school district that they're banning urinals um and let me tell you why so currently they have a policy that students may only use restrooms that match their sex not like what they falsely think that they are on any particular given day but the school board wants to change that and allow anyone to use the bathroom and there was a lot of back and forth on it and so now their uh compromise is well we'll have a boys and a girls but we'll get rid of the urinals in the boys restroom so that everyone can feel safe and we're just gonna have a bunch of single stalls and nobody can be like loitering around we can only have as many people as there are stalls in there at any particular time and the boys are pissed they were actually protesting uh saying we want we want urinals and we want them now and so you can see uh there's a video here they had about 45 minutes there was a walkout and they protested um and it's just again this is this is the crazy world that we're living in right now but what was the other story the other day of the other place that's installing urinals in the girls bathroom? like watching university at the university. They're installing so they're soaking. It's one college ever. It's one college they're installing. One of them one of these liberal arts car liberal colleges is installing urinals in the girls bathroom. Here's what I'm saying let boys be boys and let them become men again teach them to be under the tree for that for that matter on the outside have urinals this is insanity Sarah as a guy as a guy no we don't want to sit and pee yeah okay no thank you no thank you. It's like if you have to use a urinal that's because you're a dude and you should go to the dude's bathroom right? Yeah I mean I think it's pretty basic but like you know this is kind of the underlying thing that people don't realize so now basically they've turned the restrooms unisex like you can't tell so that's kind of what they want to do to us they want to make these children as you're saying that's basically what they want this is and that's why this bathroom issue is such like a you know hot topic debate because obviously nobody wants a trans man in a little girls bathroom I mean that's just like obvious. Well well the the the trans the biological male really would like to of course the little girls bathroom and I'm not saying every trans person wants to be but it's just that shouldn't be allowed you should have to go into a bathroom but well excuse me the only solution to this is their solution is a unisex bathroom so I feel like that's kind of the only direction that we can go to stop this and it's no Alex no no no what I'm just trying to say but not in my bathroom no in my bathroom my whole point is this is an analogy for what they want of our children they basically want them unisexed where they have no gender and they're trans it's a one they're in the middle yeah it's a very weird way to do it yeah I agree all right before we take a break I want to uh I want to tell everyone something we are if you're watching on youtube first of all if you're watching on blaze tv thank you so much we really appreciate you guys being a subscriber if you are watching on blaze tv's youtube I need you to do something next week you're not going to see this program on blaze tv's youtube it is only going to be on the news and why it matters youtube page so go over after this program make sure you are subscribed to the news and why it matters with sarah and solace youtube channel because you don't want to be the one that comes in next monday and you're like where's my show i'm telling you make sure that you go over and subscribe to the news and why youtube channel if you have not yet done so i'm going to remind you guys this week okay so don't complain to me if you forgot we got to take a quick break we'll be right back as i mentioned earlier in the program the perfect people to be on this show today could not have been planned more perfectly so the final trove of court documents related to the jeffrey epsene case will be released to the public in the next coming days these are all the secret documents that had uh this is allegedly they will name the uh the associates of jeffrey epsene and uh salacious allegations they say so it's related to 167 of jeffrey epsene's associates victims and employees it will be unsealed this is of course near ca has it been almost four years mhm oh my god that makes me feel so old i feel like it just happened two years ago maybe it's been the first wow well uh the court documents say that the alleged perpetrators are accused of serious wrongdoing and i'll believe it when i see it is all i have to say yeah i'm going to tell you what's going to happen this is going to be redacted it's not all the names we we know a lot of the names that should be there and i'll be able to tell you right away i don't think it's all the names and then again the names are released okay so you release the name now what you think anybody's going to be called to witness then you think anybody's gonna you you think you think if both lintons going to be called in to say uh sorry uncle bill come come come stand in front of cross examination jury of your peers until that happens there's no true justice for the victims right they're not calling them in so you release the names bubbling shame whatever right um let's see let's see what names and then let's see will action bring people into the court of law bring the survivors who are alive who can identify these guys bring them in well i mean let me just tell you something jeff rabson is accused of doing the most disgusting apparent things possible one of the things by jon luke brunell who's a model scout for his birthday actually gave him flew into his private island three 11 year old french twins and that was like jeff rabson would brag about how he slept with little twins that was like his one of his big major accomplishments and so my point is these are the most disgusting people ever and we know this like this is our all out in the open and the fact that we already know kevin spacey and there's an endless amount of celebrities are on the plane nobody gives a crap if the mainstream media would give half the amount of attention one for the amount of attention that they give all this you know craft that we don't even care about that doesn't matter about space balloons and blah blah or whatever the hell they're shooting out of the i'm not saying that that's not important but just give one one hundredth a much as much attention on the jeff rabson release but for me this is not going to be there'll be outrage between us but no real outrage against the people that matter so um i'm back i almost died yeah you okay well um but i have a theory we'll see this is just this is my own fun little conspiracy theory okay this says i'm not crying i just want to see she's very sad about this this leave okay so it says there is at least one public figure in the list of Epstein associates according to a declaration filed on wednesday what if the only public figure that they put forth is donald trump and they retract all the other names ah look they could look it was his best friend look they could pull a move like that but that statement tells you the names that we know should be on there is not going to be really one one public one public figure so they're going to list the guy that handled luggage at Epstein island right that handled the luggage and the pilot and the way come on man this is such a game it's such a farce to alex's point for us in the community fighting this every day this is it's a disgrace remember there are victims yeah real people yeah there are now 22 25 30 years old that were completely destroyed sexually there's no justice for them this is a disgrace but yeah that i they pull a move like that they would try something they're not going to give us the real information i mean they might you know expose something to get us distracted and get us mad at donald trump or something like that i wouldn't be surprised because that's what they love to say that donald trump is best friends and i think donald trump is one of the only people after a lot of it got exposed and i'm not just trying to white knight for donald trump that actually spoke out against you for a few kick them out and the trump set the trump tower and gave them all the information that's what i'm saying so trump i mean i think trump is fine they're going to say oh well he's friends with them so that you know negates them obviously i don't think that's the case yeah all right we got to take a quick break we'll be right back they're really good for them they may that may be a hell mary so mentally ill bill and movani put out a recent video saying he just like he just looked so pretty he looked so hot he could steal your husband ladies watch stay 335 of being a girl and i wanted to go on record to say that this might be the
