    "text": " And now from the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN, the AX files with your host David Axelrod. I've had the great pleasure over the last three years on election nights and debate nights to sit on a CNN panel next to Gloria Borger, the network's chief political analyst. And one of America's great veteran political journalists. I sat down with Gloria the day after the midterms last week to talk about the results, but also to talk about her remarkable career as one of the real pioneers among women in political journalism. Here's that conversation. Gloria Borger, good to see you on a eventful week. We're recording this the day after the midterm elections. And I'm going to get to all of that, the sacking of the Attorney General and all of that news because there's no rest for the weary. But I want to talk a little bit about your own journey first. Starting in New Rochelle, which as I remember was where Rob Petrie and Laura Petrie lived in the Dick Van Dyke show. So your quintessential suburban community in New York, tell me about your folks in New Rochelle. So I actually was born in the Bronx. And when my father opened an air conditioning television store with his brother, we moved to the suburbs, we moved to Dourchela, New York, but we lived in an apartment building, never lived in a house. My mother was a homemaker and my father commuted into the city every day. I went to public schools, culminating in the wonderful New Rochelle High School, which was a very large high school. I think my graduating class had six or seven hundred kids, very diverse. And it burned down my senior year. Oh my. There was an arsonist, actually my junior year, and then my senior year we went to school in trailers. And I actually just went back to New Rochelle High School to speak to the students there. And it was a phenomenal experience for me because it's now 2,500 kids, all kinds of education from kids who end up at Harvard to special vocational training. It's just an amazing place. So it was a wonderful place to go to high school. New Rochelle back then was probably not terribly diverse, right? It actually was. It actually was. It was divided by one road in town, but it actually was a pretty diverse high school. And my friends were black and white, which for those days, and I'm an old lady, was kind of amazing. And so that's how we grew up. And there were a lot of private schools around, but we couldn't afford it. And I'm glad I didn't go, actually. Now is politics discussed in the house? Politics was not a big issue in my house. My parents were Democrats, were Democrats, and it was just kind of assumed. But no, not really. Issues were discussed. Local issues were discussed. My mother was very involved. But politics, per se, not so much. I was the editor of my high school newspaper. You'll be surprised to learn. And so I was very involved with the politics of my high school. But at home, it was sort of much more traditional than the way my kids grew up in Washington, D.C., where politics was discussed nonstop. And you were the editor of the newspaper. What drew you to that? What drew you to journalism? I don't know. I think I've always been kind of a gossip, and I like to ask questions. The Huguenot Herald was what it was. And we put it out, I think, every couple of weeks. And so it was my great experiment because I loved it so much in high school. I knew. And it was crazy that early on. But I just loved the reporting. And I loved the writing. And I loved causing the faculty to get upset with what we were doing. So nothing's really changed. And I went to college. I was editor of my college paper. So I kind of stuck with that. And my husband always says to me, you're so lucky because you knew what you wanted to do from day one. I'm not sure I did. But I liked it. And I still do. Speaking of diversity, you brought some to Colgate, where you went to school as like an all-male preserve. Right. I was in the very first class of women. I'm the oldest living female graduate of Colgate University. So I was in the first class of women there. And that's a bold move. It was. Well, I loved the school. I was afraid of being a member of the first class. I actually wanted to go to Princeton, but I didn't get in. So Colgate was my second choice. And happily, I ended up there. But it was a very strange thing. When you think back on it, and I've talked to a lot of women at Colgate about it since, and Colgate is now 51% female, they prepared for us by putting plastic flowers in the urinals in the men's bathroom. And they gave us irons and ironing boards. And I remember my father turning to my mother and saying, I'm not going to leave her here. Do you? Now, the other night we were sitting together on election night, and you saw all of these women really were a big part of the story. A whole class, new class of women coming to the house. There were three or four women elected governors. And women really driving the story that women voters in, particularly in suburban areas. And women candidates, he's generally. So I ask you this in the context of your own experience. I mean, how did you process that? Well, I love it. I always think people turn to women when they need the mess cleaned up in many ways, works that way in my house. And I think that now people are turning to women because they are different, and they are authentic. And they provide something new. And I think that when you see a hundred women now in Congress, it's very exciting. I mean, I go back long enough to recall when women could not wear pants on the floor of the Senate, when there was no ladies bathroom outside the Senate chamber. I remember standing on the floor of the convention when Jerry Ferraro was nominated. For vice president, 84 and getting chills because I thought this is the beginning of something, only it really wasn't. But, but things never go in a straight line. Exactly, exactly. But I remember at that moment thinking this is different, this is the beginning of something and being disappointed time and time again. And not only in politics, obviously, but in every career. So to see this happen in politics is really exciting. The challenge now is to not judge women by a different standard. Yeah, you know, it's interesting. I got a note, kind of an angry note from a friend of mine, very, very powerful woman in business who said, how can you call it the year of the woman when, you know, two women senators were defeated. But the fact is part of becoming, of integrating women into the political processes that they're going to win and they're also going to lose. And there were obviously there's an, there'll be another additional woman senator who come in this year because of what happened in Arizona, Nevada, a woman got elected. But it would, the more it becomes not unique, I think is progress for the country. The thing about these women candidates who came in, so many of them were first time candidates, first time politicians. From the military, a lot of them? Yeah. Yeah, they had credentials. It was Abigail Spannberger from the CIA. Right. No, it was, I have to tell you, I've been brooding about the fact that I think in our own little panel last night, there was a rush to sort of kind of, a rush to judgment about what was going to happen last night. It turned out to be a pretty inspiring night from the standpoint of 114 million people voted. These women and not just these women, but all over the country, these stories of people who stepped up and said, you know what, I'm not going to sit on the couch. I'm going to get involved. I think, and even these people who lost, you know, Beto Rourke was an inspiring story. He'll be back. He will be and may be sooner than we think there's an awful lot of pressure on him to take his act national. You know, I think Donald Trump today in his press conference tried to make it seem as if he was just fine with the Democrats taking back the house. Yeah, we had. Yeah, he tried to make it sound that way, but then he made it clear he wasn't fine. He wasn't fine with it. He doesn't want them exercising their oversight. Right. And he threatened to retaliate against them. And of course now with Jeff Sessions resigning or being fired actually, they're going to investigate it. I thought Ron Kline, my old White House colleague, wrote a good column in the post today in which he said he thought Democrats should spend the first hundred days working on legislation to address some of these concerns about health care and other issues that their constituents voted for them to deal with. And I agree with that, but they may be forced to act more quickly because if it looks like and it does look like the president's doing an end run. Well, Nancy Pelosi was very clear. I mean, you know, immediately Donald Trump said, effectively, I can't work with you if you decide to do your job, which is to oversight. And Nancy Pelosi said, whatever we do, we'll do it the right way and in our own time. And you can be sure it'll be organized. And it's going to be, you know, it's going to be within the within the rules. And so I think Ron is right. And I think and Pelosi pointed out, look, there are things maybe we can work together on like preexisting conditions, for example, pharmaceuticals, drug prices, infrastructure, get those things done because their constituents care about that, about drug prices. But you can walk and chew gum at the same time. Yes. I don't think Donald Trump can because he can't compartmentalize. And so, and we saw that today. So I think that she will try and do it, but there's no doubt in my mind that some point is just going to collapse. As long as we're on the subject, what of Pelosi? You know her very, very well. I know her well. You know, I there is this conundrum for some of these new members because they campaigned and said they weren't going to vote for her. And now they're here. Right. And there's a caucus. It's no one knows who you voted for. Right. Well, you know the old Mo Yudal thing? I want to thank the six, the 120 people who committed to vote for me in the 60 who actually did. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, that's true. But I think a lot of them pledged not to vote for her on the floor of that house. I mean, tell me about her as a. I look, I think Nancy Pelosi and David, you know this better than I do because you went through the health care war without Nancy Pelosi. When it happened. Right. When it happened. Right. So she is an amazing vote counter. She knows how to get people together. She understands she's transitional. She's 78 years old. She gets it. Wouldn't you want her on your side? If running if you've got to bring generations together and try and get legislation through at least one or two things, you know how it was with health care. She was your guide dog. Right. Listen, her determined the president's determination was matched only by hers. And there was a period of time after Ted Kennedy died and after Democrats lost a special election in Massachusetts when it looked like health care, health reform was dead. And she and the president and Harry Reid quietly mapped out a strategy to revive it and pass it. And she had to work very, very hard to get her caucus to go along with it because they had to accept a Senate bill that they didn't want because the Senate was not going to vote again on this. And it was, it was, I have no, listen, there's no one within those four walls better than her at this process. And she knows that too. But it's the outward facing piece that these, and that's, it's, it's, it's going to be interesting to watch how she navigates this and how the caucus navigates this. And how Trump deals with her because he doesn't deal with women very easily. So we'll, we'll see how that goes. Yeah. Well, um, Rahm Emanuel always says about Pelosi. People need to remember she's not a Pelosi. She's a dellisandro. She's the son of a Baltimore mayor and ward boss. And I asked her on my podcast on this podcast once, how, what did you learn from growing up with your dad? She knows how to count. And she, she knows how to count. She does. She does. And, and had a service, the needs of all of her members and understanding what they, yeah, I, I see, I see the need for generational change there. I see the need. I see the problems of the members, but they're going to have a hard time finding someone. Yeah. Who's the natural replacement? Right. There is an any. It was going to be Joe Crowley. He's gone. Gone. So you left Colgate. Uh, you, you went on a fellowship. Yes. Study the British press. That must have been an experience. So that may have prepared you for today's environment. Yeah. I got a Watson fellowship first before that. I, so when I graduated Colgate, I got this fellowship and, um, it was 65 hundred percent dollars if you were single and eight thousand dollars if you were married. So I called my now husband and proposed and I said, well, come on over. Well, we're going to get married. Let's go to London together. And so, uh, he knows what he's worth. Right. And then, uh, so we, so well, and today's dollars. Yeah. Today's dollars. So we went to, uh, so we lived in, we lived in London for a year and, um, it was great. He was working at the time in Buffalo. So we had to make a choice between the Buffalo Courier Express and living in London for a year. That was tough. That's good. Well, if he had made the other decision, you would have known you at the wrong person. Right. Right. And then I, and then I came back and I had worked at the Washington Star, the now defunct evening newspaper, which is a lot legendary. I worked for them during my summers in college. I worked for the legendary Jack Germant who hired me. We should explain because there are people who won't know that Jack Germant was a legend in political journalism in this country. I mean, there was a core, the boys on the bus from, uh, from the, that famous book in 1972, but there were a bunch of reporters who just traveled the country, uh, knocking on doors and maybe the doors of a few saloons. Maybe. And, uh, and, but really had a sense of what was going on. You know, David Broder was one of them from the Washington Post and I, uh, uh, uh, David Marinus, one of his proteges, uh, uh, told me that he was sitting in a lunchroom after one of these pre-, after presidential election at the post with, with Dan Balts and, and David Broder and Broder just sort of out of nowhere said it was like the February after the inauguration of the president and Broder said, don't you just feel like going up to New Hampshire and knocking on some doors? What? But that's, that was the, what, these, that, and you know what? They're, they're, that kind of journalism is harder to practice today. Well, it is. And that's, you know, that was my introduction, you know, to covering politics because Germant hired me and took a shot on this kid and, uh, Mary McGrory was, it was a columnist at the Washington Star. And she would travel with us. And Germant was, it was just amazing to work with him because he would, it was at a time when you covered politics, when you went down to the bar at night and the candidate would actually come down and have a drink with you. Yes. And there was such a thing as off the record. Right. Which does not exist anymore. Right. Yeah. And there are no more relationships. And Germant was sort of a master at that. And the candidates, what stunned me as this young baby reporter was the candidate, like whether it was Mondale or whoever it was, would ask Germant what he was hearing and was he doing okay? Yeah. And, and they would, they would have conversations not only about policy, but about what was going on on the road. And it was, so it was, it was amazing to learn from somebody like Germant who, who knew the macro politics, but also the micro politics. And there weren't a lot of us women at that time. I mean, now I would say political journalism is over half female if I had to guess. But there weren't a lot. Right. And, and for Jack to sort of open the door to a bunch of us, Maureen Dowd. Yes. Was your fellow at the Washington Star? Yeah. And so we, we were able to learn from these guys and they were, they were terrific to us. They just couldn't have been better and more welcoming. And so it was an, these experiences kind of got me into political reporting. When I went to the Washington Star, they asked me if I wanted to cover education. Which was traditionally where female reporters were shuttled off to. Right. Would you like to cover education? And I said, no, no, not really. And they said, well, that's how you'll get your start. So instead I covered, I said, I don't really want to cover education. And I said, well, the only place we can put you is in Prince George's County covering the county politics. And I said, great. I'll go there. So I drove 45 minutes every day in a car, a little old car provided by the Washington Star that broke down. And then I covered that and then I covered the Annapolis legislature. And so I got into politics kind of through the, the back door until German kind of brought me on the more national scene. Part of that whole idea of shuttling off the young female reporter to the education beat was the fact that these were male preserves these, I mean, I grew up in a newsroom at a, you know, about the same time. And so you must have, you mean, we're in the me too era now. The things that, the things that are now, I think properly unacceptable were pretty commonplace that they were. And I, and you know, I just was chatting with a bunch of women my age about looking back on what we kind of put up with. And it's interesting because, you know, I'm lucky enough never to have been harassed in the way that so many of these women were. But you know, we all had experiences like my first boss whom I loved and it was now gone, you know, once told me after I had been at the star for, he was a Metro editor, after I had been at the star for a while. Well, you know, I only hired you because I thought you had good legs, but you turned out to be okay. And I came home that night and I said to my husband, you, but whatever, I just, we didn't, I just knew that that was sort of the way it was. And looking back, there's a lot of stuff we shouldn't have put up with, but we didn't have numbers. We didn't have confidence in the ways that women do now. And I speak with my younger colleagues. They're much more confident than I was as a young woman because they're more of them around. And we didn't have as many women to go to. And we didn't have role models or mentors that was unheard of. And so it was just a very, very different environment. And so I'm so glad that women now can talk to each other about things that we never did before. I had a conversation here with Judy Woodruff about her experiences being the weather girl on local TV on her way up to becoming one of the first female White House correspondents. And you forget, you know, right? Totally. What those days were like, you also did, you must have done sort of like we all did the occasional police stuff and covered cops. Five AM went to a scene of a crime and almost had to go out and throw up in the hallway. I'll never. And the cops were very nice to me. But yeah, I did it. I did the copy. So it was journalism at newspapers, as you know, very well as an apprentice. Yes. Yeah. And you want to experience it all. And I'm sad that we're so segmented now in even in our digital world. People cover certain things. So but the way we grew up covering, covering, writing for a newspaper was you did all kinds of things. I mean, my editor of the Washington Star, Jim Bellows, legendary, legendary, wonderful, started a daily soap opera in the newspaper. And I was, he picked me as one of the writers. We had seven writers. It became a book called Federal Triangle, not even Remanded anymore. And we wrote it under a pseudonym called Hardy Mums. One of the writers was Diana McClellan, who used to write The Ear, do you remember that? And Maureen was a, so we, and we segmented it and we did it anonymously. And it was hilarious. And he had this great idea. So we did that. And we, so we did a little bit of everything. And it was just a great experience to be able to do that, not just come in and say, I'm an old, you know. When I came to the Tribune as right out of college, I knew a lot about politics then. I had covered it for a local newspaper there. And my city editor was this guy named Bernie Judge, still around, great mentor. And he said, you know, you know everything about politics of this city, probably more than anybody I have. You don't know how to be a reporter. So you're going on nights. And I, it was the greatest education I could ever have. And I saw a part of life that I never was exposed to. And you know, it did make me a better reporter. It was, it was a great experience. You went on to Newsweek, the star folded. The star, yes. Well, yes. And I went, well, the star was bought by Time magazine. And Jim Bellows was fired. And I didn't like that very much. So Joe Alberton was the owner and I cried to him in the newsroom saying, how can you fire Jim Bellows? Which is probably not a great move. And I did go to, I did go to Newsweek. The legendary Mel Elfen hired me, hired me at Newsweek. And we had an amazing bureau. I mean, that was the Newsweek bureau and the, and the craft of writing for a news magazine and reporting for a news magazine was an education in itself because you, it was a luxury because you actually had a week to do a story. Imagine that. Right. Which is, yeah, I think that that there is, there is a great advantage to that. And then, but there's all, you know, I always needed the deadline to motivate me. And we used to write Thursday nights and then it would get sent up to New York and then they would rewrite it. And then, but, but it was, you could have a week of reporting. Which was so great at looking back on it. What a luxury that was. It's one of the things that the new modern media environment doesn't permit. And you wonder about the, I mean, people do amazing work under difficult circumstances and deadlines here. I don't wonder, I know that something's been lost because we've lost a strata of editors who used to read, copy and ask the right questions. Right. And we've lost the time for reflection. And you know, the premium is on speed, get it online and, And getting, and this is the other thing which, which it's getting to know your sources. I mean, I was their chief congressional correspondent and I would spend my weeks in the, in the lobbies of the chambers, pulling members off the floor to talk to them, not on the phone, not by text, but one on one person to person. And I still believe there is nothing that replaces that. And you know how we all do this by shorthand. I'm texting sources. Right. All the time. Right. But there's not that connection that you had when you were sitting in the speaker's lobby every day and actually talking to them. And that's how I got to know Dick Cheney so well when he was head of the House Republican conference. He was the ideas man, which his daughter is now running for that job. And he was a different man when he was in the, when he was in the house, I might add. But, but it, but members, members like to do that. And it was such a great experience. And there's no replacing it. Big vivid figures then, including the speaker was tip on Neil probably when he was. Yep, he was. And he was, you know, he had a daily presser in his little office. And we'd all go in every day at noon. And tip would speak to the press every single day. And he'd make a lot of mistakes. He threw in the towel once on the tax bill that Ronald Reagan wanted, if you'll recall. And, but I also remember speaking of being a woman when I was pregnant, he'd come in every day and he'd pat my belly and then he'd go, and then he'd just sit down at his desk and he'd say, how you doing, darling? You know, and he was so wonderful. I wouldn't have thought twice about that, right? But he was a very available speaker. Yeah. And. Yeah, all that, all that's gone. All that, all that is completely gone. You went to US News and World Report. I think that's where I probably first came across you and you spent another 10, 11 years there. I forget how many. So my editors from Newsweek ended up running US News and, and oh no, David Gurgen hired me actually at US News. I mean, between his, well, more circumimant. Many stints in government. More conservative bought US, bought US News. And my, I had a couple of editors from Newsweek who went over there and, and David Gurgen went over there and they hired me there. And it was, you know, it was great. It was a wonderful place to work. And then when Gurgen went to the White House, I took over his column at, at the magazine. So we were an underdog, but we did, we did pretty well. And now to think that there were three news magazines is stunning. It used to, I don't know about for you, but it used to be that I couldn't get through a Sunday night or a Monday without looking at the covers of all three magazines. That doesn't exist anymore for me. Right. Do you? No, no. Well, it's kind of an anachronism. It is. It is. Given the modern media template. And then, and then you, you, you moved over to television or in part of that part. So as, yeah, as part of a, and that was a long transition into full-time television. But talk to me about making that transition from print to TV. To TV. So I, I think what, what happened is that, um, I was lucky enough that, that CBS was trying to bring more women on board and needed contributors. So I went on Face the Nation a couple of times and Bob Schiefer was nice enough eventually. I became sort of a sidekick on Face the Nation for about five or six years. And, and a contributor to CBS Evening News, sometimes standing out on the porch of the Hay Adams with Dan Rather during Lewinsky, which was awfully frightening to me. I mean, I was so intimidated by Dan. And, so I, and I have always thought that it's turned out really strangely because I always thought as I age, well, print will always be there and TV goes away. But it's turned out just the opposite because print isn't always there. I mean, I can write for CNN.com anytime I want. I do. But I never anticipated that, that the print outlets, and now there's digital obviously, but the traditional print outlets that I thought would always be there for me went away. You know, US News is a magazine, but it's, it's a lot about guides and, and Newsweek is very different and newspapers are in trouble and everything else is booming. And how's reporting differ here? Not just here. Well, I want to talk about, about CNN, but just reporting as a, as a journalist when you're reporting for TV and you have to think about images and when you're, well, so there's, there's different, there are two different things because I do a lot of long form for, for CNN. So there's, there's a lot of different ways. When you're just reporting for on air, you're reporting for the next headline. You're, you're on your phone while you're sitting on a set. We all do it. Right. When you're, when you're writing a documentary or when you're writing a 10 minute piece, you're thinking about what your pictures are going to be, which is very different, which is, you know, how can I weave this story given what I, given the pictures that I have, which I never had to think of as a, as a print reporter. I also think in many ways when you do interviews and you know this yourself, when you do an interview for print is very different from when you do an interview for television. Yeah. And because when you do an interview for television, you're thinking of the next question and how do I make this, the architecture of this interview work where there's a beginning, a middle and an end. And when you're doing it for print, it doesn't really matter. And so it's a very different interviewing is a completely different skill for television than it is for print. And I think more difficult, I think much more difficult. Because as you know, it's very difficult to get people to be more honest when the cameras on them. It is. Yeah. No, it's, it's hard. And you've been at CNN now for since 2007. Talk to me about the evolution of cable news for better and worse in our. Yeah. Well, first of all, let me say something. CNN is the most dynamic place I've ever worked. Just look at the day today. You know, we, or yesterday, we had an election yesterday and today Jeff Sessions is out. And CNN has to be on it every minute. Yeah. So it's, it's a very demanding parent. It's very demanding and it's very labor intensive. More than a network where you have 22 minutes in the evening morning show, you know, CNN is a show 24 seven. And so it demands more stamina. In many ways as a reporter, it demands you to have a greater depth of sourcing because anything happens. For example, I've been on the Russia reporting team and that's been great because I've had to develop different kinds of sources and stretch my muscles in different ways. I'm not an intelligence reporter, but who knows? Yeah. I mean, it's been, it's been an amazing experience. Let's just stop right there for a second because and get back to the, the story of the moment. Having covered this investigation from the beginning. What happens now, do you think? Well, I don't think it's going to be over tomorrow, the way a lot of people do. But I think right now it's in jeopardy. I think the Mueller investigation is in jeopardy. How far along do you think he is? Very far. I think he has probably written a report. I think he is in negotiation. I know he's in negotiations with the president's attorneys. They exchange written answers to questions about collusion, but I think it's still an open question about whether they might want to subpoena the president. If he doesn't want to testify in person. I think that is still being negotiated. I don't know if that's that Donald Trump off. I have no, you know, I have no idea. I think, I think Mueller has farmed a lot of stuff out to the Southern District of New York and to other places that he cannot. So you think he's been planning for this exigency? Yes. It would shock me if he didn't have a plan knowing that Jeff Sessions was going to be fired. I think the big question now is what happens to Rod Rosenstein. And because Rod Rosenstein, who is Jeff Sessions number two, is in charge of the Mueller investigation. So if Mueller were to want to subpoena the president or issue his report, it has to go to Rod Rosenstein and get approved. But no longer because the attorney general won't be recused. Well, that's right. And Rod Rosenstein no longer has authority over Mueller. This happened an hour ago. So does Rod Rosenstein stay? Does he, what happens? What happens or has the entire top of the Justice Department been decapitated? I don't think this is just unraveling in real time. Do Sessions and Rosenstein now, are they free agents, do you think, to testify before Congress? I don't can the president invoke executive privilege. Well, I don't know the, I really don't know the answer to that. Let's see what happens with Rosenstein. I mean, so all the interviews that have been done with Mueller, the White House has not invoked privilege on conversations with people who work in the White House. Including the White House counsel. But they reserve the right to invoke it later. So you could have Mueller, this is going to be a very big issue and it could be a bit of a crisis. You could have the Justice Department redact most of it because the White House says it's privileged and then have a half report go to Capitol Hill, which will create havoc, particularly now with a Democratic House. And there would be a fight over that. There would be a fight over privilege. And it could go to the Supreme Court. I mean, I just envision this potentially happening. So with all now, we don't know what's happening in Rosenstein. We don't know whether Whitaker is going to, what's going to happen to him. I mean, he's acting and you can do that under a Federal Vacancies Act for 200 days, but it's only temporary. Seems to me Mueller had to know something like this could happen. He's, they're too smart, but I don't know what his plan B is. I just, I don't know. You must know him though. I know, you know what, I did a 10 minute piece on him and he speaks to nobody. So I have interviewed a lot of people who know him really well, but I can't say that I know him other than by his reputation and by the testimony of people who worked with him for years who tell very funny stories about him, which in my favorite of which is that we got a couple of them. One is he called Eric Holder at one time. He asked for a demotion because he wanted to get back on the beat. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and then somebody who worked with him in private practice, you know, he never stayed in private practice for very long because this person said to me, you know, he'd sit down with his white collar client and the client would tell him the story. And then Mueller would say, well, sounds like you're guilty. You want to plead. And that didn't go over too well. So he's always, he's always preferred to stay in government. I mean, he's a real prosecutor. I heard one from, from someone whose brother worked for him when he was a U.S. attorney and he would call a meeting at six in the morning, call his senior staff together and he'd always start the meeting up by saying, what have you done for your country today? Oh, really? At six in the morning. Well, my, you know, he only wears white buttoned down shirts. And I was told when he had a Christmas party at his house, which was called for six to nine at nine o'clock, he started flipping the lights on and telling people it was time to leave. Yeah. Yeah. No, he's a, I mean, I had a couple of encounters with him, not just sitting in a room when he was briefing the president on one thing or another. And he was right from central casting. And I would say I didn't say a word because he's scared the hell out of me. Yeah. I could, everybody who works for him says, they call him the boss. You know, when you go into the boss, it's all business. And he asks you 50 questions. He makes a decision. And then there's the next thing. There's no quippet saying there's nothing. I do think don't you that the election of a democratic house this week, that it complicates things for Trump because they're not going to be eager to see Mueller silenced curtales, stymied in his, in his, in his work. No. And I think, you know, Chuck Schumer today, that's the Senate side, but they're, you know, they'd like to pass legislation that guarantees that he can keep his job. But whether you could do that in the lame duck or how that would occur would, is not, is not quite clear. There have been, I should point out, lots of Republicans last year who said firing Mueller would be the red line. And of course he hasn't fired Mueller. He's fired sessions. But whether Republicans now still believe that or care about it and, you know, Mueller in our exit polls last night, Mueller's popularity was under water. And I'm sure Donald Trump looked at that. It was 46 disapprove to 41 approve. Yeah. Yeah. I, Trump may have looked at it. I don't think Mueller probably gives a, not, not at all, not about it. So what about the election and what is, how do you interpret the results I mentioned earlier? There was, you know, the early part of the evening was interpreted as dark from a democratic standpoint because of some of the early defeats. But the fact is that Democrats did take the house. Yeah. And there was some house seats in unsuspected places in South Carolina and two seats in Houston and Dallas, suburban areas surrounding Houston and Dallas. So elected six governors ousted Scott Walker in Wisconsin. I think it was a bit, look, I, look, I don't know if you were your second home state Senator John Tester. Despite the president's best efforts, managed to win reelection. Right. Look, I think that it's a huge deal. The Democrats took the house and, and I don't know if you would use this word, David, you know more about these things than I do. But I think we're seeing the beginning of a real realignment in American politics and that the president can go back to the red States, all he wants and he's got his base, etc. And that party beyond Trumpism, you can't lose women 60 40. You can't lose independence by 12 points. You just can't. He won independence by four points in 2016. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a big story. And the, and the people the Democrats brought in were not the sort of Republicans like to say it's the wild-eyed progressives. These were George H.W. Bush moderate, moderate Republicans now Democrats that they brought in. I mean, these were not, these are not raging liberals that they brought into the House of Representatives. These are suburban, moderate Republican districts. So when you talk about a realignment and the Democratic party looks very different, I mean it's white, suburban, well-educated, wealthier, plus minorities. I mean white plus minorities who are largely Democratic. And the Republican party is shriveling into this sort of older demographic and eventually you know you can put off the inevitable only for a certain amount of time. But they've got to find, they've got to find new people. Right. And last night showed me is yes, Donald Trump can win in the places he won in 2016 and do very well. Maybe, maybe. But when you consider the fact that he took, the Republicans took quite a beating in Pennsylvania, in Michigan, lost Walker in Wisconsin. Pencil, yeah. They did better in Ohio though, Sherrod Brown won reelection there. Those were really the states that, I mean along with Florida that delivered the presidency to Donald Trump. So it is shrinking a little even in the sort of what he, those three states who were talking about, they're not guaranteed. And he does have a great deal of blue collar support. I think Democrats have to find a way to get that back, which they, because Donald Trump has done very well with blue collar support. Well, I think, you know, it seems to me, and I said this at the time I was sitting right next to you, when I said it, that Democrats made a mistake in 2016 by sending this very pronounced message that, you know, we've got women, we've got young people, we've got minorities. So we don't really need the rest of you. Exactly. And that's why the deplorables thing resonated so poorly out there. And if you tell people they're not needed, they're not part of something, they're going to believe you. Exactly. And it made Donald Trump's mission or his strategy easier. But it's hard to think of a president, and you worked for one, and he, who wouldn't, after you're elected, go out and try and expand rather than contract. That's the, that's generally the strategy. Generally the strategy is to tell people who didn't vote for you, here's why you should have voted for me, and I'm for you too, because I'm the president of everyone. And Donald Trump just has never done that. And he would only went to places during the campaign where he would get full adulation and knew that he could make a difference, and then handed the house to Paul Ryan and then blamed him. So I think that's who Donald Trump is. And, and then today he shamed all these people by name who didn't ask him to campaign for him in the, and he sort of said, I don't know, am I happy that they lost? I don't know. Am I happy? Am I sad? These are Republicans. Yeah. What, do you, do you talk to him? Trump? No. It's hard for anybody at CNN to speak with the president. Let me ask you about that, because, you know, when I was in the White House, CNN was the place that we wanted to be, because CNN had such a broad reach. It wasn't just people who liked Obama. It wasn't just people who hated Obama, but there were people who were independent and so on. It seems as if the president's mission has been to partisanize, you know, his relationship with CNN. So as to, as to sideline it or try to as a, and I know we both work for this, that, it's CNN so I, but this is a clinical question. That's a, that's a challenge because I know there are a lot of people here who, who are very assiduous about what they do, you among them, for whom this is an, an, an unexpected place to be. It's, it's really unusual to be called the enemy of the people and fake news and, and you know, when we started out this campaign, because our boss, Jeff Zucker, had a preexisting relationship with, with Donald Trump because he after all put him in the apprentice and made him a star. So they had a fine relationship. It was fine. And in fact, I believe thinking back on it, you may remember this too, that CNN came under a lot of criticism for running too many of Trump's. Well, without question live. Why are you doing that? And I'd hear from the Bush campaign, why are you giving him all this free media? And they had a point. They actually had a point. I think we probably did run too much of Donald Trump live. Donald Trump live was captivating. It was good television. As he knows. I mean, that's the thing, you know, that there are, you know, elite opinions of Donald Trump that sort of reduce him to a kind of cartoon character. He helps sometimes on that, but it kind of, it minimizes who he, I mean, he has a real genius for the modern media environment and understanding it, understanding the symbiotic relationship between him and the news media. And, you know, you saw today, now whether it was his intent or not, I don't know whether he wanted to advance the story of whether he just stepped on it. But he knows that at any moment, he can send the news cycle skittering off into another direction. And that all he has to do is be outrageous enough. Yeah. And he is. And that's why our weeks are so crazy. I mean, we, you can barely remember what happened on Monday on Friday. I mean, and, and, and, and look, politicians, it's as old as the ages, attack the media. I don't know one president who loved the media all the time. Without question. Right. Of course. And with good reason, a lot of the time. But he's... Well, sort of set up that way, wasn't it? Yeah. That's why the founding fathers wanted a free job. It's our job to ask tough questions. Right. And, and today it is press conference. The president was not only snippy with us and critical, but he actually accused an African-American reporter of asking a racist question. And he, he was dismissive and talked about, you know, everything is the press's fault. It works. I mean, attacking the media works. And it's his tried and true. And if he doesn't have any other particular enemy, this is as good as anything else. Also, as he told, he told, I think it was Leslie Stahl not in this interview. Yeah. Was she, was it she who, yes, she, he told her, I want to, I want to make sure that people, that when you write bad stuff about me, people dismiss it. Right. And so that's why I go after the media. The media. But it's hard when he goes after the media and he says I didn't say that and it's on tape. Right. So that's a little bit difficult. The relationship with CNN is now very difficult. And you know, after the pipe bombs and I guess three of them were sent to two contributors and one to CNN in Atlanta, I think that it didn't get any better. And I think that I've never worked anywhere that was having an open discussion with the president, discussion as in quotes, discussion with the president about our role as a free and independent press as we are now. And so we're under attack every day and you just, you just do your job. There's just nothing else you can do. It does strain relationships with people who work at the White House. Although I must say a lot of people who have revolved in and out of the White House who I talk to on a regular basis understand what's going on. And it doesn't stop them from remaining sources of mine. And the president complains about all these fake news and these fake sources. And of course, you know, there are a lot of people that he knows who are talking and he talks to the press. You know, he'll call up Maggie Haberman or he'll, yeah, and he'll say I don't know her. Well, or of course he does. So it's, he plays that game too. He's done it his whole life. He used to pose as his own PR guy. Yes, John Miller. Yeah, John Barram. And he started out, you know, doing really well with the press with New York tabloids. He was the star of New York. And so I think now this is kind of a whole different ballgame for him. And he doesn't like any criticism period when your president, if you're not criticized, you're not doing anything. What do you think the, what do you think this election meant relative to 2020? Well, look, I think as you were pointing out the Donald Trump, I mean, the fact that Florida is remains for him maybe, right? Yes, is important. But Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, big states for him may not be available to him. And I think he thinks of everything in terms of 2020. So I do think it has impact. The one thing we haven't talked about, which is, OK, the governors are so important. Yes. Because you need a governor on your side if you're running for president. They have the infrastructure and then redistricting, which is huge. And you see the state legislatures. I mean, in the Obama years, I think a thousand state legislative seats were lost. I'm not sure all of them were made up last night, but I think a lot of them were. Seven legislative chambers that switched. Right. From the Republican state. So I think that is hugely, we've usually underplayed it because it's only day one. But that's going to have an impact for decades. So I think that you don't see it right in front of your eyes right now, but it will make a very, very big difference. And that's good for the Democrats. So I think that it was a hugely consequential election, usually consequential. I think emotionally what we heard from some of our panelists last night, like Van Jones, who was upset about Stacey Abrams or Gillum. It was sort of these were the emotional stars of the cycle. And if they didn't win, that van called it heartbreaking, I think. But the real story is that the Democrats made amazing headway here and control the house. And now have something to say about the agenda. Which they did not before. Yeah, not only things to say about the agenda, but also to block things that like the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. And checks and balances. Yeah. I mean, they can do their job of oversight. That's their job. And so they can start asking questions about what happened in the Puerto Rico hurricane. Right. What was behind the policy of separating children from their parents. Right. At the border. Right. These questions can be asked about what's going on at the EPA. Right. Right. And those things, the American public want answers to that. What's, who is lobbying the EPA? Who's got the top jobs there? What are these revolving doors we're hearing about that? So industry working with environmental protection and having too much influence. Yeah. So I think the Democrats will do that. I think there's a danger as you know. Overdoing. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. We'll see. So on my way out, I got to ask you, where do you think we come out on this? When some day Donald Trump will not be President of the United States, he will have been an oversized presence. You know, for better or worse, depending on your point of view, but in our politics. How will our politics have been changed in our country? How will it have been changed as a result of this epic? It's, you know, I, I don't know the answer. I'm not trying to dodge your question, but I really don't know the answer that. I like to think that the pendulum in American politics swings. And that after it. Well, it always has. And after a Donald Trump, it's just, it's just like you got Jimmy Carter, you know, after a Donald Trump, you may get somebody who is the opposite. You know, after Petey Barnum, maybe you get to somewhere, somewhere more in the middle because the public is tired, exhausted, exhausted, exhausted by it. And try not to leave the people out that the Democrats, the deplore, the so called that Hillary's mistake, you know, try not to leave so many people behind. And that, and that both parties will learn from it. But I can tell you now the Republican Party is the Trump Party. There is no other Republican Party. And maybe there'll be a third party. Who knows? But, but, but there is no other party. When I did this documentary on Trump, and I can end with this if you want, that, that I sat down with Ryan's previous who was in chair of the RNC. And I asked him as before the convention. And I asked him, I said, okay, so is this the party of Trump? And he got, Ryan's is a very sweet person and he doesn't get angry. He got really angry at me and said, what do you mean? Is this a party of Trump? We're not the party of any one person. We're the Republican Party. Not sure he'd answer the same way today. Exactly. And he got mad at me and I said, well, he said, no, no, no, we're not the party of Trump. And today, it's the party of Trump. He owns it, he operates it, he believes he saved it. In the Senate. Right. And it's about him. And I don't know how long that can last, but that's what it is right now. We shall see. I look forward to sitting with you and many, many more interesting nights in the, in the years to come. I have to tell everyone, I supply David Axelrod with his Twizzlers. Yes, she did. Every election night. And we both, by the end of election nights, were sick to our stomachs, but I bring the Twizzlers. You know, you know from my doctor. Gloria Bawger, great to be with you.
