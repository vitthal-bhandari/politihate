    "text": " Hard hitting medical truth, cutting through conflict and confusion to the understanding you're searching for. Join Dr. Peter McCullough, world-renowned medical expert and practicing physician for this edition of the McCullough Report. Your life may depend on it. Let's get real, let's get loud. On America, I'll talk radio. This is a McCullough Report. And I'm Dr. Peter McCullough. It's a great pleasure to welcome to this week's show, Dr. Miriam Grossman. Dr. Grossman is an MD child psychiatrist who is in practice. She is a clinical scholar and has done tremendous research on some topics that are of great interest in the news today. And she'll have a new book out that I imagine all of us are going to want to have a copy of to help us better get anchored in what's going on today. And so without any further delay, I'll ask Dr. Grossman to come on the show. And Dr. Grossman, welcome to the McCullough Report. And why don't you take it from there in terms of introducing your educational background? Thank you, Dr. McCullough. It really is an honor. I've been a big fan of yours for a few years now. I have great respect, and I'm so happy to be joining you on this show. So as you mentioned, I'm a medical doctor. I have training in pediatrics, as well as child, adolescent, and adult psychiatry. And my interest for quite a while has been in transgender identified children and in understanding where the ideas come from, that our society is now being bombarded with, especially our kids are being bombarded with where those ideas came from, why they are dangerous ideas that are not founded in medical science. And my book that's coming out soon focuses specifically on educating parents so that they are informed way before this catastrophe hits their home, the catastrophe of a child suddenly announcing that they are the opposite sex. Wow. That's, you just kind of really hit a big opener. I know this is a hot topic for our audience now by way of background. Dr. Grossman attended a Brynmore College in up in the northeast, I believe, and then NYU, New York University School of Medicine. Actually, some years voted the number one medical school in the United States, did a residency at an affiliated hospital with Cornell, had training in general pediatrics, and then child psychiatry, so she's extremely well trained. And I'm going to ask you, you really have taken on a hot button issue. Why did you personally get interested in this? Great question. The way that it happened is, well, I never really had an interest in this at all. And as you know, disorders of gender identity were very, very rare until recently. So in the entire world, there were very few specialists because there were so few patients. Now the way that I became interested in this was about 15 years ago when I was working at UCLA in the Student Counseling Center with undergraduate and graduate students at UCLA. And one thing that I noticed was that amongst these students that were coming to me, a large percentage of them had sexually transmitted infections. And it was really quite a surprise to me how often I would check into a patient's medical history and discover that they had been diagnosed with herpes or genital warts or that they may have had one or more abortions, that they were constantly going in for HIV testing. And I became alarmed at that and I started looking into what our young people taught about their sexuality and about sexually transmitted diseases and how to protect themselves and what is healthy behavior, what is unhealthy behavior. And it was there that when I dove into places like Planned Parenthood and other organizations that are the flagship sex education organizations in this country, it was there that I discovered sort of serendipitously what they were teaching kids about gender and I just was astonished. So that was 15 years ago and I discovered that they're teaching exactly what is being taught now, which is that we can separate our identity as male and female can be completely separated from our biology, from our sexed bodies so that young people were being told all the way back then and even further back I realized as I researched this, this goes all the way back to the 90s, but I discovered it sort of in 2006, 2007 that young people were being led to believe that they could have been so to say born in the wrong body and that that is not any sort of disorder, that's a normal variant of being human. Some people simply are born, are incorrectly quote unquote, assigned at birth as male or female and then they discover later on at some point that that assignment, I'm saying that in quotation marks and I'll explain why, that that assignment is incorrect and that they therefore need to change their bodies to align with their minds and when I discovered this I was very alarmed because I know and you know and I'm sure your listeners also understand you don't need a PhD to know this, that we don't want our kids to be confused about their identity. Identity confusion is a handicap, when you have a strong, you want kids to develop a strong identity about who they are, otherwise like I said it is a handicap and confusion is something that we certainly do not want to promote, but here I discovered that these authorities that are teaching our kids and have access to our kids in all sorts of ways at schools, online, through pediatrician's offices are coming in and exposing kids to these destabilizing ideas, I call it a destabilizing idea to tell a child that they potentially may have been assigned the wrong sex, that is extremely destabilizing especially to vulnerable kids, kids who have- Let me just stop you right there, so you're pretty far along in this. Are you saying that do you think at no time during child development should any adult suggest that to a young person at any time from any person? That's what I'm saying because there's no medical basis for making such a claim. That would be speaking from a doctor of authority, but right now it's my understanding that K-12 counselors are going to training, continuing education training in order to be able to do exactly that, to actually counsel kids on suggesting that they change their gender, that almost all of the physician state licensure renewals now have a transgender module that we have to go through. That's correct, all this is being presented and has been for a long time as if they are established facts which they simply are not. There's no medical basis for the idea that your identity as male or female can be completely separate from your sex body and that it is just simply a normal variant when that occurs. Those are believed. Okay, so that's the fundamental. So the fundamental is we're born and let's just say for this conversation we won't cover anything like any of these very rare genetic syndromes like Kleinfelter or anything else. Which we're going to talk about just normal women and normal men in medicine. We can use those terms normal woman and the sexes determined at birth or ultrasonically and can be carry-o-typed if we have to genetically. But what you're saying is that there's no scientific basis that one psychiatrically could arrive at a conclusion that they are the opposite gender. Well, I'm acknowledging that there certainly are individuals who experience themselves internally as being the opposite sex. What I'm saying and those used to be extremely rare individuals, one in 30,000, one in 100,000 in terms of the girls, very, very rare instances. I'm not denying that that happens. Certainly that happens. What I'm denying is that there's a possibility from a from a biological or medical perspective that that you could have the brain of a boy and the body of a girl. What I'm saying is that we are not like Mr. Potato Heads in which we can be assembled incorrectly. I get it. Are there other psychological constructs that exist? So for instance, either infatuation with the other gender or association. People have picked things as innocent as a girl being a tomboy or a boy being a femant. Is there a spectrum of just within the normal range of psychology and psychiatric gender development that's considered acceptable and reasonable? Well, of course. Absolutely. But that's called personality. Okay. Okay. So you have a huge range of, you know, boys that might have more feminine interests or more feminine ways of presenting themselves or behaving or girls that are, you know, but that's personality. What's happening here is that kids are being told that there's a random assignment, you know, that word assignment that is used over and over again, which has the connotation of randomness. You know, like you're assigned to the blue team or the red team when you're in PE. It's just random. So the doctor or the midwife randomly assigns you as boy or girl based on your genitals. But really, it doesn't have anything to do with your truly are. Now, you know, let's just get one thing straight as we're, you know, we're talking about being male or female, that that is established not at birth. And that is not established at the time of the ultrasound. That is established at conception. Yeah, for sure. It's established that obviously it's, it's, it's detectable in most at ultrasound and for sure at birth, but you're right, it's established at conception. Is there, is there a normalcy to having some ambiguity or some insecurities as, as children approach puberty boys and girls? Is there, is there an extent, can we assume that there's some normalcy there that there'll be some ambiguity or some insecurities around that time? I would argue that unless they've been exposed to these ideas that, that no, I would say no. Certainly we have in adolescence, one of the tasks of adolescence, the psychological tasks of adolescence, is to, is to clarify your identity in terms of your values, you know, where you want to go in life, what group you identify with, you know, perhaps your religious beliefs, your, your political beliefs, but not until now, or just recently, when a whole generation has been exposed to the notion that, that, that, that your, that your, that being male or female can be completely separate from your sex body, no, that was not part of normal adolescent development, absolutely not. We didn't see this until very recently. Like I said, there, there were extremely rare cases of individuals, you know, there are different kinds of gender dysphoria, gender dysphoria, meaning, a feeling of distress over your sex body as male or female, and feeling uncomfortable with, with stereotypical boy or girl behaviors and interests. So, so that always existed. And, you know, there were different types of gender dysphoria. One type is childhood onset, which were the kids very early on when they were three or five or typically, you know, younger than seven years old would insist that they want to be the opposite sex or that they are the opposite sex. And, you know, these kids have always existed. And we've done many studies on them and all the studies indicate that if you, if the, if they are permitted to go through normal puberty, then the vast majority of them between something like 60 to over 90% of these kids, their gender dysphoria, their discomfort with their bodies resolves. Oh, that's so important. That is such an important thing. So, what I've learned is, this diagnosis of gender dysphoria is something that in a sense self-resolves with the, the puberty phase of life. Well, that's correct. And it makes sense because with puberty, you're get, you know, the, the surge of hormones and that surge of hormones, it doesn't, it doesn't only cause physical changes such as breasts or facial hair or a lower voice. It goes to every organ in the body, including the brain. And it has an impact on cognition and emotional development and, and all the, the, the functions of the brain, which are very vast. So, the brain needs to go through puberty to become an adult, to be to, to, to mature. In order to get a mature brain, uh, you know, the brain of a 25 year old is very different than the brain of a 10 year old. And what you need to get the brain of a 25 year old is to go through puberty. Now, we are telling kids that we can end their parents, that we can interrupt normal puberty, we can block normal puberty. Uh, and then we can create a synthetic puberty of the opposite sex. And we are leading families to believe that, that, you know, it's, it, it, it, that everything will turn out just fine. And we, and we know for a fact that synthetic puberty is the same as organic natural puberty. Well, we don't know that. Well, in fact, I, you know, some of the, the, the papers I've reviewed, is, are that this synthetic puberty or this converse, uh, that's taken, um, is, is very ineffective for gender dysphoria. If one assesses gender dysphoria before and after, it doesn't really change much. And in fact, the, the burden of psychiatric care worsens after, after this synthetic puberty. So it's a very important point that you're bringing up what this, what the call gender affirming care of giving kids blockers followed by opposite sex hormones. Instead of curing the dysphoria, it might actually lock in the dysphoria. Oh, that's even worse. Yeah. And prevent kids, the majority of kids who would normally get through this and be okay with their bodies might as a result of these treatments be locked into it. Such an important concept. Boy, we're having a riveting discussion with Dr. Miriam Grossman, who's an expert child psychiatrist, and she's doing absolutely fantastic work. We basically just gone through normal development. We haven't gotten to the exciting, uh, part of the interview, which is going to be her introducing her book for you. Our audience is going to be thrilled by getting this preview. It'll be out shortly after we post this interview. My, our audience, Dr. Grossman extends certainly through the United States, Canada, the Europe, Australia, New Zealand, a really big following there in, in South America. So why don't we take a pause for our sponsors and then we'll be back on the other side. Let's get real. Let's get loud on America, loud talk radio. This is a McCullough report.

We are having a fantastic convo with a psychiatrist, Dr. Mary Grossman and as everybody knows, I'm an internist and a cardiologist and I rarely talk to psychiatrists, particularly ones who are in a position of authority. I'm being educated just as much as you are. We're covering the normal psychiatric aspects of puberty and development through childhood. I want to ask one more question about normal development and then we'll get into the contentious issues of what's developing today. In normal development, I've been told that these early years, you know, zero to six or eight or ten, they're so fundamental to what the child sees and experiences with their parents that those years can never be erased or changed. Meaning that as a parent, you'd really want to be on your A-game through those years because they even know that the child seems small and, you know, a baby or a toddler, they are really taking in and processing so much of what they're seeing in terms of behavior from adults and other people around them. Is that true? Oh sure, sure that is true but at the same time as a parent, I want to, you know, I want to just say that parenting is the most difficult job that exists and we all make mistakes. We do the best we can. We are flawed, all of us, flawed human beings and I don't want parents to walk around feeling guilty. I want them instead to be educated and to be proactive so that if this situation arrives at their dinner table and they have, you know, their child announces that they're the opposite sex, I want them to be prepared for that moment. Okay, but let me, let's finish what I was trying to get to. Let's say we have a five-year-old child in the household and mom or dad or, you know, their typical role models, typical father and typical mother role models in a normal family environment. And let's say mom and dad go away for a few days and there's a babysitter and the babysitter takes that five-year-old child to a drag queen festival and sits down that five-year-old child and the drag queen festival is men who are dressed in all different types of costumes, doing all kinds of, you know, sexualizing gestures and dancing and maybe some are transgender where some of the men, you know, have the physical appearance where they have breasts but in fact they have full male genitalia, all different types of dress and costumes and everyone's clapping and cheering and the child is there and there appears to be that, you know, an era of jovial entertainment. Does that episode itself, does that kid permanently filed in the brain of that five-year-old child? Well, you know, I wouldn't make a sweeping statement that every single five-year-old is going to be affected in the same way. I would certainly say though that I would expect that a good number of them will be affected in some manner, you know, anywhere from confusion and fear. I find people that are dressed up in that manner actually to look kind of scary and I'm an adult. I think that we could expect children to be at the very least confused. You know, what is going on here? You know, who is this person? Why are they dressed in this way? Everyone seems to be celebrating it. I guess I should also be celebrating it. Yeah, what about, but what if the parents take the child there and they cheer this on and with other parents cheering it on and you know, they go to several of these through the course of early childhood. What about that? Well, that is to me very, very disturbing and I know that parents are doing this and I would urge them to not do such a thing. This is not a place for a young child. It's not going to have any positive benefit. If the parents are inclined to celebrate such a performance, they should go without the child. These are instances in which the child is being used, so to speak, to the parents to, I think, often feel better about how inclusive they are and how open-minded they are and how they want their child to be likewise open-minded and inclusive. I would really strongly urge them not to do so. So do you think the driver is this guilt of inclusivity or this feeling that one is not being equanimous enough with respect to everyone around them? Is that what's driving it or do you think the adults get some type of kind of sexualized entertainment out of these themselves? Oh, you're speaking specifically about taking little kids to these drag shows. Yes. Again, people are different, families are different. It's certainly possible that some of the adults are disturbed individuals who, you know, their own sexuality and their understanding of, you know, childhood sexuality is very mixed up and they might have been led to believe that this is a positive thing for their kids. Maybe they came from a repressed background where they didn't get the information that they needed about their own sexuality and so maybe they think that they're exposing their kids to this early on is good for them. You know, I really, I'm asking the same questions you are. Why in the world would parents take their innocent little kids to such a performance? What I'm leading up to, Dr. Grossman, is I'm fearful that these images and these events are permanent. They're permanent and dullable events in the minds of these children. I mean, I can remember certain things when, you know, I was five years old. They're pretty dramatic things. You know, memory fades over time. But I have a feeling, a gut feeling that these events are fundamentally changing the children. It's not just spending an hour or two or it's not just some fun that they're changing the children. I would agree. I would agree and I think that that is part of what is animating this whole move to expose the little kids to this is that they want to reach the little kid. They want to reach them as young as possible. You know, kids are like wet cement and you get a three or five year old, that cement is very wet and whatever you drop onto it. And that's a quote, by the way, from a psychologist by the name of Hayem Geno, who said that a child is like wet cement and whatever you expose them to, it's going to make an impression. And yes, I think this is definitely part of a it's a global social political movement to change. Really, I know it might sound extreme, but I think it's about changing humanity in a very fundamental way in terms of our being male and female. I believe that there's a definitely a move to do away with these categories of male and female and to create human being 2.0, whose maleness and femaleness is vague and malleable and changeable and basically doesn't mean anything. Well, is it that current transgender people want more of their own kind transgender people or is it those who are gay and lesbian and bisexual, are seeking inclusivity to a greater degree? I mean, those designations have been around for a long, long time. The things haven't changed that much, at least in the last five or 10 years with respect to gay, lesbian, and bisexual. It just seems like honestly, this has come out of nowhere. And you turn on the TV at night and just for the listeners overseas, there could be, let's say, three evening news talk shows and every single one of them will have featured stories on this with some contentious conclusion or some aspect of diversity, equity, inclusion, or there could be another one voicing these types of concerns. We're not sure this is right. We have medical or clinical or psychiatric concerns. There have been just wild branding campaigns from Bud Light to Target. I think today or yesterday, Walmart. We've seen ESPN athlete of the year was a transgender person. Yeah, the corporations are completely taken over by this. But why would a corporation, I mean, don't corporations want to sell to large numbers of people? I mean, what would the corporations have in this? Dr. McCullough, these are all such good questions. There are other people that are doing excellent work in answering some of these questions. I really stick to what I see in my office and I stick to educating parents so that they are prepared for this to hit their home. There's a lot of speculation about what's behind this. And of course, there's billions and billions of dollars to be made in these medical treatment, surgical treatments that are being pushed as the only recognized way to help young people. So of course, there's the financial end to it. But there's a lot more. But the truth is, I am more comfortable talking about how parents need to be prepared for this way, way before their kids are teenagers. They need to be prepared when their kids are still little. And they need to be educating their little kids about biological truths, about male and female being fixed and unchangeable and how their bodies are perfect. And everyone's body, you know, you can't be born in the wrong body so that the child hears these truths from their parents at home first before they go to school and before they go to Disney and start hearing otherwise. Now, didn't we used to call that the birds and the bees? Talk, right? I mean, that's kind of leave it to beaver. But when should parents actually, just in general, in terms of, you know, childhood years, begin to start to have these conversations? Well, I'm not talking about birds and the bees in terms of reproduction. I'm just talking about kids knowing that they're in the wrong, they're in the right party. And that if any, when they hear this idea, they might hear this idea somewhere in a book in the library from their preschool teacher, from their friend, that it's possible to be born in the wrong body and have a boy's brain in a girl's body. I want the children to already have heard from their parents, no, that's actually not possible. That's that's not correct. And it's actually very dangerous to try and change your body to be a different kind of a body. So they need gender affirmation that they're in the right body. Yes, that's right. I love it. So let's then last segment here. Let's move into an introduction to your book. I know a lot of people are talking about it's a lot of buzz. What's the title and kind of lay it out for us? The title of the book is lost in trans nation, two words, trans nation, lost in trans nation, a child psychiatrist guide out of the madness. And this is a parenting book. This is not a book for psychologists or therapists. Of course, I'm very happy for them to read it and they will learn a ton of stuff by reading it that they will not have learned anywhere else. But primarily, I am speaking to parents and I am telling them that they have to trust their guts, their parental instincts, and not go to the gender experts who are going to tell them that they have to affirm their child in their new identity as the opposite sex or as non binary or any one of those sort of meaningless terms that don't really mean much. But that kids are being indoctrinated to think that they can just pick one of these identities. So this is a book for parents to understand how to identify these dangerous ideas. And there's a whole list of them. There's dangerous ideas that come from psychology and psychiatry. There's dangerous ideas that come from endocrinologists, meaning the blockers. I want parents to completely understand what blockers do and that puberty is not a disorder. It's not a disease. Their child needs to go through normal puberty. I want parents to understand these statistics about suicide because as you know, and I'm sure your audience has also heard that parents are being told by the so-called experts that if they don't affirm their child immediately, they're placing their child at risk for suicide. So I want parents to fully understand the data that we have. And the data that we have about suicide does not indicate that there's an epidemic of suicides by these kids who are distressed about their bodies. It does not indicate that at all. What it indicates is that yes, kids who identify as transgender have an elevated incidence of suicidal thoughts and suicidal behaviors. But that incidence is essentially similar to the incidence of kids who have other psychiatric disorders, who have anxiety disorders, autism, depression, other neurodivergent conditions. So identifying as the opposite sex or some other variety thereof does not automatically put you into a category of high risk of completed suicide. And that is simply that is false. Parents are being emotionally manipulated to think that if they don't go along with this immediately, that they are responsible for their child doing worse. And that's not the case, because kids who are affirmed, socially affirmed, meaning that they are permitted to adopt a different name and pronouns and to present themselves to dress differently as the opposite sex and to use opposite sex bathrooms and changing rooms and so on and so forth at school and in public, those kids are still suffering. Those kids still have and in some cases have more mental health issues. So you see, there's a vast chasm, Dr. McCullough, between what is actually known about these kids and the debate that's currently going on amongst doctors and therapists about how to help these kids. There's a vast chasm between that information and the information that parents and the general public are getting. And that this is the purpose of my book is to bridge that chasm. Wow, this is so fantastic. We've been talking to Dr. Maryam Grossman, MD, child psychiatrist and her new book, which is going to be out shortly, lost in trans nation, two words, a child psychiatrist guide out of the madness and looks like you have Jordan Peterson wrote the forward. Is that true? Yes, I'm so grateful to Dr. Peterson for writing an unbelievable forward. Yes, that is fantastic. So many of my followers follow Jordan Peterson. He actually follows me and I follow him on Twitter, although he's got like four million followers and I'm somewhere around a million. But I can tell you, this is going to be important because it's a guide for parents. And I wanted to ask you, how much of the book is dedicated to the early years, let's say elementary, junior high, and then let's say high school years? Well, it's kind of hard to, let's see, to put it in those terms. What I would say is that the book is divided into explaining the various dangerous ideas that come from these various sources, schools, psychiatrists, therapists, surgeons, the legal profession. You know, the legal profession has redefined the words abuse and neglect, so that abuse and neglect now include when parents refuse to use their child's new name that they may have picked out two weeks ago, and new pronouns. And children have been removed by child protective services from their homes. I have a chapter in which I tell the stories of a number of families in which this happened. Dr. Gortner, I have to ask you, so, you know, in our day-to-day life, when we're confronted with this, and let's say most of the people listening to this are adults, their parents or grandparents, what should we do with this whole pronoun issue when we're confronted with it? Well, I'll tell you what I've done in the book. I really mowed over this for a long, long time. What should I do with pronouns? Because I'm speaking about individuals who are identify as transgender, and some of them are quite well-known individuals, jazz genings, you know, Admiral Dr. Levine and other people, and how am I going to refer to these individuals? And what I decided, Dr. McCullough, after a lot of thought is that, you know, if it was years ago, 15 years ago, and I was faced with a pronoun dilemma, certainly, certainly, I would call people whatever pronouns they want. I'm a, I'm an empathic person. I'm someone who wants to help people feel good, feel better, you know. The last thing that I want is to cause anyone any distress. However, we're living in a different world, and we're living in a world in which there's this juggernaut to destroy male and female and to reach kids when they're little and to expose them to harmful, incorrect information about male and female. And if I use what's called preferred pronouns, if I call a man, she, then what I'm doing is I am all those little those kids out there, those boys who are 10 and 12 and 15 and 20 years old, if they see that I am calling Admiral Levine, she, then it feeds their fantasy that they too can be seen as a woman. And I do not want to feed that fantasy. Okay, that's really, really important. I struggle with that myself. So, this idea of, no, we can't feed the fantasy. Someone told me, someone gave me this analogy. I don't know what you think of it. But someone said, you know, if someone was struggling with anorexia nervosa, you wouldn't go up and tell them they're fat. You'd never want to feed a, you know, a psychological problem and make it worse, right? And whether you make it worse, you know, that type of derogatory way, or you like you say, you're just feeding the fantasy, you're making it worse by feeding the fantasy. The reason why this is so difficult is that in anorexia, of course, you'll have the whole world agreeing with your parents. But in the world we're in now, the kids are indoctrinated to think that if their parents do not use the pronouns, that they are biased and hateful parents, and that their home is not safe. And so this is what I deal with day in and day out are the families in which the parents refuse to use the pronouns. And the kids are just convinced, utterly convinced they have a fixed belief that their parents are bad, dangerous people. Oh, you know what Dr. Grossman, I have to tell you, I gave a program. I probably thank you. I'm on stage a lot. And I give a lot of public lectures. I get invited. And this woman came up to me, and she's the nicest lady. And I would say I'm 60. I want to say maybe she was 45. And she said, Dr. McCulloch, I'm really struggling. I'm a single mother. And she actually, her husband actually died in military service. She I'm a single mother. And I have a son. And he is, I think he's a late adolescent. So he's built it, let's say 17 or 18. And he's actually in a gender transition. And I don't know what to do. And she says, I feel like as if I fight him or I oppose this, that I'm going to lose him as my son. Does that's like a common scenario that you hear? Very common. Very this is the most difficult thing that parents have gone through. I, for my book, I did a survey, an international survey of parents of kids who identify as transgender. And I got the responses from 500 parents from 17 countries. And so, and so my book includes the advice that those parents have for parents who have yet to go through this, the survey consisted of questions, including what would you tell parents who have kids who are young, and they have yet to go through this ordeal that you're going through now? What would you tell them? That's brilliant. That's brilliant. Why not get help? Right? I mean, this is tough. These are tough issues. Why not get some help? Wow. This book looks so terrific. I think it needs to be on the bookshelf of every set of parents and all the single parents out there right now that are potentially going to face that. And that means almost every child could be at risk. We're talking about lost in trans nation, two words, a child psychiatrist guide out of the madness. And the Miriam Grossman MD is the author and the forwards written by Jordan Peterson. Dr. Grossman, is this your first book? No, no, it's not my first book. I wrote a book, in fact, I've written a number of this is my fifth book, but oh my gosh, I wrote a book in 2009 called You're Teaching My Child What? About Sex Education, and I had a chapter there all about what they're teaching kids about gender in 2009. And I warned parents that this is a catastrophe in the making. Oh, this is so important. So you've been working on this in terms of your scholarship and your clinical activity for a long time. That makes a huge difference. For so many of us, this caught us by surprise. It caught me by complete surprise. And you know, I have transgender patients now in my clinic. I do internal medicine and cardiology is completely caught me by surprise. This has been an extraordinary interview. We're going to have to bring it to a close. Dr. Grossman, do you have any final kind of key points for our audience? We've got we just I feel like we just scratched the surface. Well, we did scratch it, but but I think that the key point that I want to tell parents is that they should trust their intuition, trust your parental instinct. There's doctors out there with with walls full of diplomas, and you know this as well as I do, Dr. Makala. And unfortunately, they are there. They are just churning out misinformation on all sorts of subjects. And gender confused kids is one subject in which the misinformation that's being churned out is just, you know, at at at at crisis levels. And I want parents to to become educated and to trust their intuition. They know their children. Wow, this has been a powerful, powerful interview. We're going to have to have you back on the show, give it a few months, maybe through the summer. There's so many developments. I wanted to ask you about legislation and other things happening. I'm sure you're very, very busy. Dr. Merem Grossman, thank you so much for joining us on the Makala Report. You're welcome. And I'll just give my up my website. Go ahead. It's my name, Miriam Grossman MD.com. And there's a ton of stuff there that people can read and watch. And then I'm also on Twitter at Miriam under under what do you call that? Under slash underscore? Underscore, I think probably. Yeah. Yeah. Underscore Grossman MD. Good. And we hopefully we're following each other on Twitter now. Most of the people watching this is, you know, believe it or not, Makala reports, one of the top actually medical podcasts in the world. I've been actually previewing this on Amazon. So I don't know, you probably know this is on Amazon right now. You can see the cover of your book, you know, the layout, things look really good. As my audience knows, I have a book out. My first book, I've done hundreds and hundreds of medical peer-reviewed publications, but a book is so much harder. And I wrote it actually, the main author is John Leake. And it's been out for a year. And I have so much respect for authors because authoring books and being in clinical practice and, you know, being the, you know, the adults in our family, it's just so challenging. I give you all the credit you deserve ahead of time. This is absolutely fantastic. Thank you, Dr. Makala. It's really, you know what? It's like a very difficult, prolonged labor and delivery is what it's like. But let me ask you, I just, you know, just looking here on Amazon, is there anything like this that just fits this category of like this helpful guide of how, what a parent is not that there are books for clinicians, there's books for therapists on doing therapy with these kids in a non affirming way. But for parents, no, not that I don't believe there's anything. I think you're right, because I'm looking at all the ones where Amazon tries to aggregate them. I think you're right. This is such a unique book. Everybody listening, my friends out there pick it up. As soon as it becomes available Amazon, and can you also get it through your website? Or is it going to just be through Amazon? Well, the website will, I think, probably take you to Amazon. But if it's banned, you know, it's, I'm counting on it pretty much probably being banned. So really? Wow. It could be. It could be and chances are you'll need to work through the publisher or even work out a deal through your website. But this is absolutely fantastic. Lost in trans nation, a child psychiatrist guide out of the madness. Again, Dr. Grossman, thank you so much for being on the McCullery part. Thank you, Dr. McCullery, for everything that you do as well. Let's get real. Let's get loud on America, Loud Talk Radio. This is a McCullery part."
