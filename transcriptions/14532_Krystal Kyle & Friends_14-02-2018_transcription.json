    "text": " You didn't ask for it, but we're back with another episode of Keep It. Coming up a little later, after the news, I have an interview with Ashley Blaine Featherson of Dear White People. We'll talk about season two and get into a fun conversation about equal pay and Octavia Spencer. Right now, I'm joined by Cara Brown and Lewis Patel. Second week of Black History Month, I survived again. He's still here. He's still here. And I'm like Christina Ricci White this week. He is glowing. Christina Plus Casper, like if they made it at the end of the movie. Tell people where you came from. Lamont, Illinois. Oh, I was in Austin this weekend. All right. Lamont's even wider, trust me. I thought you were somewhere whiter than Austin this weekend. Oh, well, Austin's pretty white too. We're going to be in Austin. Are we? We are. Are we? Yes. We have a live show at South by Southwest. So if you're at South by Southwest, I don't know. Hey. Come say hello. Bring Prosecco. Bring Lewis and Sunscreen. Please. Oh, unbutton the flannel for us, honey. Tell us what to get the good barbecue. I don't know. I literally want one place and I think it's the good barbecue, but I'm probably wrong. Okay, well you're right. The good barbecue is too spicy for you. Oh my God. Red to filth minutes into those. Black history month. You know, just take it. Taking a black history month, we were graced this week with the official portraits of Barack and Michelle Obama. The real president and first lady. Yes. Ghehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald unveiled their depictions of the former first lady. And president. And I thought they were gorgeous. They were amazing. You know, it's contemporary art. Yes. So. Which a lot of people did not. Did not understand. They didn't seem to know that artists don't actually just render things to look exactly like. They're not all tracings. Yeah. People. You know, a lot of people were turned off, not by barrocks, but by Michelle's because the artist who did Michelle's portrait is Amy Sherald. And her work tends to be taking black skin and making it grayscale. You know, it's to sort of highlight the person. Yeah. And to remove skin color from the equation. I think that's also part of it where you don't necessarily know. And that's the person, you know, when you're looking at that person. So it was a deliberate creative choice. Which seems crazy that people didn't understand that. They were like, Oh, she's the wrong color. It's like you idiots. She did that on purpose. You think she accidentally painted her gray and didn't figure it out. Also, do you think Michelle picked Amy Sherald not knowing she was going to do that? Right. I also object to people being like, it doesn't look like her. I think it does look like her. It does look like her. You kind of have to, you have to see a high res photo, I will say. But when you see it. You can't look on your boost mobile. When you see it, it looks like her. It's quite obviously Michelle Obama. It's also very striking and also does capture the essence of her, like her kind of casually commanding time. I love the dress that she has in it. It's sort of this white dress that looks like a quilt and it turns into sort of black and yellow and pink and red colors at the bottom. Yeah. It's beautiful. A milli dress, I think, which is interesting because she didn't choose a black designer. And she often wears black designers from this like this. But it was gorgeous. She looked regal the way she always looks. Yes. And what I really loved about the work is the fact that it sort of threw back to the hope posters of Barack when they first came out. It gave you an image of the first lady and the president that has sort of been diminished over the past eight years. They look youthful. They look like they're representing art and culture and a future. Yeah. It's fresh. Obama looks great. He's sitting in a chair in a nice suit, no tie. And he's surrounded by leaves and flowers. And Gaihen Dae said that each flower is from a different place that Obama has lived. So it's Kenya, Hawaii, Chicago. And it's just nice seeing a portrait of a black man look like this. It's not concerned with his masculinity. Yeah. And it's black art, which is what I think everyone was having their knee-jerk reaction to is this is quite clearly black art and this black aesthetic. And it's going to be up in the Smithsonian whether all y'all like it or not. So you better get used to appreciating it because it's going to be there forever. I would say also for presidential portraits, they're kind of emotional feeling to me. You know what I mean? Like him sitting like amongst nature, if you will, is an unusual take that makes you feel like there's something kind of sensual about it. And maybe that makes people uncomfortable too, a black man being sensual. I don't know I'm projecting here. But I mean, it's beautiful for that reason and unexpected for that reason. And the last thing for me is that when you think of the purpose of a portrait like 100 years ago when they couldn't take high res photos of people, yeah, it probably mattered if it was an exact depiction. It's 2018. We got cameras. You know what they look like? History is not going to forget what they look like. And so them taking the opportunity to make an artistic choice and to actually make a statement and a political statement with their portraits, that's what they were doing. We don't need more pictures of them. I think those portraits also throw into sharp relief how stayed and kind of boring all the other presidential portraits are. I think people are resentful about that too. And portraits in general, it reminds me of the episode of The Crown where they were doing Winston Church Hills official portrait. And the artists took some liberties with him to sort of portray him as how people saw him and church along his wife historically destroyed that portrait. You know, but we're in a different space now where this is art. The Obamas knew that their portraits were going to be art. They have always supported black artists and black music and black designers. And they knew that this was going to be what's happening in black art right now. You know, it would be just like if Picasso was hot back when they were doing the portraits because presidential portraits are actually a pretty new thing. They weren't going on back during the Picasso area. But if they were and Picasso painted adult painting of like Obama and Michelle, would people be on, I don't know, Italian 1920 Twitter talking about this doesn't look like him. I mean, it's art get used to it. Happy Black History Month. It is Black History Month and Black History Month wouldn't be complete without a feud between white people to keep us entertained. And the ladies from Sex and the City really delivered in a punch in a big way. So Kim Cottrell has sort of been letting you know that she does not fuck with Sarah Jessica Parker for a minute. She doesn't want to do Sex and the City 3. And I supported it to be honest because the second movie was racist and it was she was the only one with sense who had the sense enough to say we're not going to embarrass ourselves so that the people are going to look back at us in 20 years. But what were these bitches doing making another crazy, probably racist or insensitive movie about a storyline that ended five years ago. Wouldn't it be awesome if for the third movie they just went back to Abu Dhabi like lean and we're like we live here now. We're having the best time. So Kim Cottrell's brother passed away last week and apparently Sarah Jessica Parker reached out with her condolences and Kim was not having it. She accused Sarah of exploiting her brother's death and in an Instagram post Cottrell said your continuous reaching out is a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now. Let me make this very clear. You are not my family. You are not my friend. So I'm ready to tell you one last time to stop exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your quote unquote nice girl persona. I don't need your love or support at this tragic time. Oh my God. You should perform Kim Cottrell monologues and speech to him. I have been practicing scenes for mannequin. Oh yeah. I'll challenge you with big trouble and little China. So damn. These are shots fired. I mean and it's wild. You know the funniest thing for me was when she put up that Instagram because you know when a celebrity comments or someone with a lot of followers comments on Instagram you'll see that comment without having to click to see all the rest of them. So you could see Cynthia Nixon had clearly said some words of condolences and Kim Cottrell had said thank you so much underneath the one where she's dragging Sarah Jessica Parker for also giving her condolences and it was so petty and I kind of loved it. Yeah. Here's the thing about this. A lot of people were deciding who side they were on on Twitter and I don't know the tea about Sarah Jessica Parker. You know there are a lot of reports from back when they were filming the movie that there was a mean girl culture on the set. There were stories about how when they were filming Kim felt excluded from the other girls and you know there were also reports like of a time where they all stayed in a different house from one another but Kim was also married at the time. So no one like really knows the true story yet because Kim has not dropped the memoir but I would happily ghost write it if she wants someone to do that until then all we can sort of go on is the fact that Kim doesn't like Sarah Jessica Parker and she took time out of grieving her brother to blast this woman. I was gonna say and also say your mom my mom doesn't fuck with you either. So clearly there's really motion there. True mind you why would her mom know about Sarah Jessica Parker that's a question I have. Here's the thing I totally on board for Kim control not want to do sex in the city three for the reasons Kara enumerated. However in Kim control's post she links to an article about the quote unquote mean girls culture on the set and it's a terrible article in which they're like arguably when Kim control started on sex in the city she was the big name of the show no she was in poor keys and Sarah Jessica Parker was a former Broadway star who was an Ed Wood in Hocus Pocus in LA story like she was like a movie star first wives club whatever. So it's like that's already a lie then they say that like Kim control married wouldn't stay in the same house as the three other girls who got a house where they could film together but it's like that's not mean girls culture because somebody has a problem with you doesn't mean she's Regina George. I find that comment or that article belittling of the people involved it's like Sarah Jessica Parker effing rules that show effing rolled get over it. Also I don't like when people keep saying mean girls adult women it's like that's just called being assholes like it's the same way that men are assholes women will be assholes they're not mean girls no no article came out like when Christian Bale screamed at that guy mean boys culture. Right exactly. I forgot about that. Right. Decimating. What I will say that it makes perfect sense that Kim control's mom knows about it because I'm just saying me if I'm like on a movie set or I've won a long running TV show and the person who's the lead of the show who's in everything you know like it's Sarah Jessica Parker it's Carrie Bradshaw you know Kim control had to go home for the holidays family members were like oh my god Carrie Bradshaw like we love Sarah Jessica Parker and you know at one point Kim's not and went listen I don't like it. Can I say this about her too so she did like an interview somewhat recently with peers Morgan right I don't know how that got set up if you that upset if you do an interview with peers Morgan excuse me that's who like Robert Blake calls to be like let's talk about how I'm not a murderer or whatever like he's got her trash you could have done that interview with somebody legitimate who asked actual questions who knew about the show but you didn't so I'm suspicious of Kim control now. Here's Morgan an interview with him is basically like the racist version of a Michael Strahan interview at this point. Yeah. Omarosa and Logan Paul have both had interviews with him after their recent drama because they needed a softball interview and if you do an interview with peers Morgan you know he's going to be slimy and like want to get the dirt like he hates women so you know he's just going to be like he'll love you Colin. He's like he probably love exactly he loves it. He's feeding off of it. Right now he was like the ambulance chaser of interviewers and like found her vulnerable and then like trapped her but let me just say what's bothering me now is that I feel like this fear is getting in the way of Cynthia Nixon completing her egot and she only needs an Oscar to finish it. I also think there should be a show about four gay men in New York called we're all the Miranda. To be fair. Are you a Miranda? I'm a Miranda cusp Samantha. Oh, oh, oh, but I whip off my wig and rage but I also have taken the bar exam. I'm nobody's Miranda. You sure? Yes. What are you a carry? Probably. Yeah. All right. Maybe even a little bit of a Charlotte guys I've got news for you. I was a little bit of a super late. You might be a little bit of a Charlotte. You know what? Let's keep my business. All right. No you're a bunny McDougall. You're the one wearing Chanel who's like a complete asshole. So does this feud between them color what we think of sex in the city? No, not for I mean, I don't really care. I don't care. The show's still fun. Yeah, it changes nothing. It changes absolutely nothing. I've got news for you. They play like eight episodes of that on E and I where the episodes are secretly like 17 minutes like several storylines are cut out. It makes no sense. Something about that show to me even now is incredibly addictive. I mean, I know that like the punny dialogue is overdone sometimes. I know like the storylines are predictable. You just believe they're friends. I don't know. My favorite parts of that show are when they do something stupid like have to go to a funeral for someone they don't know. Well, that's the thing. It's acting. So they are acting like friends. I did not actually believe that those four women lived in New York and were all best friends. So there is no reason why the show would be sourd for me because I knew it wasn't a documentary. Actually, yeah. And I'll end the court who is an actress who played Naomi on the 902 and ovary boot, just gave an interview on Wendy Williams this week where she said that she and Sheena Grimes, the lead hated each other for the five seasons of the show. They're friends now, but they weren't friends back then. And it's you know, I don't need people to be best friends. No, it's called acting. Happy Black History Month. And I was thinking about Edelen McCord. You know who I think she should play? Can we draw? Madonna in that biopic. I think Edelen McCord looks like Madonna. Anybody, Twitter, take this away. I want it to happen. I think Edelen McCord is an unsung hero. She was great on that show that I would never watch, but you watched it. Excuse me, you watched it. Don't project on me. All right. Well, you did a lot of projecting calling me a Miranda, calling me a Charlotte. I call myself a Miranda. First my God, you're weeping. Guys, it's Black History Month. No arguing between the races. We're all Blair Underwood who was on the show for two minutes. I cannot wait to blast you in 20 years when one of my siblings died. I look forward to it. Actually, maybe I am a bit of a Charlotte. I had a lovely Sunday morning with a gentleman and I watched six episodes of Sex in the City. And usually I hate being around people. And it worked out? It worked out. Were you dressed like a Charlotte, like a pink sweater tied around your collar? I was actually. And then he was like, can I paint you in a cross dressing art exhibit or whatever happened in that one episode? All right. We're moving on. Moving on to Kara's favorite topic of the week. Oh, we're us a man and golf. You love her. Okay. Kara is so mad that we were talking about this woman on the show. It's going to even matter when I say. I saw. I know you're rooting for the rest of the show. You were the problem. You were the problem. You were allowing this woman. You were allowing this woman to redeem herself. And it's you. It's wrong. It's bad. So this shouldn't be working. So here's the thing. I don't think she's redeeming herself in my eyes. I feel like I still see Omarosa the way I've always seen her. A schemer and a manipulator and I'm fascinated by how she does it. She's joined the celebrity big brother house. She's in it now. And she's basically turned the show into breaking news. Like MSNBC, Fox News, people are covering this show. And she gave all of this information to Ross Matthews about how she tried to stop Trump and how the tweets are scaring her. And we're going to listen to it. I know some of you may have heard this clip on love her to leave it, but John didn't know that Ross Matthews is on drag race because he. Oh my burn him. Yeah. You know what? I'm not going to add it to brunch anymore. And from the outside, I tell it's a voter, a citizen. I never got it. You went to the White House with him. I felt like it was like a call to duty. I felt like I was serving my country and I serving him. Whenever was it accepting a political appointment, it was always about the country. Like I was haunted by tweets every single day. Like what is he going to tweet next? Carol loves this. What are you doing? I mean, I tried to be that person and then all of the people around him attacked me. I was like, why are you whispering? Don't give her a kiss. Why are you whispering? You're miked. And as long as there's your it's there. And it's. Who has that power to say what's going on? No, I'm not there. It's not my circus, not my monkeys. You know, I like to say not my problem. I can't say that because it's. Love that dialogue from the greatest showman at the time there. What a load of fucking shit. We took the opportunity Trump gave her because she wanted to be catapulted back into the spotlight. Please also my ass. You were like you came there. We're going to raise hell and like wag a finger and Trump's face. My ass. You were going to stand behind him in every photo you could get in. Does she not remember the fact that she went on television and said you will all bow before President Trump? She said this. No, she's like a self fancy sorceress. Yes. She's honestly like a television character who's had a different head writer every season because now they've decided she is going to be a liberal who hates Trump. Right. And but. It's just I'm so fascinated because I love how celebrities try to rebrand themselves and sort of do PR moves and it's interesting to see her doing that on live TV and like. Thirty it's time. What are the 30 of time? She's reworking it. You see the wheel spinning in real time and even if people know it's fake like Stephen Colbert was like going on about how like it's bullshit. The White House thinks it's bullshit and like we all do too. But there's the fact that because she's talking about it, it's news. I think the problem for me is I don't feel like I have the confirmation from everyone that we know what she's doing because without that, I'm looking at her. Like, am I the only one? I feel like I'm the kid in the Emperor has no clothes and I'm looking around like hello. Is anyone else paying attention to what is happening here? Because I feel like I'm the only one and it's making me crazy. So if we are really all on the same page of like, we know this is bullshit. We get what she's doing as soon as the shit is over, she's gone again. We're not going to give her any more chances. We're just going to milk her for the entertainment. That's one thing. We're just worried that we're going to end up with her as a Democrat nominee in 2020. She's going to be someone. She's going to be the, what was her bullshit title for Trump? Like, Black people vote for, you know, that kind of. Vice Roy or of irrelevance. She's going to, I feel like she's going to turn around and have that position again. And we're all going to act like none of this happened. Do you know what I think is the weirdest part of her being involved with this? Is that Omarosa is way more suited to big brother than the apprentice. So it's this awkwardness for me as a viewer, somebody who really loves the show that she's, I'm not going to say a good player, but certainly making the moves to make it appear as if she's playing a real game. So that is in a way entertaining. That said, when we weave in this narrative where she's like getting Keisha and I pull him on her side and being like, let's do a Black girls magic thing. It's like, oh, now, now, now you get to pull that out. Well, also they've nominated her for the block as well. So it's like, we don't know how great she is yet because the game's not over. I personally think that she's more suited for a show like the apprentice where there's one arbiter who sort of decides everything. So she's allowed to create chaos everywhere else. I think that the problem with big brother for her is anyone at any point could nominate her get rid of her. So she sort of can't. It's weird watching her suppress the lunacy. But like I said, she's still making news. The White House issued a response to her. And here it was. What is the White House's reaction to comments made by former White House aide on Marosa on Celebrity Big Brother, where she said, quote, she is haunted by the president's tweets. She described the situation inside the White House as bad and said it is not going to be okay. Not very seriously. Marosa was fired three times on the apprentice. And this was the fourth time we let her go. She had limited contact with the president while here. She has no contact now. You dumbass. So that means you've hired someone who was fired four times more on. That's not it. What are you bragging about? Right. It's like she manages to still make the White House look dumb. You still hired her. You still hired her. You just said someone that was fired three times and yet you brought her back again. What's the positive thing there? And it's the weird thing he thinks he can get away with saying because she's a black woman. I mean, it's just the randomness of obviously she was here for no other reason, but that is disgusting. Can I also say I may be at one point thought that God was a black woman, but when Omarosa sits there and says black girl magic and she wasn't struck down or burst into flames, that is clearly not a black woman. That is what that tells me. What's funny too is just an aside, the person who said this is the principal deputy press secretary, Rod Shaw, who I guess they put him out there to Sarah Huckabee. They saw that name and said, put him up there. Sarah Huckabee is busy dealing with the domestic abuse scandal that's going on in the White House and getting multiple people fired. So they sent him out and this idiot while he's trying to zing Omarosa, the New York magazine exposed that he used to work for the Jeb Bush campaign and they published his text where he called Donald Trump a deplorable and said that the acts of Hollywood tape was justice. This is the kind of person that they hire there. Also, you know, and you're commenting on Omarosa. It's like, you shouldn't have your job either. You also know they put him up there because they looked around the room and they're like, well, we need to make some kind of racist remarks about this black woman. Let's get the not white person to do it. Like homie, that's why you're up there. You know Jeff Sessions was probably chomping at the bit to go up. You're like Jeff, this isn't even your job. Why are you in this building? Not to chew my own horn about this, by the way. But I said once Omarosa was challenged, you would be leaving the house and she disappeared because she had an asthma attack quote unquote for like 15 hours. What a long ass asthma attack. And then when she returned, she said, I've got my asthma under control. She's cough. She did a fake cough. You don't cough when you ask. What's wrong with her? Like she's in our town in the school play like, oh, goodbye Grover's corners. She faked an injury on the apprentice too. She's already cribbing from her own storylines. I will say the only interesting thing that's come out of Omarosa being in the house is the fact that she's in the house with Keisha Knight Polio. And they had so they had this discussion, which hasn't been getting as much attention as obviously her talking about Trump destroying the world with tweets. And people judged you for that, but you only you know your inner relationship, inner workings of your relationship with Mr. Cosby. Oh, wow. That's the same thing with me and Mr. Trump. It's not something that can be minimized. It's comparing apples to oranges. But you don't see the similarity. You haven't been attacked because of your relationship. It's a different situation because this man is running a country and being the voice. I hate you. That now this is in my world. I have to say Omarosa has that and culturally thing of like, oh, you're coming at me? Well, I'm going to do this lawyerly thing and make you look stupid, even though I'm obviously deplorable myself. Because Donald Trump and Bill Cosby are both awful vile people, but for completely different reasons. Also, Keisha was on the Cosby show was a child. She was four or something. Why didn't she say anything? But you know, she this is how she's doing it. She's working it. And I find it fascinating. I know you do. And that conversation is how she got Keisha on her side to create Black Girl Magic. Black Black Girl Witchcraft History Month. Now, like we need like a thousand white people to go see Black Panther an extra five times to make up for the fact that that just aired on television during Black History Month. Done. Lewis, get to it. I'm here I go. Can I just say this as bad as nothing Trump is? You would be worried about Pence. I'm sorry. I know. I know. So everybody's just wishing for impeachment might want to reconsider their life. Absolutely. We would be begging for days of Trump back if Pence became president. That's all I was saying. The White House is still embarrassing itself when Omarosa isn't involved because the Olympics are underway. And what does Mike Pence do but get into a Twitter fight with Adam Ripon, an out gay Olympic athlete. He was talking about how he wants to meet with Adam and talk to him about how like he loves gay people or whatever. And Adam wasn't having it. And basically that's like going on during the Olympics while Mike was also there with Fred Warmbier who was the father of the auto Warmbier who was killed in North Korea. And so you have him pulling this thing that some people called a political stunt and you have the fight with gay Olympians like Gus Kent worthy and Adam Ripon are just constantly taking photos and tweeting at Mike Pence to make him mad or embarrass him or whatever. And then you have the drama of Pence near Kim Jong Un sister Kim Yo Jong. So the Olympics which is supposed to be fun and sort of you know the world coming together and watching our athletes is still sort of embroiled in America's mess. Everyone has lost their damn minds is my only takeaway. Mike Pence what are you doing getting in Twitter fight you don't like gay people we know you don't like gay people keep it moving it's not new information and then calling this woman who is part of a regime that tortures its own people and starves them and they're treating this bitch like she's a Kardashian CNN had an article that said Kim Yo Jong is stealing the show at the Olympics and that she's the Ivanka Trump of North Korea. In her people's food she's stealing that too. Also how is she the Ivanka Trump like she walks sometimes like how are they at all alike not that I'm defending Ivanka sorry if it sounded like that. No I'm I'm defending Kim Yo Kim Yo is at least running a dictatorship I'm not sure what Ivanka does every day. She's just also she was just sitting there I was wondering what I was missing because she was just sitting there in a coat. Twitter does that. I didn't see her doing anything else. I was doing that thing where they like to take a photo of someone having a facial reaction and pretend they're throwing shade or throwing side eye at somebody and it's these persons eyes are just blinking. Oh God. Let me say by the way underrated thing about the Mike Pence Adam Ripon thing is he basically wanted to meet Adam Ripon the night before he performed that's what you're going to do to him like poison him with your like homophobic viper stare like seconds before he goes on right and Adam Ripon said he did not want to meet with Pence and then Pence was like we never said we wanted to meet with him he never denied that and Ripon's agent was like no bitch you're lying and you're distracting your own country from winning medals you idiot like you guys want us to have the most medals so that you guys can act like this country is still on top of anything and you were distracting our athletes from winning and doing well and focusing I want to add that by the way props to add a rip on for not being distracted because whenever he does interviews and like he'll get heavy questions about this all the way to like what's it like being the first openly gay athlete in the winter games whatever he handles interviews so well and I miss celebrities who are like quippy on the spot have like that kind of cool sensibility he really to me has almost a Madonna feel of like I know myself really well and I'm snickering at you until you can keep up with me and so it's like Mike Pence is no match for him has never been any match for him and he's going to keep being amazing for a long time I'll watch him on Dancing With The Stars. Also Adam's just really good I watched the dating and I was like an Academy Award. I was I almost was sobbing. He's dancing to Kora and listen Beyonce. Why am I getting called out of her cold play? No I'm just saying. I know how you probably feel about cold play. I just feel that Adam and Beyonce are trying to single-handedly make cold play gay icons. Probably. The Superball and now this. I mean god bless. He's like the Phantom threat of skating. It's so good it's exquisite. He's have you been consciously uncoupled? No this gay icon has. I think the thing about Mike Pence too we have to remember is he is really good at pulling these stunts and no one really mentions that fact as much you know he did the Hamilton thing. He went to the NFL game just so he could leave when players were kneeling. He brought the father of someone who was killed in North Korea to the Olympic games in Korea. He is starting fights with Adam Ripon. It's like this is what he does. He's like the David Blaine of White Supremacy and always a new gag and he's not getting enough of that attention for how much he's sort of like Trump in that he's very messy because Trump is messier. He's not that like he kind of does it messy things very cleanly. Calculated. Yeah yeah and he skates by because of and he doesn't say too much. He doesn't like run his mouth. He's out of the country while the Rob Porter drama is happening. He's out of the country while the Omarosa stuff is happening. He's not anywhere in fire and fury. He knows how to keep a low profile. Chrome Domarosa. I'm trying to come up with a nickname for him. I don't have it. Other than that I'm really enjoying the Olympics and it's a good American past time. The losers are hot. Guys how did we figure that one out? People are sledding and they are sexy. Americans are just doing really well. As it turns out you can excel when you're American and you're I don't know 500,000 feet away from Donald Trump in the country. Lesson learned. And we're back with everyone's favorite segment of the week. Keep it. What are we keeping this week? So my keep it this week is just a tweet that I saw and it said M&M and Ed Sheeran debut trailer for their new music video. And I am so tired on so many fronts and I wish everyone would just stop. You know what I didn't know that existed and now I'm happy I made you sit through all that Omarosa news because I feel attacked. Personally. I mean what is he I don't understand what M&M is doing. You know how I feel about Ed Sheeran anyway. Ed Sheeran knows how you feel about Ed Sheeran. I feel about Ed Sheeran and I wish they would just leave us alone. Like we have enough going on. Not this month. Not this month during Black History Month like my god leave us alone. Yeah I don't need to hear that song. Lewis tell them to leave us alone. Go call your people and tell them it's Black History Month and to leave us alone. Oh you think I have a lot in common with M&M something is the matter now. Lewis what are you keeping this week? I just saw that Michael Honnicky the very acclaimed director who did movies like Amor and The White Ribbon said that the Me Too movement was mostly a witch hunt. A couple of things in the witch hunts we actually didn't listen to the women. So that's a no. Secondly really annoying thing to say really basic. I do appreciate him giving great rules to Isabel Huper but that's about it. So I'm mad. Third who? Girl you've seen these movies the piano teacher. I have not seen the fucking piano teacher. Oh well get on it. All right. You're about to learn something. I only see movies about pianos if it starts Holly Hunter. Not too far off honestly. Who's in the piano teacher? Isabel Huper. I only know her from saucy remarks in French that you know I understand because Jipale Fonc\u00e9e. You understand it because it's a meme you saw on Twitter honey. Okay you know what when Catherine De Nuev and I are enjoying a nice glass of Riesling or Sansa and watching Isabel Huper clips. Happy LePu over here. My keep it is also short this week. It is Judge Janine Piro. Oh but she never messes up. What are you talking about? This is this is she even a judge. I don't know. But she has a show on Fox News and for the better part of the past few weeks she's been stalking Hillary Clinton in the woods. And now she's blaming Obama for the Rob Porter situation. Rob Porter is a former White House aide who was dating Hope Hicks and as it turned out has two x-y's that he abused. And for some reason Janine was saying that him being hired was Obama's fault. I don't know how he was not hired under the obama. Let's hear this one out. Who knows. But she's a lunatic. She's the one who was like standing outside Hillary Clinton's dry cleaner. Yes. Like have you seen Hillary Clinton? She getting your pantsuits clean? It's like you psycho? Even if she did what is that proving that she gets things dry cleaned? Janine is sort of like a woman who's trying to return something to a department store during a holiday without a receipt. That is exactly her personality. And it's staining a little bit. You know it's I want it for the original price not the sale price. And three weeks later she's going to stalk that assistant manager outside their house and badger them with her news crew. I do kind of miss that style of Gayle Weathers and Scream journalism where it's like Sydney whose mother was murdered one year ago today is right inside. Let's go in. But I want that from Nancy Grace not her. Can Nancy Grace move that quickly through like you know an embedded journalism environment? No. Janine I believe can. Well maybe if Janine started hosting Dateline I would be much more interested in her and her crazy conspiracy theories. I want to thank Cara and Lewis for once again being here and even though we recorded this in a different location and tried to hide it from Lewis. He still made it. He still made it. I was savvy am I. I've really got it together. He almost earned it the fact that he found us out here in Wakanda. How many times are you seeing Black Panther this weekend? I mean I want to play Kate Cara so I'm going to go in the 11 to 14 range. Nice. Okay all right. You don't have to go you can just buy the tickets. Oh please I'm ruthless. I'll go and buy and yeah make names. Because when we talk about it we don't want you here. Another of God. I will see you two next week and when I'm back an interview with Ashley Blaine Fettison. Hi Ashley. Hi. So you were on Dear White People. Yes. Tell me a bit about the reaction to the show once you know it hit Netflix because you know prior to it even with the movie people new people were still discovering it and being like what's the show about was it saying Dear White People was it racist? Well it wasn't even so much when the show dropped. It was when we dropped the date announcement which was like a couple months before and people went wild. That's when people were protesting the show and canceling their Netflix and writing to Netflix and saying that we were racist and saying all these terrible things about Justin and all of it. Like it just was really crazy. We were like we just announced the day that it was going to come out guys like literally that's it. We're just saying it's coming out April 28th. Like that's it. And I think for me that was so telling because it was like people are upset about something that's less than a minute long. They have no idea. They're not even taking the time to investigate or dive into what it really is and just solely based on the title and that this majority people of color it's racist and they're boycotting and it's a whole thing. And I think we garnered like over a million views in like less than 24 hours something crazy like that. And it was like the most dislikes. It was like the ratio of like thumbs up. Oh my god. It was like three thumbs up and like a trillion thumbs down. So that was like really crazy and we were all like but honestly I think you know I did a lot of interviews and people were like were you scared? Like was it scary? And I was like no we loved it. Like that's the whole point of why we're doing a show like this. Why Justin created it is to kind of break those stereotypes and show people you're upset about something you know nothing about and you're not even trying to learn anything about. So then when the show came out it wasn't as crazy because like we had already dealt with the crazy people with the date announcement and you know people still had their views. But I think that what happened was I think a lot of people who had their opinions about the date announcement they watched a little bit of the show and were like oh I guess it's not like you know what I mean. I think that's kind of what what happened. Yeah. You were in Dear White People from the Conception. Yeah. Inception. Conception. Whatever the word is. You were so you went from this was a teaser trailer and to now it's a movie to it's a TV show. Like how is that for an actor to do that it's interesting you're just involved in it's like almost like a theater trip. You know. It is. Oh my god yeah. And it's like these are my people. Yeah. And that's how you're moving through the industry. Yeah. So I'm not in the concept trailer. Okay. But I auditioned for it. Oh you did. I auditioned to be Coco in the um we we had all gone out then it's funny. We had all gone out the night before like me, Lena, Justin. Like just a ton of us have gone out the night before to a kiss and grind. Yeah. And I was like guys I gotta go because I got auditioned for Justin. So these are real. The kissing grind is real. I never been to one. Oh my god. They're real. I mean I don't know anymore. I thought it was made up on Insecure. What? No it's a real thing. Oh my gosh. No yeah they're you know it's authentic. Yeah it's really real. I don't I think they still do. I haven't gone in years. They don't have them in Silverlight. No you're gonna have to come. You're gonna have to binge try this over like um but no so I so I auditioned for it and that was my first time auditioning for Justin. Okay. Yeah and actually my friend Yani and it were it's funny because we're all family. So she was Coco in the concept trailer. Then I auditioned for Coco initially in the movie and my friend Tiana was cast as Coco but then I was cast as curls which ended up being Joelle and here we are. But it is exciting. Yeah I think for me the full circle moment was when I went to Sundance this year and my first time at Sundance was four years ago when we took the movie. Yeah. And it was such a different time in all of our lives. Like you know at that time we were all just trying to pull it together. I mean whether it was buying our plane tickets to go like our accommodations like it was for a lot most of us our first feature. It just was that type of energy or for Lena or Justin first time producing and all of those things. And that's Lena Waith. Yeah Lena Waith and Justin Simian. Yes I'm like saying like everybody just kind of doesn't. Yeah we do know now you know. Like it's so weird that Lena and Justin were working on this thing like four years ago and now Emmy winners and second season TV shows and this and that. It is crazy but so for me it was that full circle moment at Sundance because I was like wow like now I'm here. I mean the second season of a show and Netflix brought you to Sundance this No I went for the other thing. I went for something completely different a project I worked on with Mackerel called The Mert Park. So it was just coincidental that I just was back for something else but I was able to kind of have this full circle moment of like being like wow last time I was here I had four lines and a movie and now you know I just completed the second season of a show and I'm just really grateful for it. We are a family like we fight for each other like Justin was like I'm not making Deere White people like you have to unless you're in it like you are you are Joelle and I just always appreciate and love him for that. And so what is that like in contrast to you know when you are feel like you're trying to work in other projects. It's always so we're seeing you know like Black actors trying to you know make it in Hollywood and stuff and we're in such an interesting place now where we've created our own avenues and lanes for our work and we all you know know each other and are connected. But then you know it's still do you find that that's reflecting that the rest of Hollywood is sort of noticing all that or are they just sort of noticing like the here's Lena here's Justin you know are they also being like oh here are these great actors that Lena and Justin are working with let me pluck them and use them for other projects. You know if I'm honest I don't know that that's happening yet. I don't feel like many of us and not even just actors just content creators producers of color whatever it may be writers are on the mainstream radar as much as we should be or getting the recognition that so many of us deserve necessarily. I think that people are watching our fabulous content and shows and being like oh like they're really good. Oh my god this is fantastic but still then casting someone white over a Black person a lot. It's incongruent to me. It's like okay you're it's almost like they're recognizing the talent and secret like at home by themselves but then when in the meetings and then when pitching things and then when making things happen it's not a part of that conversation. I don't think that that's happening and I'm hoping that it will on a larger scale but until then we have to just keep doing our own stuff because we can't wait you know. Yeah because you know you would see like Bisa with Insecure and it's like of course HBO wants more projects from her but then it's like the writers on her show the other actors on the show too you know like give them other projects like that's how you build out. That's what I'm saying exactly it's the build out. It's a wealth of talent. Like people are always they're always asking you like oh so I mean I know all of you guys on the show are like you guys probably are doing seven movies you know four other TV shows and we're all like no like I mean we're all working in Margaret but not not to the level I think people would assume that we are based on the type of work that we're doing. I think people think that we're just you know having. Right you're on a Netflix show. This is for Steve's people like this is Netflix like you should be in demand. Yeah I I'll speak for me personally I don't feel that's the case for me necessarily and I would say I could speak for some of my other like cohorts and stuff like that. I don't think that's necessarily the case for them either. Not at this point maybe that will change and not even just on our show on a lot of other shows too like you mentioned like whether it's insecure or whatever the show's underground like whatever it may be. I don't think that people are necessarily looking and being like we need like I don't think that that's happening at the level that it should. And what is this like as an actor does it make you feel like you need to get into also just creating your 1000 percent content because it's I interviewed Chad with Bozeman recently for a shortlist Howard on profile. Yeah I love him. And he and I were just talking about like this black renaissance that always happened but the renaissance you know like it was in the 90s it was Spike Lee and John Singleton and you know it was like directors and writers and once again it's Ava Duvarnay it's Para Jenkins it's Lena it's Ben it's Justin Simeon you know and Lena's work that feel like the acting work is coming from the fact that she's also writing and creating herself you know there's never really been sort of this renaissance where it's like oh we need to take you know these black actors like I don't really seeing like that period where like you are able to participate in this renaissance other than oh yes let's go and work with these great people but you know it should be you know when HBO is announcing like a new show or like ABC is announcing like a new show it's like here are the actors here's a pool. I hope that it changes you know because it's hard like it's really hard you know as actors we do have to create our own spaces and create our own content like that's just part of something that I think really helped me in this business was co-creating a web series with Lena and partnering with Black and Sexy TV with a show called Hello Cupid that I had and that was based on me feeling like there wasn't a space for me and so I was like I'm going to create a space for myself and create a show where I can create content that I want to see and create content for people that feel like they don't see themselves you know and so I've always believed in content creation and being a producer and the truth is like that's not everybody's j-z you know what I mean like everybody just isn't like a producer everyone's on a multi-hyphenate and that's okay yeah but I think that if you are you have to tap into that in order to have like a well-rounded and successful and a career filled with longevity I just think right you know and not everybody has a Jessica Chastade who can you know exactly which was interesting too you know it feels like at first I didn't know who had brought it up first then I saw that it was Octavia brought it up first I was like oh yeah that's fine to bring it up but you know it's um because at first I was like oh Jessica's just in these streets being like I helped Octavia but and this is referring to Jessica Chastade and Octavia Spencer sort of matched their deals together on their upcoming holiday buddy movie so that Octavia could get you know the same amount of money as her but when you think about something like that it's not like it helps every like actor you know it's just helping her and then also if that movie doesn't do well you know it's it's not like she's going to be able to keep that quote yeah you know so it's um yeah it's just interesting in seeing the way the industry is evolving right now and we're having a lot of conversations about gender disparity and pay equality and it needs to move over to actors of color yeah it has to like I've read Taraji's book which is for all actors like it's a really good book to read like it just she just goes in like she doesn't hold anything back and she talks about that happening with her with the curious case of Benjamin Button like basically finding out that she got like one percent of what you know um K-Blinchet and Brad Pitt got and she just was so hurt by it and just was so and and she ended up with an Oscar nomination and she was the one that got right none of them got it she got the Oscar's the testimony of it all I was like you know what you know what though and she was like you know and that's what she talked about she's like you know I essentially grinned and bared it and clocked it and was like you know what I'm just gonna do the best work that I can do and she came out of there with an Oscar nomination you know and that really changes trajectory of her career you know it's it's happening and you know maybe the situation with Octavia being brought to light maybe that will kind of make people more like we can't just be given the black people like fifty five hundred thousand dollars less than like you know what I mean because we about to be saying something you know what I mean I don't know what I don't know what happened I don't know if Jessica called Octavia was like girl how much is your deal and Octavia was like girl mind it I don't know how it happened you know or if they're agents just were like let's just band together on this and just say that our girls are gonna get the same I don't I would like to know how it like do you know exactly how Octavia said that she was just talking with Jessica and she was like I don't know if you know this but this is how much black women make compared to white women and Jessica was like damn yeah and that's part of it too I think that you know a lot of people just don't know and what's sad is that a lot of people in the industry who are very well-meaning also don't know because people aren't having these conversations in public and you know hopefully now that this is in public it'll give other people the chance to be like you know if we long had the the black best friend trope now let's introduce the white best friend trope who is your white actress who is like I love working with this person let me check their paycheck to make sure they're getting the same as me because you know it's talking about white women are doing this with men being like you know like wanting to make sure that you know their deals are the same but before demanding that you know they're making the same as men like they should also be looking out for women of color that they're working with and making sure that they're all on the same page thousand percent yeah I just hope that I you know that the pay equality really starts stepping it up because it's not right like can you imagine like really I mean it's happened to all of us you know it's happened to me a trillion times and it is one of those things where you have to just stick to your guns and sometimes you have to be like well I'm not doing you know what I mean like y'all can find somebody else you know and I think that there's a stigma attached to that like oh do you think you're but it's like no you have to know your worth and all situations in life but particularly when it comes to your money and how people respect you in this business and it's not just about you know making money and about you know being like oh I want to you know have like a fabulous house and cars you know it's like especially for actors who are working on television you know not everybody's Ellen Pompeo you know I think that people are still in the mindset that everyone on television makes what the actors on like an NBC sitcom in the 90s used to make no and it's not that world anymore and you know people are just trying to pay bills okay yeah well thank you so much for coming Ashley thanks for having me Ira yeah this is the best tell people where they can find your work what's coming out okay cool um so you can find me on Netflix right now
