    "text": " All right, let's do this. How are you? What the fuckers? What the fuck buddies? What the fucking ears? What the fucksters? What's happening? I'm Mark Marin. This is my podcast. WTF. You're listening to it. You chose it. Didn't just happen to you. Welcome. Welcome to the show. What is happening? How's everybody doing? How's work? You okay? How the kids? How's the wife? How's the husband? How's the partner? The partner? How's your doggy? How's your cat? Oh, my cat? It's funny you should ask because I think I told you that my cat was having a little bit of trouble peeing blood. Sorry. Good morning. And it was terrifying because the cat, La Fonda, is an old lady. She's an old lady. She's 14 years old and she's becoming more fragile. Not unlike human old ladies. Her skin feels a little thinner. She's a little lighter than she used to be. She doesn't always know what's happening. La Fonda. And I know cats get older than La Fonda, but to take her to the vet is so devastating to both of us really. Let me tell you who's on the show real quick. Rachel Bloom is on the show. Rachel Bloom, Crazy X girlfriend. And she's in a new movie that's called Most Likely to Murder that her husband directed and stars another guy that I like Adam Pally. But she's here. We had a talk and I guess I'll warn you now and I'll warn you again as we get closer. There is a high level of juvness happening at different points during this interview. This is a a a Jewey, a bit Jewey. A bit Jewey. If you like a Jewey, we got a little Jewey coming. It's not over the top East Coast Jewey, but there's a nice Jewey subtext. It's nice. It's okay. You know, what I used to think was annoying about being Jewey, I believe is now become necessary. We have to put our annoying voices out there. We have to fight the power with our juviness because don't want to normalize those Nazis now, do you? Nah, now you don't. Jew it up. Bring on the Jew. Jewish Vikings got an email from a guy said might be possible. We talked about that. When do we talk about that? A week or so ago after I was up in Oslo and Stockholm and with the Viking history, they got down there, man. They got down there into the rivers of Poland. Apparently, and they were hanging out and my brother's kind of tall until I get my jeans done, I'm going to go with I got a little Jew Viking in me. Got some stocky Jew Viking in me. And now I'm going to go with the I'm not a boat guy, but I got the other part. I got the landbound Jew Viking part. Anyways, what was I talking about? I do need to mention that our potter, our ceramicists, that Brian Jones has new cat mugs available starting today at noon, noon Eastern, nine Pacific and these mugs, these are the same mugs I give to my guests. I've got to start giving them out again. I forget to get them in the new garage. Everything's discombobulated. I have forgotten to give mugs to certain guests. I don't believe Josh Brolin got a mug. You haven't heard that one yet. I don't believe Melissa McCarthy got a mug. She's coming up Thursday, but don't tell them. Maybe I'll send them to give Mary steam virgin. I don't know if she, man, I got to start giving the mugs out again, but they're available to you as my point and they always sell out. So go get one for yourself. That's BrianRJones.com slash shop for the WTF custom mug jobs. Saw some guy in Twitter, broke his sorry, pal. If I ever you a freebie publicly as a replacement, then that becomes a policy. I can't do it, but you can buy another one. And look, I'm not going to make an a fortune off of these. These are, these are nice things for the people, people like him. They're they're a solid mug. I saw a Yachoff Smirnoff last night said he drinks from my mug every day. And he looks at my face on the mug. But he didn't say that with the greatest tone, which is unusual for him. But I think he's mad at me because of the intros I've been giving him lately. Do you need more on that? Do you need more on that? I'm going to get back to a Fonda. I know where I'm at. So La Fonda. So poor La Fonda poor fragile old lady La Fonda. I come home from Europe and she's got there's bloody pee around. So you got to take him in. She's got a it's just so sad. And now they're not they don't even have that much fighting them. So like he used to be horrendous chore to get her in the box. But Sarah got her got her in the box right away. But then I get to the vet and she just freaking out and just exhausts the poor cat. And they got to put her under just to get her X rate and give her tests and everything. So I didn't know what it was. And you don't know, you don't know, you know, they're getting old and you start just you just sort of start to wait. That any kind of illness could be the end of it at this age. So I left her there for a couple hours. I picked her up. They did all the tests. And we gave her the antibiotic. And we didn't know if it would treat the what she had. So turns out that she's got a UTI and the antibiotic that was already administered will will do it. We'll kill it. Her kidneys are good. Her liver is good. And everything's good. She's got a little bit of hip dysplasia and a little bit of fuse vertebrae, whatever that means. She's all right. Just got to get her fed and, you know, get her past the trauma of going to the fucking vet. Also, please do whatever you can to support the causes that you believe in, either through actual physical support or monetary support, whatever you got to do, whatever you think will help. Don't feel too powerless. I'm always saying this because I did some charitable contributing that I do I do once a year. And I can tell you who I donate money to to try to fight the good fight. The ACLU gets a nice chunk of change from me. A planned parenthood gets a nice chunk of change from me. And the Carolina tiger rescue. And my father. That's become a charity. No, I don't want to say I don't want to make him feel shitty. I just gave him a little present because I got, you know, no matter what I say bad about him, I own something, right? Like he fed me got me shoes, got me a car. I don't think he knew he bought me that stuff. But my went through my mother. My mother was the front office. But um, yeah, the Carolina tiger rescue. They have they safe large cats. It's down there. I went down there. So that's I'm just reminding people. If you can't get in, if you can't go out and do, you know, you can you can't afford to support support. ACLU is out there in the trenches every day, defending people who need defending and standing up for what's right constitutionally. And obviously, planned parenthood is is under attack in many states, which there is an agenda to deny women of their health care rights. So do that. And if you care about tigers or lynxes or cougars of all kinds and other large cats, jaguars, jaguars, jaguar, how do they say in England? It always bothers me. Jaguar. That's what I say. But I think when I see the commercial for Jaguars, it's like Jaguar or something, something weird. Maybe that's the right way to say it. What do I know? Little Jewiness, little Jewiness came out there. So it's setting it up. I'm easing you in to Rachel Bloom, who came over. I had to familiarize myself with her stuff. It all came, it all happened in a matter of days. It just took an intensive Rachel Bloom class. And we have things in common and it was good. You'll see there's a new magic, folks. There's a new magic to this space. It's different. And I feel it. And there's something it's more pure. It's a little more pure for me. This space, not as much clutter, not as much baggage, not as much dust or weight. It's it's clean. It's pure. These are the interviews that are happening here now in the new garage in an undisclosed location. Rachel Bloom has a new movie that she's in right now called Most Likely to Murder. I watched it. It's good. It's available on digital download and most on-demand platforms. And of course, she's always in Crazy Ex-Grow Friend. Okay. This is me and Rachel Bloom. I have a pretty good sense of what to say. Right. I mean, what am I preserving? Right. There's nothing to protect or preserve. Nothing? No. Well. It's weird because I get a reputation as being that way too because I'm pretty candid on here. Yeah. But like, you know, and then I started I started to learn that there are some things. Like, the one thing I learned is that, you know, maybe don't talk about other people. There's that one. That's my one barrier is whenever I do interviews, it's like, what can I share? I'll share anything about myself because that's me. Right. But other people, it's like, I got to be really, really careful because I still want to hurt someone. Well, but also like, there's this weird thing where it's like, well, you know, other people are involved in this thing I'm talking about. Yeah. But they don't have a voice in it. If I bring it up, you know, they can't argue for themselves. If I talk about a relationship or something. Yeah. And then they're like, well, I'm glad you had that. That's your point of view. Where do I get to share mine? Oh, you don't. Right. I win. You can just write an article for the rap or something. I wrote a memoir, you know, a lot about my second marriage, which was sort of a volatile relationship. But I was an asshole. I mean, that's sort of out there. Right. And I don't think anyone's getting sent home from work for being an asshole. Right. Yet. Even though that's technically we had a we had a whole I mean, every year we do a big HR meeting. I'm sure you do this with your house. Yeah. I do with your house. Yeah. I'm a higher and independent HR company. Just to talk to the cats. They talk to me in the cats. Yeah. We did. It's a thing with CBS and they were saying that actually if your boss is like a gratuitous asshole, that does count as workplace bullying, that California specific. Workplace bullying. You workplace bullying, which I feel like if those laws had been a thing for many years, most writers rooms before like 2007. Oh, man. Would have gotten busted. My first writers room was like an old school. I've heard stories. Yeah. Like my, the writers room for my show, like I was in charge. Right. So, but it was just me and four dudes. Like it wasn't even a big writers room. Yeah. I mean, the biggest mistake was it wasn't very diversified and there were no women. It was just four dudes or five dudes looking at the walls, waiting for something to happen. So what is that? So let me ask you because I did a conversation last night. We were talking about diversity and representation. And what I was thinking was the reason sometimes there are no women or people of color on a staff. It's like you hire people innocently hire the people they know and the people who remind them of themselves, that it's kind of a tribalism thing. Would you say that's somewhat accurate? Yeah. I mean, I think with me, because I didn't have that much money to staff and my showrunners, they were, they were a team. So they were too. Right. So that left me with like two or three positions to fill with guys who I thought understood me and knew what was going on. Yeah. It's an excuse, but some writers rooms have like 10 people in them. Yeah. And again, if you have that kind of network money, you can really mix it up. But it was like, the first season was just me, those two guys and one other guy and a writer's assistant. Sure. So you want the people you know who are going to get your sensibility and where you come from. And nine times out of 10, those people are going to be people who are like you and. But you know what, I realized though, I think that it, but I could have hired a woman and it would have been fine. You're writing television. And she can give that other sense to the other side of it. That's the thing. I mean, that's what's hard is I was the only woman on my first writing staff. What's your, what's staff was that? It was this, it was a show called Alan Gregory. Oh yeah. It was a very short live, a comedy. Made a show. Oh, an animation. Yeah. And, um, and I will say the people running it were actually very, very nice, but I was the only girl and I was the youngest. And there is something where, you know, if you're the only girl and you're a staff writer, sure, you're like the token woman's voice. But at the end of the day, you're, are you really going to have like, so it wasn't, let's say it wasn't the careers, it was someone else in the writer's room, like pitched an innocent, like kind of date rape joke, right? That happens in writer's rooms all the time. That happens instead of comedy clubs all the time. It's just easy comedy. Date rape, racist. Yeah, exactly. It's just lowest comedy. It's why like 16 year olds tell dead baby jokes. It's just like, it's the lowest. Sure. It's the easiest form. It's like a fart. Yeah. Although, farts are still fucking hilarious. So as a, the youngest person in the writer's room, am I really going to be like, um, excuse me. That's offensive. No, you don't want to come off as, and this is internalized misogyny, but you don't want to come off as like, the crazy woman who's overbearing and can't take a joke. And so it's hard to be the token. You have to, I think if you're going to hire like the one person representing their gender or their race or even their orientation, they need to be high up because otherwise if they're a staff writer, they're scared. But, but, but I mean, but the bigger question is as a comic in that moment, it's not that you're not being paid to represent a gender. The real question is like, were you offended? Yeah. You were. You were a fan. Yeah, but it's scary. I mean, I don't know. I was terrified on my first writing staff. My, my default for many years was to walk into a room, apologize for being there and assume I didn't belong there. Like, and that's just also, I think partially a gender thing, but also partially a personality thing. I'm a chronic people pleaser. I'm, I'm really like afraid of authority. And so, yeah, I walked into my first writer's room thinking, I got hired off of 30 RockSpec. That's all I had. I mean, I had a one music video out and a 30 RockSpec. And so I was, they were a Bradbury music. Yeah. That was it. It was that and a speck of 30 Rock. And I walked in being like, I'm, I was 23. Yeah. Thinking, Oh my god, I don't deserve to be here. And then some of the people on the staff were, even though they were technically staff writers, they actually had a lot more experience. It was the type of thing where they'd, cause you know, you only get bumped up if you're on a show that gets ordered to a second season. So you can be a staff writer working on many different shows for many years. If you're, if you're on shows that keep getting canceled at the first season. Yeah. Right. So some of those guys were the case and it was a really mean competitive room. And it was the type of thing where I already went in thinking, I don't deserve to be here. And then you tell a shitty joke and they'd be like, Oh, good job. Good job. And I remember one day I walked in wearing a hat that I loved. This is a beautiful knit hat. Oh, nice hat. Yeah. Oh, why you wearing a hat? Yeah. Is it going to rain? Yeah. You know, certain things used to really hurt my feelings. And, and I think sometimes they still do, but I just kind of suck it up. Like what are the type of things that hurt your feelings? Well, the hat thing would bother me. Yeah. Right. But because it's calling out the, because, because some of the people in the room are improvisers and there's this thing in improv call out the unusual thing. Yeah. And that's kind of where it comes from is I'm going to be the straight man to this scene that is my life. But it's like, why is my hat unusual? Can you just let me have a fucking hat? I don't know. Like even with the women I know in comedy and with anybody in comedy, there is a certain amount of like, kind of a ball busting that goes on. They're totally is and I, and it's a really fine line. Sure. But it's different than the writer's room. I mean, you're doing being in a sketch, being at UCB or being at the comedy store and hanging out, you know, backstage or whatever is different than, you know, the pressure and the weight of going to work every day. It's also context. My friends can, we bust each other's balls all the time. Sure, right. I mean, my writing partners and I, we are straight up mean to each other. Yeah. My song writing partners and I were mean to, but we're, we love each other. Right. It comes from a place of deep empathy and respect and love. Sure. That's way different than punching down. And going to come from deep insecurity and deep insecurity. And I mean, there's a, there's a brand of dude and I'm going to generalize here, but there's a brand of dude who has learned to use comedy only as a weapon to assert their dominance over other people. And, and that's not, I'm not a fan of that. I think comedy, I think comedy is a way to connect and enlighten. That's true. So it can be mean, but it has to come from a place over the, those people, professional comedians that you're talking about. Yeah. Huh. And in fact, this is the one podcast I've done where they actually might be listening. Everything else has been like, you know, the feminist blah, blah, blah. They're not listening to that. They're listening to this. Oh, so this is a stand up that asserts his dominance to, these are, these are various. There's a couple of people. Um, on stage, like I, I'm just trying to, these are, I'm talking more about the people I'm thinking of are more improv sketch comedians who are just very good joke writers. I mean, the type of person I've noticed that does is different. So that's, that's their, they got a, that's their swagger. Yeah. Oh, a thousand, a thousand percent. And I, and I always get the sense a little bit with some of them, especially now that I'm more confident in who I am that when a woman does it, yeah, there's a little bit of like, wait, this is what I do to get pussy. Yeah, right. You're a woman. I'm supposed to get you with my jokes, but the Pussy's being funny and I don't want to like, I can't fuck funny it. Like, you know, there's that Pussy's going to eat my day. Yes. 100%. It all goes back to castration fears, which is actually a big part of a feminist film theory that it all stems from guys. Yeah, there's this writer Laura Mulvey. I went to school for, I went to NYU where we read a lot of essays on, I don't know, sometimes not. Well, let's go, let's go, let's get, wait, let's, so I'll make note of where we ended up here, which is castration fear, which I instinctively figured out on my own and you were going to explain to me, why it's right. Yeah. And then, so let's go back though, because like, you know, you do have experience in sketch and performance, but I don't know anything about you. I've had to immerse myself in you over the last week or so. Well, I'm so, first of all, this is a really big deal for me to be on here. You know, this is, comics see this is like, you've made it if you're, if you're on what the fuck is. It's so fucking cool. Yeah. And I always in my head, when I was listening to this, when I was still like a waitress, I'd be like, who would I put on blast if I went on what the fuck? And now I'm not in that place. What does that mean put on blast? I don't know. Like, who would I, what would I be like, honest about? I mean, the thing is, I'm a very angry person, but I'm also terrified of being seen as crazy or angry. And so I have a lot of anger that I keep inside, which is why I love scenes where I get to play angry because it's very cathartic. So, but I mean, we have things in common. You're clearly a Jew. You know, and I, you know, I speak that. Yeah. But I heard your interview with Mel Brooks. It was great. I became Jewish. You started talking like an old Jew. Your nose got bigger. Yeah. Everything got big. Yeah. Everything got, everything got Jewish. Literally by the end of the interview, speaking like this. Yeah. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. I do that. I do that. I just, with any sort of charismatic personality that I keep talking to, eventually I start to morph. That's nice. My boundaries. I don't know. It's a means of, I think it's a compulsion to connect. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like, you know, I can speak that language. I can do this. What do you do? A little bit bad, but so what now you grew up in California? Yeah. Manhattan Beach. Manhattan Beach, which is, okay. So it's half Manhattan because you have a, you know, I always associate Jews starting a, did your family originate in New York? Yeah. My grandpa was Brooklyn and my father's from Boston. And my parents live their lives like East Boston Jews. Oh yeah. Boston Jews. Oh, yeah. Boston Jews. That's a unique bunch. Yes. The Boston Jews. Yes. Yeah. The family, apparently I found out was everyone was driven out of Boston by my, my father's mother who just sounds like an overall bitch. And so they all were like, they went to LA. They were like, I'm piecing out. I'm going to Philly. So all of the Boston blooms are gone because slowly my grandmother, I think drove people out is what I'm starting to hear. But they didn't sound like they went too far to where they couldn't have to, if they had to visit, they could take the train. Well, if they had to visit, you know, when she dies, pick up the things that she left behind. She is a monster. I mean, I, when I was four, yeah, I will say, there's a song on our show called Where's the Bathroom, which is a song that the woman who plays my mother says. And she's an amalgamation of various Jewish mothers. And my dad called me and said, that song is literally what my mother said when she saw my first apartment. He's like, I think that you must have been there somehow in 1971. Yeah. Mother walks in. What would, what would she say? What'd she say? She called it a hovel. This place is direct. This place is garbage. What are you doing? You're doing with your life. Yeah. A hovel. A hovel. They're horrible. They can be really horrible. Oh, yeah. I mean, I didn't have a monster Jewish mother or grandmother, but I've met them. I know who they are. Aren't you half? Are you full? Full. I thought you were half. You're in urban Arizona, right? New Mexico. New Mexico. But both my folks are from Jersey. Right. Yeah. But no, I'm full Jew. So you had a very nice mother? No. I mean, she was nuts in her own way. Selfish. It's a unique, different, it's a spectrum of selfishness is usually what you're dealing with. Sure. And sometimes it's abusive. Sometimes it's negligent. Sometimes it's overbearing, but usually whatever it is, it's all about them. Well, I think that you're getting to something. I'm very, I've become very annoyed. And this is not just with Jews. It's Italians. Everyone, when culture is used to explain away cruelty or mental illness, where it's like, Oh, I'm a what I'm a Jewish mother. I'm gonna harp you. No, you're being actually really mean right now. And don't use your fucking culture to excuse that, even though it's rooted in survival. I've noticed that because there's a main character on our shows, Filipino. And so we talked a lot about the, those similarities between Filipinos and Jews and Asian families and Jewish families. And it's an immigrant culture thing. It's you come to this country. I came to this country for what? Right. For you to go into stand up? Right. Right. No. To live in a hovel. To live in a hovel. We, we escape the cossacks for this. Right. And the premium that the, yeah, that Jews used to put on education, it's a, I guess it's a tradition of having living outside of other cultures because of the religion and being, you know, not allowed to do certain things because of that. There was always this premium put on, on, you know, becoming the best, you know, so, you know, you can show up for, you know, where they can't argue with you. Yeah. You know. Yeah. It's, well, it relates back to if you're the one woman at like us, you know, right, doing a set, you're doing it on behalf of all women. If you bomb, there's someone that audience who's going to go women aren't funny because of that one person. You won't have a person say men aren't funny because that one person bombed. There's something about being anyone who's in the minority, whatever you call minority is, is always you're representing your culture. But the other side of that, is it your responsibility? No. Right. But it, like it or not, with ignorant people, it sometimes is. Are you getting anything like that? I mean, how does, how does my crazy ex girlfriend, how does a girl friend, there's no my, oh yeah, crazy ex girlfriend. The only reason I correct people is because my makes it possessive and it makes it from a male gaze point of view. I dig it. Yeah. Crazy ex girlfriend. I don't want to be, I don't want to be accused of male gazing. You can't help it. Of course not. Yeah. It's the matter. It's the way that your brains are programmed. Men and women are different. It's okay. Oh, really? Have you used that as a topic? Yeah. Well, I, okay. I've talked about this in other places, but I'm curious as to what you think. I heard a story in NPR a couple of years ago of a person who was transitioning. They were a woman and they were taking hormones to become a man. Yeah. They get on the subway, they started testosterone, they get on the New York subway. Suddenly they see this person sees a hot woman. It's just a parable. I know, right? It sounds like in the rabbi put three more goats in that house. Yeah. They get on the subway and they start, they see attractive women and suddenly get the urge to like fuck this woman. And, and he starts the transitioning, the person who's transitioning to a man. Yeah. And they, and he realizes, oh, is this what testosterone does? And I talked to a lot of my friends about this, including my husband, and they were all to varying degrees like, yeah, like, when I walk into a room and I see a hot guy, maybe I'll register it, but it's not this involuntary. Well, but apparently, but what does, what makes you do that is it? Talking to somebody or like, I mean, how is very, you know, subjective. Hot's really subjective. I think for me, I have to get a vibe. I have to catch a vibe. Yeah. Okay. Five. I got to catch that vibe, but it's not purely physical. It's why women don't wolf whistle at men on the street. That's not how our brains work. Right. But the way that it seems that a lot of men's brains work is you, my husband described it where it's like, you'll see a hot woman in the back of his head. It's like a little voice just goes, pussy. Yeah, pussy. And it's involuntary, but another friend described it as you'll get an involuntary like camera flash of like, boom, picture me fucking her in the shower. And then it goes away. You tell me unless you, you know, continue the scene, unless you continue the scene, unless you're actually fucking here in the shower. No, I mean, like, those things come, and you have a certain amount of control over how long they go on for it. But I mean, but I think on some level, the pussy thing is right, but it's also, but it's the same thing that goes on where it's right. There's the other one is food. Right. So I get that when I see I'm a big fan of roller coasters. Yeah. And I've realized it's the same thing when I see a video of a roller coaster on TV or if we're driving past an amusement park, yeah, the way I treat roller coasters is the way I think my husband thinks about women. Well, I think there's something very primal about it and very, you know, biological about it and you know, being civilized people who have self-awareness, you know, you kind of keep that shit in check. But I think that it's undeniable, but not in any way an excuse that, you know, that we're put here on some level to fuck. Yeah, and that's, you know, always that part of the brain is always sort of like, are we fucking when we fucking is that gonna happen to? I think it's how we make more people. Yeah, it is. It's how we survive. It makes sense. And I haven't made any more people. And I know of. But that, no, I think they would have come out by now. Okay. I think that I would have met them. There's still time. Sure. Oh, for me to have people. Yeah. There is. Yeah, I know. I know. I don't know. It seems like just thinking about it. I'm worried about the kid. Like I'm worried now. Like, you know, why don't you have children? He's gonna go to school by himself. So like, I don't, you know, I, what do you, what do you mean? He's gonna go school by himself. That eventually you have to watch this thing and then like, Oh, I thought you meant like for whatever reason your kid is gonna be like alone in a school. He is gonna be like, I mean, he's got a good. No, like no other students. Oh, no. No, it's just like the worry thing. I'm an anxious person. I have like severe panic and anxiety issues. It's very maternal to automatically think that that you're not like, Oh, kid, responsibility. You're like, Oh, no, I'm gonna worry about him. It's very sweet, actually. Yeah, but like, but it gets overbearing. Like, you know, there's a, you know, worrying is not love. Were you? Like, no, no, no, because I'm like, because it's sort of like, how am I gonna deal with if something, what am I gonna do if something happens to that kid? How am I gonna handle that? Oh, it all goes back to your feet, like a fear of in a way like, God forbid that kid should die. Your life is over. It's something you won't be able to recover. Right. Because I'm making up a kid. Right. So it's a, it's a, it's got no hair color. I don't know his name, but it's just the ideas. His name's Alex. Okay. But the idea is that like, I'm responsible. And, and so much is out of my control. You know, what if something happens? And it happy. Same thing with cats though. I know and it's terrible. I think that's probably why you feel it a little bit. It's terrible. Well, it's just a, I don't know. It's just too much anxiety. I like kids and I, you know, I, I'm always, you know, I like to communicate with them. Yeah. And I like to see them, but I, I just the day to day of it. But people seem to walk into it. Are you having them? Work thing. I'm worked. It's a, it's a debate. It's a conversation. I mean, I, I emotionally want them. What is that? What? Emotionally versus what? Well, it's logistics. It's um, a lot of emotional things on my end and my husband's end. And I mean, it's hard having kids is, is fucking hard. I mean, I work 16 hours a day for half the year I work 16 hours a day. I couldn't have a kid right now. Right. I mean, if I did, I would never see them and they would grow to resent me. So there is a certain sacrifice and give and take. Plus there's the wild card of if I want to have a kid. I don't know what I'm going to be like when I'm pregnant. I don't know if I'm going to be able to function or if I'm going to be super sick. I don't know what my postpartum is going to be like. It's literally, we're, we're exactly the same. You're just a little more complicated. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because it's my body. Yeah. But like, I fear that I fear the bad post. My mom had very bad postpartum and she was very sick and I'm postpartum that lasted what your entire child. I guess so that she's still going through. Um, no, I mean, it was hard for her because she had bad postpartum and then her brother was killed in a car accident. So I think a lot of those things compounded. But I, I've heard a horror stories from other people about postpartum and and is just the way it fucks with your body. And I have a whole thing where I mean, getting it, I mean, it's getting into it's kind of boring, but I have this whole thing where like, I can't be on a birth control with estrogen because it makes my tits hurt half the month. And I have a really sensitive system anyway. So that's a whole other thing where what's it going to do to my body? What's it going to do to my mind? The kid. Just being pregnant. Yeah. Scary. Yeah. No, I can, I can, I can hear that. I mean, I, I believe you. Yeah. But I mean, but you know, and I know that some people just do it. Well, most people, a lot of people do it. Yeah. Like a lot. Like most people do it. But my, I guess my, what I'm sensing is that whatever emotional, whatever desire you have to have them as being overridden either, for emotional reasons or practical reasons, whatever the reasons are, the case is being made against having them. The cases, well, look, logically, it makes no sense for anyone to have a kid. I think that's the ultimate thing. In one way. It costs money. You're raising your practical business. Just, I'm saying purely practical. If you take out the emotion, it doesn't make logistical sense to suddenly spend all this money to raise this person. I don't think it costs much more than a pet till they're like 11. Okay. But also effort. Yeah. Because you're up at all hours of the night. You give something unconditional. Well, this gets into emotion, but you give something unconditional love that they may never. It's always conditioned. Return. It always becomes conditioned. I know. Obviously. Yeah. I think I do. I mean, it's just, and I, and I want it, the weird thing is, I say I'm afraid of being pregnant. I actually want to be pregnant. I love feeling the, this, I love feeling my friends, pregnant bellies. I love, oh, I love it. I love looking at ultrasound pictures. I love feeling where the baby is. I've always been, as a kid, I was an only child and I was a weird only child. I would, um, I would like pretend I was pregnant when I was like four or five and then I would take a shit and be like, I'm giving birth. Yeah. You wanted a brother maybe. I did. I had imaginary, I had imaginary siblings. Really? That I would fight with a word. So you were only child. I was an only child. And my imaginary siblings were Kevin McAllister from Home Alone. Yeah. Wednesday, Adams and Pippie Longstocking. Oh, Pippie. That would be fun. Yeah. But I would fight with them. You'd fight with your, and then I'd make my parents, yeah, I'd be like, Pippie's being mean and I'd make my parents come in and mediate. I'll go, uh, Pippie, uh, stop. They would do that? Yeah, they would. They'd play along. Yeah. Because they, why didn't they have other kids? You don't know. They just want to one or, uh, I, I honestly think my mom had a really tough pregnancy. My dad was 42 when I was born. Oh, wow. I just know he got a vasectomy pretty quickly after I was born. Oh, yeah. They got it done. He got that shit done. So I always come in my mom. Yeah. And not worry about it. Don't worry about it. Look at me coming in you. Um, all right. So let's go. Let's, let's, let's try to get up to it. I, because I want to talk about how it happened for you because I think that you and, and not unlike you and me as well, were part of a new media thing. Yeah. That, that, that I think made a lot of other people think, oh, I could just do it that way. Yes. Yeah. So you grew up in Manhattan Beach and you went to high school here and you did the high school theater. Yeah. I had a, yeah, I have a very good theater department and it was, we were growing up in Manhattan Beach because I grew up with, I was an anxious kid who had, I was obsessed with musical theater and thought about death and, but was also very outgoing and was raised by neurotic Jews who, you know, always talked about skin cancer. And so I was, and plus I had like, yeah, do you know your skin checked? I do. I had basal cell on my nose. Oh shit. Yeah. Yeah. They had a cut. It was a real procedure. It's not, that's not a deadly one. No, but it's like, it's a thing. And I thought like, you just get it removed like a mole, but no, they, they made a hole in my face. Yeah. To get out the, I don't even see anything. Well, if I really pointed out to you, you would see it. Like they, like, they do a Mose procedure where they keep taking out of thing. They, they cut a little bit out and then they go test it. Then they, if they didn't get it all, they cut again, but you're just sitting there in the waiting room with gauze stuck into a carterized hole that's numbed out. They do it in the same day. So you're sitting there. Oh, that's disgusting. Each time. And like they went three or four times and then I'm like, can I see what's going on? And the doctor is like, we don't usually, we don't recommend that you look at it at this point in time because it's numb. Yeah. And I go looking in the mirror. I'm like, I said, I got to see what you're doing. There's like this nickel sized hole on the side of my fucking nose. And I'm like, can you fix that? Holy shit. And then of course, the doctor with their cute fucking sense of humor is like, I think so. Oh, you think so. Anyway, so the, so you're saying you were brought up by neurotic juice full of panic. And you had anxiety problems and morose thoughts. Yes, doctor. Yes. Well, you've processed this. Oh, a thousand percent. It just sounded like I felt like I was suddenly in a very good therapy session. You're in a pretty good therapy. Pretty good. I'm not a professional. But after doing all these interviews, I think you might as well be. Yeah. Yeah. So I've gotten emails from psychologists. Do they like the show? They think it's helpful. Yeah. Some of the like, well, they think that I do a good job. But I mean, but I'm not, I'm not a clinical, you know, I mean, I'm just spitballing. Of course. I'm spitballing that you're a little fucked up. That would be accurate. Yeah. See, there you go. All fixed. But like the morose thoughts though, because I remember I was going to ask you, I've this, I always have this theory about only children, but none of them have validated it for me. Did you fear for your, did you fear, was there extra pressure because you were the only one? Yes and no. I mean, I was so, and this is more relating to anything artistic. I was so encouraged and adored with artsy stuff. That it gave me confidence, but then it became my identity, which happens a lot with musical theater people too, in general, your talent, your art, your craft becomes your self worth. Yeah. Now, were your parents creative artsy types? My dad? No, my dad's a lawyer who loves health law, health law. Like the way we love comedy. He's obsessed with it. Yeah. And my mom, my mom was a music major and is a pianist and sang in choirs. So yes. And then my grandpa was an amateur, my grandpa sold technical manuals, but on the side, he directed and wrote and acted in community theater. He was the one, we have all these videos where he was teaching me all these old songs, and he pushes me to do it again today. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it was all, no one professional. Yeah, my mom's dad, who was from Brooklyn? Oh, he spent a lot of time with that. So sweet. And he lived a long time. He lived to be 80. He died when I was in college. Oh, so you had a full life with him? I did. That's great. Yeah, I had that with a couple of my grandparents. Yeah, but it was complicated. You know, he, I mean, as it is with all Jews, I think it was, it was lovely, but also he had a really bad temper. I mean, I heard that when he directed community theater, he would make his actors cry. He would just scream at them if they were a minute late. But not with you. Sometimes, sometimes he would, he would yell at me if I wasn't wearing shoes in the house. Yeah, my grandfather was, had had a heart attack by the time I really got to know. I'm already, so he was on Librium, which was pre pre-taxile pre. It was a sort of like, just kind of kept him level. Oh, yeah. So like he was more cranky than my mother claims that he was just a raging lunatic. But by the time I met him, it was sort of like, what do we, where, why are we, are we leaving? You know, it wasn't. And he was just very placated. I think it was the same with my, I mean, I think my grandpa, not my hit my mom, but he hit my uncle. Yeah. I mean, you know, that's what you did in the 50s to just playing kids. You hit them with those and now you're doing what you're doing. What am I doing? You're, you're, you're, that's what you did in the 50s. Listen, it was a different time. I have one uncle who lives in Northern California and just completely isolated himself. Oh, he ran away from the family. Yeah. There's always one of those. Yeah, there's always, there's always one of those who's just like, I'm out, peace out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And they're probably don't even identify as Jewish anymore. Yeah. Yeah. Well, he's into, he's a mystic. Oh, sure. He's a Jewish mystic. It's a thing. He makes metal geometric objects and speaks to spirits through them. That's literally his religion. Yeah, but it's not Jewish. No, it's not Jewish. It's just a guy who has a strange compulsion that, or is there a system to, but I think they're, I think they're, he's a system. No, no, no, there are other people. There's like a guru and there are other people. I mean, but would you, I mean, if you weren't Jewish or say you had no religion, I mean, Judaism's weird in that you can be an atheist. Like I am and still call yourself Jewish, right? Right. All right. It's a religion and a race and a culture, I guess. I don't know if it's a race. Is it? I've had that question before. You thought about it? Well, I've done 23andMeAnAncestry.com and it says my race is 98% Ashkenazi Jewish. I got to do that. But you prepared to be underwhelmed. You're just going to be 100% Jewish. There's not going to be anything interesting. No. No. My brother's kind of tall. I come from Russian Polish. That's what I'm doing. Yeah, that's me too. So, okay. So you're Jew and musical theater. So that you're doing that very young. Yeah. That's what you're telling me. Yeah. Yeah. And then I went to school. I wanted to be on Broadway. And so I majored in musical theater at NYU and quickly got just disenchanted with it. But how big of a problem was your mental problems? I learned to be a very good show pony. So I think people didn't know what was going on. That's like a, you know, it's like I'm up. I'm up. Oh, yeah. So you like to cover it. You can turn that shit on. I can see it on the show. I can see it on stage. You just one of those people that like if there's a, hey, if everyone's sad in a circle, you're going to like, wait. Yes. Okay. Yeah. When I, when I'm. We're mourning here. When I, yeah. In a great life. It's fine. He was 16. So let's sing a song. Let's sing a song. Come on. Come on. Put on company. Yeah. I mean, that's what you do is you power through it. In some ways, it's good because cognitive behavioral therapy is all about deciding, you know, what anxious thoughts do you envision? But aren't you, but you're sort of backloading that. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was all going to come to a, but no, I'm just listening to you because I did the same thing. Like, you know, you know, I just plowed along and because I had a very sort of, not aggressive personality, but like my parents were not, they're just sort of like, oh, that kid's okay. He's going to be okay. That one's going to be okay. Yeah. I wasn't really okay. But you know, I ended up doing comedy. I ended up like pushing ahead. And a lot of it was because I didn't buckle, you know, like that there's something about that persistence. I guess you could call it creativity or what. I don't know what it is, but I think what you're talking about that I like is that it is cognitive because it's survival, you know, because you know, either you're going to, but didn't you fucking like, I'm now thinking about myself and didn't you fucking spin out and lose your fucking mind and end up in the goddamn college health center and breathing into a bag or what? I mean, it was slow. I think I've always been so afraid and aware of keeping up appearances. Yeah. Even at my lowest, I always wanted to seem normal. So there were definitely, I mean, moments in college where I spun out and that also has to do with romantic stuff and I mean, but you never thought you were dying or any of that shit? No, I never thought I was dying and I never, I've never really had earnest thoughts of suicide. And I think that's, I don't know what that is. I mean, I have a friend who, one of my good friends, since he was a kid, has had thoughts of suicide. I mean, he would open up the drawer in his parents' house and like, look at the knives. And, but his, but he, he on the outside had this great life and I'm in not saying my life isn't great, but I'm kind of the opposite that there's something underneath all the stuff that's really sunny and happy and positive. And there's this, the idea of just ending it. I'm like, Oh, but it'll get better despite everything. And I don't know where it comes from or what that is. Like, I used to do a bit about that, but like I think about suicide all the time is not because I want to kill myself. It just makes me feel better knowing that I can if I have to. Sure. So it's a, it's a, it's actually a cognitive stress release relief. Do you think that to soothe yourself? Like, well, if nothing else, I can kill myself. I used to. Yeah. Oh, fuck yeah. Oh, wow. Yeah. Oh my God. It was like such a go to. I think that's what's there in place of the, the, the, the father of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that, that, that what's in, like, my inability to suspend my disbelief enough to turn anything over to God is just sort of like, I could always just make myself die. But I think that is the whole that most people are like, you know, it's a spiritual void. Yeah. I mean, for many years, my spiritual void was filled with this kind of, not Jewish mysticism, but as much as like, I would say like privileged, privileged white person, like, well, the universe cares about me. So anything that, you know, goes wrong happens for a reason and you tell yourself, like it all happens for a reason. And when I'd be shitting to other people or something bad would happen, I'd tell myself, well, this was meant to happen. And then I remember the moment in college, I remember the moment in college where I was, I'd already been reading Richard Dawkins, the God delusion. So it's kind of prime for it. I went, what if it's not meant to just for a second? What if there's no fate? What if I'm just, I happen to exist? Yeah. And when I fuck up, I just fuck up. And when I mean, when I'm not mean, I'm never mean by like, when I'm inconsiderate to people, I'm inconsiderate. And when I'm irresponsible, I'm just irresponsible. And it's actually to the detriment of myself and I can learn from it. But at the end of the day, it was a mistake. And that was the moment I became a practical atheist. And I became a better person in that one moment. So my spirit, my spirituality, it happened to me in this moment, kind of the way other people described finding Jesus, losing Jesus or losing whatever that that that cushion was that allowed me to not be the best version of myself. The self-centered, rationalizing universe thing. That allowed me to also be lazy. Well, that whole thing like nothing happens, it's not supposed to happen is all relative to your perception of things. And that's where everybody gets sort of fucked up with their ego and narcissism is that all those kind of little trinkets of spiritual awareness are really relative to your perception. Yes, also it's, it comes from a place of, for me, it came from a place of privilege. Because okay, so I'm a fucking like upper middle class, you know, white person in America. And it's majoring in theater with those student loans. Of course, I can tell myself that everything that's meant to happen happens for a reason that my life will be okay. Because nine times out of 10, my life is going to turn out okay. But it's so fucking selfish of me to like think that was someone, I don't know, living in a fucking destitute area who's dying of dysentery. Like, oh, everything happens for a reason. What a privileged fucking thing to think about. Sure. Well, the other version as God has a plan. And what's your plan, man? Yeah, I know. Show me your five step. Show me your what's your five-year plan, God? I don't even have time to think about it. I don't know. You know, like that's what that, you know, the idea of God and all that when people were like, you know, I don't even think about it anymore. So yeah. So atheism is practical. I don't take responsibility. Yeah. And that's why I call I say I'm a practical atheist and a theoretical agnostic that the way that I live my life day to day is taking full responsibility for my actions and being a nice person just to be a nice person. It doesn't relate to what governs the universe. To me, the two things are completely separate. So I would never claim, we know very little about the universe. There might be a teenage alien running this computer simulation that we're all living in, but that has nothing to do with how I live my life. That's that whole story. That shit's crazy, right? I'm going to do it. No, I don't do it. What do you know? It's yeah, it's crazy. What am I going to waste my time with that? I'm going to break it down that much to believe that. Do I want to spend an hour with a person selling me on that idea that this is all hallucination or we're just part of some simulation? Do I want to be convinced of that so I could do what? What happens then? Nothing. That's why it's all theoretical. Nobody adds anxiety. If I get to a point where I'm like, well, that makes sense. Now what? I think it's just interesting. It doesn't actually change anything. I'm still existing and I'm still feeling. I think it's, I don't know. It doesn't bring me anymore. I'm not freaked out by it. I just don't have the time for it. I don't have my brain won't do that. Well, you're busy. I guess, but I think about things, but just not that. Well, maybe you also subconsciously know that, or consciously, that if you start thinking about it, you're going to spin. I'm more concerned about what is happening to our brains that are being sort of maneuvered by stimulus that diminishes our ability to think for ourselves, use our memory, and maintain our intentions. I mean, I'm more concerned with my relationship with my phone. Dude, it's all I discuss with my psychiatrist. The phone, no, the phone should. He's on me about the phone, the social media shit. It's especially, I don't know if you, but I run, I don't have ADHD per se, but I have ADHD tendencies. I might have slight ADHD. I feel the phone sending dopamine in my brain and just getting me like, did it and making me dumb. Well, it's your engagement with it. The phone is like, it's like, you know, looking at good comments from them, bad comments. The speedball. My thing now is just like, compulsively reading news. What are we doing? We're talking about your life. So, but what do you have? What do you, what is your fucking problem? Oh, I have, I guess, what's my diagnosis? I have low grade depression with varying anxiety. Yeah, I don't know. I have like low grade depression with varying anxiety and like, you know, anxious and OCD tendencies with, with a little undercurrent of ADHD. I don't know about the ADHD, but I have all the other ones. Yeah, it used to be worse. I have the exact same thing. The minor OCD, that helps comfort people. So OCD, the way I have it is different from the like, I'm going to wash my hands. I, my OCD is all looping thoughts and it's all, it always ends in the fear that the OCD or the compulsive thought itself is going to ruin my life, that the thought itself is going to attack. So, the example, okay, perfect example. All right, we're pitching crazy ex girlfriend the night before we pitch. I don't sleep at all. Yeah, of course. And it becomes this thing of why aren't you going to sleep? You fucking bitch, you know, go to sleep, go to sleep and wake up that whole week I have horrible insomnia and insomnia makes anything you have a lot worse. Then it's so bad. So then the next time, so then I get over that, but the next time I have insomnia, I happen to be in New York, it reminds me of the time that I had insomnia and it sends me to a bad place of worrying if I'm going to have bad insomnia again. All right, like seeing the sunrise kind of shit, like, you know, I don't want to fucking, I can't do this. Well, also then obsession with you can't control when you go to sleep sleep is the most fundamental thing. But when you actually think about it, it's the sleep is the act of letting go. It's the act of not controlling anything, which is crazy. If you are someone who needs to control something like me. And so I began to just spiral about sleep. And then it began to kind of haunt my every waking moment where I wasn't thinking about even even when I wasn't even worrying about the night, I would begin, I would, I was fearing the night. Because I'm gonna be alone, I'm gonna be alone with my thoughts. And this is before I started meditating and shit, I'm gonna be alone with my thoughts. I'm gonna be alone with the fact that I can't get to sleep. It's gonna be terrible. And it just began to kind of haunt the day until it was this overall feeling of dread. And then I thought, Oh my God, I'm always gonna feel this feeling. When is this feeling going to go away? And then in the middle of it, my boyfriend proposed in the middle of this thing that I was going through. And I thought, Oh my God, whenever I think of my boyfriend now, I'm always going to think about this bad feeling that I had during this thing, and it's gonna ruin and it's gonna ruin my relationship, and it's gonna attack everything. And it just was this, it becomes this trying to outthink the anxiety. And that's that's the form it it takes and still takes is this is this feeling of it feels like there's this dark thing that if I let it take over, it's just going to ruin everything. And though I know that's a hyperbolic thought, but it feels like when I'm about to have a little anxiety spiral, like I, it feels like I'm walking on the edge of a swimming pool. And I'm all and I'm fine. But if I even dip my toe into the thought, if I even form the question, I'm done. I know I know that I have that is dread, dread, it's like existential dread that leads into my fear of failure. Right, right. But that's like, that's just a manifestation of the anxiety. Like, you know, like, yeah, like, it's yeah, and it's not and it takes you out of the present, it makes you live in your brain. And I don't be good for your boyfriend, who's now your husband to, to be able to to sort of the must, he must ground you somehow. Because I mean, if I mean, I have some more things where I've been just with age, somehow or another, I don't like, I don't, I know myself long enough to where I'm like, I'm not gonna do that. You know, like, because I've gone through hypochondria, I've gone through, you know, whatever the fuck it is, where, you know, I do get panic, but usually there's some foundation for it. Mm hmm. You know, in real life. Mm hmm. And I can spin out like that, but like, it's not as hypothetical as it used to be. So what happened though, that when you went into a pitch it, where you, I was fine. Oh, because I'm a shop pony. It's always fine. That's the thing is, it's, you got to lean on that. I guess you're learning how to do that. Oh yeah, I mean, it's, it's always fine. It's never, it's never gonna be what I'm fearing because I've spent 31 years doing this. Right, exactly. So that, that's, and it's so it's a matter of outsmarting it, but not outsmarting it. But do you, do you ever think it's part of your process? Have you gone down that road? What, what would I do without this? Like, there's got to be, no, because I don't feel like myself when it's happening. There's a different, something comforting about it. If you've been doing it all your life, no, it feels like I'm trying to outsmart it and solve it. That's what it feels like. It feels like I'm trying to solve something. I'm trying to solve the unsolvable. I'm asking questions that have no answers. I know, but that, that particular pattern, tell my mind works and it definitely relates to being creative. I think it's the dark side of my creativity. But don't, but don't you ever think like, oh, I don't know, it sounds like your parents are okay. Why is such a control freak? Well, remember when we were saying, it's like, I mean, here's the thing. My, let's just say there are, there are, I can talk about my experiences, but when it comes to certain things, in general with my family, I, it, there are certain people I don't want to upset. Uh huh. Okay. Yeah. Well, how bad was it? Everything's great. Showpony. What are you singing song now? Everything is fine. So, but okay, so you go to Tisch. Yeah. And that's, that's the hard school. Yeah. And you, and you didn't, you didn't love it there. Why? What happened? Well, when you major in musical theater, first of all, everyone who majors in musical theater were, were all the leads of their high school plays. So you get there and it's a bunch of other like silverback gorillas who are like, well, I was spontaneous. Now I was spontaneous. And also musical theater kids, young musical theater kids are kind of the worst because they're all like comparing voices. Everything is like, who is the best actor? Who's the best dancer? And it's just like, it's terrible. And, and it was also that I was immediately faced with people who were more talented than I was. And that's terrifying when your whole self for real though, or just, I mean, uh, yeah. Do you look back on it and you think that or do you look back on it? They just had more together? I mean, I mean, you're pretty talented. I mean, what would determine that? But it's like a binary technique thing of this person's voice. It's literally sounds better. Okay. And this person has more control over their instrument, whatever, whatever. I get it. And so there was a part of me that felt like I didn't fit in that I was kind of tired of people's personalities. And also then we started to use to when you start to study musical theater, some of it is brilliant. When musical theater is good, it's the best thing in the world. When musical theater is bad, it's the worst thing in the world. And I just began to, I don't know, I just something didn't feel right. And so I auditioned for the school sketch comedy group and I got on. And I very quickly like fell in love with that sketch comedy. I mean, it was the quickest I've ever fallen in love with anything. I immediately, I remember writing my first one of my first sketches on a lunch break at musical theater school, like on the floor in my ballet shoes. It's, it's all I suddenly wanted to do. I became obsessed. And I think part of it was because it was a new skill. I didn't have my ego wrapped up in it. So I was okay to be on a group with a bunch of people who are more talented than I was. Because my ego wasn't wrapped up in being the best comedian. So I was finally, for the first time, free to try my best at something, fail and be okay with that. And so in, but in musical theater school, I started to subconsciously not try. First of all, because I wasn't getting a lot of sleep. I mean, I've had sleep problems since I was a little kid that I've only recently, that I only in the past couple years recently dealt with. So I was getting five hours of sleep a night. And so I was exhausted and kind of wigged out. But also I wasn't trying because if I then wasn't good at a song, I could say to myself, well, I could, I mean, if I wanted to, I used to do a joke about that, like sort of like, I don't prepare, you know, because like, if it goes well and you don't prepare, you're fucking genius. If it doesn't go well, you can just be like, not in prepare. Exactly. And it's so great when you don't prepare and it goes well. Because then you start to tell yourself, well, that's just my process. I don't memorize my lines. That's just my process. But the problem with that is like, you keep doing that and you know, you keep having success. At some point you realize like, I'm the only one who thinks this is good. Yeah. Like, it's like, there are people like she's not really that good. And you're like, but I'm so honest. Oh, yeah, I took an on camera acting class. And I was doing the thing where I hadn't prepared much and it was just coming from impulse. And then they, and then I watched it and it was garbage, absolute trash. And I was like, oh, I need to start preparing. Shit. But you were in it though, right? You felt like you were now on it when you were doing it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because I was like, oh, it feels so true and so pure. So what if I'm not getting the lines? Doesn't matter. That's a, that's an important hit to take. Yeah. Right. Yeah. All right. So, okay. So you like the improv and you do it. And what you drop out, are you finished? No, you finished. No, I finished. And then you're not going to quit. No, no, no. I mean, it was a weird thing where I was on the sketch group and this is a whole other thing. But I, I was the one of the only girls on the sketch group and I was really young. I was a very young 18, like I hadn't drank or smoked or sex. And the older guys who were my directors started flirting with me and hitting on me as it happens. And I got kind of unwittingly involved in this like love triangle that then, because they were young too. I was like 19 and they were 20 people. Yeah, the sketch group people, they, I was supposed to be the director of the group and because I got in this love triangle and fell in love with one of them, but the other one also loved me. And then like I dumped one of them and continued to see the other. I got removed as director for my college sketch comedy group. So this was a by them. Yeah. So it was like a defining moment for me because I think that the way I learned comedy for the first year or two was just doing almost doing an impression of what those guys were doing. And when this whole thing happened, I said, Oh, okay. So the mentors I thought who I trusted, who then wanted to fuck me and and now they've completely turned on me. I'm just going to do my own thing. And that's when I started to want to combine musical theater and comedy. It was only after that happened and I kind of rejected them as my mentors. Oh, and then that's when he started to move towards the videos. The videos came a couple years later. But you used to, well, how did you start to fuse them without them? Did you start going to perform other places? Yeah, I took a musical theater writing class. Yeah. Oh, that's good. And then this was after graduating. I wanted to have a show running at UCB because that was that's the status symbol. If you have a show running at the upright citizens brigade theater in the basement of the supermarket, yeah, you're done. You're in. You're in. You might as well be famous. I mean, that's that's really how you how I saw it. And I was doing a sketch. I was working out the sketch show and one of the sketches in it was a song about the movie space jam. Yeah. And I wrote it with my friend and I played it for my boyfriend, who's now my husband. I built my husband for 10 years. Yeah. I played it for my husband and he went, you should just be doing this for the show. This is way more than me. Well, this is interesting though. You must have been one of the only people. I don't know. But I don't mean you're you're one of the kids. I don't I'm old. I mean, but it seems that what you do, I've not really seen it in like, I mean, were there other people doing musical comedy sketch shit? No, no. And it felt so obvious to me because it seemed like there was an obvious there was a gap in musical theater when I tried to find a comedy audition song. It was just these lame lame songs, especially for women, either old ones are just like songs that were funny adjacent. I think that also like, you know, until Glee, it wasn't particularly popular anymore. No, but I mean, I didn't know that. And when you're in the musical theater community, it's always popular. I mean, Glee's all first of all, Glee's all covers. So that I'd be but just, you know, cultural resonance outside of Broadway. Oh, yeah. It just wasn't happening. No, no. And so that's why I'm going for, I mean, even now with with Crazy Ex Girlfriend, it's still it's a cult show. Oh, in terms of who the people who love it? Yeah, like when people love it, they love it. And but there are still a bunch of people who hear it's musical and won't watch it. Okay. Let's not get there yet. So okay. So he, he says you should only be doing this. He's not only but he said for this sketch show, this is way more unique than just doing sketches. And so then I, I made my first musical sketch show and I just felt it click. I felt it. Yeah. And I felt so fell in love with it. And I thought, okay, I want to be my own kind of one stop shop comedy. I want to be my, I want to write my own shit and star in my own shit. And I want that to be, I want to be my own one person sketch group. Yeah. So I'd seen people doing internet sketches. And I thought, okay, what can I do? And I had a song that I'd written in college that I didn't know what to do with called Fafmere Bradbury. It was when I was thinking of sketches to do and a song popped into my head. And I said, Oh, that could actually make a really great first sketch as a music video. And so I made it for $2,000 and not, because you don't set out to make a viral video that doesn't make any sense. I made a video that I thought would be a great comedy calling card. And it went super viral and got me representation. That was 2010. 2010, yeah. Yeah. Because I started this in 2009. Yeah. And but it's interesting that even then though, I mean, it went viral and that brought you attention, but that was like, we started, even though YouTube had been around a bit and podcasting and been around a bit, it was just there was this moment. Yeah. Where you could break out of it. Now, of course, you have people that are specifically YouTube or only podcast or whatever, but there was a bit of a moment where you could break and you set that standard in a way. So like hundreds of young people because of you were like, you just got to put the video up. Well, and the cool thing, the thing was the thing that set me apart, I think, is because we were just coming out of, so the landlord funnier die sketch happened in, I want to say 2007, maybe 2006. And it kind of had this grainy home video quality to it. And so most sketches at that time were that. I had seen other people use great cinematography and there was the cinematographer in New York, Paul Rondo, who was his one stop shop. He had all his own equipment. And so when I wanted to do a music video, I thought, what if what if I make it look good like some of these other videos that I've seen? So I think that when I released that music video, it was also unique in that it looked cool. Yeah, it looks great. And it looks professional. And that's just because I got a great, take much to do that, right? That's what people don't, that always gets me about podcasting. It's like, you just need a good mic, man. Don't get the fucking snowball and sit it in the middle whatever. But even now, I mean, the cameras, even on the phone, right? Well, now, I mean, the phones are better than we have a Canon 70, the phone, my husband's new phone is better. So that's history. So you got representation. And that's history. And you wrote a spec script, but it wasn't like it took a crazy ex-girlfriend to really put the whole vision together. Well, it was kind of a slow burn because I was a working so after I got hired for my first gig, writing for which I'm eternally grateful, by the way, I was a cartoon coaching about it earlier. But yeah, I'm eternally grateful for that. I kept writing for TV. I wrote for robot chicken. You had Seth on here. He's the fucking best. And I just kept writing for TV in various award shows. But then I did another UCB show of here. And I kept doing music videos that I was paying money that I was paying for out of what I earned as a TV writer. And so it was those videos that this woman, Alene Broshman, Kenesaw, five years ago at this point. And she is this big deal screenwriter. She wrote The Devil Wears Prada. I like that movie. Yeah. And she called me in for a general meeting at CVS. And she said, I want to write a musical TV show with you. And I'd already pitched. She found you? 1000%. Yeah. You know. For the video, again. And no one could have, it wasn't my rep sending me around because no one had really, I was doing the musical thing and they knew it was good. But you can't, I'd pitched two musical TV shows no one gave a shit. And you're doing relatively low profile writing jobs. Yeah. So you guys put this show together, she finds you. Yeah. And she had the idea for a movie called Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. And we thought that would be a great show because she was saying that all my videos were, there was always this moment of sadness. They were all very, they were out there, but they were very emotional. And so that idea really worked. And we developed it together and you had emotional sadness and emotional menace. And then you get a great kind of funny character. Actually, it's very true. It's dead on emotional sadness and emotional menace. Mm hmm. So hot. So hot. So hot. So is less, less of a trickster, but he's more insidious. Yeah. So in that, and then the rest is like, you know, you did, it's doing great. You're doing what one more season? One more season. And you want a golden globe and a critics choice and another one. Tease a television critics association. Have you been to that one? Yeah, I went, yeah, I did go that one. And I like the sag words. That's the one that's the, that's the golden goose I can't get. Oh, I just liked being there at the most. I, I didn't, you know, because like, I'd interviewed a lot of the people and now I was there as an actor. And I felt like I was part of a community. It was nice. And Francis McDormand came up to me and told me, I love you on that show. Oh, that's so cool. And I'm like, oh, I kind of won. That's, that's fucking awesome. Yeah, I won. Though moments like that are where you really win. I mean, the awards are wonderful, but the first person who emailed me after I won the Golden Globe was Carol Burnett. Oh my God. That was my win. That was my golden globe. Exactly. Like that done. Yeah, that's all I need. That's great. And you know, I watch the show and I like it. I, you know, it's like, you know, I, because I'm the kind of person I am, I would probably categorize it as a guilty pleasure. Sure. Huh? Well, dig into that. Why? Because I'd like to think that like, I don't know if this show's really for me, but I enjoy it. So interesting. Why would the show not be for you? Because you know, you're singing. It's funny because we get in, because you're, I assume you've watched a couple episodes of season one, season three is all about we get way more into mental illness. And I have a suicide attempt. Oh, my character's diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. You don't have that to you? No, I don't have borderline. But I have, I have, I have, I have intimate knowledge of, I know people with it. Yeah, me too. Yeah, it's rough. It's really interesting. That's the way I could see that from the ones I've watched it. That would be where it would go. But you, you didn't have that, you didn't have that arc set up early on, did you? We knew something was going on. The interesting thing about borderline is it's a heightened, it's, it's, it's, it's basically someone with no emotional skin. It's someone who always has these, it feels like they have third degree burns. They're so hypersensitive. And so I have aspects of that. We all do. And it's stuff that we do just heightened, which, which is what borderline is. So we always knew she had heightened aspects of stuff that I'd had and other people had had. But also truly incapable of real emotional connection. Yeah. And very black and white thinking. Yes. And, and manipulative horror show. Yes. Yeah. And the split, and the splitting, I've started to rewatch a little season one. And I, I'm always there. I was always there. We're like, Oh, oh, she's ill. Yeah. Oh, she's very ill. And then, you know, there's a character who keeps, who keeps one, I know, right? There's a character who keeps, you know, wanting to fuck her. This character, Greg, I'm like, I dude, dude. And it's later revealed spoiler. He's an alcoholic. And in season two, he goes through like a program. I guess what there's no reason I should, you know, I, I forget, because like even the show I'm on, you know, glow, that there's a lot of heavy shit going on. But because there's wrestling, you don't process the same way. And because there's music, you're not processing, because like, if I really think about those, the first few episodes, where you're basically, you know, just sexually abusing that guy. Yep. That like, it's like, no, this is horrible. But oh, she's singing. And there's, and there's a sheet over it. Now, here's a question I would pose to you not to get controversial is if you see both theoretically, glow and crazy ex-girlfriend, as things that you would call guilty pleasures, right? There are things that you theoretically enjoy. I mean, don't, I mean, I think I was just being, yeah, no, no, sure. But I wonder if there's a little bit of that, that is because it's shows created by starring women. And I'm not saying that it's you, but I think that men see female content, even if it's on a deep subconscious level as fluffy. But I wonder generally about it. I think that's a good question, because like, I talked to a lot of dudes about glow and they're like, that wasn't going to watch it. Yeah, why? And then why, man? Because of that. Sure. Yeah, I mean, that's not we didn't just crack a code. No. That's true. Oh, we've got it. Sometimes men don't like women. But what is, but why? No, I just, I just think it's a relatability thing. Sure. That, you know, I don't think it's, I'm sure there's levels of it that might be insidious, but I think a lot of it's sort of like, it's not for me. You know what I mean? Like, that might just be in cultured. And I don't even think it's misogynistic. But the labeling and not saying this is necessarily you, but the sometimes content that has women in it is created by women and seeing quote unquote female is labeled as fluff. And you see, I didn't think that. Yeah. But but but you see that. Yeah. You see, that in every kind of aspect of art, things that take on things that are true for women. It's true. My girlfriend's a painter and she, you know, she gets mislabeled like that. Yep. You know, that that that's sort of it's lighter. It's this. Yeah. And it just, you know, it's just because it's not for the mainstream gays. I mean, we did it for the market. Or the market. They're determining it. I mean, the market itself, the people that make those decisions are acting out of, you know, either, you know, it's a principle or whatever. They believe the market is this way or that way. But it's not always about like the audience. You know, there's people making those decisions, you know, but nine times out of 10, those people are male. Sure. Right. But but the interesting thing, I mean, you see we did it with with entertainment. Yeah, please do it. Tell me why I'm wrong. But for years, we've done it with entertainment that we see as, oh, well, that's for, you know, black people right now. Here. And the way that you see, like, oh, well, stuff that was on UPN or BET or Tyler Perry, well, that's, that's fluff. Like it's in the same way people sometimes think of female. I guess so it's weird. I never noticed that because I always think like it, it's either like, you know, maybe it's not for me, but I don't think it's fluff or it's for kids. Uh huh. It's even not for me. It's either for kids or it's like, that seems to be a show that other people would enjoy who live that life. I think that's one way to look at it. But I think there is also a labeling of anything that isn't the mainstream story. Yeah. Is slight is less legitimate. It's less legitimate of a story. And it's a niche product. All right. Well, everything's a niche now. So it's hard to make. Well, exactly. And that's why it's great. And that's why, you know, peak TV is so great. I mean, we're, that's what I'm really feeling is breaking out of what's, you know, legitimate what, what isn't. I mean, I think that everyone, I was at the dinner for, I was at the Vanity Fair dinner for the Oscars. And big shot. The, oh, I know. And the only time people stopped talking. Yeah. When Francis McDormand one was talking about, um, inclusion writers, but when Jordan Peele won, forget out. Yeah. And when get out was maybe gonna win. Yeah. Because even a couple of years ago, that movie wouldn't have been seen as legitimately let alone that it was conceived by a comedian, which comedies are always seen as less legitimate and get out. It's not a comedy. But when you think about something like the idea of things not being as legitimate, because they're not about a king learning not to stutter, a white king learning not to stutter. No, it's a great movie. What? It wasn't a great movie. I actually really love that movie. Nice. I actually really love that movie. But when I saw that movie, I went, well, that's a prototypical Oscar movie. Sure. And I think that those lines are starting to blur and that includes content created by many voice for women. Exactly. And that's, it's refreshing. Good. But I, but that's why I take, I take Umbridge with the term guilty pleasure. In the case you're saying it makes sense because it's musicals, but I think that that sometimes is code for um, seeing something meant for a specific group of people. It's like, well, it's like you said like you're uh inverted, not inverted misogyny, but internalized misogyny. Well, I think that it's a version of that, you know, that like they can't, and it's also a version of it. Some of it might just have to be with posturing. Do you know, like, you know, because I know, you know, many sort of evolved people that, uh, you know, don't necessarily want to cop to liking journey. Do you know the band? Sure. So like, I think some of it just has to do with not having the balls or the, to, to, to support something like that. Uh huh. Like I love the band fun. I know a lot of people who are like, Oh, yeah. And it's an off-spand. Yeah. I love that band. Yeah. He's a pop wizard. Yeah. I know some other people who are like, they just generally don't like a, I like, I like steel train. I like his other band, the Grateful Dead band that he was. Yeah. No, I know exactly. I think some of it's that, but we don't have to solve this. No, I think we should take the take a few minutes. I hear your husband made a movie. Nice segue. Yeah. My husband made a movie and I made it and he co-wrote it. And it's great. I watched a, I watched about half. Uh huh. And it wasn't because it was bad. I just, you know, I didn't get the fucking screener till this morning, for some reason. Don't, don't go yelling at anybody. It's good that I only watch half because it is sort of a suspense, you know, it's a murder mystery. And I can't spoil it because I don't fucking know what happened yet. Great. But I like Adam Paulie a lot and you're great. Yeah. And it looked great. It was shot nicely. He directed it. Yeah, he directed it and then co-wrote it with, um, with the guy who plays uh, Duane, who has that shin beard. That's my husband's writing partner in producing partner. Oh, really? Yeah. But it looked, it, it looks great. And I've seen a lot of indie movies that are comedies and like that you're just sort of like, oh, these characters aren't going to hold up. There's a problem with comedies of any kind where, you know, they don't, uh, consider the integrity of the character and they gets diminished for the comedy. That's very, yeah. That's very important in both me. And that's something that my husband and I definitely connect on is not selling out emotion for a joke. Yeah. No. And it looked great. And uh, is that Billy Eichner for a minute? Yeah. For the, he plays the rabbi. Yeah. And you have rabbis in your family? I, my cousin is a rabbi, yes. Progressive rabbi? Uh, he's a progressive conservative rabbi. So whatever that means. Right. Right. So not reform. Uh, where's it? Where's Iamica but supports gay marriage? Yeah. Sort of, uh, you know, okay. Yeah. But, uh, but yeah, no, I, I think it, it looks great. And, uh, thank you. I appreciated the, the, the long, uh, the long sort of pan shot at the beginning. What do you call it? A tracking shot? Tracking shot. Yeah. I know that he was like, you know, I'm going to do this. You can tell. You could tell that he was like, and this is the tracking shot. Yeah. This is like the opening tracking shot. Like, like the Orson Welles touch of evil or, and then the player did a riff on it. This is my riff on the tracking shot that really has nothing to do with the rest of the film. Uh, it, and here's the thing I'll say about that. It actually does the tracking shot comes back. The idea of the tracking shot does come back visually. It's called back at the end of the film. Oh, so bookends. So I could see you spoiled it. I did. Exactly. You spoiled it. For the film nerds. Spoiler alert. You're going to get into the tracking shot. That opening image is going to come back in the closing. I like it. Yeah. It's funny. And like, I think Adam Paul is funny. I think he's like that. Uh, I've seen him in other things. I've seen him in Bayna's movies. Yeah. So he used to be writing partners with my husband and Doug who's in the movie. Oh, really? Yeah. And the three of them were a sketch writing team called Shubby Skinny Kids. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And now Pally's kind of gotten, he's has this acting career. And so they wrote this part for him. Yeah. I feel like I've seen him grow up or something. Yeah. And he's a really, the thing is he kind of has this like, you know, he, he has this irreverent persona. He just did that thing at the Shorty Awards. We took down the Shorty Awards. I thought it was hilarious. But in person, he's, he's also very, very kind and Jewish guy. Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course. Jersey maybe? Uh, yeah. Jersey lived in Jersey by way of Chicago, I think. And he has three kids and he is married to his high school sweetheart. That's wild. And this takes place in Long Island. Is it Long Island? Yeah. My husband's from Long Island. Uh, but he's not Jew, right? Oh, super Jew. He was raised conservative. He was raised in not celebrate Halloween. Really? Yeah. He went to Yeshiva until he went to Yeshiva until he was 14. He would get a look at you marrying the Jew. I know it's terrible. It's terrible because we all descend from 350 people eight years ago, eight, eight years, 800 years ago. Like eight years ago. This one, those conspiracy. Yeah. Eight years ago. It all happened eight years ago. Eight years ago. And the fossils came up in the simulation we're living. Yeah. Yeah. Well, what could have happened? Uh, we could have been created, been created five seconds ago. And we're all just in playing with his memory. Oh, he's falling asleep. Uh, but yeah, no, he was raised super Jew. I mean, you know, he, he and I both dated non Jews and I don't know, we're both ashamed of it. Wow. Shame. I'm not shame. It's just much like, uh, we're so progressive and cool. We could have done so much more instead of make his parents happy. Mm hmm. His parents are thrilled. And it's like, of course everyone's thrilled. Everyone's thrilled. The state of Israel's thrilled. Really? You don't know. No, no, we've been to Israel. They're thrilled. Oh, they are. Yes. They're hoping you're going to come there and send money. Oh, that we went there right before, right before the election. And everyone said to us, and this is weird because a lot of Israel support Trump, but they said, Oh, and maybe you come, maybe you come here and you make TV and tell of you. And we're like, Oh, we're pretty happy. American, they go with Trump coming. You may have to come here. They were almost psyched for another Holocaust. It was very weird. You might have to come here. So that's the new pitch. It's not like we're always here for all Jews. It's like, guess what? Guess what? It's coming. In Hebrew, I think the show is called Haig Sita Mita Refit, which is crazy. It's girlfriend. But I think it literally means like insane person I used to date. Oh, and they like it in Israel? I think so. Jews. Yeah, Jews in general seem to like it. Okay. Good. Well, then I'm glad you're making them happy. That's no, that's no small task. Oh, I know. It was great talking to you. It was great to be satisfied. Do we do what we needed to do for plugging the movie at the end? Yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah. There you go. Couple of Jews sitting around talking. Okay. Everybody okay with that? This is where the car, the guitar is going to be soon. Boomer lives. I'm super pleased to share with you this written driving service actually has been filled with this"
