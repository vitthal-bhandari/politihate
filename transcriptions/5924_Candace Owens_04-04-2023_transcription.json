I was overwhelmed with happiness when I heard that there was a bill being proposed that had bipartisan support that was being colloquially referred to as a TikTok ban. What's really in that bill? Plus, later on in the show, we're going to discuss JoJo Silla because she's pretending to be pregnant for attention. And I also happen to think that she might be pretending to be a lesbian for attention. And I want to talk about that. All that and more today coming up on Cana Salons. I've said this before and I'm going to say it again. It is totally weird to imagine a world where people just got onto a plane without being frisked. Just imagine your parents. They lived in that world pre-9-11 people were not having to take off their belts and their shoes and go through TSA. There was no such thing as a TSA. And then 9-11 took place and there was fear-mongering that took place and they needed to pass the Patriot Act for our protection, of course, because terrorists might be on plane. So all we had to do was give up a little bit. Okay, now a lot of bit of our freedom so our government would keep us safe. And we did it without thinking. Of course, I was too young to have thought, but everyone else agreed that something had to have been done because al-Qaeda or ISIS or terrorism after 9-11. So my generation does not really have that memory of freedom on the plane. Freedom to just go where you wanted to go without being treated like you were a convict. Treat it like you had done something wrong as soon as you show up to the airport. Treat it like a criminal. That's just the truth. China, by the way, as a country has no memory of freedom whatsoever. I'm thinking about that because a while ago I had a conversation with my husband and I was just remarking how is it plausible that in a nation that has what is it 1.5 billion people, that there hasn't been an uprising against their totalitarian government. How is it plausible that a tiny little government is able to control that many people? And that was my husband's response because they have no memory of freedom. But would they be uprising for? But would they be uprising against? This is just the norm in the same way that I go to the airport and I just go, well, this is just the norm. It's always been like this. It hasn't actually always been like that. People in China have that exact same feeling. They just go, well, it's always like this. The government has always been invading our space. The government has always been telling us what to do every single minute of every single day. I don't want America to become like China or we have no memory of freedom whatsoever and the generations don't uprise against the totalitarian system because what would they be uprising for? By the way, I think China is already invading America via apps like TikTok. I think I've probably been the most outspoken conservative against TikTok. What do I tell you on the show? TikTok is an online insane asylum. It's ridiculous that this Chinese app, which the Chinese use to advance education is instead of America advancing identity. People are doing more and more extreme things for views on TikTok. And I also think it's shortening our attention span. I have been a strong advocate. I say if your child has access to a phone, you should personally in your own capacity ban TikTok usage. I won't allow my kids to have it. It's that simple. So you can imagine how absolutely thrilled I was when I heard that Congress was proposing a TikTok ban altogether. Wow, I thought this is just too good to be true. They're listening to the Candice show. Maybe they're listening to what I am saying and they realize that we cannot allow this to happen. We cannot allow our kids to be raised doing this for attention. We can't allow, we can't expect them to go on to become well-meaning adults when they're competing for attention via more derogatory things, more derogatory behavior. And of course, it actually turned out that it was too good to be true. And I guess the first red flag was the fact that it had bipartisan support. What do you hear of there being bipartisan support for anything? Also, since when does our government care about people learning things that are bad on the internet? They don't care that America's becoming dumber and dumber. So this was unusual. And it turns out that this TikTok ban, as they're calling it, no, actually, it's the Restrict Act. What it actually is, is another element of wiping away the memory of American freedom. So let me tell you exactly what is in this Restrict Act. First and foremost, it gives full power and authority to the executive branch, the executive branch, to determine what and who is considered a quote unquote foreign adversary. It would be the decision of the director of national intelligence and the secretary of commerce. And the secretary of commerce would get to pick a few of their friends, some of their homies and their friends to join him or her in deciding who or what are foreign adversaries. So you have to imagine there will be an unelected board of people sitting back, deciding if something is potentially a risk to national security that allows this made up department, a figment of the executive branch to audit at any time any internet application that has a million users or more. That would include your doorbell camera, the application ring, think of any web based tech that you have in your home, any of it at all. At any moment, the United States government could access that to protect you, of course. Now let's say that they decide that one of the applications that you're using, I don't know, let's say Telegram is bad, because Telegram by the way was first created by the Russians. And they see that you're using Telegram to communicate anonymously about how you really feel about the Ukrainian war, despite the narrative that they have decided upon, which is that billions of dollars gets to go to Ukraine. And Zelensky is a hero, but you don't feel that way. So you're on Telegram using an anonymous account and saying that, and you're able to do that because you have a VPN, a virtual private network. You guys listen to the show, I tell you all the time that you should have a VPN. Well, guess what this bill says? This bill says that if you're using a VPN and they try to access your tech at home and they can't because you've scrambled your router, well, then they're going to arrest you and they're going to put you in a prison for a minimum of 20 years or you're going to have to pay a fine. Here's what Greg Price had to say about this bill on Twitter. He wrote, the bill to ban TikTok is absolutely terrifying. It gives the government the ability to go after anyone they deem as a national security risk at which point they can access everything from their computer to video games to their ring light. This is a Patriot Act for the internet. Believe it or not, it gets even worse. If they find you in violation, they can put you in jail for 20 years, find you for a million dollars and seize your property. They can also deem any foreign government and adversary without informing Congress and everything they do is not subjected to a freedom of information act. If this was about banning TikTok, it would pass a bill that simply bans TikTok. But the uni party is trying to create the same system of domestic spying that they did after 9-11 for the internet but on steroids. So yes, he is correct. That is what this bill is. There's not a ban on TikTok. What it is, is a ban on freedom. What this is is the American government emulating the Chinese Communist government. In China, there is no free internet. They cannot gain access to the web to read another take or gather information about what their corrupt government is up to. Why? Because when a government aspires to become totalitarian, it is necessary to enslave the people that they govern to their preferred narrative, which is always a lie. They're always lying. So they need to make you force you to believe their lies. What the Restrict Act actually is, is another incursion into the memory of American freedom. If this bill isn't stopped in its tracks, it is going to be your children that are one day saying, isn't it weird to imagine a world in which people just accessed the internet freely when they were just able to jump onto a website without fear of punishment or retribution from the government? Yeah, that will be our kids one day, if we don't stop this. And that's all I have to say about that. Profiling surveillance and data harvesting. There are lots of things I don't like about tech giants, but what can you actually do about it, especially when you rely on so many other products? We don't all have billions of dollars to buy Twitter. The good news is you don't need to be a billionaire, take a stand. All you need to do is what I do and use ExpressVPN. How do you think big tech companies make all of their money anyways? It's by tracking your search history, video history, and everything that you click on. Then they sell your personal data. When I use ExpressVPN, they can't see my IP address at all. My identity becomes completely anonymized by a secure VPN server. It sounds complicated, but ExpressVPN is actually incredibly easy to use. You just fire up the app and you click one button. Plus it works on all of my devices, my phone, my laptop, even my Wi-Fi router.

Okay, now it's time for some topics to do. JoJo Siwa. You might remember her from Dance Moms. I've covered her on the show before because her behavior is becoming increasingly erratic. She was very likable by the way on Dance Moms, even though I feel like we did watch a ton of young girls get abused by Abby on that show. But she really is an example of why I do firmly believe that children should not have cameras in their face when they're young, whether that be a child acting or whether it be via a reality TV show. JoJo Siwa is somebody that is conditioned to want attention. I've been watching as she becomes more extreme in how she gets attention and of course social media feeds those extremities. If you want more attention on social media and you have access to social media like she does, all you have to do is say things like, I'm actually gay or I'm actually a lesbian. I don't believe JoJo Siwa is a lesbian, by the way. I want to state that very clearly. I do believe that she's desperate for attention and you're not going to believe what she's doing now. But first, let's back it up to just her announcement back in October of 2022 about how she realized she was a lesbian. Take a listen. One thing about me is that when I was 12, Samuel Vato came out with the song Cool for the Summer. I really, really liked it and listened to it all the time. I did not know what it meant back then but now that I'm much older than I understand, I know what it means. Then a few years later, Jenna DuWont went on lip sync battle. She did a really great magic mic number. I pretty much watched it every day. Little me, she didn't know she was gay until a couple years later, a man was my first date. And he wanted to have sex with me. And I did not want to never want to grow stop by the thought of it immediately new. Men are not my thing. Women are my kid. Got to go. Okay, so let's just back that up. Three things that made her realize she was a lesbian. First, she says that she listened to Demi Lovato's Cool for the Summer song, which she had no idea what it meant. And now she does know what it means. Then she said that she watched Jenna DuWont dancing over and over again to Magic Mike on So You Think You Can Dance. And then she found out later that Jenna DuWont was lesbian. And then last but not least, she went on a date with a guy and the guy wanted to have sex with her and she was grossed out. And then she realized, oh, that's it. Obviously I'm a lesbian. One plus one plus one must equal, I'm a Lesbo, like, or something. And that's, I guess, the idea here is that she suddenly realized she was a lesbian because she had a bad date. And she liked the way Jenna DuWont danced to Magic Mike. It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. And it's very clear to me that she did that video for attention. She got attention because it's a great way to find a community of victims. And of course, there is no community that is louder, more war-ous than the LGBTQIA never ending Alpha-Botsu community. Now they're behind her and she does their bidding all the time. And this has become a brand for her. She's a lesbian, guys. And she goes out and she defends other lesbians and other gay people. And nobody's ever questioned whether or not this girl is literally just doing all this for attention. Now, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe she is a lesbian. Maybe it is true that if you see Jenna DuWont dancing, you might also become a lesbian. Or maybe it's also true that if you two go on a bad date, which all of us have gone on, you might be like, maybe I'm a lesbian. I've been on some bad dates. I might actually be a lesbian. Maybe all that's true. If you think that it might not be, then you're going to find it interesting that now she's being criticized even from her own community because she decided to fake a pregnancy for attention. That makes no sense. I can't explain it to you. There's no background story here. She just decided to pretend to be pregnant on the internet. She did this on Snapchat. Here are a few of her posts. There's a post of her holding her belly. And she's at Target with some pampers. There's another post of her holding her belly on Snapchat. And she has the caption written, Team Boy or Team Girl. And she's smiling in bed. Looks to be about, I don't know, three months pregnant. Clearly she was just popping her stomach out. And then there is the final picture of her wearing a hoodie once again holding her belly as if she is in early pregnancy. Now, nobody knows why she did this. She later on came out and clarified that she wasn't actually expecting by posting a TikTok of herself laughing in response to the speculation. Okay, why is that funny to put pampers in a Target basket and pretend that you're buying them? Why is it funny to pretend that you're having a child? She has not yet addressed the backlash. But here's what I want to say about JoJo Siwa and those that follow her and are watching her. I know her brand is happy and sparkly and she wears a lot of pieces in her hair. She wears scrunchies and bows and children like to watch her because she's ecstatic all the time. People that you see that put on an appearance of happiness all the time are usually people that are suffering the most internally. And there is no question to me that what we have observed from her over the last few years has been one giant cry for help. It's a giant cry for help as just one example when she would just ruthlessly attack Candace Cameron. I think Candace Cameron, who she rightfully said she used to idolize when she was young, is actually who she still idolizes. I think deep down JoJo Siwa wants to be like Candace Cameron, but she can't now because she's resigned herself to a brand of LGBTQ awareness and is driving her crazy. And she did this for intention. I don't believe she's a lesbian no more than I believe Demi Lovato was a lesbian. I think it's interesting that she brought up Demi Lovato in the first place because she's another person that went on a long cry for help. These people are suffering on the inside, they're completely empty on this inside. What they really need is spiritual growth and development in God. And so what they instead try to fill it with is pronouns and bios and extreme cries for attention like pretending to be pregnant or pretending to as Demi Lovato once did ghost hunt or say that you identify as an alien. Those are real things that Demi Lovato did. Rather than society looking at her and saying JoJo, you're not really a lesbian just like you aren't really pregnant, but you do need to put down the camera and go on a soul search. They applaud her and they encourage her. And this is going to put her down a dark path. This is a prediction. And it's one of these ones I hope I'm not right about, but I can see a person when they're suffering and that's exactly what JoJo Siwa is. So prayers for JoJo Siwa. All right guys, moving on and in speaking of TikTok and the internet and people desperate for attention, a couple of weeks ago, we covered a young woman who was Polish and who came out and said that she believed that she was Madeline McCann, the young girl that went missing and it seized worldwide attention. Honestly, we were all paying attention to the story. It was devastating. She was allegedly sleeping in a room with a hotel room just off the side from where her parents were and somebody came and took her in the middle of a night despite the fact that she was sleeping in a bed with her siblings. Suddenly this woman came up on the internet and said, I am Madeline McCann and she essentially said that she believed she was Madeline McCann because her parents were very shady about her upbringing. Now I had entered in my verdict pretty early. I said I thought she was another crazy person on the internet looking for attention and that I believed her parents who had come out and said that they were horrified by this new expedition for attention that their daughter was on. Her parents said, her biological parents said that she has over and over again done more extreme things for attention that they were trying to get her the psychological and psychiatric help that she needed and that now that she was receiving that attention because remember she got virtually a million followers overnight by purporting to be a girl that is most likely dead that she wasn't going to stop. Unfortunately it led to her getting tons of attention and even to her arriving to Dr. Phil and sharing her story with the world. So let's take a listen to Julia Wendell telling Dr. Phil why she believed that she was Madeline McCann. Take a listen. About a year ago I started to make a research on the internet because I started to think that maybe I'm missing child. I felt in my life that something is wrong here because my mother didn't hug me. They didn't say I love you so it was so suspicious to me. So that's her story and she's sticking to it. Her mother didn't hug her or say that she loved her so it made her realize that she must have been Madeline McCann a missing girl because her mom didn't hug her enough and the DNA results have come back and she is not in fact Madeline McCann. I can't imagine what Ella McCann's parents are going through. This girl literally did this for attention. I believe she knew the entire time that she was not her. I believed her parent stories that she stole the documents from their home her birth certificate and all the evidence that she was exactly who they said she was. By the way how did she get a passport right? How did she make it all the way over to Dr. Phil? I'm pretty sure to get a passport. You must have a legitimate birth certificate. These are questions that were common sense to people like me but of course the world wanted to believe that she was who she said to us. And what will happen to this girl? Well first and foremost I do hope that she actually gets the psychiatric help that she needs. I actually hope a lot of people that are on the web doing things like this for attention get the psychiatric help that they need. But what is likely more true is that people will be sympathetic to her because they were in the comments. I said even if she's not Madeline McCann she's doing the right thing by coming out and making and getting a test to prove that she isn't because there's a chance that she might be. People were already sympathetic to her entire expeditions. What will likely happen is that some of her followers will jump off but many of them won't and they're going to want to see what she's doing now. And so she will have achieved getting the amount of attention that she's always craved and that my friends is a sad commentary on the world that we live in today. But let's stick with Dr. Phil because in case you missed it last year I went on Dr. Phil and my appearance has finally premiered and I went to talk about my favorite topic racism or this case reverse racism. And lucky me I got to sit across from two doctors. These are people that were specialists. Two people with a PhD which means they can explain to me why it's totally fine if black people are racist towards white people. It was totally fine for them to engage in the discriminatory race based policies like affirmative action. So take a listen. You know I'm a mixed background. What am I supposed to mark on an application? Am I supposed to mark multiple boxes and plus if you are painting people as an oppressor if you're white. That's a terrible thing to tell someone that. Well it's a truth because you believe in affirmative action. So I said mark black. If you're a student I'm an interracial relationship so I can speak to this. I have a son that's half white and a son that's half black and a daughter that's half white and half black. They're gonna mark black because I know that there are people like you at the university so we'll say well because this person is black I'm just going to let them in. No they're gonna mark black because they're black. Well they're half black and half white. They're both right. So it is true. You overlook interracial students. So what do you mean? Why are you saying yeah they're gonna mark black in society? So the answer is if you can mark both. Can you mark both? I don't know if you can. What are you gonna look at that applicant as a little bit less because they're half white. How do you guys figure that out? How they look at it is again holistically across a number of different facets. I love me a buzzword holistically in racial consciousness. Oh yeah reverse discrimination. It's not reverse discrimination. It's just discrimination. It's just racism if you're judging people on the basis of their skin color. What I found to be really incredible about my sit down with these professors is the one who says that he identifies as black even though he's clearly mixed. He almost ignores the fact that he's white. Why is that? Why is that a recurring thing? Why is that when people are mixed they only want to identify as black? If blackness is almost synonymous with oppression wouldn't you want to identify with privilege to make your life easier? I'm being facetious I obviously know the answer to this question and you do too. The truth is that if you are black you are afforded certain advantages in American society because we are way obsessed and because people think you are a victim and they therefore keep treating you like a winner giving you things that you don't actually deserve. Obviously this guy who cannot understand how discriminatory it is to employ these sorts of practices is in fact a racist himself. He is saying that he looks at an application and the first thing he looks at holistically of course is the color of a person's skin. This is the exact same as what the things that people did in the times of Jim Crow. This guy is a racist and instead of him being shamed for being a racist he is invited into academic circles. He's allowed to become a doctor. He's allowed to say that he's a professor. He's allowed to decide whether you get into the University of your choice not based on your hard work but in how you look. So again another sad commentary on our society but if you want to see the full thing you guys just go on to YouTube it's a great episode and I was joined by some other amazing people so you can check out the full clip just type in I guess Candace Owens doctor fill episode and it should come up on YouTube. All right guys moving on. There is a Dutch TV show which's been on for a while but they have had a recent episode that I would like to draw to your attention because we are really mainstreaming what is pedophilia that's what's happening. This is pedophilia light everything that's happening right now in your society is to prime you to think that pedophilia is okay. That is why I say it is important for people to respond with anger when you see someone like the country singer Marin Morris say that she intentionally puts her two-year-old in front of drag queens because what is that that is priming the world to believe that pedophilia is going to be okay down the line what is going to happen is that celebrities are going to defend pedophilia as a choice. That's what happens when you say to children that you have a right to pick your own gender that your mommy and your daddy don't understand what you are that we understand what you are trust us trust the government trust the system trust the adults don't trust your mother and do not trust your father it's pedophilia light telling you right hate to be right about this but I'm going to you right about this. So there's a Dutch TV show if you want to see how mainstream this is and it's unbelievable what they are doing is they are presenting naked transgendered adults to children. Okay so the premise of this particular episode is that there is a show host and then there are a bunch of children that are about 11 years old sitting in a chair and a bunch of transgendered people who have had their bodies mutilated come out and they just get naked in front of these kids and they talk to these kids about what they're seeing their naked body parts full adults in front of children naked take a listen. Welcome to simply naked in simply naked adults get undressed so that we can learn something about it. These kids 10, 12 years old get the opportunity to ask them questions about their naked body and today our guests are transgenders it's about the feeling that you have about your gender yes and that feeling can simply be a feeling but you can also do something about it for example I had surgery at first you think huh but later you realize that it's actually pretty normal so it's not just male and female there's an entire spectrum of genders besides male and female how did you feel after you had surgery. Do you know the word euphoric? No euphoric means really happy extremely happy I woke up and I knew that my breasts were gone but it looked like I had always wanted it it finally matched the way I feel inside and that made me ecstatic so a bit like flying? Yes. You simply feel intense happiness. We have not yet come up with a word that is strong enough to underscore my contempt for transgenderism my contempt for this dangerous ideology and my contempt for what is so obviously pedophilia which is what they're after so that's what they're after there are no words to describe what I think should happen to the people the executive producers people that first decided to come up with this idea the parents of these children the show host and the naked perverted adults that are standing there allowing the kids to examine their bodies when you hear that little girl say first I thought it was weird but then I realized that okay this is normal that's exactly what they're after to make children go against their gut instincts which tell them that this is not right an adult should not be stripping naked in front of me least of all an adult that has mutilated his or her own body to pretend to be something other if it's a mentally disturbed individual but instead you have a show host that's brain washing them you are watching brainwashing take place there to say no this is totally fine look at this person's crotch look at this person's breasts and know that you shouldn't have a reaction to it it is absolutely appalling again it is happening in the Netherlands it could very realistically take place in America today because that's where we're at we're at people proudly telling you how they abuse their children they're proud arrest me Tennessee said maryon morris I just put my two year old in front of a cross dressing man these people are filthy and they are disgusting and they should be a shamed of themselves and we should routinely mock them and degrade them for how they are treating our children all right guys let's jump into a few of your comments from episodes past a lot of comments regarding the why are you gay video it's iconic the Ugandan reporter who just plainly asks what are you gay I think Jojo said well just down with that guy I would probably like to watch that interview and she would come back if you'd say what are you gay and she would say I saw Jenna doing dancing Katabazzi Willis writes as a Ugandan I appreciate everything you have said to add to what you have said we used to have laws that condemn homosexuality and but they weren't really enforced this has become a real issue my country and people from the alphabet community were caught teaching children these ideas and everyone decided to attack the issue head on before we as Ugandans generally speaking did give much attention to alphabet community issues yeah I mean that's the thing I really was not paying enough attention to the lesbian and gay stuff and this is probably because when it was just arguing for gay marriage it sort of predates my entry into politics but I do remember christians saying that inevitably it would lead to pedophilia and people that were against this taking it really would lead to pedophilia and so I guess I'd have to ask a question now two people that are lesbian and gay seeing what's happening right now and seeing what they are demanding which is a right to our children what are your thoughts do you do now deny the fact that some of this alphabet soup stuff is so clearly about pedophilia america writes I am an african and when I see the madness going on in america blows my mind we don't want this madness in here in africa we have enough problems we don't want to add more I respect that femme divine mind writes the fact that he was 100% trying to find out and get to understand her and not trying to be disrespectful is the best part so true he's like so genuinely interested he's like you all gay yeah yeah you know it's like we just need more hard hitting journalism like that here in the united states I want to hire that guy another general comment is from naya she writes hey can't it's my name is naya a black woman I'm a former lefty sorry for judging you before watching your videos you opened my eyes as a black woman and I really appreciate it I'm really tired of our community claiming oppression and no accountability I now realize why the right is called the right thank you candace subscribe well it makes me so happy another person awakens and it is a remind full that we also remain hopeful the more and more we talk about this stuff the more and more encourage we are to keep speaking out when we see insanity the more people we are likely to wake up all right guys it is all the time that we have for today I have some exciting exclusive content that will be coming up on a daily wire plus so click the link in the description and subscribe right now and be sure to come back tomorrow for an all new episode"
