    "text": " Hi, I'm Mike Baker, CIA veteran and host of the President's Daily Brief podcast. Stay informed on the rapidly unfolding conflict between Israel and Hamas as Israel responds to the deadly terrorist attacks. Tune in Monday through Friday for the most up-to-date insights. Download and listen on Apple podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts. Get briefed. Stay ahead with the President's Daily Brief. Hey Bill O'Reilly here. Welcome to the No Spin News. Thursday, December 15th, 2022. Stand up for your country. You may remember if you follow us that we reported a story on November 11th of this year. A guy named Manuel Peggon arrested in New York City with 22,000 fentanyl pills. 22,000 fentanyl pills. Now what does that mean? The dope pushers buy these pills and Manuel is transporting them to the dope pushers, people on the street. They're capsules, so they knock it down the capsule and they take the fentanyl inside and they sprinkle it onto heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, whatever it may be to make the drug more potent. Fentanyl can stop your heart. It can kill you. Everybody knows that. We have hundreds of thousands of dead Americans every year because of this fentanyl. It's manufactured primarily the ingredients and it's manmade. In China, sent to Mexico to the cartels. They smuggle it across because of President Biden's open board of policy. It's easy. So Peggon gets 22,000 capsules and it brings him into New York City and he's in a cell. But that's not what he's charged with and that is the subject of this evening's talking points memo. Because of the insane criminal justice system we have here in New York City and New York State, Manuel Peggon was charged with possession, not possession with intent to sell, which is obviously what he was doing, but just simple possession. Like you'd have two capsules in your pocket. So he was released without bail, shocking, shocking, irresponsible, whatever adjective you want to put on it, it was sickening, particularly if you have family members who are dead from drugs or you know people who have died from drugs. Now this is what I said. Go. Sign of the times New York City, dope dealer, Manuel Peggon, 49 years old, Washington Heights, that's Upper West Side, way up in Manhattan, cops arrest him 20,000 fentanyl pills, 20,000 for Manuel, released on his own recognizance, Nobel, charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance possession, possession, 20,000 pills, think Manuel is going to use 20,000 fentanyl pills. It should be possession with intent to sell. That give Manuel 10 years in the state pen attention. Now, nope. Now Manuel will never be seen again. He's due back in court December 15. He got. He'd never come back. Well, today is December 15th, but he came back and I was wrong. But there's a reason I was wrong. Okay. Not an excuse reason, but a valid reason I was wrong. So he did answer his hearing today with his court appointed attorney, which means you're in panty money, a woman named Molly Kalmus. Okay. They did not enter a plea. The district attorney, Alvin Bragg, is soft on crime as any law enforcement officer in the country. This guy doesn't want to put anybody away. His office says that Peggon is going to remain on the street, Nobel, and that they're going to have discussions about a possible resolution of his case. Again, he didn't enter a plea. So what does this mean? It means that Bragg, the DA, made a deal with this Peggon that he's going to say who gave him the 20,000 fentanyl pills. This is how it works, but you don't have to do it this way. All right. You can charge him with possession and he's facing 10 to 20. That's when you make your deal. But the guy came back with assurances from the DA through his court appointed attorney that A, he'll be able to walk right out, which he did. Okay. And B, that there'll be a quote unquote resolution. So we're going to follow this to the end, but the odds of Melonwell, Peggon getting jail time are zero. He'll flip. Now, the only danger of Melwell is that the people who sold him the fentanyl might clip him, though, may well be to watch his butt, because that's what this is all about. There's a deal in the making here, but again, they don't have to go about it this way. So why am I reporting this story? Well, number one, it's outrageous. Okay. And number two, it shows you that many law enforcement people, not the police per se, but above the prosecutors, the governors, the mayors, they don't care whether your kid dies a fentanyl. Fentanyl is in a high priority for them. Biden doesn't care. And I mean that literally does not care. Yeah, give lip service to it, because they have to. But if they really cared about people dying from drug ODEs, they get tough on the drug pushes. But drug pushes from Seattle to Key West, they know, even if they're caught selling the worst drugs in the world, that's an all heroin, meth, amphetamine, cocaine, well, what's going to happen to them anymore? They're going to walk, they'll bust it down a simple possession, whatever it may be. So what is this? What is this? I mean, what is this? And you always come back to the fact that most of the drug dealers in this country are minorities. That's what this is all about. And the Alvin Braggs of the world, put his picture up there again, please. He doesn't want to put people of color in prison. He just doesn't want to do it. What's the decarcerate, this guy? Now, in Philadelphia, it's so bad that they're impeaching the DA there, Larry Krasner. And my sources in Pennsylvania tell me Krasner would probably get convicted and booted out, just like the guy in San Francisco. But Bragg in New York is safe. But it just drives me crazy to hear all this lip service. But, oh, yeah, we have to get them help and we have to do this and we have to do that. They don't care. They don't care. And he's shocking. He's absolutely shocking. The President of the United States could not care less about people dying from drug overdoses. He could not care less about 6 million foreign nationals pouring in here on supervise. He just doesn't care. It's so shocking. Usually in the past, they faked it. All right, they faked it. Oh, yeah, I don't bother doing any more of these progressives. You know, we don't want to put minority people in prison because the system's biased against them on and on and on. That's a memo. All right. So Joe Biden today, another African day. I thought it was going to be one day. It's two days. The African leaders are here. They're having a good time on my dime, which is fine. I don't mind it. I'll buy the African leaders dinner. And so they're here all day and then Biden goes to Delaware, goes home to Rojoba. And I don't think he's coming back, by the way. I could be wrong on that, but I think this is it. So tomorrow, there is a town hall on health care benefits for vets. Okay. Look, I sympathize. And I don't mind them doing that. I mean, Biden doesn't do anything anyway, all day. And you know that if you listen and watch to those spin news every day, we have reported schedule in the way. All right. He just doesn't. He leaves everything to his underlings or committee, you know, whatever, but he didn't do anything this. I don't care. Okay. And so here's something interesting. New Hampshire, obviously primary number one, up there with the Iowa caucus and then the New Hampshire primary. Now the progressives want to change that. They want to get it down into the African American states like South Carolina to do the first primaries, but I don't think that's going to happen. So anyway, there's a liberal group, rootsaction.org that took out an ad in New Hampshire about President Biden. Go. The threat of the GOP has become all too obvious. The states could not be higher. Our ideas are way more popular than Joe Biden is. Joe Biden running undermines the Democratic chances in 2024. There's no question that we have a climate emergency. It's a question.

Don't run Joe. No Joe's not going to run but that's a liberal group that is just running a new Hampshire because they don't want them to run because they know they being the progressive movement that he'll lose. He's going to lose and because things are going to get worse in America next year they are. And I'm going to deal with that in the final thought. I got a slew of mail about financial stuff and a lot of people are panicking. So I'm going to do that in the final thought of the day. Okay so the media the corrupt corporate media this is NBC CBS, ABC CNN. And some people think that Fox News is corrupt. I mean you know there's not uniformity anymore about FNC. It's divided. But anyway the corrupt media that just doesn't cover stories that will make Biden look bad starting to crack a little bit. So there's a guy named Jose Diaz Bel-Lard. I've known him for a long time. He's on MSNBC which is progressive heaven. And here's what he said about the border. Go. What a just tragic humanitarian crisis. We just heard some of the horror stories that people face just when they get to Mexico and trying to get to the U.S. They're being kidnapped, starved, raped, extorted. That's just in Mexico. I'm just wondering on where is the urgency here? Where is the outrage that men, women and children are going through hell and it seems unless there's some political aspect to this, there's no outrage. There's no focus. Jose listen to me. You're pal. Okay. As I said, the president of the United States doesn't care about those people. All right. At all. Now Trump who you don't like, he had the immigration, illegal immigration thing at least manageable. The stat again is about 750,000 encounters with migrants and Border Patrol in Trump's last year because he had to remain in Mexico. Policy Biden comes in first day knocks remaining in Mexico out. Now we have 6 million encounters in less than two years. And Biden won't even go to the border as we heard last week when he was in Arizona. I'm not calling it. I don't care. Because he doesn't care. So it's hard for people, particularly liberal Democrats to wrap their head around the fact, and it is a fact that they're liberal president that can't win these people ever die. They're not going to do anything. Now why is he going to do anything because the progressives want to flood America with foreign nationals? And we went over this in the two tribes. Now on Sunday, I will have that two tribe analysis more fleshed out Sunday noon my column. You'll be able to have the column downloaded, look at it. And it will explain everything about why this has happened. So the state of Arizona put up crates as a barrier for people illegally crossing the border from Mexico to Arizona. They put up big, big crates. Okay. And the Biden administration is suing the state to get those crates taken away. And Ducey, Doug Ducey, the governor of Arizona is doing it. He's folding. I wouldn't. So Ducey says that he's going to stop putting up the barriers and he's going to remove the containers in the San Rafael Valley. Okay. So he's folding because the Biden administration is suing the state of Arizona. I put up more. Awful. Let's go to the culture. So as some of you know, I do a weekly spot with news nation, which is a cable news outfit trying to make a name for itself. And I'm on the Chris Cuomo show. So yesterday we reported that the Cambridge dictionary has expanded the meaning of the word man and woman. It's all a bunch of malarkey, as Joe Biden might say, but it's woke stuff. Okay. So it's not enough to say man, a person born a male. That's a man. Or female, a person born a female biological male biological females. And when you're born, the authorities fill out a birth certificate. We all have them. Male, female, there's not like eight other categories. Now, as you get it to be an adult, if you want to change, you're titled to do that. It's America. You want to be a girl? You may grow. Okay. I don't care. But anyway, the Cambridge dictionary has changed the definition of man and woman. This was a topic last night on the Chris Cuomo show. Roll it. In theology, there's a lot of intolerance for things that are deemed immoral by certain religions. Come on, this isn't a free fire unitarian zone here. You've got to expand it. What should happen is the totality of the issue. Some people are going to want to change their gender. They should not be scorned or mocked or anything else. Right. They have a good on that part. Once they're 18 years old, articulate the next part because that's why we're rubbing. Go ahead. The next part is that there isn't anything wrong with that in a civil society, but in certain religions, that is not looked upon as a positive. We give both sides so people can make up their mind. You can give both sides, but you can say you can't make kids believe it's okay. That's not what we're saying. We're saying it is okay. I didn't say that. You're saying don't indoctrinate kids. That's a great question. You said don't indoctrinate kids whose faith say that this is wrong. That's what you said. Correct. Okay. Don't indoctrinate them. It's a secular society. The same way that you say that the world is round and not flat, not in my religion, it isn't. That's your problem. Listen, that's not our problem. It's the same formula. Listen to me and I'm going to drum some common sense into you. It would be the same thing as a public school teacher in second grade came in and told the tykes that abortion was great and reproductive rights was great. It's excellent. And if you get pregnant and you're a girl, you should have an abortion. That's different. That's indoctrination. That is not that is indoctrination. And I'm not talking about that. Religious people, religious people consider abortion a grave sin. I'm with you. I can't do that. I'm not doing that. I'm not saying to do that. It's not a good analog to what I was talking about, which is these people exist. They have a right to exist that way. And if you don't like it in your faith, that's fine. But don't you act that out in a secular society in a way that disadvantages those people. I agree 100% indoctrination. But I hear you. And that's where the bullying comes in. Absolutely. And you're the bullying about that. That's right. That's right. As a debater and as a former teacher, you know and you're right. Okay. So it was a spirited debate. And I'm glad I had that forum because millions of people remember. All that goes out on social media all over the world. And it's interesting because that segment that I do, they don't have debates like that anymore on cable. I made the factor the biggest cable success of all time debating. Almost every segment was a debate. So I'd say to my staff, find the smartest person disagrees with me, bring them on in. We'll kick it around and then the audience could see it as a stronger argument. But that's gone now. It's like, here's my opinion if I'm the anchor or the host of a program. And now we're going to bring in somebody who agrees with me 100%. Because it's easy to do. That's simple. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. Okay. In order to debate, you got to be prepared. You got to have a strong argument. Now Cuomo is a liberal. He's never going to change. And it doesn't really matter to me. What he is. All right. What I want to get out is the common sense view that these woke people are tedious. It's ridiculous. They're trying to ram their lifestyle down the throats of traditional people's life. And that's wrong. And you shouldn't be discussing this stuff with six and seven and eight year olds anyway, because they don't understand it. And it's outrageous what they try to do in Florida. And now it's against the law. Thanks to DeSantis. And that's his strong suit for running the president. They basically say, well, we're going to come in and we're going to tell you that, hey, this is an option for you. If you're eight and you don't like to, and your name is Larry, but you want to be Belinda, just wait till you're 18. And you know, no, those are private matters. Those are private matters. You don't have a chart saying, okay, here's how you can become a girl if you're a guy. That's ridiculous. That's, it's now against the law in Florida. And it should be against the law everywhere. That's indoctrination. Like I said, with the abortion thing, what's the difference between a teacher, a second grade teacher coming in and saying, hey, abortion's great. I love abortion. I had five of them. And if you get pregnant, you young girls, when you're a teenager, you're going to go have an abortion. That's, that's outrageous. That's a public school. What about the religious kids in a traditional, you can't do that. And he says, it's not a valid comparison. Absolutely is. Because of the same teacher walks in and says, hey, you don't like being in Sally and you want to be Harry, just wait a few years. And here's the chart. Here's what you can do. And right on, no, that's a parental responsibility. It's a personal decision. Public schools shouldn't be involved with that at all, at all. But my main point, and that I made last night was forget about the woke stuff. It's just tedious and tiresome and ridiculous. If I'm in the presence of somebody who's woke, I'm out of there. I haven't bought it because it's just boring. Okay. However, the bullying, and I saw it first, say when I was a teacher, the school boards have got it. You got to crack down on it. If somebody is a serial bully, or they're expelled, they're expelled. And you can see it now on the internet. These kids have the texts and the emails. I mean, you can't tolerate it. School boards, it's not a federal issue. It's a local issue. I wish, I mean, way back when I was teaching, didn't have any of this stuff, but boy, I was ferocious. Those bullies, they feared me. I'd get them. I wouldn't, I couldn't hit them or anything like that. But boy, I gave them a hard time. Because I, you know, and it's not just LGBT kids getting bullied. It's black kids, it's chubby kids, it's kids with bad complexions. It's across the board. And it's worse now that it was when I was teaching a thousand times worse because of this internet stuff. That's where the liberal people should be concentrating their efforts. But no, they want indoctrination brainwash. That's what they want. There's a lot of noise and very little signal out of Israel. There's a lot of propaganda, a lot of misinformation, disinformation and bad media reports. What's actually happening on the ground and where does it hit? I'm Eric Erickson. I'll explain to you the state of play in Israel to hear the special episode. Subscribe to the Eric Erickson podcast on Apple podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.

Download and listen on Apple podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts. Get briefed. Stay ahead with the president's daily brief. All right. This is a crazy story. You ready for a crazy story? So John Boehner used to be the speaker of the house. He's a former congressman from Ohio. Boehner and I never got along. I don't know why, but I never really particularly liked him. He hated me. So we just did not anything to do with him. So as I reported last week, there's a documentary on HBO by Nancy Pelosi's daughter, a very talented filmmaker named Alexandria. She made a documentary on her mother. And guess why? Her mother's a saint. So Boehner, he watches this documentary. Roll a tape. Leaders lead, Madam Speaker and you, Madam Speaker, have led. I'm honored to be here today as a long time colleague and a fellow American to say thank you for that. Thank you. Oh, ah, so I'm not offended by that. I want to know how Boehner is stay so tan. I mean, I go out in the sun for 30 seconds and I have to have an operation, but I'm not offended by that. But I don't think I could ever, ever say anything good about Nancy Pelosi. And that's on me. I mean, that's I'm not being Christian. The two reasons that I think that Nancy Pelosi harmed this nation in a way that was almost unprecedented. First of all, she basically said to her members of Congress, Democrats, you don't do what I say. I'm cutting off your money. So there was no freedom of thought or anything like that. It was you do it in Nancy's way. Whatever Nancy wants, you do it. Or you don't get any money from the Democratic apparatus, the political action committees and all of that. Now, Congress, we have to run every two years. So they got to raise money constantly to run. They want to get reelected. So Pelosi was basically extorting them. That's what she was doing. It's done to some extent on the Republican side, but nothing like she perfected it. And the other thing was the state of the union that Trump gave where she ripped it up behind his back. That was one of the lowest moments in congressional history. Now, in civil warriors, they used to beat each other up with Keynes in the house. But I thought that was so classless to rip up the state of the union. Trump doesn't know it. He's got it back here, but she knows a camera's on her. Now, if she came and said, Bill, I'm sorry that I did both of those things. I would forgive her. Shock and all. You know, I do a weekly for VIGO, which is a streaming service. I do a weekly program called Shock and All. And we've had tremendous guests. I mean, just absolutely off the chart guests. So this week is Christmas and the decline of Christianity in this Christmas season, not just now, but it's been a slow descent that Christianity in America is now about to be overtaken by people who don't give a hoot. So I just want to show you a little clip of what we did go. On the next episode of Shock and All. So when I laid out my vision of Christmas, the key question is what has changed. Interestingly, you spoke more about a cultural Christmas in many ways than a religious one. I mean, you were talking about the presence and the tree and the caroling and all of that. But there wasn't a lot of Jesus in what you just said or Christ. And I think what a lot of people are complaining about today is that it seems as though because we become more secular, that people are resenting the religious celebration of it, that they want to keep it secular. I think that's an interesting trend because less people are going to church. You have more identifying as nuns and no NES. And that's true. So 93% of America is according to Pew, I believe it is, Celebrate Christmas. But less than 50% of all Americans go to church synagogue mosque. So this is gap about, let's see, let me do the math. About 45% of Americans do anything to do with Jesus or Allah or the Torah or anything. Yet they are on Christmas. And I'll remind you, the President, U.S. Grant was a man who made a federal holiday. Now the other interesting aspect of this is the war on Christmas, which we won. The O'Reilly factor was the forefront of that. And you may remember that. And it was a very, very intense time. Boy, did I get attacked. I was just brutalized because what had happened was that corporate America in the merchandising industry was ordering, not all of them, but many of them. Their employees, their counterpeople, not to say Merry Christmas. It had to be happy holidays. Even if somebody said Merry Christmas to them, they weren't allowed to say Merry Christmas back. Remember that? So I just went in with my usual hammer and started to name the names of the department stores and the corporations that were behind this. And they folded fast. They folded in less than two weeks. All of them. Nobody held out. Everybody lifted the Merry Christmas ban. That was one of the most powerful things that I ever did on television. The other was raising money for the wounded severely wounded vets. And I remember that now because that's not in play anymore. So Merry Christmas isn't banned anymore. The ACLU has pulled back on its lawsuits against the nativity scenes. As long as you have a menorah and the nativity scene, you're good. Okay? Or a quanza, whatever the quanza people have, you put that there too. I had a problem with that. Who has a problem with that? Nobody. So it's calmed down. The cultural Christmas war has calmed down thanks to not just me, but my staff. I mean, my staff is really good. And they're good now and the nose spin news and they were good with the factor because they took a bunch of them with me over here. So we're proud of that. But we do understand that America is heading the way of Holland here. And in 20 years, you got 48% saying they're affiliated with a church. 48% of the American people now participate in a church. It's going to be 25%. Part of that is the church's fault because they're not engaging, generally speaking. All right. Smart life. This comes from Lewis Cricchio from Broly, North Carolina is a friend of the program. So Azur Standard. Azur, A-Z-U-R-E-S-T-A-N-R-D. Azur is the color blue standard one word.com.

We appreciate the tip of this day in history. Very important day. 231 years ago, December 15, 1791, the Bill of Rights was amended by the state of Virginia in the most powerful state by the time. Remember that was where Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, George Washington, everybody's in Virginia. So they approved 10 of the 12 Bill of Rights amendments. Here they are, full screen on a radio. I'll read them to you. First amendment, freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, petition. Second amendment, right to bear arms. Third amendment, courting of soldiers. That means that British soldiers were throwing you out of your house in Boston and Philly and they were taking it all. So according to the Bill of Rights, that could never happen again. Americans all just couldn't do it. Nobody could do it. Fourth amendment, search and seizure. Got to get a warrant. Can't just come on in. Fifth amendment, grand jury, double jeopardy. That means you can't be tried twice for the same crime. Self-incrimination, you can take the fifth on and on. Sixth amendment, right to speedy trial. We don't have that anymore. We should have it, but that's gone by the wayside. Seventh amendment, jury trial in civil lawsuits. So you can demand a jury trial. Eighth amendment, excessive fines, cruel and unusual punishment. That's been used by the ACLU because anything can be cruel and unusual punishment. Ninth amendment, non-enumerated rights retained by the people. That basically is a catch all that the federal government can't come in and treat you unfairly, that you can litigate. And the 10th amendment is rights are reserved to states or the people in those states. That's the abortion. Okay, Supreme Court ruled the abortion should be handled by the individual states and then it went back to the states. Okay, there it is. Now, no other country on earth has that. But the only ones have it. And that's big, big time protection for us. It's not working perfectly now. Our justice system is on a verge of collapse because of the progressives, but it's still the best in the world. Okay, mail segment and finance money, your money, my money in the final thought, right back. Let's go to the mail. We got George Sipatriliac, Largo, Florida. So the networking cable news ratings are low and they aren't coming back. I agree. But when they ignore the dreadful border story, not to make Biden look bad, shouldn't it not matter much, because hardly anyone is watching. That's true that a lot of people aren't watching, but then they don't know about the catastrophe down there. So it's a double edged sword. Stacy Gilmore, Sioux Falls South Dakota regarding the recent prisoner exchange, a Brittany Griner for Victor Boot. I've heard you comment several times over Riley that President Biden didn't have a choice. If Paul Whalen was in an option, could have chose to make no trade at all, that's what I would have done. It's pretty cruel. Keep that woman over there where you can get her out. So we have a disagreement. polite, Stacy, but I would have gotten her out. Jerry Groin, Libertyville Illinois, Bill. Watch you on Cuomo show. Like it. You're right. There are other programs. There are no other programs that allow for debate now. Also your points were on target, but I don't think Cuomo listened to you. So why? I don't care. I'm care what he listens to. All right. I'm happy he has me on the program so that other people can hear it. I'm not in the business of converting anybody. All right. That's not what I do. I put forth a strong cogent fair argument. You take it or leave it. Richard Conseer, each member, please consider Conseer's membership for Christmas gifts. You'll change people's lives to the better. If you do, great gift.

You know, people who make judgments about that, you should rethink that. People are people. Most are not trying to force anything on you. Susan Mosanic, San Bruno, California, your recommendation of gibberish as a word of the year instead of the one chosen may be left out loud. gibberish is the word of the year. How much gibberish have we here? I mean, just Kamala Harris alone. Just her alone. gibberish is the word of the year. I've never heard as much gibberish as I had in 2022, ever. All right.

So check out the killing books. Word of the day, one of my favorites, don't be a pecsnifian. If you say don't be pecsnifian, you're wrong grammatically. It don't be a pecsnifian, one of my favorites. Back with the final thought in a moment. All right. Here is the final thought of the day. And a lot of mail about finance. You know, what do I do? What do I do? What do I do? People are panicking. Okay. I can't give you financial advice, but I can tell you what I am doing. And that's what I do to concierge members. So the concierge members send me, they're like, I have this, this, this, this, and this. So what should I do? And then I say, here's what I would do. But I'm not telling you to do. It's a subtle distinction. I know. But there's a lot of panic about money because Biden is such a poor president. He's not going to get any better. Interest rates went up half point yesterday. Stock market went down. Wild swings in the stock market. And all I can tell you is this. This is what I'm doing. Nothing. I haven't bought a stock in months. All right. I'm not buying into, well, if you invest now 18 years from now, it might be, no, it's too unstable. The stocks that I do have, all right, I have stopped loss on. So if they hit a certain point, okay, it automatically sells. The ones that I have losses on that I haven't hit to stop, I'm just going to sit on it. Okay, because I do believe the market will come back and nobody's ever going to know when. These charlatans, they get on TV and tell you, it's going to come back. Nobody knows. It's going to be a recession. They don't know how bad if there is one unemployment's probably going to rise but nobody knows. So to me, I'm not a panic kind of guy. Okay, I'm not. I'm a methodical guy. I'm holding what I have. I am not buying equities now. Bonds, I see a good bond, particularly the municipal bond that's tax-free. I'll take a look at it. But it's got to be at a discount. That's called buying below par and buy above par. We gave you the US savings bond tip. That was a tremendous tip, but you can only invest 10,000. Okay, check that out. But just the best thing to do right now is nothing. Thank you for watching and listening to the No Spin News. We will see you on Monday. Important column Sunday noon."
