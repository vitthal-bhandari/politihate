Special Edition 1911. This is a truly gorgeous handgun. I was so proud to add to my collection and you will be too. Buy one now for yourself at galleryofguns.com. That is www.galloryofguns.com. Own a piece of history. Welcome dear friends to America First One On One. The deep dive, the long form that I know you love as much as I do. The opportunity to talk to the true experts, not in a hurry, but to get to the meat of the issue, the true newsmakers, and one individual who has been an exemplar of courage and candor in an age where... Well, these kinds of things are posted for public consumption. This is a young American and this isn't a parody. I understand why in the year 2023, doctors are still forcing their trans patients to sit there and misgender themselves multiple times to satiate their confusion and curiosity and how they seem to just not be able to understand how I said I take testosterone because I'm transgender. My body doesn't produce its own. And then later saying how like referencing my pregnancy and this and that and she just... Just had to like really drill it in that she was confused. Despite the fact that I said I am transgender, I take testosterone wrong. And then her to speak. So how are you pregnant? Do you have a uterus? Do you have a nurse? Do you have that? Are you female? Are you female? Are you female? That is a woman with a beard. Why? Because she's been pumping herself with male hormones. Thinking that that makes her a man. It doesn't. How did we arrive at this situation? Let's decode it all with the author of an incredible new book. I have my signed copy here. Let's put it up on the screen. Amazing, amazing title. Lost in trans nation. Not translation. A child psychiatrist's guide out of the madness and do we need this more than ever? By Dr. Miriam Grossman with a forward by none other than psychologist Dr. Jordan Peterson. Dr. Grossman. Welcome back to America First. It's great to be back with you Dr. Gorka. Thank you. Well congratulations on the book. It is sorely, sorely needed. Just if I list the people who have endorsed it, my rabbi, yes I'm a Catholic but he's still my rabbi, Dennis Prager, Matt Walsh, on and on Jan Jekielek of the Epoch Times tells you enough. I'm going to do things a little bit different because this is like the third or fourth time you've come on the show. We're celebrating the book. So I'm going to start at the end of our discussion. And I'm just going to tee it up and then we can break down the elements of the current situation in the book itself. What has happened to the science of medicine? Dr. Grossman. Oh my God. We have lost our way. We have terribly lost our way specifically around this issue of being transgender and how we can best help the kids who have been indoctrinated to believe that they're in the wrong body. We have a very dire situation here. Little kids from preschool are being taught that there's such a thing as being born in the wrong body. And that when that happens, it's a mistake that their bodies might be a mistake in which case they're going to need to have these dramatic and invasive medical and surgical interventions. Now, I want it to be clear from the get go. There are two sexes, male and female. Sex is established at conception. It is not assigned by anybody. It is established when the sperm meets the egg and anyone that's taken 10th grade basic biology knows that. And it's a sad state of affairs in this country when a doctor has to testify in Congress that that is the fact that sex is established. Which is what I did as you know last in the House of Representatives. And unfortunately, there were a lot of people there who didn't like hearing that. So, yeah, we're in a dire situation. I see these kids and their families every day in my office and I have been for years. And that is why I wrote a book lost in trans nation in order to guide parents so that this ideology, this belief system. It's a belief system. It is not based in science. It is not based in medicine. The idea that your identity can be completely divorced from your biology and that that identity takes precedence over your biology. That is a, a, a belief. It was someone's theory a long time ago. It has taken a hold of our entire culture, but most importantly of the medical profession. So we have lost our way. And we're in a dire predicament. And I wrote the book so that parents can inoculate their kids, their families against these dangerous ideas. And I call them dangerous because they are without foundation. And because kids who are led to believe them as if they were true are put on an assembly line toward permanent disfigurement and sterilization. And there's no evidence that they're doing any better on the other side of all these medical procedures than they would have without them. They may even be doing much worse.

I was there for your testimony in front of Congress a few weeks ago and it was, it was for an individual who served in politics and deems himself to be adequately cynical. I found it, in fact, more disturbing than most things I've seen of late because every single one of the Democrats stood up and said things that are insane, that talked about toddlers, toddlers that are transgender, children needing to be mutilated to find happiness. We'll discuss that a little bit later, but let me ask you because you've been in medicine, you've been practicing med medicine for decades. Is there any analog? Is there anything in your prior experience as a practicing clinician, as a person of medicine where you have seen either ideology or politics so intrude upon your career as we are witnessing with this transgenderism? Well, I'll mention to you in terms of medical scandals and catastrophes, the one that I first think of, of course it was before I was a medical doctor, but the prefrontal lobotomies was something that really took hold in this country and elsewhere. And that was the practice of trying to help mentally ill people by inserting something that appeared, it looked like a kind of an ice pick and it was inserted through their eye socket into their brains and a portion of their brain was disconnected from the rest of their brain. That was the prefrontal lobotomy. It was thought to be the answer to severe mental illness. Upwards of 40,000 people in this country underwent this barbaric procedure. The inventor of the procedure was given a Nobel Prize. And so we did go through a decade or somewhat over a decade of believing that this was a legitimate treatment for mentally ill people until we realized, oops, it's not. And at that time, if you had been living at that time and investigating researching this procedure, you would have seen that there's appeared to be a medical consensus. You would have been told by doctors that there is a medical consensus. So I'm drawing a parallel here between the prefrontal lobotomies and what we're doing now for these kids that are confused about their identity, because parents are being told there is a medical consensus. We have Admiral Dr. Rachel Levine of the HHS standing up over and over again and telling parents and telling the public. There's a medical consensus. Doctors agree on this. No, doctors do not agree on this. In fact, there is a fierce debate. And in fact, the countries of Sweden, Finland, Norway and England have all done a 180 and are not providing these medical interventions for minors any longer, because they recognize that there's no good evidence for them. And that what these kids need is to get to get psychotherapy. And I will add, as I discuss in the book that aside from psychotherapy, they need to get off the Internet. Yeah. Parents need to be vigilant about what their kids are learning and who they are talking to, because this is a social contagion. It's not, you know, I do want to throw in there, Dr. Gorka, that there are extremely rare individuals who do have a disorder in which their bodies, the sex of their body feels wrong to them. And they just, they deserve our compassion and our understanding. But that is not the 99.9% of kids that are presenting right now with what's called gender dysphoria. This is a different group of kids. And they have taken on this gender dysphoria, developed this gender dysphoria, this discomfort with their body because of a social contagion. And now with that phrase, social contagion is crucial and we will discuss it. We're talking to the author of the brand new book, Lost in Transnation, a Child Psychiatrists Guide Out of the Madness, Dr. Miriam Grossman. I'm Sebastian Gorka. This is America first one on one. If you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you kind \u2026 I think what I wanted to say is that I included access to celebrating for my husband and my 14 week teenager who has random learning Well it doesn't just happen when you're 18, any of that. And so another thing I would tell is I have no regrets. I have no regrets. But I have no regrets because when I transitioned when I was young and I wouldn't have my children, I can't imagine a life without my children. And so every experience led me to here. And so how could I regret that? That's a very important clip, truly important clip that I found thanks to our guest Dr. Merengrosaman. It's from four years ago. It is the annual meeting of the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. And speaking there is a man who pretends that he's a woman. He's an admiral now in the Biden administration. And Admiral Levine said, I am glad I didn't transition as a child. Why? Because I would not have been able to have children. Why would he not be able to have children if he transitioned as an adolescent? Because he would have been sterilized. That's the quiet part said out loud. And I'm grateful to our guests for pointing that incredibly important clip out to us. Dr. Grossman, how is this lost in the discussion, lost in translation, if you will, that if you go through with these procedures, if you remove sexual organs, if you take the opposite hormone, if you take Lupron to castrate yourself as a young boy or even as an adult, what you are effectively doing, because this is the drug that is used for sex offenders as well, is you are sterilizing that human being. You are making them infertile, incapable of having children. We are told that these procedures are for mental health purposes, because these people are sad and they will be happy if they are mutilated surgically and if they take these hormones. Admiral Levine just admitted that they sterilize human beings. How does that lead to mental health if you end up being infertile? Nobody discusses this. You know, Dr. Gorka, I've watched that clip numerous times of Admiral Levine and it never fails to really upset me. I'm so angry. I'm so angry. So let me break this down for you. And I will preface it by saying that I'm not going to use the preferred pronouns for Dr. Levine. I call Dr. Levine Admiral. I explain in the book my rationale for not using preferred pronouns. I will not have my speech compelled and a big part of this movement is about a compelling speech and compelling thought which we have to resist. So just getting back to the Admiral, you see what the Admiral is saying there is that there's no regrets and especially no regrets because the Admiral would not have had any children if the Admiral would have transitioned to appearing female when the Admiral was an adolescent. Now, I'll explain the read what's going on here. You see, the mainstream gender medical establishment in this country is calling for doctors to provide puberty blockers. You mentioned Lupron, that's one of them, to kids that are just beginning puberty at a very early stage. So that puberty is completely blocked and they do not go through this natural process of being exposed to estrogen or testosterone if they are a girl or a boy. Now, if let's say for example, a boy is 10, 11, 12 years old. He really hasn't gone through any puberty at all. He's just beginning on the cusp of puberty and he is given puberty blockers. That means that his body and his mind will stop developing. His genitals will remain the genitals of a small child. His brain will not develop into the brain of an adult. You need puberty to do all those things. But in terms of the context of what Dr. Levine was saying, he will never develop mature sperm and his body will never be capable of doing that. His body will also not develop a normal pattern of sexual response, of sexual arousal. He will never have an erection. That is if he stays on those puberty blockers for a number of years, which is what most kids do. And then the puberty blockers are in almost 100% of cases, let's say 90 to 98% of cases, those puberty blockers are followed by in a boy, very high dose estrogen. So the normal testosterone is not going to be released by the body. And instead, they're going to be getting external estrogen at very high doses. So yes, the result is sterility. And what we are doing is we are sterilizing these young kids and these gender affirming clinics are claiming that these little kids are capable of providing informed consent. They're capable of imagining what they're signing off on, that they are not going to be able to have biological children. They are not going to be able to have a normal biological psychological response to sexual stimulation. They will not have orgasms. I mean, what a child can consent to that? Yeah, it's the point at which you realize the true utter wickedness of what we are dealing with. We're talking to Dr Miriam Grossman. The website is Miriam Grossman MD.com.

You have an amazing forward to the book Dr. Grossman written by Dr. Jordan Peterson where he actually makes the historic and the geopolitical connections to policies analogous policies politically driven medical policies under the Nazi regime under the communist regime. I have to take it to that level of the ideological analysis because of this lady's statement. Her name is Helen Joyce. She is a former reporter with the economist. She has also written a book on the transgender phenomena and this clip went viral a few days ago and I'd like us to discuss it together. Play cut. It's something that you may not have thought of is that there's a lot of people who can't move on on this and because that's the people who've transitioned their own children. So those people are going to be like the Japanese soldiers who were on Pacific Islands and didn't know the war was over. They've got to fight forever. This is why this is another reason why this is the worst, worst, worst social contagion that we'll ever have experienced. A lot of people have done the worst thing that you could do which is to harm their children irrevocably because of it. Those people will have to believe that they did the right thing for the rest of their lives for their own sanity and for their own self respect. So they'll still be fighting. So there are homosexuals. We've had the monaster who say a lot of this is to trans away the gay. These are parents who don't want to have a homosexual son and say, well, you're not a homosexual boy. You're a girl. Let's put you in a dress. Let's start feeding you full of estrogen. So it's trying to delete homosexuality. They see that as an assault on their identity. And for those parents who are the generators of the mutilation, Helen makes the point is makes the point that they're like the Japanese soldier on the island 15 years after the war who just cannot stop fighting because if they do, they will have to convince themselves and admit that I have done the most atrocious thing possible. I have mutilated my own child. So their commitment ideologically must be total. As a result, where does this end, Dr. Grossman, you've written a manual for us. You've given a testimony in front of Congress. We're doing it every day in the media with Dennis and my friends. Where is the resumption of sanity? Can the medical profession do it by itself? Or will it have to be a political decision as we see with the governor of Florida and with President Trump making promises about his next administration? You know, great question. And by the way, Helen Joyce, the bet I retweeted that that clip that you just showed. Perfect, brilliant point that she's making. People are always asking, you know, there's what about there's no regret. Okay, the proponents of this are saying there's very, very little regret. Not true at all. But one of the things that we must understand is that parents who have put their kids through this and the kids themselves as they grow up, when they begin to perceive that, Oh, my God, what did I do to myself? You see, that's, it's so huge to have to recognize that and to admit it and to go out in the world and admit it and go back to your doctor. We know that these people don't go back to their doctors to tell them that they regret the whole thing. So, you know, that that's brilliant. But the people who have gone through it have a need to constantly affirm in themselves, the parents and the kids, that they must have done the right thing. Because what's the alternative? I just figured myself permanently. I sterilize myself and I was wrong. Yeah, that's a very important point to think about. So, so does that mean that the solution will have to be some political one because it won't come from the inside or from the profession itself? No, I think that it's on all fronts. It's political, it's legal. We have a lot of lawsuits. It seems like almost every day now there's a new lawsuit by a D-transitioner, somebody that went through gender affirmation and now is regretting it and has returned to living in congruence with their biology and they are taking their doctors and therapists to court. So, that is going to help a lot. But in terms of my book, I am giving parents the tools and the understanding so that their family can be inoculated against what is a social contagion and they can raise their kids so that they understand from an early age that you are a girl or a boy from the moment of your creation, from conception. The doctor and the midwife has nothing to do with it. Well, not only that, let's be very explicit here. Your chromosome will make up your DNA, your X, Y and your X, X makeup cannot change from the point of conception. So, we can leave out the less than 1% to our homophoriditical who actually truly suffer from believing. They are believing, not believing that they are in the wrong body. Everybody else is X, Y, X, X till the day they die. No matter what they do to themselves, chemically or surgically. The book is Lost in Transnation by Dr. Miriam Grossman.

We have recently the great Matt Gates in Congress with the superintendent of the United States Air Force Academy. Let's just listen to this car. You're literally pushing a program in the academies that says if you're a cisgender woman a transgender woman a non binary agender by gender to spirit demi gender what's demi gender? Sir that's a that's a term of the people that are eligible for that particular scholarship that is available to it's a person who looks at their gender in a in a different a different way than I do sir. Well sure that's all of these people you're a cisgender man you don't get to apply. Well do you know what demi gender really means? I'm not really sure sir. Right so do you know what agender means? All one word not a space gender. A fellowship at the Air Force Academy for people who are not cisgender who are demi gender who are agender it would have been a multi python skit 20 years ago now it's on the floor of Congress. At some point Dr. Grossman we just traverse into absurdist and don't we? I mean I was laughing but it's I want to cry I you know I just want to cry. So let's let's return to that phrase that you use at the beginning that crops up again and again and again which I think goes to the heart of the matter social contagion and and social media. Teenage is a tough for boys and girls your body is changing your voice is changing you're trying to make friends you feel awkward you're growing a beard whatever your voice is dropping. The power of somebody providing a model whereby people can be told hey join this victim group and you will be feted you will be celebrated be a boy who pretends they're a girl be a girl who pretends they're a boy and then this is reinforced in like a chronic hysteresis on social media how how much of this is analogous to the the click like behavior that brought us bulimia and alexia in the 80s talk to us about how this is this is a trend more than it is actually a psychological problem. Yes so a social contagion is when beliefs or behaviors are spread among social groups social networks so it can be your your friends your child's friends at school in a club online etc and this is why in my book I am telling parents they have to be vigilant about who their kid is hanging out with online and in real life they have to know what's going on in the schools I have an entire chapter and I have an appendix written by attorneys who are specialists in the field of parental rights and education parents have a constitutional right to direct the education and the medical and mental health care of their children and people at schools are infringing on those rights so getting back to the social contagion parents have to know ahead of time how to put schools on notice and I'm talking about I don't care if your kids in preschool I want you to go to your and I instruct parents how to do this in the book you go to the school and you have a form that that indicates that you do not want your child exposed to any gender ideology you do not permit your child to join any club at school that is going to promote gender ideology and you are certainly not going to agree with any social transition using a different name or pronouns and allowing your child to use the bathroom of the opposite sex all those things you have to put the school on notice that that that they better not even think about that with your kid so this book lost in trans nation dr gorka is not only for the many many thousands tens of thousands of families that are going through this catastrophe right now it is for families in order to avoid ever going through this catastrophe because a lot of the kids do first hear about this in school from clubs from their friends from social from their guidance counselor now I want to talk about the internet I also have excellent appendix written by an expert I never could have written it on how to get control of your child's internet use parents it's mandatory the internet is filled with individuals that are grooming and looking out I'm sorry I'm talking so much today I'm losing my voice they're looking for children like yours that are innocent and that can are vulnerable and they can be recruited into what is essentially a cult yeah this is no let me just stop you there so this isn't just an important book for your edification it is also a defensive shield for you your children your grandchildren so if you I mean I just wanted to mention it thank you for reminding me you have 10 pages I've never seen a dedication that runs to 10 pages because of all the families who are in the crisis or who are post-crisis who have had the the strength of will to talk to you and share their experiences also in the back of course you have that guide to how to protect your children from the groomers please get the book right now lost in trans nation a child psychiatrist's guide out of the madness dr Miriam Grossman I'm Sebastian Gorka this is America first if you have a cell phone you need to know whether or not you're supporting these people every large cell phone company in America is woke is on the side of those who promote this insanity there's one Christian Conservative cell phone company that doesn't believe in this insanity it's Patriot mobile it's the one I use please don't fund those who hate your values and hate this nation go with Patriot I switched all of my family's phone numbers to this company they have the same nationwide 4g and 5g network they have free activation with my name extra discounts for veterans and first responders they believe in the sanctitive life they believe in the first amendment and they are patriots just like you make the switch today can keep your old number it's super easy call their us based customer support team they are excellent on 878 patriot or just go to patriot mobile dot com slash gorka that's 878 728 7468 or just go to patriot mobile dot com slash g o r k a I want to mention the the good doctors name once more time one more time to just do a sanity check with you dr. Grossman Jordan Peterson makes this point and I'd like you to confirm it or to say it's maybe a little bit more complicated he's of the same field that you are and he says and it seems very commonsensical to me and he's written the forward to your book there are no other mental conditions that that we affirm if somebody comes into a clinician comes into a psychiatrist and says I believe I'm obese and it's a woman who weighs 72 pounds you don't say yes you're fat you should go on a diet or if somebody comes in and says I'm an apolian you don't say yes mr. Bonaparte you are an apolian this seems to be the only condition where we affirm the patient's incorrect self diagnosis it's surely this goes against everything the profession stands for and and even the Hippocratic oath of first do no harm surely affirming a incorrect state of thinking is damaging to the patient is there a genesis to this where when when what doctors told yeah in this one case you can make things worse or you can believe as my friends on the trigonometry podcast use the phrase that an incantation will change your gender well as I explained in the book that the very foundation of this belief system and it really is more like a religion than anything else the very foundation of it is it is rotten because the the very idea that you are who you think you are and not what your biology your physical reality says that you are that is without any foundation I mean you can believe it if you wish people can believe all sorts of things but we should not be teaching this to children as if they are established facts yeah and that is what we have been doing for some time now so it is extremely dangerous but there are answers and in the book I explained to parents how from a young age they can provide the truth the biological truths to their children and they're going to I'm going to want them to tell their children that you know you're either a boy or a girl but you know what there are many different kinds of boys and many different kinds of girls and you may not be a boy that loves sports and building things or you know all these stereotypical you may not be a girl that loves makeup and you know you may be a girl who's attracted to other girls there are many different ways of being men and women and that is actually the opposite if kids are old now they're being believed there's only one way to be male or female and that if you don't fit in that box right well you must be trans um one thing we're almost out of time but but it it's so important I think because it's so dastardly um can you address the question of autism and how it seems as if many disproportionate numbers of those who are being put through the transgender mill are in fact autistic children um who obviously don't feel comfortable because they think differently from those who are not on the scale and as such we seem to have a phenomena of praying on the autistic to make them the victims of these procedures okay so the kids who are on the autism spectrum are vulnerable to this ideology and I'll explain a few reasons why one is that as you said they are uh feel socially awkward because of the way that they are wired neurologically they are neurodiverse they are wired somewhat differently and they it's challenging for them to pick up on social cues and it's challenging for them to for example read another person's facial expression some of them have trouble understanding jokes and as a result they have trouble finding a peer group at school in which they will fit they are often bullied for being different that's one reason so when they hear about the possibility that their unhappiness and their anxiety may be due to being in the wrong body and that if they uh then identify as the the opposite sex that will be the solution to their distress they are attracted to that now when a student comes out in many schools i'm not saying every school but in many many schools when they come out as being transgender or non-binary or one of these other words that really have no definition they get uh points they're so social status yes is elevated and they suddenly are our love bombed you know 24 seven by friends by teachers and by others at school or maybe in their community so just imagine for a child who never felt to be a part of things for a child who always felt that they were on the outside looking in and they're now being celebrated and i'll explain something else about people on the autism spectrum and that is that they tend to think in a black and white way in other words either one thing is true or another thing is true uh and they can't see the gray that's in between that the nuance that's in between so if you have a girl who is developing breasts and she's very uncomfortable with that and people are staring at her and she's getting unwanted sexual attention and she's scared about getting her period she then thinks oh i'm uncomfortable with my female body i must be a boy and that is what i've seen over and over again in my office and these kids are very vulnerable parents have to be aware of that if they have a child who's on the spectrum that these kids are especially vulnerable to this dangerous belief system uh i could go on for hours i'm just going to say uh one more thing and ask one last question first get

slash salem huh isn't that interesting i guess when joe says his son has done nothing wrong he should ask his son first who's pleading guilty as a consequence of this plea deal for reasons to be articulated at or near time of sentencing the united states will recommend a sentence of probation why why probation if both counts demand a 12 month prison sentence why does he get probation david vice us attorney we're so curious let's go to the appendix of what hunter biden did according to this plea deal the defendant robert hunter biden was an attorney and businessman with lucrative domestic and international business interests at the times relevant to this case from 2017 to 2019 he served on the board of a ukrainian energy company and a chinese private equity fund he further negotiated and executed contracts for business and legal services that paid millions of dollars of compensation to him and or his domestic corporations o wasco pc and o wasco llc through at least early 2017 he was also employed by a prestigious multinational law firm in and of council capacity for this work he earned substantial income totaling more than 2.3 million dollars in 2017 and 2.1 million dollars in 2018 hunter biden also has a well documented and long standing struggle with substance abuse why is this being put in the plea agreement who gives a damn that's not any kind of remediation for guilt well i wonder who wrote this was it daddy's doj following the death of his brother in 2015 biden relapsed over time progressed from alcohol to abusing illegal drugs including crack cocaine this contributed to the collapse of his marriage with his divorce finalized in 2017 as well as the collapse of his most significant professional relationship of fall 2017 nonetheless in that year despite his addiction what sorry what is the government doing writing here this up are they his defense attorneys or the prosecutors biden successfully entered into business ventures and landed legal clients earning millions of dollars by his own telling in a memoir oh a memoir published in 2021 biden's substance abuse worsened in a year that included a move to los angeles and what he describes as quote a spring and summer of non-stop debauchery oh poor poor hunter even during this period however biden continued to earn money and exercise control over his personal and corporate finances during the calendar year of 2017 biden earned substantial income including just under one million dollars from a company he formed with the ceo of a chinese business conglomerate get this if you're into signs of the diabolical he earned 666,666 dollars yeah you read that you heard that right 666, 666, from his domestic business interest approximately 664,000 from a chinese infrastructure investment company oh he's such an expert on chinese infrastructure don't we all know it 500,000 in direct fees from a Ukrainian energy company 70,000 relating to a Romanian business of course his expertise in Romania is just uncontested and 48,000 from the multinational law firm biden continued to earn handsomely and spend wildly in 2018 however without the structure of a stable business partner and still in the throes of his addiction biden essentially ignored his tax obligations what would happen to you if you done a fourth of what i just listed would you get a sweetheart deal yeah
