of our many episodes that we offer our vast plethora of knowledge and humor we do have Q and AF this is where you bring the cues and I bring the AF's in that right yeah it kind of scared me a little bit yeah and I like the word choice of plethora I haven't heard that that means many sounds like your reether yeah but your ether is only one yeah baby I think so guys is there two there's two urethas and is it really yeah comes from two sides see bro there urethas a whole of your reether of your reether I could be wrong you are wrong I'm the judge of this motherfucking show you're fucking wrong all right now let's get to the real questions yeah got some good ones for you brother yeah hey if this is your first time listening we do a couple different things here we have Q and AF which is mainly educational entrepreneur self-development how to kick ass and kick everybody else asses too that's what Q and AF's about then we have CTI which is the news and we make fun of it then we have real talk which is I haven't done one in a while yeah for a minute maybe I'll crack a couple off for these for these fools oh man yeah all right get what you ordered yeah that's right you got get what you ordered that's fucking fact but it ain't going to be made your way right notion you know saying and then we have the full length podcast which we have my friends and people I admire people who I think deserve a platform for humans yeah to come on and we talk and we talk about all kinds of stuff you never know what we might talk about on those so with that being said this is Q and AF and there is a fee for this wonderful knowledge that I'm about to bestow upon you and the fee is very simple tell a motherfucker about the show yeah that's pretty much now how can people have me answer their cues easily it's very very easy guys email your questions and to ask Andy and Andy for so would I come that sounds pretty easy it was very very simple yeah now ask me whatever you want as long as it's not stupid yeah and I'll answer it that's the catch yeah that's the catch you have to answer my question yeah yeah that's because your questions sucked all right now if you want more entrepreneur content many of you know many of you don't know that I have a company a group called the RTA syndicate all right and this is a collection of the best highest performing actual entrepreneurs not fucking fake entrepreneurs flexing with someone else's shit on the internet we're talking about real people doing real shit in real life and I we have that group with my my really good friend Ed Mylet who's one of the best entrepreneurs I know we bring every single person in the founders of the companies that you know and use every day to talk about business and how to how to grow and how to win and that's where most of my entrepreneur content goes these days as the RTA syndicate so if you're interested we open up applications two or three times a year they're not open right now but just you go check it out on RTA syndicate dot com or at RTA syndicate on Instagram now enough promoting let's start to show Andy question number one okay when you're starting out as a young business owner okay young entrepreneur you have a couple of employees five employees let's say okay what level of transparency should a small business owner have with their employees about stuff going wrong or the numbers etc right what information do you shield from them to make sure that they aren't distracted or confused or worried obviously that depends on the level of company right first of all you need to be as transparent as possible at every single phase of your company because when there is no transparency or there's lack of transparency that creates questions and it can lead to mistrust just by simply not understanding what's actually going on so when people are confused when people don't know what's going on when you're not letting them know what's going on their natural reaction is to assume the worst and that's where the rumors start yeah that's right and all kinds of negativity and cancer and all these things start a lot of the battles that you guys face with your employees start from lack of transparency now there was a good part of that question so like in the beginning being transparent is extremely important because everybody knows you don't got shit so you got nothing to hide right and there's no reason to to keep anything from anybody because we're trying to build this together right and a lot of owners hesitate to be transparent because they think that you know if the if the employees see that they're making X or not making X they won't believe in the company right like if you're making too much money you're greedy fuck if you're not making enough money holy shit I'm working for a failing company fucking loser right so there's a line to walk there that people think they need to walk but the truth is if you're honest with people and say hey we ain't shit and we got we got to do a whole bunch of work you'll be surprised how many people want to get in the trenches and work with you on that that's the best policy because it creates a true trustworthy bond now when you get bigger there there was a valid point in that question when you get bigger you don't need to unload all the information on to everybody because you have so many people that are doing critical jobs to make the machine work yeah that if you unload you know things on to them that they don't need to handle you're actually lessening your chances of success for not just them but for the whole entire company right so there's definitely levels to transparency and in my inner circle we are transparent we talk about sales we talk about this we talk about that we talk about our problems we talk about our wins we talk about our ideas etc etc etc now when I leave that room I don't go around and tell everybody everything but like if they were to come in and ask we would talk about it right so there's levels to it but one of the things that makes the companies that I've been a part of and that I you know have found it and run and all these things great which all of them are is just a fucking fact is the fact that we have trust and the reason we have trust is because we tell the truth and we share the challenges we share the we don't shy away from bad news we address bad news and we come up with a plan to overcome it together and all of those things create buy-in for your team right like if you solve a problem by yourself as a CEO and people never know that you solved it what differences it make but if you had five people that all put in to solve the problem now you just took a problem and not only did you solve the problem you created a bonding experience for your team that creates trust and you know good momentum good faith moving forward yeah it helps galvanize that team together yeah so there's dip you know there's nuances there on that question but that's how I see it in general yeah love it love it question uh question number two Andy what are some steps or things that young men specifically ages 18 to 25 okay should be focused on uh to become men okay and when did you first feel like like I'm a man right like like the person he's 22 years old he's living at home he is financially independent since he was 18 he's working on his goals he's doing the work but he feels like something's missing what what do you got on that look man there's no shortage of people out there trying to tell people how to be men right um brother beard yeah like dude and they all got beards he's raw livers yeah right like it's all crazy shit like kill the wild buffalo with your fucking bare hands and then skin it with your teeth right so crazy shit like dude to me what I think a young man should be worried about um is putting in the time right now understanding that they're playing in the long game see this is something I did very right um I I partied I had good time I fucking hung out with friends I fucked around but I always made myself do my work I always put good stuff into my brain I'll I always read I always talked to successful people I was always a student of success um and that was a big part of being successful in business but I don't think that's part of being a man um I think that's just part of getting your life together right you know productive human yeah yeah yeah so so that would be the first thing I would recommend to anybody who's 20 whether it be a man or a woman you know you you need to really understand that your 20s are super valuable uh contradictory to what like other guru type dudes say you know oh fuck your 20s go have fun bro that's how most people do it you know what I'm saying and then that's why they find themselves in the shitty position in their 30s um which you could still recover from and build great but I'm just saying why not get the fuck ahead right right that's how I look at it so to me when we talk about how to be a man I think a lot of a lot of that has to do separate from success okay to be a man you need to be fucking financially self-sustaining uh you need to provide for be able to provide for your future family see when I was 20 years old 21 years old 22 25 28 I didn't have a family and I had you know I had relationships but you know these were just like three four-year relationships you know what I mean and and they were important to me but I didn't have a family but I was always working for my future family does that make sense yeah so I had it in my head that like okay dude like when I when I eventually want to have kids I want to go I want to go to their practices and I want to be the guy who can do all the things with them and I started working for that when I was 20 now as it turns out I didn't end up having kids which means I got a whole bunch of extra money you with okay and guess what that's what I do right but um but fuck dude I raise a lot of other people's kids so it's all good for me I'm gonna get like 400 I ain't missing nothing I love what I do I love the people I'm around I love all of it but when it comes to being a man you know I think it comes down to things like uh developing the ability to be disciplined uh having integrity standing by what you say you're gonna do not lying telling the truth um you know meaning what you say I think those things developing those abilities and traits in yourself uh are far more important to becoming a man than making a dollar you know what I'm saying and what we're missing in this world really is true true masculine leadership yeah um you know someone who will look you in the eye and say I got this fucking handle and go fucking handle it right um people that are willing to stand up for things that are wrong I think that's what makes a man um and to be honest dude I think that might be the biggest one that might be the biggest fucking one mmm willing to stand up for motherfucking shit that you know is wrong even if you're the only one standing up for it that's that's a man yeah and there's very few of those people so there's a massive vacuum of that right now yeah yeah and so you know being able to do that in a lot of people you know they don't think that being uh brave like they don't understand that like when you see people out there who are standing up to all the stuff that's wrong in the world they're scared too like it's not that they're not scared it's that they're scared and they're choosing to do it anyway that's what makes a fucking man yeah like that kind of shit right um you know and dude like when it comes to women and shit you guys you guys have been taught all the wrong shit but you really have you've been taught all the wrong shit you've been taught to be a supplicating uh for lack of a better term supplicating little pussy that's what the fuck you become where you go around begging for a slice of a slice of sugar wall right like and you'll do anything for it you'll compromise all your values you'll never say no blah blah blah and you end up being in the friend zone because your mom taught you uh all this shit and she wishes that she had that actually doesn't really work in the real world you know so um don't be afraid to hold out and be a fucking man and not go around begging for the for the pee right uh like a little bitch because dude first of all the minute you stop that shit is the minute that girls find you interesting because you have to understand that ever since those girls were fucking 12 years old and they started to go through puberty every single fucking boy every single dude every single man they know has been trying to get in their pants you know and you fucking begging for it is really honestly it ain't it's not getting you closer it's getting you fucking a million miles further away okay so there's all kinds of things we could give a whole conference on all this shit but it needs you now yeah i know but at the end of the day um women love real men it's just the reality and it's not alpha men like there's this alpha shit tossed around by a bunch of motherfuckers that ain't alpha at anything right um it's um it's what i said you know it's the qualities of a man it's a protector it's a provider it's a man of integrity it's a man of values it's a man with courage it's a man that'll stand up and say hey you know what fuck you right you know and then also put out a helping hand when people need help i think those are the things i think those are the things that make up a quality man you know what i'm saying um and that's not to say you're going to be a perfect man you you you were going to make mistakes you're going to fuck up you're going to do dumb shit um and and a man owes those things and and works to be better so you know i i truly feel touching back on what boys are taught about girls i truly feel like they're totally misinformed yeah and totally taught the wrong shit their whole life yeah you know and you're taught uh you know if you align your chakras well no what i what i observe is that mothers teach their boys the things that they would like to have happened to them or have had happened to them in their ideal functional relationship right so you have a lot of single moms it's not their fault maybe it is i don't know could be could be not but you have a lot of the way it happens to be is you have a lot of single women who are raising boys and when they're telling them about how to attract women they tell them all this shit you know uh sugar and spice treat them nice pull out their chair do all this shit send them flowers be a romantic and blah blah blah blah yeah mother fucker let me tell you something all that's fine and good but if she thinks you're a weak little bitch you ain't you you're never she's not gonna be attracted to you physically at all okay and that's a whole another thing like all these dudes out there are taught that if they're nice to girls that all of a sudden the girls obligated to like like them that's not how it works mother fucker you got to become a person of value you know if you're a fat slob you're gonna get fat slob you ain't gonna get fucking what uh you know like if you you're gonna get what the fuck you are that's really what it comes down to and and you know i observe a lot of young men being taught the wrong things by moms that lack in relationships and then the men go out in the world get the fucking heads kicked in by women stomped on cheated on treated like shit because they had they're not equipped to properly be a man right you know and then do you hear from women where's the men right where's the men where's the men well you all fucking told them that they were toxic you told them that they were too aggressive you told them you didn't like that shit and they started using your fucking body wash and now they smell like you and they dressed like you and they look like you and now you're pissed off the man but yeah like dude it's fucking it's ridiculous yeah and and so you know i feel like this is like a whole show we should do but at the end of the day being a real man is all the things i mentioned and then also standing on those things when it's hard to you know i i it's very hard for me to talk about the state of like interpersonal relations between men and women right now because these men are fucking clowns they're fucking clowns so i love it yeah i mean dude they show up for abuse after abuse after abuse after abuse and they don't understand that the minute you say fuck you stop abusing me is when their fucking vagina gets fucking juicy it's the fucking truth it's the fucking truth it's the fucking truth yeah you got to have a fucking backbone if you don't have a fucking backbone bro good luck because you ain't getting it ever you better fall in love with jail you know who jail is right her his palm yeah you know that ain't bad sometimes too i'm just saying like but i'm being real dude no there's rooster like there's too much weakness in men and it's so weak that women can't even find proper men to fucking day yeah that's real so maybe if some of you women would start telling men what they actually should be and and talk to them about what you would find attractive as opposed to making them supplicating little bitches uh maybe you have some more men probably i think there's gonna be a lot of guys that are being intimidated you know i'm saying like they're gonna be acquired a few of them that will be intimidated once they tell them what they really want once the women tell the men what they really really want the the bottom is still miss out listen it's saying a message this is i was wrong about what i said just there it's saying a message for men this is a message for women to tell men it's a message for men to tell men you know what i'm saying like it's not women's job to fucking fix the broken cycle of raising broken little boys yeah it's ours once we realize that's right i love it so the truth of it is is uh you you boys out there listening you don't have a fucking clue um get your fat ass in shape get a fucking job that pays stand up for your fucking word be who you say you are be authentic have integrity stand on your values stand alone if you have to have courage and you won't have problem with the p that's a fucking fact yeah sugar walls would be there but yeah and get yourself a nice beer to help and then you go kill the wild world of beast dude i'm just saying man it's like i feel free these dudes you know because i was that dude too i was that dude who thought like oh let me do all these sweet things and then you know what they don't end up like any worth of fuck in fact they abuse the shit out of you because there's no backbone yeah that's fucking awesome guys i thought oh and by the way all that shit i said about holding doors and that and that that's the right way to do it yeah you still do that but that's after everything's established yeah no shit because it's a different there's a big difference between a pussy little boy holding doors hoping to get in exchange some p versus a man that tell you to fuck off but still decides to open the door for you and no shit it's a big difference guys our third and final question for you uh Andy i've heard you say a few times that there was a time and a place where you thought you were the shit but you had to switch that mindset to almost like a humility standpoint and you had to realize that you still had work to do what was that situation that quote like you know come to Jesus moment that you had oh dude i think you have them i think between every phase of life when you're leveling up if you're an ambitious human you're going to come to those moments right um so it wasn't just like one i'll be all yeah i know it's like okay when you set your first goal of life and you're trying to escalate and elevate to that level right you get to that level and you start feeling like yeah fuck it fuck yeah like when you buy your fucking house yeah you probably thought you're pretty awesome you're doing pretty good yeah you think you're still awesome now all right i got far way long way to go right that's right so you get to the thing it's it's cool i love it i'm doing i'm doing good yeah fuck i'm doing real good man fucking nobody's as good as me at this age yeah oh shit i got a lot to live i got a whole long way to go i better i better up my next goal right right and so then i go up to the goal and i fucking say this is this is me talking now right oh dude i've got my nice house i've got a Lamborghini i'm making money uh oh shit my team needs to make money too oh fuck dude all right well fuck dude all right i gotta set this new goal so i can get everybody to make money right then i go blah blah blah yeah and i get to that next level and i'm like all right now everybody's making money except you know these guys or that guys or this or that or you know there's this problem to solve or there's that problem to solve and every single time you you expand your vision to be something greater than what it was uh comes a time of being real with yourself that you ain't that fucking good right and so what i try to do man and like this is not recommended for anybody else um i compare myself to the best in the world i compare myself to Michael Jordan i compare myself to Jeff Bezos i compare myself to these enormous personalities successes um i compare myself to Donald Trump i compare myself to these people legitimately my brain people think that's because i think highly of myself you're goddamn right i do yeah i do think i know it's not about luck huh and you know that it's not about luck it's just fucking work no i think highly of myself i think highly of myself so much so that i know i can achieve those things yeah so so but i also in the same right know that like those motherfuckers Bezos could buy my whole entire life when i sweat and a drop a ball not a drop a sweat off his nuts yeah so i know i ain't shit you see what i'm saying so there there's a there's a process and you're going to come to a road many many times where you have these situations where you need to uh expand your vision and in order to expand your vision and create a new path or the next level up that requires humility like there's a part of that conversation that happens it says hey Andy you really ain't done shit bro you know what i'm saying and that's kind of a heart that conversation gets harder and harder to harder to have yeah the the more success you have because you're like well fuck dude nobody like nobody i know that my age doing this shit that's gotta be fucking tough well i'm just saying like i'm being literal yeah i don't know another human that's my age that's doing what i'm doing on my level i don't not a single one so so i what do i gotta compare to i gotta compare to guys where i'm gonna be in 20 years where i'm gonna be in 30 years or where these guys are right so we always have to step do not do that by the way because you will be miserable you will be if you're at the beginning and you compare yourself to Bezos you're gonna be fucking miserable right right it's gonna feel hopeless um it's not a realistic goal no well at that point that like is that what you know i'm saying you have to be a wild-ass fucking motherfucker to actually think like i think yeah like it's just probably not healthy for most people to think that way um but what i am saying is that yeah you're gonna have those conversations over and over and over and over and over and over again as you go through the progression and when you stop having those conversations and those come to Jesus moments is when you are where the fuck you're gonna be and you're not going anywhere past that okay and so that's the important thing to notice like when you stop saying fuck dude i got a long way to go like i got i got this and this and this to do and you stop like dreaming bigger and you stop this or that that's it for you that's it that's all you're gonna be and a lot of people really screw themselves with this concept because what they do is they set out to become successful they set out to build an amazing life and they get there but they get there way earlier than what they thought they were gonna get there all right so like let's just say you're 20 years old and you say i want to be a multi-millionaire i want to have this house i want to have this life i want to have this shit first of all you better fuck a stand up for freedom or you're never fucking have it okay i'll just come throw that in there secondly um let's just say you work for the next decade let's say our freedom stays intact and you work for the next decade and you get to a point where you you have a nice house nice car nice life nice bank account oh you're a fit you're healthy you're disc blah blah blah blah if you say oh dude i made it right there by the time you're 40 you'll be fucking broke because you're either moving forward you're either getting better or you're fucking going in reverse because the world the world's momentum and everybody else's momentum is naturally escalating towards achievement it just is now they're trying they being the media and these elite fucking communists across the globe are trying to make it so it's not popular anymore to pursue success but the nature of human beings is to improve nature of human beings is to progress the nature of human beings is to collectively work towards a goal that we can accomplish and if you look back over the societies of history this is this is behavior that's consistent amongst humans since the beginning of time yeah we want to build this cathedral we want to build this pyramid we want to build this this this this this this this this that takes teamwork that takes achievement driven people it takes ambition you can't culturally remove that with propaganda from people it's always going to be the natural way so so if we get to if you get to that point when you're 30 and you're where you think you want to be and you're not setting a bigger goal you're it's over for you you know i'm saying it might it might take three or four years it might take seven years but it's over for you you just don't know it yet love it well andy guys that is free that's three i go pay the fee"
