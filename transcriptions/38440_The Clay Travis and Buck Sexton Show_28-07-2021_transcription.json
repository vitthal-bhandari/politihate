Please follow me at Facebook.com slash Buck Sexton. On Facebook, follow Clay on Twitter at Clay Travis. He was trending on Twitter in the last 24 hours. We're saying the things that Clay says and does. So there we go. We could start in that there's a new story that I want to bring to your attention. It's actually really more of an editorial for everybody. But it's all based off of a very straightforward question. And it's one that is so obvious. You may say, why would they even ask this? Why spend our time at it? Because it goes to a central untruth or the war on truth that the left is waging these days. Question is, what is a woman? Now I know you're saying, I mean, you might be laughing a little bit, except understand that while you and I know what a woman is. The left no longer has a clear definition of what constitutes a woman or a female. And if you transgress against this change, you find yourself in a very woke, targeted place very quickly, Barry Weiss, who left the New York Times because she was supposed to publish editorials of an outside point of view. And she did that. And the New York Times hated her for doing it. The staff hated her. So she left. She has a sub stack on the sub stack. She has a piece by Katie Herzog. I just want to read you a little bit of this in clay. Just just think about what this is like when we're talking about how this is. This is no longer just undergrad. This isn't, you know, the, the Oberlin interpretive dance faculty lounge. This is medical school now. Yes. And an elite one hears what's in this Barry Weiss sub stack piece. And it says during a recent endocrinology course at a top medical school in the University of California system, a professor stopped mid lecture to apologize for something he'd said at the beginning of class. I don't want you to think that I am in any way trying to imply anything. And if you can summon some generosity to forgive me, I would really appreciate it. The physician, the physician says in a recording provided by a student in the class, the med school class, he said, quote, I'm very sorry for that. It was certainly not my intention to offend anyone. The worst thing I can do as a human being is be offensive. His offense. What's all that? Hold on. Let's pause here for a minute. That is what some people believe. Think about how crazy that sentence, even before he says what he offended people for. Think about the idea that the worst thing you can do as a human being is offend someone. Buck. That is such a mind blowing idea even before he explains what he said that may have offended someone. This whole thing ties into the idea that words are actions and that you are responsible for your words more than you are your physical actions. Words are violence. I mean, that's been a contract of the left for a long time that if I say something that offend somebody in a protected category, it's the moral equivalent of me punching them or spitting in their face. But, but back to what did he say that was so offensive? I mean, was there a, did he, was there a racial slur? I mean, was there something really awful that you would never expect to be said in a medical student class? His offense was quote, using the term pregnant women. And he went on clay. I said when a woman is pregnant, which implies that only women can get pregnant and I most sincerely apologize to all of you. Okay. Now, I just want to say. It is true that clay, neither you nor I are doctors. It is true that neither of us went to medical school. You went to law school. I would bet all of the money in all of the world that it is a true statement that only women can get pregnant. Now, it's one thing when you see this being argued on social media among crazy lives. This is what wokeness means. Now, wokeness is the open rejection of truth of the most basic and fundamental kind and medical schools are bending the knees of this. Yeah. And, and honestly, some people can say, well, what's the impact of this? First of all, science is broken in this country. Okay. It used to be that science was a refuge from political discussions in many ways from the woke virus that has spread across. Our country, but I think for many people science broke for them last year when in the middle of a lockdown, we were told Black Lives Matter protests were okay. When you and I were being told, hey, don't leave your houses. Your kids can't be in school. We can't have gatherings of anyone anywhere. But oh, by the way, scientists came out and said, but we're going to make an exception for Black Lives Matter protests after people had protested the lockdowns and they were told that they were heinous human beings. But biology itself is a lot of people have trouble. Let me say this, Buck. And I think you'll understand a lot of people have trouble distinguishing between opinion and fact. That's one of the biggest challenges that I think we have on social media today. Even Facebook itself because they're often fact checking opinions, which is impossible to prove very often that an opinion is wrong unless it's rooted directly in science. For instance, if I started going on Facebook all the time and I was like, hey, water freezes at 38 degrees, I could see Facebook being like, hey, we need to fact check Clay Travis, who's got this huge collection of people out there that believe that water freezes at 38 degrees. We all know it's 32 degrees, right? This is one that I would think Facebook should fact check, right? Women have babies. Biology is sexist. Let's be clear about that. Be clear about what I'm saying. Biology is sexist in that men and women are definitively different. And the idea that a top medical school would be teaching, it's not a fact. It's not a fact. It's a fact. It's a fact. It's a fact. It's a fact. It's a fact that a top medical school would be teaching its students that someone other than a woman could have a baby is its madness on an epic scale. And yet this is now the standard in medical schools. And if you're wondering if this kind of thinking results in actually bad medical outcomes, it absolutely does. In this piece, again, this is on the Barry Weiss sub stack, which people can subscribe to in this piece, they talk about a someone listed as a man who came into a hospital in 2019. Yes. Complaining of chest pain. And turned out that it wasn't a man. It was a biological female who was transgender and was actually going into labor, did not realize because the patient was obese, did not realize that the patient was actually, in labor and the baby died. So a life was lost here because no one wanted to be offensive by writing female on the medical chart of somebody who is a female with those body parts with a uterus and a womb. Neither you know, I have a uterus or a womb. There are certain basic realities here that they are denying. And I'm sorry. I am troubled by some conservatives out there even who are now starting to get a little, oh, but this is about just acceptance. And no, you treat everybody with dignity. You treat everybody as a human being with kindness and you treat them the way you would want to be treated. But that doesn't mean that you go along with and celebrate what is objectively untrue. And this is where in med school, of course, because there are literally lives at stake and that the piece also goes to the people who are in the school. And the piece also goes into rapid onset gender dysphoria, which is just a fancy way of saying children who see the attention other children get when they say they're trans. And all of a sudden, the chance of them being trans goes up a thousand percent or, you know, thousands of a percent because kids are young, they're impressionable. And that was published by a very real researcher who not only had the piece taken down by Brown University, but was also later on cut from a contract from the state of Rhode Island from a medical contract that was part of her livelihood. This is craziness. And I think the reason I, this was in my mind, Clay, as we're talking about COVID and everything else, is the party of science. Yes. Believes that a preborn baby is not a baby. The party of science believes that a man can be a woman and a woman can be a man. And what they're, they demand in coherence. It's not even clear. This is why I asked what is a woman? They just start spewing invective and saying you're transphobic because they don't have a good answer. Not only do they not have a good answer for what is a woman, but also Buck, if you choose your race, you are racist. Think about this. This is, this is where you have to logically follow down the rabbit hole sometimes to point out the flaws of logic. If you want to choose your gender, you are permitted to choose your gender and somewhat even say, many on the left, it's heroic and brave and courageous of you. If you are a man to decide to become a woman, if you're a woman, decide to become a man, you can choose your gender. But if you out there decide to choose your race, like we have seen with certain high profile people, Rachel Dolezal remember got caught. A white woman pretending to be black. It's super racist and completely unacceptable. For most people out there, what about you Buck? I'll tell you my answer. If you said, Hey, is your gender or your race a more significant fact of you, I would say by far being a man is more significant to me than being a white man or black man or an Asian man or Hispanic man. In other words, changing my gender would provide more significant difference in my life than changing my race. Would you agree that that? I mean, you may or may not agree with that, but I think most men would feel that way. I think different internal organs and biochemistry down to every cellular level between male and female is a whole heck of a lot more significant than skin pigmentation, which is like eye color. Right. Okay. So how is it that the same super woke Democrats can rip anyone who says, Hey, you know what? I think maybe kids under 18 shouldn't be getting pumped full of medicine to change their gender. But if you change your race, it's racist. How can you reconcile those two perspectives when I think most people out there listening to us right now as we just walked through would say that gender changing your gender is a more significant alteration to who you are than changing your race. Can we come back to clay just some places where they suppress the same people that want Facebook to say that you can't question vaccines and things like that on the entire trans agenda. The data is constantly being suppressed. Yes. They they go with narrative. They go with narrative over data all the time. We'll come back into this in a second. And also we'll be joined by our friend, Will Kane in the third hour. Talk about Simone Biles got some updates for you coming up as well on the insurrection investigation.

He is the buck. I hope all of you are having a fantastic Wednesday. We're talking about the Woke Viruses assault upon medical schools now. We're saying that women can get pregnant even at elite medical schools. Men can get pregnant. Women can get pregnant. Yeah, sorry. Well, that's why I'm told. That's why I'm told that birds in the bees. Birds in the bees. Yes, yes. That men can get pregnant, not only women can get pregnant. All this is so stupid and so ridiculous that even talking about it gets me all crossed up and it has significant consequences going forward. But listen to this discussion. It's a couple of clip here, I believe, discussing what is this madness going on as it spreads. To med schools, this is Douglas Murray talking about men and the possibility they could become pregnant. If you'd been to this medical school, I mean, you'd end up stupid afterwards and you were and you went in. You'd leave medical school believing that men can become pregnant. This is an example of this craziness. You know, China's eating America's lunch economically and America's top medical schools are telling people that men can become pregnant and much more. So the crucial thing that will always give us the edge in America is telling the truth as we see it and not sticking to lies. Clay, if we don't have the truth as conservatives, we're not conserving anything, right? If we don't start from a place of the truth, then nothing else that we say really matters. I think it's also worth noting that when we're talking about this medical school and other situations of extreme wokeness, it's usually the elite universities where this stuff filters down from. And it's because there are people there who are terrified of their peer group thinking differently. I'm talking about the professors now, the faculty. They're very elite positions. They want to hold on to it all costs. So notions of academic freedom, things like that free inquiry and discourse on a college campus. You want to you want to keep your cushy job at Harvard. So people just go along with the madness and it's particularly pronounced at a lot of the most elite institutions, supposedly elite institutions, the country. I mean, I don't even know what they do that so elite these days. Many of these professors are terrified of their students because they are aware that a student can decide to blow up their entire career, which is why that professor, if you just started to join us, said the worst thing that he could do is offend someone. I don't know about you, Buck, but I could think of a billion things every single day that are far more on the scale of human wrong offending someone is so far down the list of what things I'm worried about. I never have been, but the idea that that words are violence, as you said, and that you would even begin that apology by saying that that teacher is so chastened and terrified. That's where that comes from. People that see this all comes from a place of rejecting truth. So what the left will do, and you'll see this in arguments, you'll see this on college campuses. It's all over the country. You'll see this in the corporate boardrooms now. They'll say, well, instead of just engaging with you're saying this, I'm saying that you have a contention. I have a thesis. You have a belief. They'll say your words make me feel unsafe. And that feeling of un-safeness that I have creates a physiological response, a stress response, sweating, heart palpitation, anxiety, that is the equivalent of you doing physical violence to me. Therefore, if your words trigger me, or if your words upset me, cause offense at that level, it's like you've actually assaulted me physically. Therefore, your speech no longer has protection. That's the game they play. And I just say to, I know you know this clip, but everyone knows this with this right now. If you've never offended somebody, you've never lived, man. You're not what you've never said anything worthwhile if you've never said anything offensive. Not only that, it's actually even if you are trying to play by the rules not to offend, it's impossible to play by those rules and avoid offense. So even if you're buying into those arguments to the words or violence concept, it's impossible for you to manage not to offend, it's all complete and total madness. And I gotta tell you, right now, Yvonne in California said, both my husband and I are in our 70s and so grateful to have found Relief Factor.

I'm here with Clay and we are breaking it all down for you, including the latest out of DC. We'll get to that in just a second. The phone lines are open, 800-282-2882. Remember to follow me on Facebook and Instagram, Facebook.com slash Buck Saxon. Follow Clay on Twitter at Clay Travis. I've got to peace up now on Buck Saxon.com on how everyone knows that this mask reversal is bull crap. So if you want to go read that, you can because Clay and I certainly know that it's bull. I could say that on the radio. I was just going to say, do you ever get nervous when you start to say something that you might say that you might say that more? With the bull, they might have to. Yes, absolutely. Although sometimes when I say my own name, I get a little nervous sometimes too because it's easy to have a slip of a slip. It's funny because I bet like you, the number of times you've used the phrase bull crap in your life probably pretty low. Before radio, I think it was zero. I think it was zero times. But hey, the FCC folks, they're still a thing. They're still out there. And so is the United States Senate. Clay, I want you to tell me what you think this turns into for the GOP. The senators just just broke last hour. Key senators, according here to CNBC have announced they've reached a bipartisan infrastructure deal. Unclear if the plan had enough votes to pass. Chuck Schumer says he's prepared to push it through the chamber. They would need the 60 to overcome what is still a filibuster that exists if somebody's going to exercise that. And it's looking like looking like Republicans, Clay are going to go along with this. I mean, the Democrats have wanted to, as they say, invest and invest 3.5 trillion in social programs. Plus, I mean, something like a trillion of this is going to be in actual infrastructure. And the act that the text isn't out yet. So, but it sounds like we're just going to spend ourselves into oblivion. Is that the plan? While inflation is skyrocketing. And here's my big question. And you tell me where I'm missing something, Buck. Most of the time, when you agree to a compromise in legislation, the way that compromises work, and by the way, I'm married for 17 years. So I also understand that all compromises are not actual compromises. There's a lot of married men out there. So yeah, I've compromised a lot. She gets exactly what she wants. And that's how I stayed married. It feels like this is that kind of compromise for the Republican party right now. Most political compromises, you give up something that you didn't want to give up, and you get back something that the other side did not want to give up in exchange for your compromise. No one has been able to walk me through what the Republicans are getting from this infrastructure agreement. And let me just give you a couple of examples of things that could happen. If Joe Biden said, Hey, you know, I proposed 43.4% capital gains tax. Right now it's 20%. So we're talking about roughly a doubling of that capital gains tax. I'll walk that back to 28% in my $3.5 trillion deal if you'll agree to support the infrastructure bill that I want. Okay, I could see that. If Joe Biden is walking back his corporate tax rate, if he's walking back, the overall tax increase that he's getting and Republicans in exchange are saying, Okay, we'll support infrastructure. The Democrats are giving the Republicans are getting and vice versa. But buck, given the fact that they are, and I know this is a little bit procedural, but the Democrats are basically letting it be known that they're going to pass their budget. This massive tax increase, the biggest tax increase that's ever existed in the history of the country in the middle of inflation. They are doing this with the budget reconciliation where they get 50 votes plus Kamala Harris to break it. What are the Republicans actually getting? Have you seen something where you thought, Oh, this is a good compromise where we are Collins and cinema. So the moderate, you know, the moderate or key moderate Democrat in cinema and the key moderate Republican and Collins are on board for this already. I'm hearing, I was just checking with a with a DC source. I'm hearing that it's going to be substantially less that they're tough. Cause remember that the text isn't out. This is all just the horse trading behind closed doors. So what they're doing is they're coming out. You get a bunch of senators now high five in each other. Yeah, that's right. We got a deal. And everyone's supposed to say, Oh, great. Our government at work. Look at the amazing things they do. But a deal that does what? I mean, they've talked about the broad outlines of this, but we're, we're looking at federal legislation here folks from the Congress. What the devil is in the details. So we can't even know exactly how much is being spent, what it's being spent on. But that's the question about Republic Republicans. And this is a man. Some people got to get a little bit upset, a little bit upset with this. This is true. Republicans like to spend a lot of money too. They Republican senators and members of Congress want to bring back pork to their districts. That hasn't changed. And it's not, there's no serious movement underway. Clay right now to rain in spending and the debt and the deficit. There is no tea party and not even the beginnings of one today. Modern monetary theory basically teaches that deficits don't matter and there's no consequences for them. And that's the era of magical economic thinking in which we are living right now. Have you heard though? I mean, your point of, Hey, there are lots of Republicans who want to be able to go back and bring the pork back to their community. They get a bridge. They get a new road, whatever it might be. Much of this infrastructure, by the way, not actually infrastructure when you actually look in the details of the legislation. But I just don't see any horse trading, so to speak, where I feel like Republicans are getting anything out of this deal other than giving Joe Biden's money. I've been in an opportunity in 2022 to see to say, see, I told you I would bring back bipartisanship. Now we just need more Republicans eliminated so we can have more people who want to work and understand that importance. And then if they try to drag Joe Biden across the finish line again in 2024, I can already see what his television commercials are going to say, which is I made Washington work again by passing the biggest infrastructure bill in generations. It's really hard to run against Santa Claus. Republicans have learned this, talking about the budget, looking at the math, the long term projections, the challenges of funding, Medicare and Medicaid going for all those things that, remember, the Republican Party of 10 years ago was very much fixated on, very interested in, although we didn't really accomplish anything in terms of, look, we're going to be at 30 trillion, the numbers speak for themselves, right? At some point, the scoreboard matters here. We're going to be at 30 trillion dollars in the national debt very soon. And so Republicans have an under look under the Trump administration. We were still spending spending spending. This is where we're going now because the free stuff people, which you brought up MMT, modern monetary theory, the party in office or the rather party in power or just the political party in general that says, we're going to give you stuff and other people are going to pay for it. That keeps working until financial catastrophe, until the bill comes due. And so right now we're just, it's like both people, both parties are on this train throwing coal into the furnace saying, let's see where this thing ends. At least if we're going to be on that train, could we not increase taxes? I mean, if we're just going to totally buy into the idea that budgets don't matter. If we're going to do that, what is the benefit at all of increasing taxes in the middle of a pandemic? Oh, it's my big thing from the get go. It's the, as Obama would say, it's the right thing to do. Remember that? Didn't matter, even if it hurt the economy. It's about sticking it to the rich people. But as you know, doesn't actually really stick it to the rich people. Billionate for all the talk that Bernie Sanders has about the millionaires and the billionaires and the oligarchs. They can afford your 3% margin. They can afford to get rid of the carried interest loophole. They can afford this stuff. It's the small business owner who's, you know, making 150 K, 250 K, maybe combined household income, who's finally hitting their peak earning years. They're the ones where all of a sudden, the lack of the mortgage interest, you know, salt deduction really hurts and changes their long term outlook. They're the ones for whom corporate tax rate really matters. And it's all, it's all about the politics of envy, man, as long you got to tell people you would have more stuff. This is what Democrats do. We're going to give you that stuff. It's others people. It's other people's fault. You don't have it and we're going to punish them for not giving it to you before. That's what taxes are all about. Sadly, that's correct. My argument is just in the middle of a pandemic, how is nobody standing up and saying increasing taxes is the wrong move at this point in time? It's, it seems like madness to me. What's the right move? By the way, Buck Sexton, how about saving money since you're going to have to give all your money back to the government over this insane new. A tax bill that's coming your way.

You can follow me on Twitter at Clay Travis. You can follow Buck Sexton at Buck Sexton. You might see us even occasionally trend for opinions that don't make everybody... I think I may have fidded some people, which for that doctor, Buck would be the worst thing on the planet that I could have ever done. Clay Travis is a spicy, I meet the ball. That's for sure. You never know what you're going to get with Clay Twitter. And so, you know, I want to talk a little bit about what we were discussing, Joe Biden and inflation and everything else. And I think you agree with me, Buck, that this infrastructure bill is going to be the linchpin to the extent that again, they can drag him into the 2024 race. That he tries to argue represented him bringing bipartisanship back to Washington. So why give him even if it's a ridiculous half-hearted opportunity? That... So why go along with this is the question you're asking, right? I mean, I think the answer that the Republicans would give or that we could give in their stead is, Trump wanted to do infrastructure. Infrastructure is popular. The problem we have... This is what I meant about the spending. Everybody... Oh, it's roads, it's bridges, it's putting people to work, right? And so, all of a sudden, talking about financial and fiscal responsibility and doing things... It's like being the dad at the table. That's right. When you're making the budget. This is what I mean, Clay. You want to be the... Do you want to be the grinch or do you want to be Santa Claus? The Republicans want to be Santa Claus too. And they want to buy sneakers. And so, I just think the challenge here is they are giving Joe Biden the best salesmanship opportunity he's going to have. Because I think... Tell me if you think I'm crazy on this. We're going to talk to Kevin McCarthy, I believe tomorrow, who I believe will be Speaker next year, if the Republicans take back the House, which they should, if they take back the House next year, and there's a strong chance that the Senate will be split or, you know, the Republicans have a decent chance. We'll see what happens in all these different battleground states. But regardless, Joe Biden's really not going to be able to get much done in 2023 and in 2024 as a result. So, he's going to lean on this infrastructure bill as the reason to justify his re-election. I just don't know why you give him this ammo when, again, it's different if you're getting something substantial, if there's horse trading going on, if these tax increases, which are so insanely out of whack relative to where we are economically, if they were being dialed back, I just haven't yet seen anything that suggests the Republicans are gaining anything from this quote, bipartisan bill. Well, as you know, the narrative from the Democrats and the 90% of journos and the media that do their bidding would be Republicans don't want to not only repair roads and bridges, but all the things that we want to do, whether it's extended unemployment benefits or pay for more child care or whatever, free stuff is popular. So that becomes a club with which they beat the Republicans. But I would note that your point about the midterms, let's remember that in the last election, well, I know that it was all overshadowed by the fact that Trump, and I don't need everyone to say, oh, but he actually doesn't matter what actually happened in terms of my discussion right now. Joe Biden is obviously the president. So Joe Biden is the president and we focus on that a lot, but Republicans actually did for a COVID year with very low with the party and power being Trump's party, the Republican party. They did pretty well. They actually gained in the house. Obviously, it's a 50 50 in the Senate. And so without that, you know, without the the COVID irregularities, both in the way the voting was set up and everything else. And the COVID year, I think Republicans are going to be in a really strong position because on on key issue, economy is not as good as it should be and everybody knows it. Inflation is is real and everyone's seeing it. The borders of disaster, crime is way up and Democrats think that there's no such thing as women. I mean, it's a pretty straightforward pitch. Well, and also it was kind of a perfect storm that there were two Senate seats up in Georgia, which was a state where Republicans didn't trust the outcome of the election. And then suddenly Republicans had to go back and run again, which is what is it going to end up costing us? Unfortunately, I think multi trillion dollars. People talk about what Senate races cost. If the Republicans had won one of those two seats, the government has trillions of dollars less debt. That that was the unforgivable loss, quite honestly, on the whole on the whole GOP slate of races, the two Georgia Senate that we couldn't pick up one of those is where there has to be a lot of soul searching about how did, you know, the Georgia GOP is a mess. We know that. But at the national level, there needed to be much better, much bigger and better planning for how to get that done. Once David and Williamsburg Virginia, before we get to our friend, Will Kane here in the next hour, David, what's up? I just don't see why that the Republicans should give a win to the Democrats on infrastructure when the Democrats took in the way of Trump for four years of trying to get an infrastructure bill done. It's just ridiculous to do something like that. It gives them a win going into this next election cycle. So David, it is interesting you bring up this point. And thank you for calling in, you know, play when Democrats stand in the way it's hashtag resistance and it's glorious when Republicans don't do what Democrats want. It's obstruction. They're obstructing. And then you have to use to pen the phone, right? You got to go around them. Well, not only that. I mean, as Kristen Sinema to her credit called out in a Washington Post editorial, suddenly the filibuster became Jim Crow 2.0 when it was super racist. But the win Donald Trump won the presidency. All of those same Democratic senators said we're going to resist with every fiber of our being. We're not going to allow Trump to run rough shot over Democratic institutions. So is it a good thing or a bad thing? The answer is it depends on how much power you have. You don't have a lot. It's a great thing. You have a lot. It's an awful thing. And it just points out the hypocrisy. I'm fine with the infrastructure bill. If there was something being gained, I just haven't seen that. I haven't seen it at all. We got our friend Will Kane from Fox News. We joining us here in a few minutes to talk about the Simone Biles stepping down from the Olympics controversy. If you believe it's a controversy, then also the insurrection narrative looks like they're going to be coming back with more insurrection investigation days in the future. We'll talk to Will about that. The GOP, how it's doing. Maybe Clay's got some sports things to throw in the mix. It's going to be a lot of fun. We'll be back with that. Spicy. Let's hang.
