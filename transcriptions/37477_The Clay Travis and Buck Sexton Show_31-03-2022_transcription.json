    "text": " You're listening to the Fox X 10 show podcast. Make sure you subscribe to the podcast on the I heart radio app or wherever you get your podcasts. Team welcome to the freedom hunt Thursday, March 31st edition of the program. I cannot believe how the time is flying. Thanks for rolling with us here. We have much to discuss today. The Hunter Biden laptop situations getting real folks, House Republicans launched an investigation into Twitter and Facebook following new reports on Hunter Biden's laptop. Plus, U S citizens are not going to be able to select X as their gender marker on U S passport books starting April 11th for transgender day of visibility. There was a tweet out about this from the secretary of state. So the trans agenda continuing, not a word from Disney in apology or even clarification after those videos came out where they said they want to have your kids exposed to as many LGBTQ LGBTQ plus characters as possible. And then we've also got a woman who said that she violated the Hippocratic oath with multiple shot jabs in someone's arm because he made fun of her pronouns on her name tag a nurse. We will discuss this coming up here in just a moment and more. Look, have you ever wanted to invest in real estate, but you didn't have the time to do it on your own. And you didn't want to make huge rookie mistakes. That's how I felt. And then I met my friends at done for your real estate. They found me an awesome property. They rented it out for me right away. Now I get a check every month like clockwork clockwork. It's amazing. Okay, you go through every stage of the process. You don't have to know anything about real estate investing. I never even bought a house before. The first house I ever bought was through done for you real estate. Okay, they found me an awesome property. They rented it out for me right away. And now I get a check every month like clockwork. Visit done for you buck.com to see how this works. That's done for you. Buck.com again, done for you buck.com. You'll begin your real estate investment journey today. Multiple houses bought already as investments for my retirement with done for you real estate. I'm preparing now building up equity, telling you they're amazing guys. They've got a great system. 100 Biden situation. It is getting interesting here. Here's the the libs don't even really know what to say on this one at this point. They're they're kind of, uh oh, we got away with just outright lies about it. We had big tech suppressing it. We had people increasingly, uh, willing in their journal positions to just go full on Democrat propagandist. And yet here we are. They had to admit finally that the laptop story was all true. And there's real corruption here. There's a real criminal investigation. And as you know, I've got a bet with my main man Clay Travis about whether or not Hunter's going to face charges. I see a deferred prosecution agreement in his future. He'll pay a fine he'll, but facing an actual possibility of prison time. Oh, the sitting president's son. We think that we think the apparatus of a Democrat party is going to allow that doesn't matter what the law says. Doesn't matter how many laws he broke. We think they would allow that. Well, only, and this is the part of it that makes me not 100% confident in my end of this bet. I'm I'm 90% confident. I'd say, but only possible now because it seems increasingly clear that they don't want to protect Hunter anymore. They don't want to protect Joe anymore. Not the same way. Is this a a version of the soft coup that they tried against Trump with the whole Russia collusion line? I mean, that is now I think we have to view that as a real possibility. We have to view that as something that we need to take seriously. And we have to view that as something we need to take into our analysis here. Because why now why the story is all coming out at the same time? It does feel like maybe they've realized they're creating the grounds for Joe to step down at some point in the future. Now this maybe this doesn't, you know, doesn't happen at all. Maybe we don't know. Maybe who knows? They make the whole thing go away. But now the Washington Post has said the stuff on the laptop is real. And Hunter Biden was paid millions of dollars by China, by Chinese firms. And there's no such thing as a Chinese firm that's paying an American who is the son of a former vice president and possible. And now as we know, actual future president without the Chinese Communist Party say so. So if he got paid millions of dollars, didn't pay taxes on that, you and I would definitely go to prison for that. No question. You and I would go to prison millions of dollars you're hiding from the IRS prison time. But he's Hunter Biden, the entire media apparatus lied. And that's also why I just want to say I don't want to hear it from these lips about election integrity, refusing the results of elections. They essentially hijack the democratic information process right before the election of 2020 in order to throw the whole thing toward Hunter Biden. That's what's really behind all this. Joe by or to Joe Biden, I say Hunter, it doesn't matter. Joe Biden never should have won this election. And I know you could be yelling right now, but he didn't and they cheated and yeah, but he's the president, right? So yeah, I'm not saying he did or did not cheat. I'm just saying the guy is the president. Their scams worked. We are not lives. We live in the real world. Who is the occupant now of the Oval Office? It's Joe Biden. So their scams plural worked for them, unfortunately. And here we are now having to deal with the aftermath of it. A Joe Biden presidency marked by a guy who's a buffoon. I mean, he should, he really should be removed with the 25th amendment. He should be forced to step down. This is a guy who does not have the mental clarity. Nevermind the temperament. I don't mean that he he's always been a blustery bully. I mean, Joe Biden is an impressive person to idiots. Joe Biden's an impressive person that somebody doesn't realize it's just all the same shtick for 40 years. No joke, folks. Here I am. I just want to you roll up the sleeves. You know, one of your just like you. I mean, I totally go along with far left radical socialist nonsense, but you know, whatever, I'm just, you know, one of the guys, one of the guys, no joke. Some people, unfortunately, think that that's real. Look, other people, it's transactional. They know that Joe Biden's a lib when he when he's told to be by the Democrat party. So he's just give, he's going to vote the way they want. They know that he's full of it, but he's going to give them the votes they want. And so they go with it. But here we are now seeing the reality of what it is to have a Joe Biden presidency. It's a it's a bad thing. We'll keep it real simple. A bad thing to have a Joe Biden president's. So now with that in mind, with that all lined up and done, I think the Democrats realize he's not going to win a second term. They're really worried about look at the numbers and all the numbers indicated can't win. And so that's why now all of a sudden, maybe the Hunter Biden situation has changed. There are some holdouts though. Here's Jonathan Lemire saying that Trump is obsessed. The Hunter story, we did everything right on the Hunter Biden story. Flattered Putin right now is without question the least popular person in the United States. How is this a good idea from Donald Trump? If he is eyeing a return to the political stage, if he wants to run again in 2024, and it's certainly clear he's still obsessed with relitigating 2020, he feels that not enough attention was paid to the Hunter Biden story, even though it was fact checked and most of it seemed deemed nonsense back then. But yet he's still so obsessed with that that he's playing this Putin card when right now, even most Trump friendly Republicans are running away from all things Putin. Just ignore the you know the Putin stuff is a shiny object. That's that's that's just obvious bull crap. Well, why is he all pro Putin? It's just this is the lie that they constantly out. But the more the more mendacious part of this was when he says, you know, the Hunter Biden laptop was fact checked wrongly. Yeah, 88 wrongly. They got it all wrong. To say it was fact checked. Isn't some kind of excuse for what happened. They lied about it. I mean, that was so Soviet. It was remarkable. I mean, you know, we checked the Hunter Biden story at the time and you know, it was so, you know, we totally totally fact checked it. And it was, yeah, you all lied about it. Liars. They are liars. You think think of how many votes had to change for Joe for Joe Biden to lose to Donald Trump, 50,000 votes, 40,000 votes, depends on how you spread them around different states. Not a lot for or not a lot, friends, not a difficult, not a difficult to ask to change that many votes. So here we are. Now we see they have to just make up something that what else are they going to say? How else are they going to explain this? Well, they're fraud says, you know, utter and complete frauds. And that's why they say things like we fact checked it. Yeah, you guys lied. Your fact check was a lie. Just because you call it a fact check doesn't mean that that's okay. You know, Donald Trump should be president right now. In a world in which people report the news, honestly, like the Hunter Biden laptop, Donald Trump, I think is the president. But no, no unacceptable to them. Four deputy U.S. Marshals deployed under president Trump to protect and defend a federal courthouse in Portland during the riots of 2020 are being sued by the ACLU. The Department of Justice under the Biden administration will not agree to provide an attorney to defend them from outrageous allegations. These brave officers withstood physical harm repelling riders. You remember the images, assaults, fires, flying objects, noxious chemicals, explosive devices, and the whole lib media on offense against our police. Learn about these family men with stellar service to our country at police defense.org. The law enforcement legal defense fund at police defense.org educates the public on the risks and threats associated with being an officer today and raises funds to alleviate financial burdens. In this case, hundreds of thousands in mounting legal fees and at risk of losing their homes. Help these officers today, today, donate at police defense dot org. That's police defense, police defense dot org. Make your donation today. How about these guys? All right, we have now the Biden administration saying U.S. citizens able to select X as their gender marker on their U.S. passport book starting April 11th. This was on a tweet from the secretary of state Tony Blinken. He wrote, as we mark transgender day of visibility, we mark this historic moment at the State Department as a meaningful step toward LGBTQI plus in inclusivity. Why do you leave off the A? They're supposed to be an A, I think. Is it an LGBTQIA? Or am I, no, I thought I'd see it as an A sometimes. I guess that has changed. I also want to know where's the P for pansexual? Because I just heard the Disney chief of contents say that she had a pansexual child. So I think if we're going to talk about inclusivity, why not have the P on there? Oh, just the plus. The P only gets a plus. That seems a little discriminatory for my taste. I got to throw it. It's got to be LGBTQIAP. QRS TUV. This is what we're up against friends. This is a madness here. I just spoke to my friend about this earlier in the week. We had a we did an interview, Rob Smith. Rob Smith is a conservative. He's a veteran. He's black and gay. And he is looking at all this stuff. We're talking about he says the all these activist groups, they're they've decided they don't they don't gay and lesbian Americans. They don't spend any time really thinking about them. That's not what this is about anymore. In fact, they've been kind of forgotten. I mean, that's this is not about gay rights. Not about lesbian rights. This is about trans and multi gendered new age sexual attraction and proclivity agenda. Oh, oh, it's interesting because there are members of the gay and lesbian community. Remember, we used to hear about the gay and lesbian community. You won't hear that really that term anymore because they're not at the it's that that's not the forefront of the left wing activist agenda. Now it's all about the trans agenda. This is what Rob was saying to me. He's a gay black American. Great guy, veteran, good friend of mine. He's like, it's all the trans agenda, all the trans agenda. And it's it's remarkable to see this. I mean, the state department now changing the situation of passports. You can select X as your gender marker. There's a security component of this. I mean, there there's a we need to know we need to be able to see your face. That's why masks are so stupid. And we also should be able to know one's gender. We should be able to know the person's gender. This is about physical identification. X on your passport. Well, this is what they're doing. And you also should know that this is, as I've said so many times, really increasingly a religious belief. This is a religious belief for people. Oh, by the way, the Biden administration has just endorsed this. This I'm just seeing. Biden administration endorses transgender youth sex change operations and top surgery. Hormone therapy. White House encourages gender reassignment surgery, puberty blockers, hormone therapy for transgender minors. President Biden, this is on Fox News. I'm just saying this story is breaking. President Biden has released a series of documents encouraging gender reassignment surgery and hormone treatments for minors. The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Population Affairs released a document titled gender affirming care and young people. Same day, the substance abuse and mental health services, administration's national child traumatic stress network, another subset of the HHS HHS released a parallel document titled gender affirming care is trauma informed care. The HHS documents describe what it calls appropriate treatments for transgender adolescents, including top surgery, which is the, the surgical removal of healthy female breast tissue and bottom surgery, the surgery to remove male genitalia for minors. The Biden administration is pushing this. Wow. They are going all in on this. You got to think that maybe they realize they can't win independence. They can't win on decided going into this midterm. So they're just trying to get the crazy left wing base as fired up as possible and get as many of them out there as possible. Wow. I didn't even get a chance to talk to you about this, this woman who was down. I got to make sure I get the place right here. This woman who is taking giving someone a shot and he made a joke about her, about her pronouns. A North Carolina medical student, I said nurse, I'm sorry, it's a medical student made a, they, they patient here you go. Woke North Carolina medical student who is a trans rights activist, brags about deliberately injuring patient who mocked her. She, her pronoun badge by missing his vein on purpose. So he had to get a jab twice. Now medical students put you in physical pain. If you make a joke about their ridiculous, ridiculous gender pronoun announcing on their name card friends, they've gone insane to the left and we will continue to push back on the madness. Thanks for rolling with me here on the bucks, action show podcast. I will talk to you tomorrow. Shields high."
