    "text": " Coming up on this episode of the doctor's pharmacy even simple meditation 15 minutes twice a day Can cut back on? Constantly cut in half the amount of hot flashes a woman has Hey everybody, it's dr. Mark Hyman welcome to a special episode of the doctor's pharmacy that's pharmacy with an FFA I may see why I place for conversations that matter and if you've had any hormone issues whether it's Menstrual issues or menopause or perimenopause or bad pap test or anything. This is the podcast you should listen to it's with My colleague and friend and partner with the ultra wellness center dr Elizabeth Boham and she's joining us on today's special episode of house call on the doctor's pharmacy and She's an incredible doctor. She's had struggles with herself with hormone issues and breast cancer So she knows a lot about this and we focus on Chronic diseases that nobody else can figure out and get people better when no one else can using a very different model of care called functional medicine So I'm super excited to have you here Liz. Thank you for joining. Thank you so much for having me mark. All right. Let's get into it How prevalent are hormone imbalances for women? Oh Man, I mean when when I see a woman you so often we're dealing with hormone imbalances. They're so prevalent you know everything from as you mentioned pms to With you know to issues with menopause and perimenopause to issues with estrogen dominance rate or over over levels of estrogen high levels of estrogen in the body which can lead to breast tenderness or more pms or Cancers like uterine cancer and breast cancer food retention and heavy bleeding that too. Yes Yeah, so swings and mood issues So we're really thinking about hormones and hormone balance when anybody comes into the office So I mean that's something I think that that's an area. It's so common, right? 75% of women suffer from pms How is that normal right? It's not a normal state of biology right? Normal state right just because it's so common doesn't mean it's actually Optimal right absolutely so then we need to ask that question why why are the hormones out of balance and we look at everything From how is the body metabolizing the hormones? How is the microbiome and how is that influencing it? How is the person dealing with stress and is that influencing the hormone balance? So you know you want to look at look at the whole body when you're trying to figure out what may be out of balance with somebody's hormones Even fertility issues. I mean, oh that's getting so common It's so common you know affects so one out of seven couples And so when you go to a regular doctor and you have these you know symptoms of pms or heavy bleeding or you know Miracles like what do they do? It's so often they'll say okay, I'm gonna put you on birth control pills Oh, yeah, right right like if with with pms and or regular cycles or perimenopause That is the common response, you know, let's just start some birth control pills and that's even everything out. Is that safe? I don't know. I mean, it's a good question, right? I mean, there's there are side effects to birth control pills, you know, we see we see we see stroke and blood clots with some women with birth control pills Infections flexing microbiome Absolutely, there's some there's some women where we know that the longer you've been on birth control pills Or if you're on them more than 10 years or if you're you know, your risk for breast cancer goes up So there is an association with long-term use of birth control pills or just breast cancer Yeah, so you take the pill for a long time and your risk of breast cancer goes up Yeah for women when they're on the birth control pill or if they've been on it a long time they have a slightly higher risk and You know, so that's something we got to pay attention to not everybody handles the hormones in the birth control pills the same So not everybody being prescribed birth control for birth control They're using the medical therapy for hormone imbalances when there's a very different way of treating it It works better Yeah, the women feel better and their hormones get imbalanced without nasty side effects of stroke and cancer Right, right. I mean you really want to I grains and who knows what I write migraines too. Absolutely So you want to ask well Why is there that imbalance in the hormones and and what may be out of balance for that woman? You know, I think perimenopause is such an interesting time Where we get a lot of women who come in to the office at that time because they're just feeling so crummy, right? Perimenopause is the time frame between when you're between when your cycles are normal and you can easily get where you can get pregnant and Menopause so perimenopause are those years You know, you know, it's can be they can be like 10 13 years perimenopause and it's can occur Anytime you can go into menopause anytime between 45 and 55 That's typical and that perimenopause can be 10 6 to 10 to 13 years beforehand before you actually go into menopause is considered perimenopause What is that? And it just means yeah, I mean there's there's just the this the hormones are not as regular and consistent, right? So what happens a lot in perimenopause is During those years women will have what are called an ovulatory cycles. Mm-hmm, so So they don't ovulate every time they have a monthly cycle, right? And so those an ovulatory cycles meaning no ovulation that month Results in less progesterone being produced in the body because when you ovulate That's when you make progesterone, right? If you're sort of weaning down your years of reproductive life, you don't necessarily make progesterone your ovulate every cycle you get these high levels of estrogen Right that causes a lot of these symptoms of lots and heavy bleeding and that PMS and mood issues and sleep issues And migraines and all this stuff that women suffer from it is so unnecessary Right you think of it as you know when you're having regular cycles with ovulation You have estrogen and progesterone and they sort of balance each other out And then when you're in those perimenopausal years, you're gonna have so many women will have cycles where they don't have that Progesterone spike. Yeah, so it feels like their body feels like it's higher in estrogen because they don't have that Progesterone to balance it off and so you feel like you have high estrogen And and like you mentioned you get more breast tenderness or more clotting or heavier bleeding And and the low progesterone makes us often feel crummy. Yeah, so you can be more irritable You can just you know cranky Harder time sleeping because progesterone really is a calming hormone and it helps us helps women helps people sleep better So when it's low many times you don't sleep as well. You'll have irregular sleep patterns where you've never had that before and and and you just feel more irritable and cranky and and And it's no balance. Yeah, and you know, it's It's important to understand that we know a lot about what causes these imbalances And we know a lot about how to fix them except your traditional doctor is just not doing it. Yeah So what are the things that we know? Create hormone imbalance that make things worse for women and by the way, you know, just to sort of a little aside You know, it's not just sex hormones to get out of balance Right and when you when you see this sort of period of life around perimenopause There's like four different hormones that are all interacting That all kind of gets screwed up one is insulin and blood sugar Yeah, because you're you know, you're all in the sandwich generation You have kids and your parents are getting older and you're trying to have a career And it's like it's a lot going on at that time for women often. Yeah, and then they have Estrogen imbalances and progesterone they have adrenal imbalances Because they're adrenal glands are their stress response and they're highly stressed in that time of life So there are adrenals interact with the sex hormones and screw that up and then of course You got thyroid thrown in there in a lot of cases You got thyroid adrenal sex hormones insulin and it's just like a big mishmash of hormone chaos Yep, and actually you can fix it. Absolutely. And I'm so like so easy to fix with functional medicine Yeah, yeah, and I'm so glad you brought that up because all of our hormones are interrelated. They're all playing off each other They're all influencing each other and so that's important to really understand Because because that's how we can really help women feel better Yeah, so when you really focus on the adrenal glands for example so you have you have two adrenal glands typically they sit up on top of your kidneys and those glands produce cortisol and They produce DHEA and they a bunch of other things Yeah, so Cortisol is one of your stress hormones So when you're under a lot of stress if you're under chronic stress for example I mean, you know your body is gonna be producing a lot of cortisol all the time And so what can happen what can happen is then the body is spending all this time Making cortisol to handle that that chronic stress you're under you're dealing with your your kids and then your parents as you talked about You know, you're working all the time good job. You're not you're not giving your body enough time to rest You're not getting enough sleep. You might not be eating right, you know, you might be just running from one thing to the other It may not be taking the time to do your meditation or your exercise, right? You're just not doing that self care, which is so important for your adrenal glands And when that's when that's happening then then your body spending all this time producing cortisol that it can't do Is good a job at producing progesterone. Yeah, right and so they have it's like a chicken wire thing It's all connected. It's not like you're all separate right and so then you have more of those signs of low Progesterone which we talked about before which is irregular sleep irritability, you know more crankiness more PMS, right so So it's really important that we step back and say okay How can we support your adrenal glands and and that's really a lot of of self care? You know by saying okay, I need to give my time myself time to rest. I need to give myself enough time to sleep Maybe exactly I got to get my meditation in right and and I think that makes a big difference It can really help With with balancing the hormones we know right that even simple meditation 15 minutes twice a day Can cut back on? Concignificantly cut in half the amount of hot flashes a woman has yeah during those pyramid applause that we haven't even talked about half Flash yeah, right. I mean let's talk about the things that screw up your hormones, right? Yeah, so sugar Yes That causes insulin resistance that causes more estrogen be made and all the imbalances right right? We're talking about how when you when you get more insulin resistance you gain more weight around the belly Yeah, and we know that when we gain more weight around the belly That we have more of that aromatase enzyme which makes more estrogen and again throws a side of balance What about alcohol? Yeah, alcohol alcohol really is a concern because the because the way alcohol you know, there's multiple ways that alcohol can impact risk of of Breast cancer for example, but it also seems to result in a higher level of free estrogen in the body Yeah, and so you know and we know it disrupts sleep It is it liver toxin. Yeah, and it literally impedes the body's ability To metabolize estrogen. Yep, and I've seen studies it was shocking to me where people were on hormone replacement and drinking and their liver Just can't handle it and the estrogen level spike. Yep, and their risk goes up So we have you know an enormous link there even like I remember a study I read years ago Which was if a woman had a glass of wine a day it increases her risk of breast cancer by 40% Yeah, you know unfortunately, there's a linear relationship between alcohol and breast cancer risk So for every drink a woman drinks per day like every time she increases the amount of she drinks per day her risk of breast cancer Goes up even further. So, you know, what's considered moderation for women is five or less drinks a week With a drink being, you know five ounces of wine or you know an ounce of yeah But not very much no, it's not for a year a whole week But what's interesting is your right there has been even studies showing that even even one drink a day is linked with an increased risk of breast cancer and and maybe because it is Impaoring well partly because it's impairing our liver and our ability to detoxify and it's shifting estrogen levels And it also depletes the body of B vitamins So there's so many so many impacts that alcohol has there yeah, and even even the microbiome plays a role in your hormone balance, right? Right absolutely, right? That's something we're always measuring right we're looking at how the body is metabolizing hormones and And we're looking at the microbiome And I think that that's important when we're dealing with a woman in perimenopause like sometimes they're they just don't even Understand why am I feeling this way you know why am I all of a sudden more irritable? Why am I having a harder time with my periods? You know why are they heavier? Why can't I sleep? Why am I getting hot flashes now right and so sometimes just Educating them is a great first place to start and a lot of times women just feel better when they start to understand okay This is this is gonna you know my hormones are shifting and then what can I do to support them? Yeah, hey everyone, Dr I'm in here now I know we're all focused on being as healthy as possible during this unprecedented time and that means drinking clean water Eating loads of anti-inflammatory foods and it also means keeping our homes clean now I've been doing my best to keep my family safe while indoors and for me This means using an air filter now. We know that toxic air particles can contribute to cardiovascular disease Lung disease and even Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's these toxic particles come from cleaning products and stoves and pet dander and air fresheners and house paint and furniture and so much more And that's why it's super important to filter our indoor air with the highest quality Filter around and a few years ago I found Air Doctor which is an air filter that's made by ideal living and I loved it so much that I bought it and Brought it into my home and my clinic The Air Doctor is the first affordable air purifier that not only removes a hundred percent of the particles But also the vast majority of all the organic compounds and gases it features an ultra-hepa filter Which is a hundred times more effective than ordinary HEPA filters the Air Doctor is a hundred percent seal system To ensure that all the air you breathe is pure and Filtered now I've teamed up with the makers of air doctor to give the doctors pharmacy listeners the best deal yet on this amazing filtration system Right now if you go to doctor hyman.com forward slash filter to access the air doctor filter for $329 and that's $300 off the normal price of this filter and this is their biggest deal yet You definitely want to take advantage so head over to doctor hyman.com forward slash filter to access the deal. Thanks for tuning in And we were talking about how great meditation is right because it's oh yeah Yeah, and in the things you know We see typically the women who have the worst problems have the worst diet the most stress they drink too much They don't exercise they don't they have lots of stress. They don't meditate. It's not rocket science why hormones get screwed up Right and and we know how to intervene using Yeah, very specific diagnostic tests that we do at the ultra want to center to actually help map out what's happening with the hormones We can look at estrogen metabolism We can see how to really be sophisticated manipulating those hormones so that actually they're better We can fix the gut in the microbiome We can look for environmental toxins which act like estrogens in the body and get rid of those or heavy metals And we can actually have an impact through using various foods to help whether it's flaxes or other broccoli family help estrogen Metabolism certain soy products that are your whole food. Soi products are good and and then we can kind of Get people's hormones to kind of work better We may want to use nutrients and you were talking about sulforaphane Which is a powerful broccoli chemical that you can take and there's a whole cocktail of things we use to help estrogen Metabolism well, we should probably talk about soy a little bit because honestly this is probably the most common question I get Yeah, because people are so confused Soi or not eat soy So so soy right soy foods are in they have these things called phyto Estrogens in them and this is what got everybody nervous, right? So they have these they have these these components these phytonutrients these components in them that can actually impact the estrogen receptor And so for you know a bunch of years ago Oncologists used to say oh no it can impact the estrogen receptor. I don't want you to eat soy But what we know actually is that they they bind to the estrogen receptor Preventing your own estrogen from binding to the estrogen receptor and as a result You have a lower estrogen like impact in the body So multiple studies have shown that that soy is actually associated with a lower rate of breast cancer and And a lower rate That's a good point like tofu tempeh yes, natto miso soy, soi soy, right right Those are whole soy products that are not Industrial food and most soy we're eating today is industrial soy Yes turned in all kinds of weird ingredients like soy burgers and and soy hot dogs and Texturized vegetable protein that gets inserted in all kinds of protein bars And isolated soy protein which very different than regular whole soy and maybe you can't sir Right, so I think it's important. We'll realize that you know It's you know food is a modulator and it usually helps the body do what it does rather than Interfer with it and so sometimes it's true with like you eat too much broccoli or whatever you raw broccoli gonna get vecter thyroid But the the phyto estrogens in soy actually helped to act more like a thermos they keep things balanced, right? Mm-hmm, and and I think you know recommending those whole soy foods is great And I think that's a really easy thing to do flaxes also really help on flax seeds in the gut yep The crock broccoli family vegetable simple dietary things and getting more fiber to help the Biotics in the gut getting rid of all the starch the sugar the processed food all those ingredients alcohol There's really simple things you can do yeah I like balancing your blood sugar balancing your blood sugar by making sure that every meal has a good source of healthy fat Has a good source of fiber and has a good source of protein right so that Prevents the spikes in blood sugar and the spikes in insulin right so you you make sure your meals are balanced like that Then you won't get those ups and downs in your in your energy And so you just feel better and that helps with that helps with all you know preventing those at that high insulin I'm gonna be binging on carbs and sugar to get your energy up and all that right right right so then that helps with the balance of all the hormones as you were mentioning earlier and And so you know when a woman is going through perimenopause You know the first place we look at is okay. What are these personalized lifestyle factors? What can we really focus on with them? I mean there might be times where we at the ultra walnut center may use some hormones to help with just wrong To help with their sleep if necessary But many times just a woman understanding what's going on and then making some shifts in their lifestyle can make a huge impact And make them feel better. Yeah, and so you had this patient who had you know struggle with sleep and she was 45 And she had never had a problem before and woke up all the time at night sweats and she was terribly not well And what did you find with her right? So you know we found so she was 45 so she was in perimenopause We checked her hormones at day 20 in her cycle. So what we ended up finding was her progesterone was low Right, so she had she was in those anovulatory cycles like we had mentioned earlier and and her progesterone was low So what we really worked on was supporting her Her progesterone production with supporting her adrenal gland, you know taking good self-care Getting good rest doing her meditation. We also worked on metabolizing her estrogen So she had some variations in her genetics and she ended up having some We worked to really lower her estrogen levels with with with you know the cruciferous vegetables folate rich foods we added in some supplements that actually on top of that were helpful and You know she did much better She really started to feel better and we also you know We got her off of we got her off a caffeine because we know that caffeine can impact sleep more and it might not have bothered her in The past but during this transition in her life It was really impacting her sleep and her irritability So we got her off of the caffeine and we also saw when we did that her hot flashes significantly decreased and her sleep started to improve Yeah, and you just see so many of these patients who suffer with things like PMS Paramedipods or sleep issues or mood issues or depression or migraines which are common when your hormones that are balanced right or or abnormal pap tests or we call it dysfunctional uterine bleeding which they have cloths and painful periods and I you know it makes me really angry when I see these patients because They're not getting the advice they need. They're not actually given a doorway into a way of thinking and Diagnosis and treatment that actually fixes their problems. Yep, and they're either told they're you know You know emotional or they're anxious or they give me any a present or they give them a hormone treatment Which you know sometimes is okay, but a lot of times it's not the right hormones It's you know giving them a birth control pill or giving them Premarin and and what we see in functional medicine is by working in this way You're using the thyroid approach and the adrenal treatments and the insulin approach So you know fixing the insulin resistance and fixing the estrogen metabolism and the gut and the toxins You know, it's it's different for every woman But you sort of look at what's for them the issue and you then personalize it and you can create an incredible roadmap for women to feel good and Get rid of PMS and get rid of heavy bleeding and get rid of the cramps and get rid of migraine and get rid of the Sleep and hot flash issues and so forth, right? So it's a pretty exciting model that I think is you know It's one of the best applications of functional medicine is helping women with all these Hormone imbalances that are actually relatively easy to fix. Yeah, I would agree. I'd agree It's really fun. It's a fun place to be. Yeah, and I remember there's one patient I had would abnormal pap test because you know That's a big thing for women, right? Yes, pre cervical cancer and screening and you know what they do is they they screen you and then they Then they say well, you know come back if it's worse and then they cut your cervix out or they do some surgical thing They burn it or you know that has consequences and you know may save your life But it's not necessarily the only thing you can do right and I had you know one woman very very interestingly She had really a moral pap test But when I checked her shed these weird jeans that made it hard for to metabolize estrogen The methylation jeans and things have to do with B vitamins And she also had some nutritional deficiencies and various things we just we just fixed it up and then we gave her we gave her Methapholate and we have her various nutrients B6 which helps estrogen metabolism And we also gave her something called indol 3 carbonyl, which essentially is broccoli pill Yep, and there's a lot of research on how if you have an abnormal pap test if you take these phytochemicals if you help estrogen metabolism you actually have Reversal and I can't see how many patients I've had with using this actually help them get there Like 3,000 micrograms of methyl folate again that want the methyl form But 3,000 micrograms of methyl folate really can be helpful in terms of reversing that cervical dysplasia right and And of course we always go with food and right the folate rich foods are your foliage or green leafy veggies But but when there's actual Displasia in the cervix when we give that higher dose of methyl folate That it can it's we really can be very helpful so powerful and there's so many things like you know We talked a little bit earlier and maybe we need to do another podcast on this but fertility is such an issue right one in seven couples are in fertile It's increasing and it has to do with things that are often treatable or reversible Not using tons of hormones or intrigued to a fertilization or all these things And you know I've had so many patients in my practice who couldn't get pregnant Right and you treat them using a functional medicine approach and they're packing just think of two right now one's a 44 year old woman Who actually was so sick with all kinds of issues wanted to have another baby couldn't get pregnant and got pregnant naturally after we fixed Fixed her another one was about a 38 year old woman who also struggled with the fertility And she literally just had her baby last week and it's so gratifying to me to see that that you know We can actually focus on how to treat these things using food There's a little textbooks written on this and fertility diet written by Walter Willett Which talks about how sugar is a big factor for infertility huge, you know And people don't realize that they're eating bread they're eating sugar and the thing all is fine But right actually maybe it caused their fertility so but that whole connection with that high insulin and your hormones Yeah, and it's so connected so I if anybody's listening out there as a woman There's probably a few out there. I would I would really not accept the traditional messaging from During conventional doctors that you just have to suffer through all this yeah PMS again is one of those things It's relatively easy to fix using this functional medicine approach Whether we use you know diet exercise supplements various kinds of herbs nutrients even sometimes You know natural hormones like progesterone can make a huge difference and if we do use hormones We actually use bio identical hormones which things like Premarin is horse urine pregnant mares urine And it produces all these secondary metabolites and more more clay to give stroke and cancer increases inflammation Increase the celiacate protein. I mean it's like not great Mm-hmm and by using a different approach using bio identical hormones delivered to the skin or certain ways It can have a profound benefit to women and and I think we're gonna have to come back and do another podcast on Metapause because we didn't even talk about hormone replacement therapy which is a whole big category of of Thinking about how do you actually find the right? Dose in the right person in the right way is delivering the right method that actually has the most benefit because there are risks to it But but I think we can mitigate those risk using this whole approach absolutely. I agree So what do you think as a woman about any last words to women and what what they should think about when it comes to Their hormones and being out of balance. Yeah, I mean I think really appreciate the connection with all the difference With all the different hormones in the body that you know when you really work to support your adrenal gland when you really work to manage your stress when you really work to get enough sleep and Rest in your body that really helps with your hormones Rebalancing themselves and I think that I think that that's a really important area that you know so often women are just Taking care of others right they're taking care of their kids or taking care of their spouse or taking care of their parents And they really need to take this time to say okay Maybe maybe some of these symptoms are telling me that I've got to start taking care of myself Yeah, and and that really can make a huge difference sort of like on the airplane They tell you to put the mask on your face before you put on your kids You know I think that's what women need is and it's hard because women are programmed in our culture to be caretakers to help everybody else To neglect themselves and feel guilty and bad if they do it And I and I think it's really important that women start to put themselves first and actually prioritize their own well-being Which will help everything in their life? Absolutely. Well Dr. Boham Liz, thank you so much for being on the doctor's pharmacy I really love having you on this little mini episode.
