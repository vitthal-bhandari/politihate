    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you. No matter how dark things have gotten, if you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on the screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at BlazeTV.com slash The Blind. Today, Senator Rand Paul presses Dr. Rachel Levin on Capitol Hill and progressives threaten to abandon COVID-19 relief if it doesn't include minimum wage hike. You may be wondering what one has to do with the other. Well, so are we. We've got a lot to get into and it starts right now. Welcome to The News in White Matters. I'm Sarah Gonzalez reporting to you from the Arctic Tundra because whenever Glenn just leaves the set, it is in fact freezing in this building. We're going to try our best to get through this program without actually freezing to death. I'm joined by Stu Bergeer of Stoode's America. I had my heat on 90 in my car the whole way here to warm up from the radio show. I just got warm and then we came in here. We had to come into this. It's packed right. It's cold outside too. I mean, Texas cold. This time not like our Arctic cold. Right. What 50 today? How are you here without a jacket? I'm tough. I'm from Montana. Yeah, Lee. All right. So we've got a lot to get into. I know you guys were thinking before you walked onto this set that you really wanted to talk about the issue of genital mutilation and right. Finally. Finally, we're going to discuss it. That's got a six part documentary coming out on. Yeah. I can't wait to catch that. Ken Burns and I did it. Senator Rand Paul today pressed Joe Biden's nominee for assistant secretary of health on whether the government should override a parent's consent to allow a gender dysphoric child to begin taking hormones or pursue sex change therapy. Now, this comes because as we know, Dr. Rachel Levine, who is from Pennsylvania, who is of course a transgender woman, so a biological man is the nominee. And in the past, she's even tweeted about it. If you go to her social media, she has a tweet in which she expresses support for puberty blockers for children, young children being able to change their gender. And not just like, Hey, I think I am a girl or a boy, but actually taking these medications in order to do so. So Rand Paul went back and forth with the doctor, did not get a straight answer from her and but kept going in this clip watch. For most of our history, we believe that minors don't have full rights and the parents need to be involved. So I'm alarmed that you won't say with certainty that minors should not have the ability to make the decision to take hormones that will affect them for the rest of their life. Will you make a more firm decision on whether or not minors should be involved in these decisions? Senator, transgender medicine is a very complex and nuanced field. And if confirmed to the position of assistant secretary of health, I would certainly be pleased to come to your office and talk with you and your staff about the standards of care and the complexity of this field. Let it go into the record that the witness refused to answer the question. The question is a very specific one. Should minors be making these momentous decisions? For most of the history of medicine, we wouldn't let you have a cut zone up in the ER, but you're willing to let a minor take things that prevent their puberty and you think they get that back. You give a woman testosterone enough that she grows a beard. Do you think she's going to go back looking like a woman when you stop the testosterone? You have permanently changed them. Infertility is another problem. None of these drugs have been approved for this. They're all being used off label. I find it ironic that the left that went nuts over hydroxychloroquine being used possibly for COVID are not alarmed that these hormones are being used off label. There's no long term studies. We don't know what happens to them. We do know that there are dozens and dozens of people who've been through this who regret that this happened and a permanent change happened to them. And if you've ever been around children, 14-year-olds can't make this decision. In the gender dysphoria clinic in England, 10% of the kids are between the age of three and 10. We should be outraged that someone's talking to a three-year-old about changing their sex. I can't remember if you can. Thank you so much, Senator Paul. So a tense moment between Senator Rand Paul and Dr. Rachel Levine. Who's lovely, by the way? She's beautiful. Have you ever seen a more beautiful woman? That would have been her. Oh. She's incredibly beautiful. I saw one once. I saw one of the women in the Obama because her arms are arms. Okay, the arms. But I mean, in general, the perfect woman would be Rachel Levine with Michelle Obama's arms. I think we could agree on that. I think we can. So, I mean, it's uncomfortable to watch and it's like, all right. But I mean, this is one of Joe Biden's nominees for a pretty important position. I get it's assistant secretary. But if we have people in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services who think that now three-year-olds should be able to consent to sex changes, that's a big deal. And we should acknowledge that the only reason this person has this job is because of their transgender and they wanted to set this new first step on transgender rights or whatever. There's no reason to say, in fact, we've seen terrible handling of health issues in Pennsylvania throughout the last year. Yeah. Can I just say this is the same person who enacted the same policy similar to Andrew Cuomo, removed her own mother from the nursing home so that her mother wouldn't be affected. I mean, this is a bad nominee no matter what they look like or no matter what they're saying in this particular hearing. When you go to this point, I mean, it's, there's something that like we do when we argue points, right, where we take the most extreme crazy thing to set a sort of like baseline of the argument. And for years and years and years, I mean, there was always a back and forth from the left and the right about gay rights and gay marriage and transgender rights or whatever. But you should be able to say, look, a three year old is the most extreme example he used, should not be making the decision about changing their gender, which by the way, you can't actually do. You can have surgeries and take hormones to simulate a change of a gender, but you can't actually change your gender. But there's this idea that like a three year old can make a decision like this. When we all know a three year old literally can't make any decision on their own. I mean, there's not, that's not what they do. They're three. A 10 year old is the same thing. I mean, I have a nine year old and like he's not like he would not be capable of making a decision like this that would alter his entire life. That's what parents are for. So you know, it is, it's a remarkable that this, you know, Rachel Levine will probably sail through with every democratic vote because of her identity. The fact that she won't answer, he won't answer whatever will not answer this very simple question like, come on. Right. Well, kids, we're talking about, I understand we can get their all other stuff. We're talking about kids. Should they be making their, their, this decision without parental notice? Right. We're like so far down the extreme thing and they won't even say that. It's like when you ask a liberal like, what about abortion one second before birth and they won't say no. Yeah. Right. Well, because if this is a, if this is a position that you hold to be morally superior, why not say it? Yeah, not sure. Pat. I have kids at every age up to 38 years old. I wouldn't allow my 38 year old to make that decision. I don't know. It's not capable. They're not capable of making that. I'd be like, no, you can't make that decision. Yeah. Let me help you out. You're a state of same sex. Okay. Well, I mean, it's kind of what not at 38, but it's kind of what like parents are designed to do. Yeah. And then why we are the ones who are in charge of our children's lives until they are at least 18. It's the most absurd thing maybe that I've ever heard because we all know that as Stu just said, you're, they're, they're incapable of that. They're incapable when they're teenagers of making decisions like that. They really are. I mean, they're, they're, they're but stupid until they're like 25 years old. And even then, it's a little iffy. Yeah. And even then they shouldn't vote till they're 35. I mean, you can't be president. You can't vote for president, right? Right. That's a ridiculous. Now, look, I mean, you know, this goes on the back of, of there's a poll that came out yesterday, which talked about the breakouts of, of, you know, how many people are gay, how many people are lesbian, how many people are bisexual, transgendered. Did it, did it say how many people are two spirit? It did not. They didn't even ask that. What should me was hateful. Wow. I thought it was hateful. Very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very handled. So there's no, there was no pl militias. There's a K.Dole Q. It was just LGBTQ. Oh, wow. That's it. That was it. That was, oh, really bad. Yes. Plus both beers both? Q, no, no, no. Umm, not so cool. So anyway, the poll, I don't have them in front of me. They had intersex, right? No, surely they had no ... Oh, no, wow. Didn't have that, either. They did have Pansexual. They asked how many people were Pansexual. I printed out the poll and it came it was on the outside of the paper. It didn't fit I don't know what the result was I see it was like 80% are pansexual, but I don't know it was outside of the paper I printed it landscape on the portrait. Yeah, all right I'm sick, which is a problem is my fault. It's my fault and I apologize. It really is all the intersex people out there And all the pansexual folks who happen to be tuning in He apologizes Definitely. Oh my gosh. I apologize for everything. I've ever said that including the thing I'm about to say which is They found that the poll found that of Malef the zoom zoomer generation Z whatever they're calling them zoomers, which is just awful They they found that 11.8% of them were bisexual 11.8% there's 1.8% was was transgendered I think it was like 1.6% were lesbian and like 2% were gay. So now we're out to two believe Right now that there are more transgendered people in this upcoming group than there then there are Certainly bisexual but even lesbians like there's just they're disappearing apparently and when you look through the age You look through the age ranges what you see is like for bisexual. It's like 11% of Generation Z and it slowly steps down The percentages till you get to older people and it's like 2% of older people and it's like well If you're gonna go by the sort of lady Gaga thesis here that everyone's born this way You know why are those percentages so different? I think there is a fair argument to say that it's become more acceptable as we've gone on through time and like more acceptable to come out of The closet but the people we're talking about are alive like they're they're like 40 years old now in a period where they're alive And they could come out of the closet and they could certainly answer a an anonymous poll accurately at this point in their lives But like we're like it's just like there's another part of it that is it's 11.8% of the population Generation Z is bisexual when you look at that they broke it out a little bit and they said well you're bisexual Are you having a opposite sex relationship or a same sex relationship? Pretty interesting question. I thought they did a good job with this poll what they found is that it was like 10 times as many people in the bisexual group were having opposite sex relationships That's just you're just straight right like like I think there's this thing that you can do and I've heard people say this Before they're straight right they're straight, but they're trendy straight with trendy. I think there is legitimately this thing that is like Somewhat tied to politics and somewhat time to be open-minded where people will say to you look I don't care what they are all whoever I fall in love with I fall in love with and consider that to be bisexual They just always happen to fall in love with someone of the opposite sex I mean that's always just been straight, you know, I mean we're changing these definitions all the time It's hard to track these numbers, but it's a fascinating thing to watch in that like You know What is the what is causing that it is a dramatic change We're talking four five and six times as many people that are young are doing these things and And I don't think it's a coincidence that they've grown up in the most accepting era of these things Say if they're good the bad you can you can toss that around all night But like the idea that this is just some like you wake up when you're zero years old and you are this thing forever Is you know at times probably false? Yeah, right? Some people Decided to go different ways with it over time So it's a tough discussion because you know, it's the type of thing they get you thrown off social media luckily I'm saying it on your show, so I don't care what happens Let's not forget was it what five years ago the AMA maybe it was ten years ago I don't think it was even ten years ago the AMA said that trans Genderism was a mental disorder American music awards. Yes. Why would yes? I don't know what they were doing in it. That's a weird segment I didn't see that weird. Yeah, it's really weird. It's really strange I mean it is like what business is it? Music Association, I don't know I don't know it's weird No, but but now but now they've erased that yes And it says if yes, and I believe if I remember correctly do you remember how long it's been? Because I think it was five years ago. I think it was five years ago. You American Association said it was a mental disorder now all of a sudden You're perfectly healthy now you have the mental disorder if you don't accept that to be the reality. Yeah Yeah, I mean we talked to Ryan Anderson from Heritage Foundation among other places and he wrote a book in 2018 that was called when Harry turned into Sally and It was about Transgenderism and just the science on it and like you know obviously he's a conservative So it kind of comes off as like, you know, this probably isn't a good thing I mean the science, you know like look this it's widely supported over time that what what people Believe that that are you know, we've talked to several doctors about this that you know the research basically shows that Trans people who are transgender who have who have gender issues or early in life If they don't have the transition they wind up usually being gay and if they if they do have the if they don't have the transition the Overwhelming majority of them are thankful. They didn't have the transition. Yeah, that's just you know, and these are just these are just numbers, you know Various studies have shown the same types of things So like you're legitimately taking the you're you're replacing the G and the L with the T And I I mean I just feel like It's one thing if you want to do that as an adult. You know, you can make your mind up again like I it's it's a very complicated situation There is some truth to that, but it's not complicated when you're a kid Kids would make terrible decisions all the time. My children would eat Skittles all day That's all they would eat with Skittles. That's not a healthy It's not a healthy way to eat and I'm not a healthy person either and I can even know that it's all Skittles all the time It's not a healthy way to eat that you need parents need to be there to be able to guide them Through especially life-changing decisions you make when you're young it's insanity and in a way rampol is giving Her an out here by saying like here's the lowest hurdle to clear kid young kid Doesn't tell their parents about it. Can they do it? Oh, I'll come to your office and I'll talk to you about it later I mean, I I don't know how you even how can you even have a conversation with somebody who believes that it's it's it's so Crazily over the line that I think you'd pull that question and you'd find 95 percent of Americans would be like, okay, wait a minute That's too far. Yeah. All right. We've got more to come first. We want to thank our sponsor built bar So, um, which I think pat and I can speak about Stu is like this vegetarian thing that he has going on He doesn't know the deliciousness, but I bet you hear it from your wife a lot I will say that there no one at this table spent more on built bar In fact, no one in this audience or no one in this country Than my household so I can say a lot about it. There's about 14,000 of them in my fridge at all times Yeah, my wife has a mural of her at the location of bill bar pretty hot so much our family likes bill bar It's pretty awesome. So yeah, no, I mean it's it is amazing. She's almost like, oh, I wish you could try this because you know, I don't there's You know, I don't eat gelatin, which is in there, but like it's uh, you know, it is one of those things where like all these flavors come out I'm like gosh.

I'm telling you you're not going to want to miss out on this It is built bar dot com use promo code news 20 back in a minute Guys We finally done it. Uh, we have solved Discrimination hasbro the company that of course makes uh, mr. Potato head They have decided to give the toy a makeover. It is now going to be gender neutral and they're dropping the mister. They're just going to go with potato head The change will appear on boxes this year Thankfully, I mean we've got a lot of issues plaguing our society right now But I think none as important as making sure that no toys have genders Um, so I want to get your thoughts on this gentlemen, but just I just really quickly Um, I have a couple things that I would like to to say about this number one being I think it's really root of them that brian stelter obviously identifies as male I don't think it's right of them to just assume that he wants to be gender neutral Now I just think that I mean like that's kind of going against the discrimination that they're saying that they're solving Uh, number two missus potato head I think that might have something to say about this because as we know there was a mister And there was a missus Although I do think that they already were interchangeable. Yeah, okay So I think that they that was already the solution and I don't want to know what happens in their bedroom But they had the ability to interchange that now all of a sudden Mrs. Potato head is left like in the wind I guess Um, and also the fact that it's a fucking potato It's not even actually potato with some toy about a potato Technically, I mean it's not even that I get all that out right. Thank god. I do think that you did nail that one now That's uh, you know, look it was I was not even a real potato, which makes me very upset about it Your problem is that you can't it's not edible. You can't you can't eat it. I've tried You cannot eat mister missus or just potato head you can't do it you'll joke Uh, look I mean I I just like I it's it's an I'm joking sort of but like oh it's completely ridiculous Right our kids are not going to be able to play with any toys anymore. That's not just like well Is this is this a girl or is this a boy? Well, we we can't really say I know it's stupid Look, I mean and of course they're gonna still have I would assume the attachments that make them look like a boy Or a girl like this just seems like the hasbro wants to save on printing packages Like I'm just gonna give one potato you can make it a man or a woman however you want right like I Um, it's pretty silly. I will say that there are other priorities though It's not I mean I know you're kind of joking by saying that like, you know making sure potatoes have no genders is not really the top Issue the top issue is taking all black people off of packaging. That should be we've got cream of wheat. We've got enchamaima We've got uncle ben. I want no african-americans on packaging. I think that's the top Goal of our country If not, I mean, I know the jeep we got to get the names off jeep Cherokee. We got to get the check the off the car Yes, I do think that what we should do is just name all of our products after boring white people So you have like the jeep stew. I mean the chevy pat Right and uh, you're a little too. You've got a little bit too much flavor to be used here too spicy. You're too spicy You're a little too spicy. Sarah though will work. I mean Sarah seems like a white name Doesn't yes, you know, I know I have my passing. Yeah, you're white you're a white passing poc So maybe maybe maybe but I mean this is just it's absolutely ridiculous when though Will we get barber bush off the Quaker oats package? I know what's that when will that happen? Will that be soon or I mean are you I mean I don't think that's Okay, so this goes along with another story right now Uh a proposed california bill would assess a thousand dollar fines to retailers who don't create a gender neutral space in their toy sections So in their toys and apparel sections, they have to have a gender neutral section I mean they're literally talking about finding businesses for not going along with this nonsense And I just can't freaking do it anymore there. I caught myself I can't do it anymore. They already have to believe it out. You might as well just flood them fly now. I mean this might as well just go Yeah, I mean I it's so hard I think like the thing I keep falling back on and I don't know maybe I don't care about this nation I don't care about what's going on here. But like I don't have enough energy To care about all of these things like I legitimately But you care that your kids are growing up in a society where they are trying to do all of these things and your son is Is supposed to feel just feel bad that he's a man. Also, he's white. So he's got those two things against him I mean it's it's insane. Yeah, I think what I'm saying I'm looking at it from their perspective for a minute though Right like can you imagine if every day you woke up and looked around the toy aisle for something you might find offensive? If you looked around where pancakes and rice are sold to see what character is Is on the front to see if you should be offended that day And then to go on social media and post and post and post from my letters and like you've accomplished Nothing like the fact that ancemaima is not on that pancake box accomplishes Zilch well, I mean exception to the fact that african-americans can't buy their favorite pancakes anymore Right. I mean it erases black people if that's what you're trying to do. Yeah, and it does seem like that I mean it does seem like that's part of it doesn't it? I mean it really does seem like you know when when it when a When native americans come to you and say you know what 90 percent of us are not Offended by the washing ritzkins name we think it honors us and then you just take the name away like What have you done? Yeah, you're you are white-splaining essentially like when african-americans or native americans or whoever should be offended And that should be what people are offended about yeah, but apparently apparently not Then in california Was it california where they're they're going to find stores for separating toys in boys and girls sections You're gonna find a store If they put toys in different sections $1,000 are you I mean the insanity is just so out of control If you could play it in toy currency, I'd be okay with it Where would be like the line because I mean if you're a retail store you've got people shopping in and out of the aisles what if someone has a Toy and takes it to a different aisle and leaves it there We kept doing rest of them. Then you get fine. They kept doing rest of them But then does the store then have to pay that fine? I mean, how is this even policed? Enforcing this and this is all being taught in our schools and to our kids You know you mentioned the we were talking about Rachel Levine and the whole transgender thing This is all being taught in the schools kids can go and get this stuff done on our own And I will say this that just to expand on on on all of our previous conversations many over many of these years I keep coming back to this it's like we sit here and we have these conversations about how Inane this is and how poisonous it is so much of it And the fact that it's being taught directly to our kids at school And then we will go on the next break and say open up the schools And it's like well, maybe we should get the clothes the schools closed And we should send the kids to private school or any other place Maybe under a bridge to be taught by by by homeless vagrants Instead of these people because what they're doing to our kids is really traumatic. Okay. Yes, however Yes, I understand as long as they're taking my tax money. Yes, open up the damn schools Yeah, oh totally. I mean look they should be open. It's it's a separate argument But I think that yes, like I I agree conservatives I think are missing a great opportunity here with these schools being closed and with people being so frustrated about them being closed to say hey There are better options because not only are you pissed off that your school's not open And your kids are with you because they have to stay home and have nowhere to go But in addition to that when they go to the school they're going to teach them poison Yeah, so I mean we really need to like make up I think a bigger issue about Trying to figure out ways even for people who can't afford it To be able to take their kids out of these schools and learn from saying people occasionally. Yes. Yeah home school your children I did I'm like really really busy and I still find time Uh, you got to find the right curriculum. I can promise you it is out there.

I mean, it's good that the democrats aren't playing games aren't playing political games with you know americans paychecks Yeah, no, that's good. Definitely not. I mean look she she of course does really want this But she will also fall in line if she is needed For a bill that's going to spend 1.9 trillion dollars on other various wishlist items for democrats Yeah, you know the $15 minimum wage. I don't even think honestly it can be done this way I don't think it makes sense. I mean we haven't had it that do rules matter now I don't know there's the senate parlamentarian who's going to give this ruling we haven't I don't think it's come down yet has it I like if it came down today. I missed it, but they're going to say hey Yes, you can put a minimum wage double through reconciliation. I don't think that is within the rules Now you're right they could change the rules and they can say well, you know what now you can Now they just have to get the votes to do that. They need Manchin and cinema But again when when needed? All of these guys will come around all of them will come around when needed now. I think there's a chance that like something where You know joe Manchin might say I'll I'm only going to do 1250 an hour like you'll get you I wouldn't be surprised to see something like what was it? Romney and someone else want to do $10 an hour. They want to do 10. I think was it 7 and 25 now So they want to raise it up to 10. I mean look there's overwhelming support in the population for these bills To raise them in wage. It's not it's not a close. It's among the least popular thing us three belief You know you're talking if you want to say about like to eight nine dollars I mean you're talking in the 80s and 90 type of approval over these things It's like a conservative Libertarian economic point that we are 100 percent right on but no one agrees with So you're sorry They're gonna get that through They can get that through during another bill 15 bucks. That was really stretching it. I don't think about it Okay, so because I heard a report what was it yesterday or the day before That we talked about on the program that joe biden had even said the minimum wage deal is dead So you think he just meant if it's $15. I think the $15 thing is such a stretch And I think they know it's a stretch. I think it's the type of thing they know they're loose I don't think they can do it the way they're trying to do it So because the 50 votes think is very specific with the types of rules They can again change the rules they can go after and get rid of the filibuster There are things that they can do but they're extreme and um, I would not put it past democrats to put them through in this fashion But it's a it's a pretty big step now if they jam in a $12 minimum wage into a bill that they they want to get passed later on That's very popular like, you know, uh military support bill, right? Like that's the type of way I think they could get something like that done. I don't think rule wise they can get it done this way Um, and I think you probably will get cinema and mansion saying look we said we don't support $15 an hour That's why we're only supporting 1485 That's the type of thing or it'll be phased in over a longer period They'll play their games, but I think you know when it comes down to it the democrats will get their 50 votes for this thing um and and Joe Biden knows it everybody knows it. So why would they bend? Why would they bend to to ramenese $10 plan or a $12 plan? They don't need to I just don't think they can do it this way Yeah pat i'm going the other direction if 15 is good wasn't $50 an hour better It is one on a hundred dollars make everyone really rich. Yes. Yeah, why not a million dollars an hour Let's just make everybody millionaires. Yeah every hour That's true right. She said like I would like I would have said I would 27 million people right This would support all for every 30 million. This supports everybody. Yeah, really really well. Why don't kids get it right? They should just give it to them. They should so that they can then afford their sex change operation. Yes, right? Which they should get for free. Yes I saw Chris I saw Chris Hayes tweet out something along the lines of like well, there is there is absolutely no compelling substantive argument against raising the minimum wage It's just asinine right it's like just You agree with it doesn't mean that there's no substantive argument Of course there's a substantive argument against it. It's going to hurt small businesses Dramatically yeah and not to mention it's going to hurt the minorities and the the poorest of the people that they that they Claim that they want to help big because they're going to get forced out of a job and look The minimum wage is just that it's a minimum wage for when you're just getting into the workforce That's what it's designed for it's not designed to support a family of 12 I mean nobody he says you know what i'm going to retire on that 12 dollars an hour I'm going to retire and then i'm going to make well when i'm retiring though I'll probably only make 10 dollars an hour, but i'm going to retire on this that's not what it's for It's for teenagers who have no skills who are working at mcdonald's Get into the workforce and you make a minimum wage just to get you You know into the workforce and understand how it all flows and how it works Gets a few dollars in your pocket so you can put gas in your car and go cruise the drag or whatever These wacky kids do these days. That's what they did. That's what they did. The cruise the drag um And so you know it's but it's been completely flipped around like it's supposed to support a family of Six or 10 well because well because they get to use the term livable wage and make it It's not supposed to be a livable wage Right, well, but i'm like what does livable wage even mean can someone please define it for me What is livable wage because something that someone can live on in new york is a lot different than something someone big Don't even in texas you're gonna need like 50 bucks an hour in new york Right 15 is not a livable wage you could but like it's like okay is this living with a roommate Is this living without having children before you're ready? Is this living without a really nice car and taking the bus? I mean there are a lot of things in here nuances in here that we're not even discussing because you think you have a right to just say I just need a livable wage so you have to pay me whatever the hell i want It's one of those dumb things they make up that can mean anything right? I mean we all know 100 of people making minimum wage are living So they've somehow made it livable. I mean they may not like that life I mean it's supposed to chip in it's a way you or you You learn money early on get experience build your career as time of soul I believe it was said you know the the actual minimum wage is zero When when the minimum wage gets raised to 15 dollars those people get zero dollars per hour and they stay at home And they're on twitch all day. Yeah, right like so what do you do with that? I mean like if you want a society that is dependent on government for their entire lives a group of young people who grow up with no No ability to learn a trade to actually have a work ethic and build that work ethic Then you're a democrat and you want this to go on right? You know, we know it will cost millions of jobs It may help some people in certain circumstances But the amount of people who are trying we've gone through these numbers before the amount of people who are on minimum wage Who are trying to support a family to make it a livable wage? It's such a small amount you basically round it to zero. It's almost no one almost no one is in this situation Most of the people are either very young or you know, maybe in retirement just trying to do something It's a very small percentage of people who are in prime earning age who are working to support a household on minimum wage You're right pet not designed for that. You know, look I would be of the opinion to get rid of the minimum wage entirely So, you know, that's just it's just not a sensible thing. It doesn't help people it hurts But again, there's only so much pushing you can do on this We can win this argument in our think tank worlds in our talk show worlds But when you have a policy that's 85 88 percent approval, they're just going to do it I mean, they're going to find a way to do this. I don't know if it'll get to 15 But they're going to find a way to raise it. Yeah, all right We've got the latest on Andrew Cuomo coming up next Second minute Andrew Cuomo is uh Surprisingly shocking land. Oh sit down for this one denying allegations this week that he has used his position uh to be little and bully critics and opponents Sexually harass and aid and suggest she play strip poker now. Of course we brought you the story Yesterday the allegations from uh, Lindsey Boillan who is a former Cuomo aid who I think it was last December she came out and she said he sexually harassed me. He basically he's a slimy, you know sleazeball But didn't really go into the details now she has And uh, I for one am shocked that he is denying it and also shocked to hear that Multiple women on the left including kiersten jilla brand who was very outspoken of women's rights and uh, you know blasted al frankin himself All of a sudden have nothing to say not responding to comments asking them how they feel No believe all women coming from jilla brand on this one. I'm I'm shocked. I'm shocked Maybe she didn't get the call another democratic luminary that spoke out very much this way and advocated for individual immediate and uh independent investigations was someone you might know Andrew Cuomo Uh, yeah, he also was there's another guy who has that name? No, it's the same person Yeah, you just say when it was someone else it was all we need independent investigations immediately now it's as he's supposed to deny it Um, you know his denial was amazing too. I don't know if you happen to see it But um, I don't have the exact phrasing in front of me But basically he he did one thing he did was take something she didn't say in her piece like she she described the Strip poker Situation and said like I we know one person was sitting in front of me one person was behind me and she names who they are And he responds in his um, you know his big denial to get him out of this Uh, we have the flight flight manifested at no point was she on a flight with just those two people It's like well at no point did she say she was on a flight with just those two people And then and then he says and you can you can attribute this Statement to any one of these four people and they list four people and then just says we never heard the We never heard that conversation take place. It's like well did they say that or who? Why are you attributing it to four people? Did they say it in unison? Was it a song? Do they sing it all together? Was there like are you just writing words and jamming it into these in these people's mouths because they're subservient to you Right like you wanted lindsey boila and to be and that's why of course and your crumbo Is awful? Uh, oh my god, that that's what the mug says. That's exactly what it says. Sarah. Wow And it is uh despicable and I will say this as well We have not heard word one from his brother quish chris quomo or anyone on cnn well That's because there's a band on uh chris having andrew on the show with him so we wanted to he'd love to have them on I think right now. Yeah, there was a band and then they cleared it and then they Want to get a difficult right really needed to do the you know interview with the giant cotton swab Oh, that was right. That would have been really funny. That wall was really it was hard hitting journalism I've always found that comedy is much funnier when thousands of people are dying in nursing homes It's just right it's just a rule of comedy right uh, so yeah, no no no commentary from quomo Um, which is you know, we've got Andrew quomo is awful dot com and that's why of course also chris quomo is worse Dot com Okay dot com so you can get either of these there But they are both true statements very and you might say wait wait I don't know maybe chris quomo isn't worse. He hasn't killed thousands of people nursing homes But he's worse than almost anything so it works in every even if you don't think he's worse at Andrew quomo If you just hold it up. Uh, it really it stands on its own. It really does almost everything These are like good his and hers cups. Yeah, or his and his let me make one that says don lemon is worse or Uh, that's great. That's up there now too That's amazing. Uh, but it is it is hard to pick though cat which well, I want to know If we've gotten so picky now where a governor of one of the most popular states in this country It can't ask a few employees to play strip poker on a flight Where we are now Uh, no, I don't think so. I We gotten This picky now where that is a bad thing. Yeah, and we should point out it wasn't just that it was also touching the leg He's on the lid No, I know I did say what I read yesterday There was one that I gave him a pass on which was sending flowers on valentine's day to like multiple female aid workers. Yeah, I was like, okay, that's not the same terrible that you could say like that was just nice Her case on that was All of his direct underlings that were women got flowers And one person outside of the direct underlings which was her got flowers on another floor the only woman on the floor who got them So I mean if the card said like hey, baby. Do you want to like go to bed later? The email said that The emails didn't they say he listed one of his former girlfriends and said that she looked like his former girlfriend except her You know prettier sister And and he told again through multiple layers of management. This is not Cuomo saying directly to her She's saying to Lindsay Boylan's Supervisor who then's communicating hey, you look like my hot girlfriend's a hotter sister and also You know that I have a crush on you So again like none of this was we should be clear Number one even though Andrew Cuomo is among the worst people on the planet. He is still innocent until proven guilty And number two None of this was Harvey Weinstein level stuff. I mean it was it was bad and and really creepy But it was not and as much as I legitimately can't stand Andrew Cuomo I legitimately think he's responsible for thousands of people being dead that being said he still deserves all the protections That everybody else Due process I I still believe in due process I will be consistent even with the worst human beings on earth. I will still say that that's true By the way, Andrew Cuomo is awful dot com back in a minute Okay Available now Hey, don't forget to go to apple podcast wherever you get your audio podcasts subscribe rate and review the podcast it helps more people Find the news and why it matters you also might see your review read live on air We've got one from gambit 120 who says best news podcast.
