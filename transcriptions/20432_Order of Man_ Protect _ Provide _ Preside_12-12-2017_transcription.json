    "text": " Every time I bring up a conversation about style as it relates to masculinity I met with hesitation because quote unquote real men don't care about what they wear. While that sounds good to say it just isn't true. If it were we'd all walk around naked or in a baggy t-shirt and sweat pants everywhere we go. Besides, your style is a powerful tool in building influence, gaining confidence and creating opportunities for yourself. My guest today is my good friend Tanner Guzzie with masculine style. I have learned more from him about what I wear, what it says about me, and how it's perceived by others in the last couple years than I have the rest of my life. And while it's hard to quantify the results dressing well produces there's no doubt there's a connection between what I look like and my income confidence and influence. You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears. And boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down you get back up one more time every time you are not easily deterred or defeated rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day and after all is said and done you can call yourself a man. Then what is going on today? My name is Ryan Micler and I am the host and the founder of this podcast the Order of Man. Whether you are new to the show or you've been around for years you are listening to the show about becoming a better man. I know I'm biased but when I set out on this journey to become a better man almost three years ago I would have never imagined that would have grown to what it is today and it's a testament to the fact that we as men want a place that hasn't been impacted by the rampant dismissal of men that we see perpetuated by much of society today. The fact is that the world is starving. Starving for real men who step up as protectors and providers and leaders in their family, their businesses, their communities, every area of life. And that is what we are all about here. So each week we interview the world's most successful men on the home front, the business front, the front lines, wherever that we are expected to show up and we extract their lessons, insights and all of the information so you and I can replicate their results. Now before I get into the meat of today's show I do want to let you know that we still have some tickets available for our meetup. This is going to be held January 26th and 27th 2018. It's coming up quickly. That's going to be held in Nashville in addition to the keynotes and the brotherhood and the camaraderie that comes with that. This is also a book launch party and everyone who tends will get a signed copy of my new book which is going to be released February 1st. So do not wait to get your tickets. We are going to sell this thing out. You can head to orderman.com slash Nashville again order of man dot com slash Nashville. Gentlemen, my guest today again is my friend Tanner Guzzi. Tanner and I met years ago. In fact, he was the second guest that I ever had on this show. I used to balk at the idea of dressing well because I thought it was more about what's inside a man than what he's wearing. And while of course that's true and there's validity to that, our style says a lot about who we are. Tanner is a deep thinker which I certainly appreciate and he goes well beyond how to wear a suit and what shoes go best with what pants he delves deep into the why and the psychology of what we wear and how it produces results in our lives. And that's what we're all about here. Producing results. And if I can take just one thing about what I wear and improve that and it's going to help me in my life, you can bet I'm going to do it. Tanner's going to show us how. Tanner, what is up man? Glad you're back on the show. Dude, Ryan, so good to be back on here with you. I was actually looking at this last night because I knew we were going to have this conversation. Do you know what number episode that you were first on? Because this is a repeat visit for you. Right. Was I number two? I think you were number three number three. Yeah. Yeah, that's crazy. It is crazy. It's been almost two and a half years since we had a follow up conversation now. Well, and obviously all of your success is attributable to that one conversation that you and I had in episode three. So without that, I just don't think we would be where we are today. Well, we've obviously built a friendship over the past couple of years or so, almost three years now. And I've got to tell you, I've learned more about you or from you, I guess I should say about style and how to incorporate this in your life than I've ever learned in my entire life about what it says about the things that we wear. So I'm really interested and excited to have this conversation. I appreciate it. And I, yeah, I'm just, I'm excited to talk about this with you, your insights on the relationships between what it is that makes men men, it's going to be fun to talk about how style plugs into all that. Well, it's really interesting because when you talk about men being men, I think the last thing on a lot of men's mind and more specifically probably our audience's mind is this notion of dressing better. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, most guys, that would be within the very bottom tier of how you would define a man who's either a good man or being good at being a man is what he wears. Why do you think that's the case? Because I think about this, even if I were to rewind, you know, five years or so ago, when I think about dressing better, I'm looking at a picture of you on your Skype profile right now and you've got the suit and the tie and you look the part, but that's not necessarily what it means to dress better. Although I think a lot of men probably think that's what it means. Yeah. And I think that's one of the big reasons why there's this disconnect. I think part of it is that we get into this idea of a suit and a tie is the only way to dress well, or it's the only way to have style. Therefore, if I don't fit within that particular mold, then style is irrelevant. And there are plenty of guys who are masculine men who don't fit into the suit mold. Therefore, there's no causal relationship or even a correlation between the two. So it shouldn't matter. Where did that come from then? Because there's no denying the fact that men believe that. Where did that notion come from? I would argue that that's attributed to two things. The first one was the idea of the cultural revolution that happened with the baby boomer generation, because prior to that, the majority of men within Western civilization, and especially within the United States, whether you were a blue collar worker or white collar, or you were a movie star or a politician or anything else, you wore suits. It was just a uniform of men is that they wore suits. And yes, they would be made of different materials or they would be cut differently based on the decades or styles or the environments in which you worked or things like that. But there was a largely homogenous uniform. And then when this cultural revolution amongst the baby boomer started to happen, and they rejected everything that had to do with traditionalism. Obviously, the uniform of traditionalism was one of the first things that went out the door. Now, you couple that with everything that's happened within the United States and Western culture since then, where we're no longer a homogenous culture. But we really are so diverse. And there's so many different ways that value is measured and status is measured and all these different things about how you fit in with the world are determined. And so even if it wasn't this rejection of suiting as far as we don't like tradition, but just this idea of that's not appropriate in so many different cultures, or it's not how status or achievement or mastery or anything else is actually expressed anymore. You look at the tech industry, if you live in the San Francisco Bay Area, a suit does not signal that you're successful. It's actually kind of the anti uniform for the guys who are successful there. And so you've got the overarching idea of rebellion plus the diversification of different societies and all of a sudden the suit doesn't mean what it used to. So there's no reason to think of it as the standard uniform of masculinity. How do these trends get established? Because you're talking about Silicon Valley and the trend is no longer the suit and the fact that we've gone away when it comes to baby boomers from that traditional suit and tie type look, how do these trends get established? Because I've seen some people wear some wild stuff that just doesn't stick and I've seen other things like come into fashion and out of fashion into style out of style. How does it actually stick? So this is one of the things that actually cover in the book that I think is really interesting to think about because a lot of times, especially when you talk to guys who are into style and they're trying to kind of start new trends or they're following new trends, they will give this idea that as long as you're confident, you can wear whatever you want. And that's very kind of common within the style community. But it doesn't work like that because you can confidently show up to work one day at a bank wearing a pink gorilla suit. And it doesn't matter how confident you are, it's going to have very big negative effects on your ability to do your job to be taken seriously by your coworkers, your clients, even your own self perception. Confidence is irrelevant when it comes to that regard. And so when it comes to trends and who they're started by and how they take on, what it really is, is it's a balance of a man's status within a particular culture or subculture and how he's trying to distinguish himself. And so it's men who are of high status, who will use their appearance as a way to separate themselves from everybody else who's beneath them. And then the people who are beneath them will start to adapt to recognize that all these guys are dressing differently, I want to be like these guys who are higher up. So I will dress like they do. And then you eventually have the lagers on who at first don't care at all, but then they finally start to recognize it. And then at this point, everybody's dressing the same way. So then the top status guys who now have to distinguish themselves another way will subconsciously start a new trend or start dressing in a way that's different as a way to separate themselves from everybody else below them. And they do it, I'm sure in a set of parameters, right? Because you talk about the pink gorilla suit, for example, there's no way that I'm going to go out in front of my audience wearing a pink gorilla suit, but I might do something else. And I can't even think of what that is right off hand. Well, the beard, I mean, the beard's a great example. Yeah, it's perfect example. Where I do it within a expected set of parameters, and yet it's different enough that it is distinguishing. Right, because if you think about it this way, let's take the beard, for example, your beard is something that is very unique and it's part of how you identify yourself. But it's also not so out there that other men who subscribe to Order of Man who are part of the Iron Council or anything else. It's not so unique that if they were to grow out of beard like yours, then they would be very obvious Ryan McQuar copycats. Sure. Whereas if you were somebody who was more interested in being an iconoclast as opposed to a leader, the two references I used for this in the book are Conor McGregor and Dennis Rodman. These guys have no interest in having people actually follow them, but they are relatively high status. Obviously, Conor McGregor is about as high status as it gets in the UFC right now. And so he's dressing in a way that's so different that if people were to try and emulate his style, it would actually be a signal of their low status because it shows that they're directly copying him as opposed to having any plausible deniability where it's like, oh, no, he's got a beard. I've got a beard. We're beard buddies. We're cool like that. It just happens to be the case, right? Exactly. It's very intentional about that. But it's interesting. One of those things that we don't talk about it, it's totally gouged to talk about this directly and overtly. It's something that has to be navigated subtly and subconsciously and there needs to be plausible deniability. And so that's where you get guys who will throw bombs and it's like, okay, if you're going to dress like me, it's very obvious that you're copying me and therefore acknowledging that I'm higher status than you are. What is the reasoning behind that? Because I see what, in your examples, Dennis Rodman, Conor McGregor, and I think you guys look absolutely ridiculous and there's no practicality to what you're wearing, but that just might be my personality too. Right. And really, if you think about it, it's this idea of are they trying to be leaders or are they trying to be rebels and iconoclasts that totally separate themselves from everybody else? Because if your goal is to piss off everybody else around you and make sure that you are recognized as the one outlier, then there's huge benefits to dressing in a way that's a complete outlier. But in order to have that actually work to your advantage, you have to have the status or the skill set or the mastery or anything else to actually back up the attention that you're getting. Because some brand new guy to the NBA or to the UFC who can't actually fight or play ball, who dresses like that, then he's just called out as a poser. But these guys who are good enough that they can distinguish themselves, then it actually works to their advantage. And I think also there's the intentionality and a thought process about it. I mean, if you look at what we're trying to do, Order of Man, you hear Order, you think society, Brotherhood organization, which is inclusive, right? So my goal is not to alienate or put myself above or anywhere else, but where the tribe is. And so I feel like as the leader, I guess you'd say of the organization, like I still want to be relatable to everybody else. 100%. If you were to go back to just doing financial planning, which is what you were doing before Order of Man, and you were to have the long beard where you were within your practice and where you were within the overall financial planning, tribe or community, it's something like all of a sudden I can show up to a financial planning practice in Des Moines. And these guys have long, right? And nuclear beards, right? Because you weren't high status within that particular tribe or organization. But you can very much do that as the leader of the Order of Man subculture and have men start to identify with that and start to adopt similar aesthetics because you've established yourself as a leader and your aesthetic is not so far removed from what they would associate with the Order of Man that they will be accused of being flagrant copycats by embracing what your style is. Well, let me give you the alternative to this because I actually had four appointments yesterday, specifically for my financial planning practice, which is few and far between. I just don't do that many appointments now that I've been so busy with Order of Man and the Iron Council. And I wore to those meetings exactly what I would wear on a day to day basis. I had my jeans on, I had a flannel shirt on, I had my red wing boots on, of course, my beard and everything else. And yet I walked into the meeting with a sense of confidence that I don't think I possessed three years ago. I wouldn't even bore that to a meeting, but you know what? It was kind of like the I don't care. This is who I am. And I think that confidence exude in the actual meeting, although it wasn't expected as a traditional financial advisor uniform, if you will. 100%. And I think that that actually helps solidify the point rather than providing any contrast to it because the idea of confidence and authenticity has to be partnered up with these other factors that are coming into your style because you can completely 100% embrace the uniform of a given tribe if you belong to it. But if you feel like if it actually negatively affects or impacts your own internal presence, the way that you view yourself, the way that you fit in, then that can largely negate a lot of the benefits that come from actually dressing in a way that you fit in. And so again, you dressing the way that you do isn't impacting the overall aesthetic of the financial planning community at large, but it does have a huge positive impact on your ability to be professional and successful with your clients because it's authenticity partnered up with not being so out of the norm, again, not wearing the pink gorilla suit that you're completely typecasting yourself as this weirdo. You know, I think it's really interesting too, because the other thing that I think it has the opportunity to do is create some sort of mystery or attraction or at least curiosity, like who is this bearded financial advisor and why does he think that he can dress like that when everybody else dresses differently, which I think is a good thing. 100%. I love that you brought that up. This is actually something I was talking about with my wife of all people this morning. And it's the idea that we know what one-dimensional characters on TV shows and movies look like. And so many men in the world, the way that we dress is that we tell this story of being a one-dimensional character. I'm into guns and self-defense, and so I dress like I'm tactical or I'm into books and I'm into video games and comics and so I dress like a nerd this way or anything else. And we just tell these one-dimensional stories, but interesting characters in television or any stories or interesting men in real life, we have multiple dimensions to us. You may be somebody who's physically capable and intellectually capable and financially capable and you have all these different things. And if you can create an aesthetic that actually tells that full story, that's where a good style comes from. And I think there's also a level of duality. You know, I think about Jocko Willink, for example, who is the warrior archetype. He dresses the part, he looks the part, his Instagram and Twitter messages and posts are the part. And yet he's also somebody who has a degree in English and is very well versed in history and knowledge and intellect in general. Exactly, exactly. Because you take those expectations of the dumb brute or the smart weakling and he says, no, I'm screw that, I'm going to be all of it. And he combines it in a way that works. Interesting. So let's talk about one of the things you talked about is confidence. And so my question is, where does confidence come from? Is it the ability to pull something like this off? Or is the way that we look a manifestation of the internal confidence we already have? So confidence comes from accomplishing difficult things. You know, obviously that's not related to style directly. But I think any confidence that a man attains is because you put yourself outside of your comfort zone, you conquer whatever it is that you're trying to conquer. And therefore you recognize that you're more capable than you initially thought you were, right? Sure. Yeah. No, this makes total sense. I mean, we talk about this all the time is just do hard things. If you're not confident, just do the thing that you're confident about. But I guess the reason that I asked that question is because we've all heard the term fake it till you make it. Right. Does that even work? Absolutely. So that's where this idea comes in. And it's fun because I was listening to our last conversation in preparation for this just to make sure that we don't, you know, go back and hit on the same points or anything else. And it was fun to realize that a lot of what you and I had talked about in that first conversation has morphed into things that I'm better able to articulate now three years later. And one of the things that we did discuss was this idea of balancing authenticity with ambition. And that's where this idea of faking it until you make it really can come in. Because you want to dress in a way that puts you a little bit out of your comfort zone. It puts you a little bit higher status than what you actually are. It puts you in this position where you actually have to change your behavior in order to accurately match up with what the story is that you're telling with your clothing and your appearance. And then you actually change your behavior to match the story that you're telling with your clothing and your appearance. Now, if you go too far away from that and you can't actually deliver what it is you're promising, that's where the dissonance comes in. That's why there's a problem. But if you can give yourself a little bit of a push by dressing in a way where you and the people around you have higher expectations of yourself, that's where faking it till you make it really can come in. It's interesting that I actually had, and we may have talked about this in our first conversation, I know I've told somebody else about this, I had a baseball coach who every single year we would get the best uniforms, the brand new uniforms, and we'd all have to buy him as opposed to other schools that just provided him. And his philosophy and theory, and he always said this is, if you look good, you play good. And I believe there was an element of truth to that. We had the newest uniforms, the nicest uniforms. We always were the best dressed and looking team on the field. And I think our level of play was elevated to some degree because of that approach. Right. And then there's nothing to do with what anybody else thinks of you. It's how it affects your own perception of yourself and not only what you're capable of, but what you're expected to do as a result of putting different clothes on your body. Let's talk about the term aesthetics because this is a term that I know I've heard you say before and a lot of people in the style industry, if you will, will throw that word around. I'm a little weary of the word itself just because I believe that this goes so much deeper than the way that we look and our appearance. And it's not all about how we look. I know there's a lot of guys who are listening to this now that are probably rolling their eyes thinking, it doesn't really matter what you look like. Being a man is way more than just how you look. So help me understand where this aesthetic idea actually comes from and is it valuable in the conversation of being a better man. Yeah. Well, and first of all, I would 100% agree with our proverbial guys who are rolling their eyes and saying that because one thing that I will never argue is that the way a man looks is the most important or even that it's a primary thing that we should be concerned about because it's not. The value of a man is created by much more than how we look, but it can be measured and communicated by how we look. And that's something that is important not only to ourselves, but also to those around us. And I think one of the things that does make aesthetics so important is the understanding, and this is where a lot of the disconnect comes from, because if you think about fashion or if you think about following trends or even kind of what we were talking about earlier as far as recognizing where things are going within your tribe and trying to signal high status and all that stuff, the thing that can be frustrating about that for a lot of men is that it's all very external. It's all very much other men determining value. And therefore, I have to adapt in order to be able to follow it. And we don't want to do that if we don't have to do that. Whereas true style, and that's where we're talking about this idea of balancing authenticity with aspiration and being able to tell a story that's multi-dimensional, really good style comes from knowing who you are and what your value is internally, and then discovering a way to be able to express that externally. And not only so that other people can see that and make an accurate assessment of who you are and what you bring to the table, but also so that you can see that and have that reinforced in your head every time you look in the mirror, every time you catch a reflection in an office building, every time you see a photo of yourself, if you see a guy who's got his act together, who lives deliberately, who's able to make the world what he wants it to be, or at least make his world what he wants it to be, as opposed to somebody who's passive or is a slob or whose main priority is getting through life in a way that's as comfortable as possible, those are two very different stories that you're telling yourself. And aesthetics has a huge impact on how we perceive ourselves and therefore what we do with ourselves. And I think everybody wants to look good. I don't think there's anybody else. And it's really funny, there's this trend, you know, it's like, I don't care what I look like, and this doesn't mean who I am. But what's really interesting is I think the majority of guys who would even say something like that, just by the notion of them saying that are actually probably trying to illustrate or communicate that they don't care, which means that they're more intentional about the way they look than they portray to be. Yeah, it's antipathy. And antipathy requires more emotional investment than true indifference does. You know, love and hate are not opposites of each other. Love and hate are actually very close to each other. It's when you don't care about something at all. You know, that's the opposite of loving something. And most guys, if they would say, I don't care what I look like, it's like, okay, well, then put on a dress or put on the pink gorilla suit or do something that's totally out there and tell me that you don't feel uncomfortable dressing that way. And obviously they will. Right. The guys who truly don't care, they would happily wear that just as happily as they would wear a suit or anything else. And those kind of men are very few and far between. Or they would make their decisions based solely on what is the most comfortable, meaning they'd walk around naked or in boxers. All these exactly. Yeah. Yeah, this makes sense. Now, the title of your book is called the appearance of power. I'm really interested in this because when I hear that title appearance of power, it's almost like I'm trying to be validated by being powerful from some external source, like to appear powerful rather than to be powerful. Help me understand that. Yeah. And that was very intentionally a play on words because once again, I acknowledge that power does not come from appearance. You can look at con men who were very much not who they project themselves to be in one of the ways that they're so successful in getting their marks to believe them and invest in them is by dressing the parts. And you can have people who dress and look like they're great successful men and they were 100% or not. And you can have people who dress and look like they're bombs and they actually are very successful and very involved fathers and good husbands and all these other things. And so there's not a direct correlation, but we believe there is a direct correlation because it does happen so often that those two are actually interconnected. And so the title of the book came about from recognizing that if you start off with what your own power is, you start off by defining what you are as a man, how masculinity is defined by you and by the men and women who are important to you in your life by your tribes. And you recognize how that kind of power has been projected, then you can use that as a way to maximize your relationships with other people to maximize your own self perception and to increase the amount of success that you have in your life. And I think this is a huge component of influence as well. And I think every man who's listening to this, whether they want to dress well or not, probably to some degree believes in the notion of being influential in the lives of their family or community or employees or employers, whatever it may be. Yeah, 100%. Because I mean, unless you're truly like a hermit, most of us are tribal. We want to be around people who matter to us. And that doesn't mean that we want to care what everybody's opinion of us is. But we do want to be around people who matter to us and honor within that group of people, which is basically their opinion, mattering to me and my opinion, mattering to them. That's a normal thing. That's a good thing. And one of the ways that that's measured is through how we dress. I mean, you can take it to something as simple as if you go to your favorite college football team's game and you're wearing the colors of the rival team, you are being dishonorable and you're signaling that you don't actually belong to that tribe. And you're going to be ostracized by the tribe is 100%. I want to talk to you about our sponsor, HealthIQ. It is our job as men to protect our families. And I don't believe that that responsibility goes away when we die. That's why I want to talk with you about the life insurance that HealthIQ offers. Just because you purchase life insurance, though, for your family does not mean that you need to pay too much for it.

Gentlemen, if you want something different out of your life, you are going to have to do something different. I want to challenge you today to step outside of your comfort zone and do something you probably already know you should be doing anyways. And that is joining a band of brothers. Now you can do it alone and take a lot of time and energy and resources building that thing up or you can tap into what we've created inside of our exclusive brotherhood, the iron council. We've spent years developing and fine tuning and honing the strategies and the resources inside this brotherhood to produce maximum results in your relationships, your health, your bank account, your business, your life, just your life in general without a system for the way that you operate in your life and more specifically a new system, a new system you can expect to experience the same results you have always experienced. Our brotherhood, the iron council, will help you experience something new and give you the tools and the resources and the track to run on. If you are interested in learning more and joining us head to order of man.com slash iron council order of man.com slash iron council. I hope to see you inside. Now let's get back to my conversation with Tanner. What is the distinction between power and appeal? Because you talk about that and make that distinction in the book itself. And I'm really curious as to how you describe and explain this. So I think this is another thing that's really good as far as going back to one of the first questions of why do most men kind of shape at the idea of caring about their appearance. And that's because for most of us who are younger than the baby boom generation, the entirety of our existence has been that caring about the way that you look is for women and not caring about the way that you look is one of the ways that you can express your masculinity, right? Sure. I think that's probably a pretty modern thought. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Okay. So part of that is because we have this idea that the only way to care about the way that you look is to try to be more appealing. It's to be sexier, it's to be younger, it's to be trendier or more fashionable or more youthful. And all of those things are very, very good if you're a woman and you're trying to maximize your relationships with other people. But when it comes to being a man, youth is a liability overt trendiness and the instability that can be communicated through trendiness can be a liability in experience and all these other things, those are not core to masculine to be their counter to it. But if you can dress in a way that does communicate power or achieve status or respectability or self respect or longevity, then communicating that through your clothing, that's dressing in a way that's powerful rather than appealing. And that's a huge benefit for most men. So if I'm understanding you correctly, appearing to be powerful or actually being powerful is more of a masculine, generally speaking, more of a masculine trait versus being appealing, which would be more of a feminine trait. 100%. This does make sense because I see the value in being powerful. Men want to find other men. And biologically, we've evolved and been programmed to operate this way to be protectors, providers, and presiders. And the men who are powerful are those things, generally speaking. So I could see why men would want to be powerful as opposed to appeal to other people. It's really interesting because I see a lot of men who take more of the appeal approach. And this is what I would think of when I hear the term peacocking, for example, it's to appeal, interestingly enough, to other men, not necessarily to women. Yeah. Oh, yeah, 100%. Again, and that's another thing that's really kind of funny about how we are as men because a lot of times, and both men and women are guilty of this. A lot of times we think that we dress for the opposite sex. But really, what we do is we dress for the same sex because that's where jockeying for status and position and utility, validation and everything else comes from. And then that's reinforced by how attractive we are to the opposite sex. So you're saying the validation from the same sex is a higher priority than an attraction from the opposite sex? Yeah, and most guys don't want to admit that. Interesting. But I really think that that's the case. And I mean, you take that on a very distilled level. Okay, take the Jim rats, for an example. When you look at what the majority of women actually respond to when it comes to the build of a man, it's going to be something that's more along the lines of Brad Pitt in Troy or something like that. Ryan Nickler from Order of Man. That's obviously the static ideal right there. But then you get these guys in the gym who are going for Arnold, or they're going for as big and as built as they possibly can. And at some point, it becomes no longer that women are responding to it, but it's a way for them to measure and determine how masterful they are and how strong they are, which are things that are more validated by other men within their peer group than they are by the women within their peer group. Interesting. Well, and I also think too, if you have, again, these are just generalities, right? Of course, yeah. If you have a group of 200 men within an organization or a structure or a society or community or whatever it may be, if there's a handful of men that rise to the top through the validation, if you will, in lack of a better term from the other men, I think women probably also notice that and can see how the other men respect those five, and that makes them attractive. Right. Yep, absolutely. And that's why you can get these different subcultures where it may be something that to most of us, we just look at and go, those guys are weird. Like, I don't see the value in that. And that's why you can have very attractive women at Comic Con or magic the gathering tournaments or things like that. And they still latch onto the men within those subcultures who can demonstrate the highest status amongst the other men within those subcultures. Well, let's talk about how to do this. And I certainly don't want to come across as we're gaming the system because I think when you do try to game the way that you look, it comes across to what Jerry point earlier is disingenuous and inauthentic. And I think people can see right through that. What I might wear is going to be completely different than what you might wear. And if we try to switch roles, I think both of us would probably look fairly ridiculous. Agreed. Yeah. So how do we begin to come up with a strategy for articulating who we believe ourselves to be and what we want to be viewed and perceived as? So I love that you use the word strategy because really that's what it comes down to. When most men start to think about how they want to improve their style, they may look at, okay, well, I don't like the way that I look now. So I'm going to maybe start wearing suits or I'm going to go watch a YouTube video or I'm going to read a book or a blog or something else. And the problem with most of these approaches that they get is they get a lot of information, but most of the information is tactical. It's how to take a specific item or specific group of items and wear them in a way that they work well with each other. But those tactics may be totally inappropriate for a particular man in his situation in life and what he's trying to do. For example, somebody who is 19 and he's in college and he's trying to find a girlfriend should not be wearing the same clothes as a man who's 35 running his business and he's trying to find new clients and he's an attorney. Very different goals. And so the first thing that men really should do if they want to start improving their style and that what's so cool about this is it's not gaming the system, it's just taking a proactive as opposed to a reactive approach is if you figure out what your goals are, what it is that's missing in your life or that's just incomplete in your life that you believe that improving your appearance can help contribute to making those things better. And then from there, you break it down into these are my goals and here are some different strategies and actually outline six different primary strategies in a book that help men in any situation that's been applicable across different cultures and throughout different points in history. And so you look at those different strategies and then you can actually start to apply some tactics and see if those will work for you. I'm really trying to think about my scenario because there's no doubt in my mind and I'm sure dozens of others that I have improved my style over the past five years. But I don't know how strategic I've actually been about it other than I like this, I don't like that. I like the way this guy looks or those boots are cool or those jeans look good and that shirt is right. I don't really know how strategic I've actually been in this process. Yeah. And that's what's cool is it's one of those things for a lot of guys that can actually be a hangout because you see so many men who are natural, who are able to just dress well or dress authentically and are able to do it. So my question to you on that would be what benefits do you think you would have had if you would have been able to do that in a few months as opposed to over five years and how much money do you think you would have saved if you would have been able to do it that quickly and knowing what you were purchasing. And lastly, do you think you've already arrived at the ultimate benefit of your appearance or do you think that there's still more that you could improve on by taking a more strategic and goal oriented approach with it? I want to go to your question about the money saved because there's definitely that but then there's also the money that I've left on the table as well. And I believe that the ability that I've had to improve my appearance maybe slower than I ought to is a direct translation to potentially the income that I can earn as well. Yeah, absolutely. And I certainly haven't arrived. I think the way that we look is fluid, right? And it changes and it evolves and it grows and it morphs. And I'm sure if I looked at the very first video that I did when I started Order of Man, I'd probably ask myself what the hell was I wearing. In five years, I'll probably say the same thing about the video I did today. So I do believe it's always evolving. And I think the quicker that we can do this, the better off will probably be. That brings up another really good point because you're right. If your appearance isn't evolving as you do, then either one, you haven't evolved as much as you thought you have, or two, you're leaving opportunities on the table to further the benefits of that evolution. And so you're missing things out. And as your life evolves over the next five, 10, 20, 25 years, do you want to continue to haphazardly try and get it right? Or do you want to develop a more strategic goal-oriented approach so that you can always be maximizing the benefits that come from having your aesthetic evolution match the evolution of all the much more important components of who you are as a man. Well, one of the things we always, always talk about is intentionality. And a lot of the times we're talking about the way we plan our goals or the way that we eat or the way that we work out or the way that we communicate with our spouses. But very rarely does it come from this context of the way that we look and what we wear. But I think it's a crucial part of it, intentionality and being deliberate about the way that you show up. Yep. Especially because it does communicate things to yourself, to your spouse, to your kids, to your boss, to your clients, to everybody. And if you need to be intentional about the language that you're using, the tone of your voice, your body language, how present you are with these other components, you're just contradicting yourself if you're not applying that same intentionality to the clothing that you put on your body, especially because just like speaking, you put on clothes every single day. Right. Yeah, it is. You're in the thing whether you want to be or not. You're doing exactly my single day. Yeah. Good call. Well, for the sake of time, we don't have time to go through the strategies that you lay out in the book. Although I have read the entire book and in fact, I gave a little blurb slash endorsement for the book. I think that highly of it and the work that you're doing. But there is one that really stands out to me that I wanted to ask you about. And that is taste. I really wanted you to break down this concept and idea of taste because that one was a little bit more difficult for me to wrap my head around. Okay. So taste in the six different strategies is the fourth one. So you've built upon other layers of what works with your body, your different style archetypes and then the tribes, the expectations around you. And then taste is where it really starts to come together with this idea of authenticity. Because if you're just wearing the clothing that's expected of you within one particular group that you belong to, then you're nothing really more than just a drone. And in some environments and some situations, that can be a good thing. You think about the military, for example, like there's no room for personal taste in uniform or appropriate in that situation. It's totally inappropriate. That's detrimental to the goals of what you're trying to accomplish within that tribe. Right? Sure. But most of us don't fit within that. And even when you're within a what some people would consider a more rigid hierarchy, like a white collar business where, yeah, you're expected to wear a shirt and tie or a suit every day, there's still room for personal taste as far as expressing different things about what makes you you how you add the second and third dimension so that you're not just a one dimensional character. Maybe you pull some aesthetic cues from other tribes or other groups that you belong to. Maybe you're using that taste as ways to demonstrate things like mastery or courage, or maybe you're more interested in strength or in honor, communicating these kind of different masculine tactical virtues. And so taste is really taking everything that you know about who you are and what value you bring to the world and then finding out a way that you can express that through your clothing. And one of the reasons I think you struggled with that and why I think that that is so hard is because you can't just go out and buy a shirt that says mastery. That doesn't communicate anything. It's so much more subtle and subconscious and indirect and all of that. And that's where there definitely is a need for experimentation and giving yourself permission to make mistakes and try things and figure out where the lines and the boundaries are. But by learning how to combine what it is that makes you a good man internally and then seeing other men who may share those values and seeing if they have things that are common denominators or common threads in the way that they dress or the way that they look and then starting to implement some of those things, it's ways for you to start to experiment with what your own personal taste is. So I've got two examples of how I see what you just laid out would work in my life and did work out in my life in high school when we went to prom. There was about five of us. You know, you wear the tux and you do the thing and you wear what you're supposed to wear, but all of us decided to wear tux as our shoes. And this was appropriate, right? We wore the tux. We met the requirement. We met the standard and yet as the quote unquote jocks of the school, we were rebelling and we were saying that we are independent of the rest of you number one and we are above following the rules even to some degree. Perfect. So that was one example. The other one that I did is in the military ball when I was in the military, we wore our dress uniform and all of us in the section that I was part of actually wore red bow ties as opposed to I think it was just a black tie is what we're supposed to wear. And yet again, same thing, we are representing unity within our section and we were rebelling saying that we can do whatever we want. You guys have to follow the rules. We're not going to 100% absolutely. And it doesn't even always have to be rebellious as far as like a complete rejection of other people or anything else. Because even like, why do you like your long beard more than you liked it when it was shorter? What is appealing about that to you? I don't know. I don't know if I can even articulate what that is. I think I just, I like it. You know, one of the things I do like about it is the fact that I can have conversations with other people about specifically my beard. It's a great icebreaker and a short beard didn't do it like a long beard does. Right. Okay, that makes perfect sense. And now you've had it for so long. You've been seen enough with it that it become part of who you are as Ryan Mickler and what's represented with Order of Man and everything else. You could still do Order of Man just as well if it were something else besides the beard that communicated what the beard does. But your own personal preference was you're going to grow the beard out long. That's a great manifestation of the tribal expectation or even the expectation of your rugged archetype. But then the manifestation of it is done through a beard as opposed to something else. Let's talk about the archetypes real quick as we kind of wind down here talked about the rugged archetype which I would consider me falling into that archetype. What are the define that first for me and then talk to me about the other two archetypes? So the archetypes are the easiest way to start to separate yourself from the other men around you or even just from other potential ideas of what good style could be because again, good style is not just wearing a suit. You can have guys who manifest and demonstrate really good style in different points in history or in different cultures or even within the United States in 2017. There's different ways to express that. So if you can first identify how you primarily interact with the world around you for someone like you rugged where you enjoy working with your hands, you enjoy pushing yourself physically, you enjoy bending nature to your will. The rugged archetype makes sense. The other two are refined in Rakesh and men who fit within that refined archetype. That's where I fall. I like rules. I like structure. I like society. I like civilization. I like being able to navigate things based on dress codes and finances and all this other stuff. And you fit within some degree to that archetype as well. And then the third one is going to be Rakesh. And these are the guys who primarily identify by being rebels and rule breakers and iconoclasts. And they want to give the middle finger to everybody else around them. And each one of those has very different aesthetics that comes with it. And what's interesting is I think based on what you're saying and what I've seen in the conversations we've had, you can be Rakesh for example, in a suit just as easily as you could be Rakesh in a cut off sleeveless shirt, for example. Yeah, go to a demolition derby wearing a three piece suit and tell me that that's not giving the aesthetic middle finger to everybody around you. Right. And we even see that to your point earlier about Conor McGregor. I mean, dressed to the nines to go fight. He's going to fight and maim and hurt somebody. And he dresses like a king. It's pretty exactly exactly. Well, Tanner, we're bumping up against time, man. This has actually gone by really, really quick. And I know we could get into so much more. I would just encourage the guys to go out and buy the book, the appearance of power, really good book, fairly quick read, and has a lot of great information about what we've been talking about, including the six strategies that we didn't get to cover, unfortunately. Tanner, I want to ask you a couple of questions. The first one is, what does it mean to be a man? I love what you provided as far as the definition of provide, protect, and preside. I think in order to be a man, you need to be somebody who's capable of being an agent that acts as opposed to just being something passively waiting to be acted upon. A man is someone who does, who becomes rather than somebody who just responds or waits for things to happen to him. Powerful. I love it, man. I love that definition. And I agree with that. How do we connect with you? How do we pick up a copy of the book and just learn more? So if you want to pick up a copy, you can go to appearanceofpower.com. It'll give you an opportunity to go through there. You can also look it up on Amazon. As far as connecting with me, that's a great place to do it. There's an opportunity to sign up for a newsletter where I give out consistent information about how to apply these strategies and different tactical approaches or how to think about this stuff differently. And then also social media would be Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram, and all of those. It's just at Tanner Guzzie. Right on. We will link that up. And then also, depending on when this show is being released, guys, there's also Menfluential. And Tanner, I'm assuming you're going to be there. I will be there. Awesome. And it's in February. I'll get you guys the details so you have that, but you'll be able to connect with us and so many other guys. So make sure you check that out as well. Tanner, I've got to tell you, man, I appreciate our friendship getting to know you, the conversations we've had, and of course, all of your work. It has been instrumental in my life. If we were to rewind, like I said, five years ago, there's no way in a million years, I thought that this would have the type of impact that it has on my level of confidence and my influence and my income and my ability to show up more fully as a man. So I appreciate you for all that you've provided to me, man. I love to hear that. I mean, honestly, Ryan, you were such a good example of what it means to be a good man and a man who's good at being a man. And I love that I've been able to get to know you over the years and seeing the success that you've built. And I expect so much more from you. And it's fun to just be on this journey together, dude. Thanks, brother. Gentlemen, Mr. Tanner, Guzzie, like I said, I have learned so much from this man about what I wear and how it will help me accomplish my objectives. And I know you will too. I would encourage you to pick up a copy of Tanner's book. I have read the entire thing. It is a great book. It's called The Appearance of Power. If you need the link, head to orderofman.com slash 143 to get that. And of course, the rest of the notes from this show. Also, if you enjoyed the show, please let us know. Let me and Tanner know on Instagram and Twitter, Facebook, wherever you are. And also, tell us what your biggest takeaway was. In the meantime, we have our meetup slash book launch party in Nashville, January 26, 27, 2018. You can get registered at order of man.com slash Nashville. And make sure you take a look at the Iron Council. This is the brotherhood I mentioned earlier. You're going to band with other men who were accomplishing and striving to accomplish the same things that you are. You can do that at orderman.com slash Iron Council. Guys, I will look forward to talking with you on Friday for our Friday field notes. But until then, take action and become the man you are meant to be. Thank you for listening to the Order of Man podcast. You're ready to take charge of your life. And be more of a man you were meant to be. We invite you to join the Order at orderman.com."
