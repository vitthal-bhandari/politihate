    "text": " You ever watch this guy on television? You all were not telling the truth and you should not be trusted. Congressman Matt Gates, thank you for what you did for your country tonight. He offended with the Democratic whip, not House Republicans, like a machine. Matt Gates. Welcome to Hot Take. I'm Congressman Matt Gates. Let's talk about the news. The fight against fraud in our election system continues. People shouldn't vote more than once. They shouldn't vote in more than one state. People shouldn't vote in a state after they've moved out of that state and they certainly shouldn't vote after they die. But all of those things appear to be happening in the state of Nevada. Former Nevada attorney general Adam Laxalt is leading up the president's work in that state to try to clean up the elections. Here's former attorney general Laxalt of Nevada. We are providing today, and this lawsuit is that many of these votes were improperly cast. We are presenting today in our formal contest that there are north of 15,000 people who voted in Nevada and another state. We are presenting that people voted in people that had already done a change of address and left the state outside of the 30-day requirement. Their ballots were still cast. We are also presenting dead voters. In addition to this news out of Nevada, we're also seeing some interesting reporting out of Georgia. David Schaeffer is now the chairman of the Georgia Republican Party and he posted to Twitter, quote, one of our monitors discovered a 9,626 vote error in DeKalb County. One batch was labeled 10,707 for Biden and 13 for Trump, an improbable margin even by DeKalb standards. The actual count for the batch was 1,081 for Biden and 13 for Trump. Had this counting error not been discovered, Biden would have gained enough votes from this one batch alone to cancel out Trump's gains from Fayette Floyd and Walton. We were limited to one monitor for every 10 counting tables and we were kept some distance from the tables. There's no telling what we missed under these unreasonable restrictions. The miscounted batch had been signed off by two election officials. Biden's margin of victory for this batch of votes, 99.9%, bested Bashar al-Assad's 2007 margin, 97.6%, and Raoul Castro's 2008 margin, 99.4%. It matched Kim Jong Il's 2009 margin of 99.9%. Our attorneys have turned over an affidavit from our monitor to the secretary of state and requested an investigation. Pope Francis may be quite active on the gram. Fox News reporting Pope Francis Instagram account reportedly likes bikini models, Racey Snapchat. Natalia Geboto's Racey picture was liked by more than 133,000 people. She was dressed in stockings and suspenders. And hey look, she says that her mom may not like her booty pics, but if the pope is double tapping, she thinks that that may increase her chance to go to heaven. Now I don't know if this was the Pawneth himself or a member of his team maybe that didn't realize they were on the official account when they went around looking on the gram for something interesting or beautiful. So hey look, if liking pretty girls on Instagram is wrong, I don't want to be right. And if the Pawneth is out there making it happen, well, God created beauty in this world, Instagram allows us to share it and enjoy it. And I'm here for it. Apparently, so is the pope. After people have coronavirus and recover from it, they may have immunities that could last not for weeks or months, but for years or even decades, according to a new study reported by the New York Times. And this study is suggesting that there are special memory cells in the body, not just antibodies, but memory cells that can create these just outstanding immunities that can fight back against the coronavirus for quite some time. The study comes from La Jolla Institute of Immunology. The leader of the study is Shane Crotty. He's quoted as saying that amount of memory would likely prevent the vast majority of people from getting hospitalized by the disease by having severe disease for many years. The findings are consistent with encouraging evidence emerging from other labs, according to the reporting researchers at the University of Washington led by immunologist Marion Pepper had earlier shown that memory cells were produced following the infection with the coronavirus for at least three months. A study published last week also found that people who have recovered from COVID-19 have powerful and protective killer immune cells, even when the antibodies are not detectable. So again, the research showing initially that those antibodies are detectable for three months, but there could be this extended period of time beyond that with these memory cells that can come back and be very effective in combating coronavirus. Now, the studies also show that there is not universal adaptation and development of these memory cells, that there are some people who still can be reinfected. And we look forward to continuing research to show who might be more vulnerable, who might be more resilient, and how that can inform on our policy choices. Reeths across America is an opportunity for our fellow countrymen and women to honor the tremendous sacrifice of the fallen by bringing reeths and laying them at the grave sites of some of America's best and bravest. Arlington National Cemetery had originally announced that they would be canceling reeths across America at Arlington. And we saw a swift rebuke of that from members of Congress, members of the Senate, the president himself saying that this must be a decision reversed. And so the secretary of the army has reversed the decision. Reeths across America will go on. Here's my hot take. If in Washington, DC, we can allow tens of thousands of people to protest for and against different kinds of politics during this coronavirus pandemic. Certainly, we can allow patriotic Americans to honor the sacrifice that those who have fallen have made. And I think it is entirely appropriate for the president to have gotten involved, reversed this decision. And I'm glad to see that reeths across America will go on. Democrats on Capitol Hill are proposing remote voting rules to allow members of Congress to be back in their districts and cast their supporter opposition to various legislative initiatives by the phone. Now most Republicans have opposed this, but I'm starting to think that it may do a lot to drain the swamp to get members of Congress out of the swamp more often and back in their districts. I discussed the issue with Fox News Radio's Jimmy Phala on Fox Across America. Take a listen to the discussion. Jimmy, I got to let you in on the news today here. Republicans and Democrats are meeting for their caucus leadership elections and to vote on the rules that they think should exist in the 117th Congress. And there's a key difference between the Republicans and Democrats. The Democrats believe that we ought to be able to remote vote on legislation, like on your phone. And Republicans have criticized that as literally phoning in the job of Congress. And if Henry Clay can get on the horse and get here, why shouldn't we be able to get on Delta? But here's my base thinking and it may be an unpopular view. Do members of Congress really get better the more time we spend in Washington, D.C., around the political action committees and the lobbyists? I mean, when we all centralized here, it makes it real down easy for the lobbyists to run the show because it's easier to buy everybody off if everybody's in the same place. Now, I'm the only Republican in Congress that doesn't take any PAC money because I find it to be a completely disgusting exchange of favors for cash. And I just think maybe, I don't know, there might be something too draining the swamp by having members of Congress actually have to sit in their districts, look their fellow Americans in the eye who elected them and be truly accountable to the people in this country, not to the special interests in the bellway. So let me know what you think. Remote voting, get people out of the swamp before their constituents away from the lobbyists, away from the PACs. Put in the comments section whether or not you would agree that remote voting could actually make Washington better by getting more of Congress out of Washington. Big tech CEOs, including Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg were before the Senate to talk about censorship and de-platforming. Senator Mike Lee called out their approach during the 2020 election as distinctly partisan. Take a listen. Twitter and Facebook represent and have represented for years to their users, their customers, that they take a neutral approach to election content moderation. However, as we've heard today and as we will continue to hear today and into the foreseeable future, there are instances in which your platforms are taking a very distinctively partisan approach and not a neutral one to election-related content moderation. And as Democrats were increasingly wanting to see more censorship, more lockdown, more control for big tech, Senator Cruz correctly pointed out how dangerous that could be. I will say it's dismaying listening to the questions from our Democratic colleagues, because consistently the message from Senate Democrats is for Facebook and Twitter and Google to censor more, to abuse their power more, to silence voices that Senate Democrats disagree with more. That is very dangerous if we want to maintain a free and fair democracy, if we want to maintain free speech. There was a time when Democrats embraced and defended the principles of free speech. There was a time when Democrats embraced and defended the principles of a free press. And yet there's an absolute silence from Democrats speaking up for the press outlets censored by big tech. There's an absolute silence for Democrats speaking out for the citizens silenced by big tech. Instead, there is a demand used even more power to silence dissent, and that's a totalitarian instinct that I think is very dangerous. At the same time that big tech exercises massive power, it also enjoys massive corporate welfare through the effect of section 230, a special immunity from liability that nobody else gets. Congress has given big tech in effect a subsidy while they become some of the wealthiest corporations on the face of the plan. And so we continue to see this pattern where CEOs are brought in, they're berated by senators, but nothing has changed regarding the rules, the regulations, the laws that govern big tech. President Trump was working to see more of his administration confirm America first patriots who would actually push back on big tech rather than being their laptops. And that may be interrupted. So we've got to continue to keep our foot on the gas pedal. We've got to continue to push reforms. And that's certainly what I'll do so that we have online freedom so that we have the ability to have discussions and debate about things that may not be comfortable, that may be difficult. Remember, the First Amendment doesn't exist to protect comfortable speech. It exists to protect uncomfortable speech. And if we can't have the freedom to express ourselves online, I guess we have to ask what the point of the First Amendment is anyway, because we start from the proposition that the airwaves are owned by the people of our country. And while certainly these technology companies aren't their private companies, I don't think that they should have the ability to define acceptable debate in America. Breitbart scored a great interview with the president's nominee to be ambassador to Afghanistan. Ambassador nominee Will Ruger Trump can cement his legacy by ending the Afghanistan war and it's by our friend Christina Wong. President Trump can cement his legacy as the president who ended America's longest war. If he withdraws all U.S. troops or greatly reduces their numbers in Afghanistan, the president's nominee for U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, William Ruger, said on Monday, quote, he would be the first president, since at least Reagan, to not start a major new war. And he'd be the president who got us out of America's longest war. That's what the president should want in the first paragraph of the history of his presidency. I could not agree more. The war in Afghanistan has gone on too long. It's cost too much in terms of our nation's treasure and the blood of our bravest patriots. Let's hope that the accelerated work now of the Trump administration in these weeks continues, that we are successful in bringing this drawdown into focus and that we allow America's great patriots, our great warriors to be home by Christmas. Buckalupo.com's Sofia Carbonet has a hot take. And the war on traditional gender roles, arguably one of the most dangerous assaults on Western culture is the rejection and subsequent unfurling of traditional gender roles, according to the piece. And the argument being made is that when you look at the successes of Western civilization, it relies upon a strong family. And within a family, there are opportunities for men to use their masculinity in productive ways in the same with femininity. And Carbonet argues that when you see stuff like Harry Styles, you know, in a dress on the cover of Vogue magazine, that's not like some transformational breakthrough. That's going to advance society. That is really showing young men who idolize Harry Styles that they too can reject their masculinity. And it's also showing women, I think the fluid nature of kind of some of these representations. Here's my hot take. Absolutely. The traditional family ought to be seen as the model. And of course, just like any model, there are going to be folks who fall outside of it, who live different kind of lives. And we shouldn't be mean to those people. We should not, you know, allow them to have fewer rights. We shouldn't allow others to pick on them. But that doesn't mean that the standard in America, that the standard for Western civilization shouldn't be reflective of the types of strong institutions in families and in churches that have proven pretty successful and pretty productive for the American way of life. So it's the buckalupo.com. Check it out. Critiquing the critiquers on gender. It's quite the hot take. On our 115th episode back in October, we talked about the applicability of mouthwash to potentially reduce the viral load of coronavirus in someone's saliva. And we've actually got a follow up to that report. Sky News showing us that if the mouthwash has the ingredient set applied in them, that that can be effective according to some of the initial trials. They've still got to be peer reviewed. But in this 12 week trial at the University Hospital of Wales, we saw that there was some promising evidence of this. So out in Wales, I guess whether the coronavirus is a factor or not, use the mouthwash. And let's hope that we find more and more remedies to be able to reduce the viral load, reduce the rate of infection, reduce the contagiousness, and help our fellow people of the world deal with this pandemic. Thanks for listening to Hot Takes. I'm Congressman Matt Gaetz.
