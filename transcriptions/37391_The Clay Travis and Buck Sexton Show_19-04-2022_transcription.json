Team welcome to the Freedom Hut Tuesday April 19th edition and my oh my it's a good day to be an American. Masks are done on airplanes at least for now. I'm not sure the battle is over forever but masks are off on the planes folks unless you're terrified of breathing the air from the dirty peasants without their masks on. Oh we will have some fun on this one. Finally a victory for sanity. We'll discuss. Plus the Washington Post the Bezos owned post goes after Libs of TikTok an account that shows you just what Libs say on their own accounts and Taylor Lorenz at the heart of this one a Washington Post technology writer who is known to cry on camera about people being mean to her online. She went and docked the Libs of TikTok account. We'll discuss and then of course Rhonda Santis is out there doing great stuff in the state of Florida. He may pull some special status away from Disney World because why should Disney World be treated especially given how they treat the state of Florida. We'll discuss all of this my friends coming up here in just a moment but first off I gotta tell you real estate investing is such a fascinating process. You learn so much and if you do it the right way it can be really financially rewarding. I actually enjoy it. I like learning about different cities markets the neighborhood and then what happens with my friends at Dunferreal estate is they walk you through every step of the process. They take you through all of it. I've bought multiple houses my brothers and I have gone in together to buy houses with Dunferreal estate.

You'll see go to Dunferreal buck.com again that's Dunferreal buck.com and you'll be a real estate investor. Oh my gosh the masks on the planes are off. Can you feel it my friends? Can you feel all that highly processed filtered airport airplane air right? It's great though isn't it? Because it doesn't smell like old dirty mask which is such an improvement so much better. I am flying next weekend down to Florida place where I spend a lot of time these days flying down to Florida and I will not have to have that moment right before I get into the taxi to take me to the airport where I go oh wait did I bring a mask with me? No more masks sorry libs your insanity does not get to infringe upon our right to breathe air for all eternity. I just want to say this is something that should have happened a long time ago. It is outrageous that it took two years for this to finally come down. There was no there was no rational justification. I will smoke anyone in a debate on airport airplane masks. It is not possible it is indefensible because the reality of the position is actually intermittent masking. There's never been a scientific study done period that shows any benefit of intermittent masking. Think about that for a second. This would be like telling everybody you have to wear a raincoat it'll keep the rain off you and then you say well hold on a second but I only wear it half the time and that's your policy. They say yeah that's right. Raincoat 50% of the time you're in the rain going to keep you dry. No it actually won't. It's stupid beyond words but this has been federal policy under the Biden regime because they have a lot of people who can't think for themselves who are really intellectually mush. They can't actually think through things they don't have the ability to process differing information sets and to look at experience and reason and come to good conclusions. They don't have it. It's not in their capability and a perfect example of this comes from Jen Suckibam back and forth with Peter Ducey on the mask issue. Listen to this one. You said about this mask ruling out of a federal court in Florida that it's a disappointing decision and you say you continue to recommend that people wear masks. Why is it that we can sit here in the White House briefing room with no masks but people can't sit in an airplane cabin with no masks? Well Peter I'm not a doctor you're not a doctor that I'm aware of if you're a doctor I wasn't aware of that today until today. Okay not a doctor just making sure I don't know but these determinations remember the masking guidance is there are is green yellow and red we are currently in a green zone in Washington DC so they're not recommending it and this is based on health considerations and data that the CDC looks at about transmissibility as we've seen increasing cases on airplanes. Notice how she just goes into some blather about the bureaucracy. Yeah there's like chartreuse and like and like yellow but like more of like a sunflower yellow and like less of like you know big bird yellow and you know like when you get it doesn't matter all idiocy it means nothing it's absurd the CDC looks at the CDC has been boiled down to a few unelected bureaucrats at the top of a massive multi-billion dollar year bureaucracy that is overwhelmingly worthless by the way if you made president buck which spoiler alert one day that might be a good idea if you made president buck CDC gone rip down to the studs day one build something in its place with actual safeguards and protections against politicization and the utter nonsense that we've seen and accountability if you're the CDC chief and you say everybody must do X and it turns out X in this case masking on planes is moronic the same way that if you were the general of the military and you said oh look at this sneak attack actually you want to do an ambush and you know you you just lost a huge battle somewhere you might get fired although currently with our military situation as we know the obama Biden uh i'm sorry the Biden Harris administration uh the afghan debacle not a single person resigned or fired but theoretically at least if you're a general and you're losing the war you're not supposed to stay in command the whole time you know go back in history you'll see this is the case if you're the head of the cdc if you're the head of the nih or nayad which is fauci's little kingdom he's the little smurf his smurf kingdom is nayad uh national infectious allergy disease something like national institute of allergy and infectious disease boom nayad you should get fired you should no longer be in that position because the public shouldn't trust you anymore and the public doesn't trust them anymore but saki goes into this blather because how can they really justify this i mean in what world does this make any sense that this was the only place you could go to crowded concerts i did i was in brooklyn all the hipsters in brooklyn at the packed concert and i was in hipster brooklyn too i was in bushwick i was worried they're gonna look at me be like your pants are not tight enough your facial hair is not ironic enough you have no tattoos you were not allowed to be here turned out it didn't happen i was okay but i was there no masks all indoors really close together but on a plane where they actually have hepaphyl tration system so the air is constantly being cleaned of virus there you have to have it no it's because airlines are a concentration of authority and power that's why it's love it because there's immediate consequence there's a media consequence for defiance they will kick your butt off that plane and ruin your day take money from you of course because now you no longer have a flight flying is expensive also because of price of oil thanks bud and ban you from the airline forever and perhaps have you arrested depending on how it all goes so they love that authority it was a way to always hammer home to everybody including the red states we are in charge you do what we say so andi slavitt who is horrible on all issues of covid he's one of these covid advisor people who makes the rounds on tv is out there like and the pandemic is not over it's not over no actually you know what it is over of course nobody likes the pandemic nobody likes wearing masks and so if the mask has become the symbol of the pandemic you know people you know can cheer be happy if this feels like a symbol of this pandemic being behind us but it's certainly for many people the pandemic is not over particularly people at high risk and the pandemic in cases are of course arising so but we shouldn't confuse this and we quite honestly we shouldn't allow people who are uncivil on airplanes and put a lot of pressure unfairly on flight attendants to rule the day so you know people people understandably don't like masks and cheer and be happy but we need to make our decisions and our judgments with public health in mind and the law and the law in this case is on the side of the cdc no actually the laws on the side of the federal judge who had a universal injunction which the lib used all the time in the trump administration that actually is the law but you notice he's a andi slavitt md medical advisor whatever doesn't know a damn thing about the law or constitutionality so he's actually wrong it's not the law and everyone in the air airline industry has effectively conceded that so no wrong on the law but also wrong on the merits of of the science here why will they never defend the policy who is this protecting in a way that is meaningful considering there's no masking anywhere else they will not defend it it's indefensible my friends we have learned so much here i will tell you i have a more pessimistic and dim view of human nature and human freedom in this country than i ever have before because of what i've seen in our last two years i i am i was honestly shocked to see how pathetic and how incapable of the most basic independent thought about half the country actually is and yes it is overwhelming unfortunately the political culture of democrats to go along with the hive mind they do not think for themselves they just want to be part of the herd the good smart herd of the good smart people or what about when the herd is wrong doesn't matter keep going along it's exactly what they did and it's awful awful what this has done to the country as a result and uh i'm we're in this fight forever you got to remember this this is not going away the fight for basic freedom i'm talking about now the libs got a taste of absolute power trust me they they want more of that they're not done look if you run a small business who's running your HR if the answer is i'll figure it out myself or no one remember that one employee can plank and turn your world upside down HR is not just about avoiding risk as a

tick-tock is a chinese spying app whatever put that aside for a second because if you have kids your kids are on tick-tock this is i conservatives we cannot keep seeding these areas of communication indoctrination and propaganda to the left and then wonder why when ten years passes and it grows and grows and becomes more influential we say oh wait a second you mean that's really no we got a month so you have to be tick-tocking yourself you don't have to make your shuffle dance videos or whatever although those are pretty cool sometimes i'm not gonna lie but you kind of know what's going on tick-tock is specifically using an algorithm to see what your kid likes what your kids see and it's just reinforcing themes all the time all the time constantly and there is an account called libs of tick-tock and it it operates anonymously which we used to be told if you're on twitter or facebook this was important you should be able to be anonymous and now the libs want to be able to hunt down and destroy anybody who deviates from the narrative so anonymity is all of a sudden a problem um that's an interesting change isn't it but the libs of tick-tock account doesn't do anything other than share what libs on tick-tock are saying it also puts it on instagram and other social media platforms and what you see in particular this is what's really upset the left are these teachers who will go on air or go on the platform and say you know i teach kindergarten and you look at them and you hear what they have to say about their sexuality and about their desire to speak to children about it and these people look completely insane they they just do they look completely nuts i mean they're you have to see it to really understand it but whatever caricature in your head you think of a true leftist indoctrinated leftist who wants to indoctrinate small children whatever caricature you're thinking of is not extreme enough based on the reality of libs of tick-tock it's just showing people what's really happened on the left which is what that they have just gone over the edge i mean the left has a lot of people who are completely insane i mean they have adopted this ideology that really has no anchoring intellectual weight whatsoever it's just whatever i feel like and whatever i'm told to feel like and whatever i want to say is great and has to be celebrated or else you're a bigot and that makes a lot of people very concerned especially when it comes to these are teachers who want to teach your kids this stuff and given the fights in florida recently we can understand why this is heightened heightened to national attention this has been elevated to national attention well the washing post with taylor lorens who is fond of going on tv to cry about how people are mean to her
