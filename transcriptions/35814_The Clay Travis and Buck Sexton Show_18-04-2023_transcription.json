    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast Welcome back in our number three Tuesday edition of the program appreciate all of you hanging out with us We've had a bevy of topics that have been firing up reaction uh, but uh including the debate between lady in the tramp and Peter pan both buck and i picking our favorite chit disney movie as children i'll point out Peter pan just absolutely obliterating bucks awful decision of lady in the tramp This is nonsense it is neck and neck and it's your twitter account that fired out this polser So it's 55 45 now. We're heading to like a 2000 bush v gore finale Might have to wait and see whether uh, we have the uh, the the flood coming in fullton county Uh in atlanta to see whether or not we can actually get any of the votes tally But again at clay Travis at clay and buck you can also Uh go vote there thousands of you weighing in so far tons of comments. I believe alleys said we have a new uh, we're about to set Um about to set an all-time record for vip emails people absolutely firing away Uh, okay, so Really good interview last night. We were talking about this earlier in the program that we were just going to discuss it in the third hour Tucker carlson set down with elon musk as i said The most successful african-american entrepreneur of all time elon musk now owns twitter killing it with tesla And space x and i did love as a part of this discussion last night that i was watching Um when elon musk said hey actually the business of twitter isn't very complicated Compared to building cars or sending rocket ships to space And i i love that because so few people who are criticizing elon musk Understand even the most basic elements of business and what uh going out and ending up owning Uh, a company like twitter would do Uh, but probably the most significant thing that elon musk has done so far is When he took over twitter had around 8 000 employees Now i believe they are down to 1500 And he says it turns out you don't need that many employees if you just actually run a business As opposed to an activist organization listen to cut eight What percentage of your staff did you fire at twitter one of the great business stories of the year I think we're about we're about 20 percent of the original size So 80 percent left, uh, yes So A lot of people voluntarily sure sure sure but but it's 80 percent are gone from the day to correct. Yes, so how do you run the company with only 20 percent of the staff? Uh, it turns out you don't need uh that will not make people to run twitter, but 80 percent that's a lot um, yes, uh, I mean if you're trying to run some sort of uh glorified activist organization, uh, with a voice And you're care that much about censorship then uh, you can really like a lot of people turns out The employees that he's referring to here when he says it's a glorified activist organization is exactly what it was And by the way, that is what youtube is that is what facebook is the same or worse pre elon at those places um As as it is as it was at twitter And and I think that everyone needs to remember that and think about the ways that that influences all political issues But specifically the 2020 election you had activist groups posing as Free speech exchange of idea platforms, which was which was a total lie Um, but it was you know, glad did you ever see uh, so there were these instagram Videos and tick tox and this really happened before you on bought it Of people who were like hey and day in my life at twitter, I'm just like Gonna go like go walk in at like 11 a.m. And now i'm just gonna like walk around. Oh, look at this free sushi today Amaze like gonna go take a nap now like oh, we have like a like a trust safety and dei thing. We're gonna go to that It was like day camp for adults and people were making videos About what a joke it was and how they were being fed And and getting like free massages and yoga therapy during the workday at this place So yeah, it what's amazing is that the people who complain about twitter Never have an answer for twitter was gonna go bankrupt This was gonna happen twitter was gonna die as a business altogether you on saved it Um, but that's because everyone has to remember the purpose of twitter No, it started out under the promise that it would be a free Speech platform that was what that was how they got people like me and you using it, right? When did you i think i started twitter in 2011 when i got on a media for the first time Yeah, i started twitter when i had i think my second book was about to come out and i was thinking okay This was like 2008 and i thought i need as much promotional opportunity maybe 2009 Maybe in 2009 i need as much promotional opportunity as i possibly can so i started my twitter account in 2009 and rapidly realized how much i like it um in terms of just a mechanism by which new stories spread um But now you know a part of me wonders I think it's certainly been worth it for my career to be on twitter I cannot imagine buck being a real human that does not use twitter for work And being obsessively on it does that make sense like i have friends who are practicing attorneys And they say for instance i work so much the last thing i want to do is worry about what is trending on social media on any given day And i appreciate people out there who are fighting in their free time I've not i've not been on facebook in probably a decade like i don't remember the last time i went and looked at anything on facebook I don't think i would be on social media very much If we didn't have the jobs that we have But what are you on musk is doing is incredibly important. I want to play a couple of more cuts because While he's getting ripped to shreds, I thought this was interesting. Did you see who he long voted for He voted for biden over trump in 2020 So when people are out there talking about it what a far right wing idial log he is listen to cut nine You've allowed donald trump back on twitter he hasn't taken you up on your offer because he's got his own thing Do you think he will go back on twitter? Well, that's that's obviously up to him um, you know my job is to You know, I take the freedom of speech very seriously, so It's um You know, I didn't I didn't vote for don't provide actually vote for biden No saying i'm a huge fan of biden because i would think that would probably be inaccurate but um You know, we have difficult choices to make in these presidential elections. It's not I would prefer frankly that we we we put someone just a normal person as president I think that's probably overwhelmingly the the wish right so so I I think it's so interesting because what elon has showed With with twitter specifically and I think it's so important forever to remember extract forget even about just social media companies uh, think about the education bureaucracy think about the federal government they're all of these Places that once they're in a position to the commissars the political enforcers start to pile in And then it's you know, it kind of accelerates the effect snowballs is why If you look at public education in the united states over the last uh 20 years Something like and someone's gonna fact check me on this but something like for every teacher that has been added there are six administrators Yeah, and a lot of these administrators just push around paperwork for the unions so that other people who can you know It's essentially a jobs program for people that shouldn't have jobs or you know aren't doing anything worthwhile um twitter Was effectively a massive surveillance and suppression operation masquerading as a free speech platform That's what you can really take from the elon discussion with with tucker last night It reminds me of the secret police in east germany right after the partition the stazi clay had about a hundred thousand full-time like spy surveillance people and hundreds of thousands of part-time collaborators So you're talking about people whose job was just to monitor what you're saying and doing in the hundreds of thousands in the employee of the state For uh east germany. I think had like 15 million people something like that. Not that big that was twitter I think it's so important to point out that he voted for joe biden Because the way that the left wing media in this country is treating elon musk Is as if he is some far right wing Idiologue And to me it's representative of the graphic that we talked about we did the patrick bet david podcast on friday It's the way that I feel in particular and I saw elon share it several years after I did The left has gone so far left wing in this country That I actually think if you're one of the 75 or 80 percent of the american public people who believe things like america's pretty great place to live Uh by and large americans are pretty fair and friendly to others Capitalism works the meritocracy is real and i'm just tossing off a few of those things western civilization by and large is beneficial to society as a whole if you just believe basic things like that The left doesn't tolerate you anymore and even a guy like elon musk Will be susceptible buck you see what's written about me You know like i'm a right wing extremist. Well, how do what does he believe that's right? We extreme is him he thinks that you know boys and girls should not compete against each other in sports he thinks that Biology is real and things that you should be able to make a decision For your family about whether your kids have to wear masks in schools like these are all very rational Reasonable things that have been completely Rejected by the left and that is what I think is is illuminating here Remember the party that claims that it's so convinced of its moral rectitude Is desperately afraid buck of its ideas actually having to be debated in the public square That's the reality of where we are. I think that those on the on the left or on the democrat side of things who um have certain Principles rooted in you know, they call themselves liberals, which I've always thought is a is a total misnomer For the people that are liberals in this country because they are they are anti-liberty. They are status or they are authoritarians Um, they will never leave you alone. They want to tell you what to do We all understand the mentality wokeness is the same wokeness is the antithesis of liberty wokeness is you can't say think or Anything that is against in a sense the revolution or the hive mind is to be destroyed Right and you know, you've seen this playing out over over a number of years now and I just think that clay honestly You know, we're at a point now where ewan and others like him Realized that the democrats there's a monster that has been created on the left here and people like bill mower You can see he kind of knows now they egged it on they were voting for it But that monster will consume everything that monster will destroy western civilization if it continues So there are some people now. I think they'll have a little bit of lib regret And the only way for that lib regret to finally flourish is a massive ass kicking because unless we get a monumental win in a presidential election then Democrats are not going to acknowledge that the woke monster has taken over their party and alienated them from vast majorities of white black asian and hispanic people all over this country Who believe that america is a force for good? You don't risk your life to come here because you think this is a fundamentally racist and oppressive society I don't even mean this as a as an ask or as a question about trump's Competency or how well he did because I thought he was a very good president you have said that if you thought he's a very good president But it's just a look at the actual power structures in this country and how they operate even with a figure like trump who was a fighter a brawler and and was Instinctually very well suited to just fight the commies right Did the communists in this country gain ground or lose ground at the end of the trump administration? And i'm not saying this is on trump i'm saying, you know, it's it's disney it's the meat it's everything right it's it's education It's all these things but even when we win an election Even when we have a figure like trump I think you know, I by the way, I don't even pretend that I have a clear answer to that I think you could push both ways But vokeness certainly wasn't defeated after four years of trump and to look what they managed to pull off in the 2020 election There's no doubt the only thing I think you can point to and say Uh, at least we have this is the supreme court because imagine where we'd be without the supreme court I mean they have been the best backstop against authoritarian impulse in the biden administration That's the single biggest win by the way that donald trump delivered that is lasting Forget, you know what he did and his regulations and his treatment of the border Unfortunately, that stuff can be flipped by a democrat as we see But the supreme court the reason it it it Enrages the libs so much is that there's a permanence or at least a semi permanence to it'll last for decades My patreon supply makes the world's best emergency food Especially prepared meals packaged in such a way you can safely store them in their home for 20 years if needed We've got this in the travis household one for me one for my wife one for each of our three kids When you need to rely on this food you hope you never will it's insurance Just like you hope you're never going to need car insurance or home insurance or life insurance Do you feel comfortable that food is always going to be available for your family frankly?

We're finding out it is better for the planet No Everything he says there by the way is not true Um, look I I know i'm gonna get people that are vegetarians We're gonna i'm gonna get some vegans with like a six pack we're like, oh, look at me Okay, maybe for some people at work the truth is Eating meat eating protein from animals is for most people a superior diet Very clear people can argue this as much as they want, but it's obvious why all of human history Um, but also just that they're gonna have the city fight climate change really got bigger problems. Clay Yeah, I mean, how about you just make people feel safe on the subways Well, let's start there and then we can move into worrying about plant based diets and what it might be doing in new york city Just gonna toss it out there. I think that's I think that's a fair fair way to approach it But not these days friends gotta get everybody to you know They it doesn't didn't tucker talk about he's got a show eat eat bugs or something or you know eat the bugs That's on fox nation now because they want you to eat bugs because that's good for the planet too.

Let's play cut 30 here of bill mar going after The biden administration over this woke ridiculousness. Listen title nine in the early 70s was something that was uh It was a major event in feminism that we finally have this law that says that colleges, right? And I think high schools too, but definitely colleges women women sports have to be given equal to men sports So that women aren't getting you know, and this led to the wnva and lots of other stuff This seems to be the opposite of that. It seems to be so many instances I think where wokeness is the opposite of what I grew up as Liberalism was let's give the women an equal shot I mean, this is let's put a veil in the swimming pool with the women. I don't get it so I actually think that the rewriting of A lot of what title nine did is an interesting component of this too title nine effectively Cause the end of men's collegiate wrestling in a lot of places collegiate rowing something I know a little bit about Um, they destroyed all these men's programs It turns out that actually there's a greater interest in a greater number of sports For men to actually just compete and play in then there are for women but clay as you know because you have massive amounts of money going towards men's uh football and men's Uh, the football is the big one, right? Some other sports, maybe basketball gets some money some other things But all that meant is that now you're going to spend all this money on women's teams that nobody goes to see that nobody really cares about You got to recruit for these women's teams that don't really do very much for the school And you got rid of a whole lot of uh of men's athletics as a result I mean crew teams in particular were a big casualty this uh wrestling You probably knows there's some other sports too where right where they were just cutting the men's programs to get more parity in the budget So there was a destructive component even to title nine that I think people don't really talk about Um, and I was familiar with this because of college rowing and what was going, you know We'd sometimes you'd roll against a men's team and they were like It was like they had a bathtub and you know and two paddles they're trying to go by and then he rogan So our women were all against the women's team and they had 30 40 000 New shells, you know going down the river. I mean title nine This is why I've always thought somebody floated this argument to me legally a while back buck and loaded clay I see what you did there. Hey, yeah, no pun intended Uh, I thought this was brilliant and the argument was football isn't a men sport Women are open to making football teams and playing they're just not good enough to ever make the team And so football is actually a unisex sport men and women can both compete in it 85 men just happen to get the scholarships as opposed to women And I always thought well, that's really kind of an interesting argument right because there is no women's football team So there's just a football team, but the result for people out there who don't understand it title nine effectively mandated equal scholarships for men and women and because football takes up 85 male scholarships They women if you're a women's diver or a field hockey player You might well get a scholarship and the fl- the one the sport that really gets screwed on it buck is baseball Because virtually no school in america gives full scholarships to baseball players But every softball player would get a full scholarship for instance because they have to make up for the 85 And so I think the average male Baseball team only gets like eight scholarships for all of the players I know scholarships are a big part of it. Is it only scholarship though? Is it just the overall spend in the athletic program? I thought they know I had the spend Well, the parody and the spin comes primarily through scholarships because the Cost way more but football makes money and effectively funds entire athletic departments at many schools Every school loses money on virtually every sport other than football and basketball and some schools even lose money on football I wanted to a lot of my understanding because I actually looked into this as a book called the game of life written by a guy out of Princeton where they looked at very few schools Even make money all in on their football program very few Relatively, I'm not talking about you know, you michigan in the big schools that you like but like d3 d2 schools Losing money on those football programs while wildly expensive and also to be fair a lot of athletic programs are Run to spend every dollar that they make so you're a non-profit So most of them are either lost leaders or they're basically they're not trying to make money Right if you were trying to make money you would have a football and a men's basketball program Basically cancel out anything else but I wanted to play this too because I actually respect piers morgan here Uh because he says to katie porter. Why hasn't he had you on his show? By the way, I'm seeing people doing the piers show. What's going on clay? I got a fox news colleagues. Yeah, I didn't get my ears on time one time on piers's show I'd like to use a trip to london and write the whole thing off if anybody from piers morgan show is listening I'd love to be on your show. I'll take a trip to london right off the entire trip Uh so that I can appear on the show one on the show. I didn't realize that so I guess i'm not Oh, you know, I've been invited but I wasn't able to do it and then they didn't reach out again Um, but katie porter may well be the next senator from california And she is a left-wing zealot ideologue Um, not very likable person appears to be an awful Employer if you're a staff member of congress But piers morgan she went after riley gain so we've had on this program a lot riley gains former swimmer at kentucky She went after riley gains and the arguments that she's making and piers morgan actually pushed back and said wait a minute What do you disagree with that she's saying and this was fantastic? Listen, including riley gains way disagree with strongly should be You disagree with out of interest. I think that it should be up to sporting bodies to make the decisions about who What does she said that's actually wrong? I think that what she has done is tried to turn this we talked about people you know Becoming using things to kind of get likes and get clicks. That's not what she's doing I mean, I I've got no chock for right against personally But all I've seen her do is stand up for women's rights to fairness and equality She actually competed against lea thomas and it was obviously unfair lea thomas won one of the races in the nc W. Chambages by 50 seconds against a bunch of biological females who simply couldn't keep up She can't even explain buck what she disagrees with but the orthodoxy requires her this I see this so often I disagree with everything she's saying okay. What in particular well, you can't even explain it This is that that was so perceptive and well done. I thought by piers morgan. I have I do know some leftists real leftists in the media Personally and i've had more than one Confied to me on this issue and I will not call them out because I know them personally and they confided to me But they know that this is crazy and they just don't want the trans activists to come after them They have told me that so that is the reality of being a democrat today You have to say things that everybody knows are completely insane Including the person saying it because if you don't the lunatic police will come after you And it's not even that on top of it buck espn as part of their regular programming Said that lea thomas was one of the women of the year So if your kid is just sitting down eating breakfast watching sports highlights There was a one-minute long advertisement talking about how heroic lea thomas was a dude For being a top women's athlete They I mean this is on a sports network which theoretically understands sports fans should the importance of you know age restrictions Weight restrictions Comparative we'd need to get like we need to get like a you know 240 pound beer to do like a macho man randy sabbie Who just claims that he's actually you know eight years old and then he just goes onto the p-w Football league and it's just like stiff farming little kids into the dirt like yeah I'm actually say I am If you are listening to us right now and you wanted to create an incredible documentary And you're a pretty good male athlete. It would just be You're going to identify as a woman in women's athletic competitions all over the country You could have a beard you could be six four Ripped Don't change anything other than maybe you decide to occasionally wear a dress and just ridicule and mock this and see how many Women's championships you could actually win. I think it would be Incredibly powerful both for comedy satire, but also just an evisceration Of the lies that you are required to believe if you are a left-wing democrat acolyte right now um, so This reminds me I think it's called a Ahsoka hoax This is when To to test how crazy academia was this academic um, allen sokel a physics professor at m y u submitted a paper that was all gibberish to a uh, you know highly accredited Academic journal of physics. It was just jargon and gibberish and it was called transgressing the boundaries towards a transformative Humanudics of quantum gravity it clay it means nothing it was the whole thing was just jargon Um, and the port the point of it was just a show that this is all about conformity and virtue signaling and you know They don't even read this stuff. They don't know You kind of need to do a sokel a sokel hoax that that's what you're really talking about where guys just like i'm a woman And i'm just gonna go in there and we're gonna i'm gonna you know compete in you know the What do you think we the best event? What would be the best i like i like doing it in tennis because they're not gonna hurt anybody right? That's the thing i you know i don't want anyone to get injured in this place Just smoking chicks Like especially because you could wear like a tennis skirt Which what you i mean you could dress too further i think basketball Like if you added a legitimately good men's college basketball player and he decided he was gonna play in the wmba He would almost immediately become the greatest wmb a player there was a mojuana man 20 years ago Mocked and ridiculed the concept of this but we could have a real life juanaman Uh, and you could have a player who was you know, i mean if you're a college scholarship male basketball player You would be the greatest player. It's ever existed in the history of the wmba You could be dunking on these chicks like crazy. You could be trash talking How would the wmba respond if a guy decides that he's identifying as i mean it's score every each score every time he got the ball They wouldn't be able to stop him. I think a single remember buck you get to play with a smaller basketball So you have a greater likelihood of making a shot because the ball is smaller associate with the rim Nobody talks about this uh, you the guy could hold the basketball like it was a softball, right? I mean like his hand would be so gargantuan. He would get 50 rebounds a game He would get like 20 dunks a game Nobody could stop this dude. I think i think i think that wmba that's it has to be wmba That would be i think it would be the best the place to ridicule it.

Oh, that's probably true But I saw this story And it just it just came out and I'm picturing the dad who is somehow being blamed for this buck So this is early tutorial for you dad's always to blame A toddler has breached the white house grounds by slipping through the fence Outside of the white house. They had to shut down the white house Secret service Sorry Secret service had to respond The toddler uh the the access to the complex shutdown Um, the secret service spokesperson stated the officers encountered a curious young visitor Along the white house north fence line who briefly entered the white house grounds Secret service had to seize this kid I I just I I can't stop thinking about the dad who is inevitably being blamed for the kid going through the fence Because buck you'll understand It doesn't matter if if the kid goes through the fence dad should have stopped it from happening And i'm just picturing dad Reaction as he saw probably his two-year-old running across the white house lawn And he was like this family vacation is over Uh, I uh, thankfully the secret service managed to retain this toddler and return him to his parents without a incident But I I would I would love to hear from the parents as they watched their little two-year-old Shprinting across the white house grounds Uh, so that just happened they had to lock down the white house over this This is something for you to keep in mind buck dad is always wrong just prepare for it"
