    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blaigetv.com slash The Blind. Welcome. Welcome to Fearless with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock, your host. We made it. It's Friday. The weekend's here. I hope you're as excited as I am. I'm looking forward to the weekend. It's been a tough, awesome, inspiring, interesting week. We're now into day two of Pride Month. We've been hammering that topic and we're going to get at it in a different way today. We're finally going to interview someone I've been dying to interview for a long time. Riley Gaines, the University of Kentucky swimmer who is at the forefront at the trans athlete issue. Riley, of course, swam against William Leah Thomas in the NCAA's, the University of Pennsylvania transgender swimmer. She's been making news all over the country. I can't wait to talk to Riley and we'll do that in a second. But the first thing I want to do is talk to you guys a little bit about a new partner, a new sponsor for the show. Got to take care of these guys because, one, the beauty of this show and the beauty of working in the podcast space as opposed to corporate television is you actually get to or at least I get to and I'm sure other people at the blaze. We actually get to meet the people that we're in partnership and in sponsorship with so that we can actually know who we're dealing with, know if they fit our profile, know if their values align with ours. And so last week, when Fisher came to town, he has a business called Naturally, it's clean. When and I sat and talked for about an hour last week and a lot of the conversation was just casual about our personal life. A lot of it was about his product. Naturally, it's clean. It's an eco-friendly cleaning product for your kitchen, for your bathrooms, for rugs, carpet, laundry, whatever. It's got it all. It's eco-friendly. It uses enzymes and to help fight stains and things like that. It's one of the most innovative products in the market. It's awesome, but what's even more awesome. I don't even want to say it's more awesome, but what's just as awesome is when Fisher, he shares our values. That as we, in the first week of Pride week, I think that is what's being hammered home to us as we look at what's gone on with Target, as we look at what's gone on with Bud Light, as we look at what's gone on with Chick-fil-A. We have to spend our money with people and businesses and corporations that share our values. When Fisher, naturally it's clean, they share our values. When and I hit it off, he lives in Indiana, my home state, loved the guy, took his products home to my mother in Indianapolis. She loves the product, took it to my own home. I've been using the product guys, and I know I'm speaking to a predominantly male audience. If you don't do the shopping, if you're married and your wife or your spouse takes care of the cleaning products and does the shopping, tell her or him or whomever, they have to switch to naturally it's clean. The product is awesome. I've used it. My mother's used it. I've talked to when Fisher, who runs the company, we have to get on board with Naturally It's Clean.

All right, I just had to get that off our chest. I'm very excited about this new partnership with Naturally It's Clean. Welcome them aboard and then send me an email telling me that you've hopped on board with Naturally It's Clean that will guarantee you a response from me. All right, without further ado, let's bring on one of the most courageous young women in America today, Raleigh Gaines. And it seems funny to say that the one of the most courageous women in the world today and in America today is a swimmer. You know, you're in competitive swim. You don't think that that takes a great deal of courage, but it does when just as a young person at age 22, 23 years old, you decide to hop into this transgender gender dysphoria debate and take a side and take a side that social media and corporate America does not support. Raleigh Gaines has done that. She's faced the criticism. She's faced physical violence when going out and speaking about that it's just not right for biological males to be competing against women in sports. Raleigh Gaines, thank you so much for taking the time and joining us today. You look like everybody's kid, sister, next door. Why did you decide to hop into this fight? First of all, thank you so much for having me on. We're both right here in Nashville, but I couldn't swing it to get there today and I wish I could have. That being said, why? Why have I really been thrust into this position and why I've taken a stance against this? Really, what it boils down to is that I was no longer willing to lie for that entire season, which was my senior year last year at the University of Kentucky, that entire season, our coaches, our athletic directors, the NCAA, the universities, the institutions, they were telling us to go along with this. They were telling us to smile and step aside and allow these men onto our podiums and allow these men into our locker rooms. If you feel uncomfortable about having to undress next to a male, then you're the one who's crazy. You're the one who should seek counseling if you don't want to see an undressed male simultaneously while you're undressing. For a while, it was almost this feeling of you didn't know who to talk to. We talked amongst ourselves as swimmers and as teammates and competitors and we knew this was wrong, but we didn't really know who to convey that to because no one was there to protect us. And so ultimately, when I saw this with my own eyes, when I felt this injustice of competing in a lane over from a six foot four man who towered over the rest of us, I'm dressing in the locker room next to him and he was fully intact with an exposing male genitalia seeing that and then ultimately tying this man at our national championships, which I want to mention, this national championships, it's the fastest meat in the world. It's the most impressive female swimmers in the world gathered together and they raced. When we tied Thomas and I, which almost impossibly enough we did, we went the exact same time down to the 100th of a second. And so upon tying, we get out of the water, we go behind the awards podium and the NCAA official looks at both Thomas and myself and says, great job, but you guys tied. We only have one trophy and we're giving this trophy to Leah. Riley, you have to go home empty handed. And I, of course, was taken aback by this. You know, we went the same time. Why are you giving this trophy to Leah? And I asked, which this was the first time anyone had pushed back on anything that had done this far, so clearly they weren't prepared to answer this question. And he looked at me and he said, well, we have to give the trophy to Leah for photos. Leah has to have it for pictures. So you can pose with this one, but you have to give it back. You go home empty handed. Leah takes the trophy. And that's the point when I knew the competition was wrong. I knew the locker room was wrong, but when they reduced everything that my teammates and I had worked our entire lives for. I started sewing when I was four and I stopped swimming when I was 21, 22. So 18, 17 years of my life, I dedicated to my sport. And when they reduced that down to a photo op to validate the feelings and the identity of a male, that's when I was no longer willing to lie and say that Thomas was a woman because we all knew that was not the case. How much conversation, because I'm sure this was building all season and you knew you were headed to the NCAA's where you may face William Thomas. How much conversation were you having with your parents? And was this your fiance at the time of your husband at the time? How much conversation would you guys have about? You know, if you take this on, you're going to be a lightning rod and it could change the course of your life. How much thought went into this? First and foremost, and it sounds kind of cliche to say this, I never expected it to blow up in the way that it did in speaking out because I had the same thought process that you did. I thought to myself, how can it require courage to say that men and women are different? I didn't think that would ever be something that really thrusts me into this position of fighting for women. Fighting for women and girls, not just in sports, but women and girls in general. We're seeing this overall systemic erasure of women, whether that's in the media, whether that's through corporate America, whether that's in academia, whether that's through the administration that's leading this country right now, the Biden administration. We have a sitting Supreme Court justice who can't even define what a woman is because they claim they're not a biologist. It's so crazy. And so I never once thought this would be the direction my life would go. I graduated from the University of Kentucky with my degree in human health sciences and health law. And I had every intent on being in dental school this year. I actually wanted to practice endodontics, but clearly I'm not performing any root canals and I'm fighting for this because ultimately I saw what was at stake if I didn't fight for this, if someone didn't fight for this. And it's a lot bigger than just women's sports. When they're asking us to say two plus two is five, that's a problem. We can open any history book and see how that turns out for any other civilization. And it's not pretty. The denying of the truth, the silencing of people and the submission of voices from people in power, the changing of the language that we use. And there's a lot of a lot of other factors that go into it, the breakdown of faith, the breakdown of family, the breakdown of freedoms. It points directly at Marxism. And it's relatively easy to see yet we're choosing to ignore it. And that's why I say I saw what was at stake if I didn't fight for this. It's it's I have people all the time who tell me, you know, you're just being a sore loser, which I didn't lose. We tied first of all. But they'll say, you're just being a sore loser. You're drifting off of this situation. You just want your participation, participation trophy. But it's so much bigger than that stupid, silly $5 production trophy that I didn't get to hold. It's not about the trophy. It's about the principle of what's happening in here, what's happening here, and how we're allowing it to happen and how our administration leading this country is actively leading us in this direction. Bad government and bad policy can literally be deadly. Almost 100 people died in Hawaii's Lahaina fires. The most wildfire fatalities the country has seen in the century. But months on from the event, it seems like the media and local and federal governments would rather we all forget what happened. I'm Lauren Chen and to uncover the truth about that day in the aftermath, including through exclusively obtained 911 calls, the blaze and I travel to Maui for this first ever blaze original documentary. And this is just the start of Blaze originals, a new docu series featuring your favorite Blaze TV hosts as we investigate the most important regions of our national theater covering groundbreaking issues and standing in the void left by the elimination of investigative journalism. Watch what really happened in Maui, a blaze original streaming now on BlazeTV.com and use the code Lauren plus to save $36 off your annual subscription. Well, I remember seeing you on Tucker Carlson, I don't know, six, eight months ago, or I don't know how long ago. But it seems like, wow, you have evolved in your understanding of the underlying issues, has multiplied 20 30 times. So if we went back a year, had you given much thought to Marxism and some of the things you unpacked, or is this things you just learned from going through this experience and figuring out where did this come from? How did we get here? Or were you already thinking some of these things before this even happened? By no means was I really taking this outlook on what's going on. I don't like to consider myself naive, but I most certainly was naive to what's going on. And I kind of, I often joke now, I wish I could go back to being naive, not really, but life was more simple when I didn't have to think about all of the different things going on. And just what issues our country is facing, issues that are taking us back in time centuries, by allowing what's this what's happening to women, women and children in particular, which I think is really important to mention. They're going for these, of course, vulnerable populations. What's happening to women? Of course, we have the right to vote, we have the right to own property. But now we have to plead for privacy in our locker rooms. We have to plead for opportunities to deem where worthy. I mean, it just seems wild. And so my perspective this past year has shifted entirely. I have been, I opened, I have seen just how corrupt the media is. I have seen just how corrupt politics can be on both sides. And how that operation really works. I've been spiritually awakened. I've always, I grew up in the church. I'm very fortunate for the family foundation that I have, how they raise me, how they raise me in the church. And so I've always been spiritual. But this past year, I feel like I have so clearly seen how God works and how He puts people in positions that they by no means feel equipped for. I still don't feel equipped for doing what I'm doing and for fighting what I'm fighting. That being said, I've seen so clearly how the devil works and how He moves through people and how He moves through organizations. So yes, this past year, I feel as if I've matured in a way that you can't go through unless you're directly impacted by something like this, which is unfortunate, of course. But that being said, I don't look at myself as any sort of victim. I really look at this situation and what happened to me as something that's optimistic, because it's given me the opportunity to talk about this. It's given me the opportunity to shed light on this in a way that very few people in my position have thus far. I think obviously for certain reasons, one of which being they're so fearful, they're so fearful of this cancel culture that we live in. They're scared to be labeled any of the labels and I've been called them all for simply saying men and women are different. You get called transphobic, you get called homophobic, they lump racist in there, which blows my mind because this has absolutely nothing to do with race, but they'll call you it. And these people are terrified of that. And naturally, no one wants to be called those things. But I've realized now, does it make someone transphobic to say that there are only two sexes? Does it make someone transphobic to say you can't change your sex? And that women are rightfully deserving of equal opportunities and fairness and safety and privacy? And if it does, then by all means, call me it throughout my way. I'm a lot more scared of not standing firm in the truth than I am of being called those things. So that's kind of been my outlook and how it's really shifted this past year. So one of the things that I haven't seen people talk much about, I don't think I've seen anyone talk about, but when you referenced like, hey, I'm in the locker room, this guy's undressing, he's kept his baton balls. I'm a woman, I have to undress here, other women have to undress here. One of the issues I never hear talk about is like, you're married and have a husband. And how is that fair to him? I mean, would you want your husband undressing with a bunch of women in a woman's locker room? Why would your husband want you undressing with a man in a man's locker room? It's incomprehensible to me that people don't think about these issues. It's unfair to your husband. Absolutely it is. I also have a dad who's, he played SEC football, he played in the NFL for a long time. He's a very big, your typical Tennessee guy. And when I called him, both him and my husband, they were at this when mead it was at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. And first of all, we weren't for warned we'd be sharing a locker room. No one told us we would be sharing this changing space. So the only time that we became aware that we were was when we saw Thomas disrobing, again, a six foot four, 22 year old male dropping his clothes fully intact with an exposing male genitalia. That's how we became aware that we'd be undressing next to him. And so I immediately left that locker room and I called my dad and I called my husband. And when I called my dad and I told him, you know, dad, we just had to undress next to a man. My dad was there watching the mead and he says, Riley, I'm coming down there and I'm going to handle this myself. And I said, dad, you can't do that. We already have one man in the locker room. We definitely don't need to. And I don't want to have to talk to you through through bars at a jail cell. So don't come down here. This will will handle this. And so I went out of the locker room and I asked one of the officials on the pool deck. I said, what are the guidelines that allow a male with male parts to undress in our women's locker room? And so nonchalantly, this official said, Oh, well, we actually just got around this by making the locker rooms unisex. No big deal. And so then I'm sitting there thinking unisex. So any man could have walked into our locker room, any coach, any official, any parent, any dad, any man who wanted to, any pervert who wanted to be in that locker room, would have had full access and full reigns and fair minimum. We weren't told about it. It felt like this, this feeling of betrayal. It felt like the people who were supposed to be there to protect us and protect our privacy had failed miserably, again, not even alerting us that this would be the situation at hand until we had to see it with our own eyes. It was disgusting. It was perverse. It's obviously it's wrong. It's unethical. It's immoral. It's crazy to think that this is actually not only is it just happening. It's almost as if it was being celebrated. It was being encouraged to happen because after this meet, Leah Thomas, again, a male who swam three years on the men's team at University of Pennsylvania, a very mediocre male, breaking 462nd in the country at best the year prior. After this meet, Leah Thomas was nominated for NCAA Woman of the Year, which is why I say this is being encouraged. How are we nominating this person for Woman of the Year, which is the most prestigious collegiate honor for female athletes? I was also nominated, but this nomination immediately was devalued to me when I saw that Thomas was nominated as well. So listening to you talk about your dad and his instincts, because those are those are thoughts that have run through my mind. What if this was my daughter and to hear that your dad, former Vanderbilt football player, former NFL football player, his instincts are right. Like I'm coming down there to take care of this baby. Get out of my way. How have you kept him at bay and how have you kept him feeling, being able to sleep at night because that is like, I've sat there. If this was my daughter, I just don't know if I'd want her out there in this way, but clearly they've raised you in a way that you're going to stick to your values and you're willing to take on this fight. Just your mom and dad sound like really unique people. They absolutely are. And again, I talked about my family foundation. I think why my parents have have kind of stayed back and let me handle this is because they know I can handle this. Unfortunately, they know my stubbornness. They know my sass. They get it. They saw it for 18 years before I went to college. And while they didn't necessarily appreciate it at the time, they most certainly do now. My dad, he knows I'm a leader. I was I was team captain at University of Kentucky in my years there, my junior and senior year. He knows that I'm unwavering. He knows that I'm not going to back down from from what I know to be right from the biblical truth, from biological reality, from of course, objective truth. And they know that. And again, I couldn't be more fortunate for the support that I have with them, with my friends, with my teammates, with my coaches and my athletic director who have been so incredibly supportive of me. After this all happened before I took a public stance, I immediately called my athletic director. And his name is Mitch Barnhart at the University of Kentucky. And he's a phenomenal guy. We had an amazing relationship, of course, before this. But I called him. And I said, Mitch, you know, this is what's happening. This is how we feel. And when I say we, I met my team at the University of Kentucky, because we talked about this and we all felt how I'm speaking to you. I said, how do you feel Mitch? If I take a public stance and acknowledging that this is wrong and it's harmful to women. And he said, Riley, I love you. I support you. I'm behind you. Don't he said, I will never forget. He said, speak your heart, stay true to your convictions, and don't worry about painting this university in a bad light. And at the time, I thought nothing of it. I thought, okay, you know, sounds great. Thank you. Hung up the phone. But now after talking to other girls at other universities, he is the only athletic director in the NCAA who has taken that approach. Bar some Christian schools, especially of the SEC of the ACC of the power five. He's the only one who has said this. And I've talked to these girls at these other universities and the silencing that they're dealing with. It's truly chilling. It's terrifying to think that these institutions and these universities have this much way and this much fear instilling, that they're enabling all of their women's sports teams to really be silenced. Riley, I need you to give me like 60 seconds to take care of another one of our sponsors. But I want to ask you about Samantha Ponder and Sage Steel, some people with some big platforms that are starting to show you some support. But I want to talk a little bit about our good friends at Preborn. You guys know Preborn. I have to admit, it's probably my favorite sponsor. They have given us a purpose here at Fearless. We have developed a mindset about when life begins at conception. And we know that supporting life in the womb is the key to developing a right, the right mindset and the right attitude on life outside the womb. You can't properly develop life and wait until it's outside the womb. You know that talking to your baby while in the womb increases. Talking, reading to your baby increases the baby's intelligence. No, it's undeniable that life begins inside the womb. Preborn recognizes that and that's why expected mothers who are thinking about abortion, Preborn provides them an ultrasound to provide them the ultimate proof that life begins inside the womb. They show a woman that heartbeat, they show them that ultrasound, that image of the baby inside their womb, women then choose life. And that's when Preborn really gets into the game, providing women the tools, the accessory items, the help and support both financially and mentally to get them through the first two years of that baby's life. In the womb and outside the womb, it is an awesome, awesome experience to donate money and support Preborn. As Fearless Soldiers, we do this all the time. You know how I do it. I go to preborn.com slash Jason and give my money that way. There's other ways to do it. All you got to do is hit pound 250 on your phone. Say the keyword baby, you can give that way. Be a good Fearless Soldier. We support life inside the womb because God knew us inside the womb. He made us inside the womb. This is important. If you want to be a Fearless Soldier, I need you to support Preborn. We got to support babies. We got to save lives. Preborn has saved more than a quarter million babies lives in its existence. Dan Stein, I told you about the opportunity to meet the founders of these companies and make sure that they're on board with what we're on board with. You guys have seen Dan Stein on this show. Great man shares our values, great organization. The money goes directly to the ultrasound. It's not wasted on mid-level and high-level executives. Preborn.com slash Jason or pound 250, say the keyword baby, $28 pays for one ultrasound, 140 pays for five. Give what you can. Send me an email about it. I'll guarantee you a response from me, Fearless, Blaishow at Gmail. Send me an email about your Preborn donation and I will respond. All right, let's get back to one of the most courageous people in America who has been joined now by Samantha Ponder and Sage Still was already out there supporting Riley. But in the past weeks, Sam Ponder from ESPN, she hosts their NFL countdown show. It's a high profile position. ESPN and Disney are about as woke as any corporation you can get. It takes great courage for Sam Ponder and Sage Still to step out there and support Riley. How has their support made you feel Riley? It's been huge for so long and speaking about this, especially speaking about this in regards to sports, people in the sporting industry, such as ESPN, of course, such as the NCAA, the International Olympic Committee, sports-specific governing bodies such as FIFA, US rowing, all of the sport governing bodies. They've been silent surrounding this, which blows my mind how you could see this happening, knowing sports, knowing the differences of course between men and women when it comes to sheer athleticism or anything that requires strength and be silent. Having Sage Still come out first and support this, I really, when I saw this, my heart was overjoyed because I knew what this meant. I knew more people would follow behind, closely behind, because of course, courage begets courage. It takes one person such as Sage Still to take this stance and more people will follow. And that's exactly what Sam Ponder has done. Their support, both privately and publicly to me, has meant the world. But again, not just to me, it means the world to so many, to so many girls who were in my same position, who didn't have and who don't have that support from their athletic director like I did. Or they don't have any of that family foundation that I mentioned, or those younger girls who are playing in middle school and high school and who are terrified of talking about this. It gives them hope. And so to have them on my side, fighting alongside me, especially given their platform and the influence that they have, again, I can only be hopeful that more in their same position will closely follow. What has shocked me, Riley, is that I think male athletes should be your biggest supporters, because we know, and a long time ago, long before you were born, I used to be a college football player. Don't look at now, but trust me, take my word for it. There's proof on the internet. We know better than anybody that we have an advantage. Physically over women. And so I'm sitting here like, where are the jocks, the X jocks, the NFL players, NBA players, they're all on ESPN, they're on Fox Sports. I'm surprised that male athletes aren't coming out. They have daughters. They know how unfair this is. I'm shocked at the silence of men. As am I, this conversation very easily gets centered around girls and women. But it's so true. We need men. We need the men, of course, in these positions of power, such as in these governing bodies, in the NCAA, typically a lot of athletic directors and coaches, they're men. I've recently called for a boycott among female athletes, but let it be on record right here right now that I'm calling that I'm calling for a boycott of male athletes. We need them. They need to take a stance. They need to send a message and that message is, of course, that men and women are different and that women are worthy of fair competition. What we're seeing, of course, this is only going one way. We're not seeing women infiltrate into men's sports, especially at the competitive level. We're not seeing women asked to be in men's prisons. We're not seeing women going into men's locker rooms and restrooms. This is only going one way. These men, they're not a jeopardy here. Therefore, so many of them have been silent, but I love what you mentioned about these men having daughters. They have a lot of them, especially even the Democrats, legislators and politicians and senators and delegates who make these laws that enable this, that allow women to be rid of opportunities. These are dads. These are moms of young daughters and you're telling me they're perfectly fine with their young daughter undressing next to a fully grown man who, again, is fully intact with an exposing male genitalia right next to them. They're okay with that. If that answer is truly yes, I think there's another conversation that needs to be had and it probably needs to involve child protective services because that's really sadistic if you're a parent and you're okay with your daughter being in that position. And so yes, I entirely agree. We need masculinity. It's been deemed masculinity is toxic and it's bad, but oh my gosh, there's a saying and it's hard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. Weak men create hard times. And of course, it's the cycle. And I think right now we're in the cycle of weak men creating hard times, which we can only hope garners these weak times creating strong men. That being said, parents, teacher, sons, masculinity, teach them to be protectors and providers because we've gone so far away from that. And it shows it really does. We need strong men, we need strong women. Don't shy away from being strong and being bold. Well, end on this note and I'm not asking this to be snarky or funny, but I just kind of want your take. Caitlyn Jenner has been rational about this. What do you think of his take on or Caitlyn's take? I'll try to stay away from pronouns, but he still got his baton balls. So I'm just, but he's been on your side. What do you think of Caitlyn Jenner? I think Caitlyn's experience in terms of understanding gender dysphoria, but also understanding what it takes to be an elite athlete is pretty powerful. There are, of course, things that Caitlyn does that I don't agree with. But I think in regards to protecting women's sports, I think having that understanding of the value of sports, the understanding of, of course, how Caitlyn, when competing as Bruce would have compared alongside the other males, or excuse me, of course, compared to the males, but also in competing with the females, he knows what it would have been like in that situation. And so I think that added value there while also understanding this gender dysphoria, which seems to, of course, take in this rampant exponential. It's a trend, in my opinion, not to say that I don't think there are some people who truly struggle with this. That also being said, I don't think that everyone who is identifying as trans nowadays, actually is struggling with gender dysphoria. And I'm certain that Leah Thomas didn't. I think that experience that's interesting. Hold on for a second, I don't know if I've heard you say that. You don't think you think Leah Thomas is just a total scam that there is no gender dysphoria? Yeah, you're right. You really haven't heard me say that because I've been hesitant to, of course, speculate. I like to say a lot of my stuff with certainty, but I am almost certain that this point, of course, I'm not living in Leah Thomas's body. I don't know. But it has come out now based off of content that Leah Thomas has engaged with in social media in regards to being an AGP, which just stands for an autogonophiliac, which just means you're sexually aroused as dressing as a woman. Also, my understanding of gender dysphoria is that you are dysphoric about your gender. Therefore, if you're a man and you're, of course, still intact with your male parts, how would you feel comfortable undressing in front of women? That's not someone what someone with gender dysphoria does. And I've had conversations again, I really like to be well versed about this, because I think it's important to come from a place of understanding and come from a place of considering perspectives. And so I've talked to many trans identifying individuals who I genuinely do believe struggle with just this gender dysphoria. And they said they're so dysphoric about their gender, they would never feel comfortable openly undressing in front of a roomful of the opposite sex. That's not what gender dysphoria is. And so my understanding of Leah Thomas is I do think there's some other underlying mental delusions there. But in my understanding, and what I've seen based off of what Thomas has portrayed is this isn't really someone who's transgender, this is a transvestite. And we were subjected to participating in this person's fetish. I think you're right. I'm glad you said it. I certainly believe it. And then, and this is just another obvious point. It was like, everybody went out of their way to make sure Bill Leah Thomas felt good and felt affirmed. And no one was worried about Riley Gaines or any of the other women, how they felt, were they comfortable with it? And again, because I don't, undressing in front of the opposite sex. Sometimes undressing in front of your own sex or whatever. It ain't the most comfortable feeling in the world, but no one cares. They only cared about how the, and I think I agree, the transvestite, how he felt, was took priority over everything else. Leah, I'm not, Leah. Well, thank you so much for coming on the show. It was awesome to meet you. I, one day I think you might be president of the United States of America. And I hope that that's true because our grandkids and the next generation will be in better shape. You were, I hope you take this as a compliment, but you remind me of a young Carrie Lake. And, and man, you got a set and I appreciate it. Well, thank you. And thank you for having me on really. I appreciate it so much. Have a great weekend. That's Riley Gaines. Wow. She ain't scared. All right. We'll play some tomorrow and we'll see you next week. No negotiation, my system, all relation. We just want a hat. Free to. Sitting on a corner, never been long. I'll wreck my back for free to bless. We are living get back. We are receiving all the seed when we are on the beat. Free to. I just want, I want to be. I just want, I want to be. I just want, I want to be. I just want, I want to be. I just want, I want free. I want free."
