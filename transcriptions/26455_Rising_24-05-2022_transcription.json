    "text": " Good morning and welcome to Rising. We have a fantastic show for you today. It tells me to say great but I'm feeling fantastic. Brianna what do we have? Well Dr. Amesh Adalja will join to answer all our questions about the spreading monkey POTS virus especially whether the panic is truly justified. Plus our Rising panel will weigh in on what may be the final nail in the coffin of Donald Trump and Mike Pence's alliance. But first entering the misinformation discourse is none other than Dr. Anthony Fauci he spoke out against the spread of falsehoods online while delivering Princeton University's commencement address yesterday. Fauci proselytized that if something doesn't change soon quote then truth means nothing integrity means nothing and facts mean nothing. Being in Washington has allowed me to experience firsthand the intensity of the divisiveness in our nation. What troubles me is that differences of opinion or ideology have in certain situations been reflected by egregious distortions of reality. Sadly elements of our society have grown increasingly adnured to a cacophony of falsehoods and lies that often stand largely unchallenged ominously leading to an insidious acceptance of what I call the normalization of untruths. We see this happen daily with falsehoods propagated through a range of information platforms by a spectrum of people including sad to say certain elected officials in positions of power. Physician healed myself about all the misinformation that has sprung from the well spring of knowledge that is Dr. Anthony Fauci. It's not that he's wrong it's that he is completely lacking any insight about the role that he has played in that right. I think everyone is kind of in the same boat where it's frustrating that there is this bifurcation that's happened these very different camps that believe very different things. I think everyone is struggling to figure out how to understand what is real no matter what your ideological perspective. I think that diagnosis doctor is correct but at the end of the day I think I don't want us to kind of participate in the bifurcation by not acknowledging that it is very difficult in the information age and it is very difficult when there's so much partisanship that is affected people's translation of science. It is so difficult when there's so many political incentives that are driving different so-called like scientific decisions and decisions about whether or not to open up businesses or not decisions about whether or not to distribute certain kind of mass or pay for certain kinds of vaccines and all of this to find out what you should really do for your own personal safety and I do find myself wishing there was some kind of good housekeeping keeping seal of approval that could vet information but we see how that goes what this misinformation are and I don't know what the solution is. It's like every man is an island all of a sudden. I also am increasingly troubled that misinformation, disinformation, mal-information whatever you call it seems now it is the framing that liberals that Democrats have chosen it is their way to understand what has happened over the last six, four years however long it's been and that framing is I think increasingly suspect or like the buy-in to it is tremendous so much reporting the whole like disinformation reporting industry now right they wanted to create a czar about it it is the way liberals seem to try to understand what's happening is there's rapid spread of disinformation manufactured by hysterical right-wing people and propagated to the masses making them you know foolish and suspicious and crazy but isn't it just entirely wrong like are people more more misinformed today than ever before like where is the I want to see some science or some polling on that like people have been misinformed about policy and politics yeah you know basic questions of expertise I don't know that it's anything other than and I think I was talking about this last week the role that social media is playing and the fact that people have all had all kinds of opinions and takes throughout human history but chiseling it into my little rock tablet and spreading it on reddit have two different kind of valences and levels of effect I also while I completely agree that it's a weird framing that liberals have taken that like politicizes the idea of misinformation in a way that is out of step with the fact that it's always existed it is a flip side of I think what conservatives do which is the kind of conspiratorial they're lying to us right one side says you know there are people who don't believe the authoritative facts coming down on the high and the other side that says I can't believe the authoritative facts or anything that comes from the government because it's pizza gate or QAnon or these other kinds of less serious or less extreme kinds of untruths and I don't know how to bridge that gap I will also say that the vast majority of people I think are somewhere in the middle and not quite as suspicious and distrustful of things I think the most people still open the New York Times or Washington Post or whatever your rack of choices and trust it but I do think that part of what the appetite is for shows like this with people with multiple opinions talking to each other is that no one knows what the truth is and it might as well have two people with different ideas hash it out and get some sense of truthiness from the by between them and who just seems more credible on their faith. It just seems like a bad way to understand what's happening say it's not because you know speaking the Democrats it's not because the policies we're offering are not what the people want or we've you know lost sense of who our voters are or we speak to them using a new cultural vocabulary that you know elite college grad students came up with that everyone hates it can't be any of these things the reason we're losing we're losing because the people are being like hypnotized by you know an old school guy with the pendulum. Yeah well and Russia was the biggest bookie man in that regard and I think it's really to the detriment of the Democratic Party to refuse to acknowledge and take any accountability for its own personal feelings over time. There is no reason it needs to be losing but to the extent that it engages in any of the misinformation campaign it's just to stir the pot and make it worse and again never reflect on all of the things it has gotten wrong. Those people end up those people the people most obsessed with the kind of misinformation that most involved in the misinformation reporting industry end up sounding like conspiracy theorists themselves because they that's how they they're connecting all the dots. So this is why everything's happening because this tweet went viral harassment campaigns that's all there is. Right. It's like no. Right. Right. Meanwhile former Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway called out Dr. Fauci in her new memoir Cusing the White House science advisor of foregoing masks while in private Conway allegedly wrote quote no mask was standard fair in the White House situation room where Dr. Fauci was more likely to wear Dr. Fauci socks than a mask surprise surprise surprise now because I mean consider the source it's Kellyanne Conway but it would not surprise me at all that he was demasking in private. Because so many people are like this. I think that so many people you know have non scientific assessments of their own risk. And while I understand as a public health official the gap between what you are you know if you feel compelled to tell the public and what you practice in your own house might be bigger and might feel more problematic as a consequence. I don't think if that unusual for people to not necessarily practice what you preach. But it's so deeply frustrating is that there was so much moralizing around it from people who knew that they weren't doing those same kinds of behaviors in their own lives. And I also think that a lot of liberals my observation has been there's a comfort level in demasking when people think they're around other liberals because they think that they're safe like COVID magically is not spreading among. Because COVID only afflicts bad people not good people. Right. And if you're if you're if you're impure then you're vulnerable. Well getting some of it is. That's how they talk about it. Some of it is the perception that obviously if you are engaging in one risk taking behavior the likely that you are going to be getting COVID and spreading COVID is higher and that's reasonable. But there is I think that doesn't translate to you have no risk just because there's someone else that's being safe. Lots of people get COVID people who've been trying very hard and being very careful get COVID and moralizing to the degree where you think that you're safe just because somebody voted the same way that you did. And unmasking and public or unmasking at fancy functions is gross. You're a good person Briana which is why you haven't gotten it yet. I'm not a good person which is why I think I'm due for round two anytime now. I mean I wasn't going to say it. What about are you going to be remasking aggressively because of the monkey pox? No not because of my I haven't stopped masking in high risk situations. So I still mask when I go into stores and you know ride in Ubers and go on public transportation and things like that. And I've really enjoyed not getting any cold of any kind for about two years now after being a very very sick gal usually so why not why stop? Well we'll be talking more about monkey pox and the risks and so forth in just a minute. And we're going to tell you what's on my radar I believe coming up next. Looking forward to it. Robbie what's on your radar today? Okay it's finally time to get into it. Johnny Depp's defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard has entered its sixth and final week with closing arguments expected on Friday. Depp is seeking 50 million in damages in order to punish Heard for implying that he was a domestic abuser in a Washington Post op-ed. Heard contends that Depp was indeed abusive and his countersued for 100 million dollars. Their conflict is messy, it's salacious and the public can't seem to look away. With the fraud attempt by everyone involved, trial participants and onlookers to condense a rocky relationship into a neat uncomplicated story about one hero and one villain should give us pause about the wisdom of formally arbitrating such things. Anything the Depp heard trial in my opinion calls to mind sort of student hook up disputes that frequently occur on college campuses were previously adjudicated in accordance with ill-conceived federal guidance relating to Title IX where obvious instances of unwise behavior on both sides were often ignored in favor of simplistic victim perpetrator narratives such campus adjudication is expected to make a comeback presently. The Biden administration is planning to release new guidance any week now that will likely be a disaster. More on that in just a minute but first the Depp Heard trial has in fact captured the public's fascination. It's not surprising. The involved parties are famous movie stars with active careers and other celebrities are lining up behind one or the other. Eva Green, a co-star with Depp in Dark Shadows, wrote on Instagram that there is no doubt Johnny will emerge with his good name and wonderful heart revealed to the world. The comedian Kathy Griffin on the other hand has shared articles that are supportive of Heard. The media is closely covering the proceedings. Many liberal and feminist commentators lament the widespread mockery of Heard on social media while the pro-Depp camp, including those who think the Me Too movement has treated men unfairly and also people who just happen to be fans of the actor feel vindicated. Heard and Depp began dating in 2009, they married in 2015 and divorced 15 months later. In December of 2018, Heard wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post in which she came out as a quote, domestic abuse survivor. The article in question did not mention Depp by name but Depp was perceived to be the abuser in question. During the trial it was revealed that employees of the American Civil Liberties Union actually wrote the op-ed and Heard had promised to give the organization $3.5 million from her divorce settlement. Depp filed suit arguing that the article was defamatory and in fact Heard had abused him, not the other way around. What has emerged at the trial is good evidence that both Depp and Heard have treated each other very badly. Witnesses have testified to Depp's overuse of alcohol and drugs and how they affected his behavior. Heard for her part was manipulative and cruel and has admitted to throwing pots and pans and even striking Depp. Conclusive evidence that Depp was the more abusive of the two has not yet emerged. However, and plenty of testimony suggests that Heard is telling exaggerations or outright falsehoods about the extent of her injuries due to alleged sexual and physical abuse. As the new republics Natalie Shore explained in a perceptive piece about the trial, quote, \"...most significant eyewitnesses, her own sister Whitney Henricas, whose former colleague and roommate has claimed that Henricas had apparently moved out of Depp and heard home because she was scared of her sister. And contemporaneously confided that Henricas saw Heard attack Depp not the other way around, an account corroborated by Depp's bodyguard on duty, the extreme brutality of what Heard alleges coupled with an utter lack of independent corroboration of anything, even approaching the extent of her story, and the fact that several of Depp's former partners have insisted he display no abusive behavior before Heard met him when he was in his 50s, makes her account very hard to swallow, resting the integrity of feminism on Amber Heard's word is an awfully shaky bet.\" End quote. That's from Natalie Shore, the new republic. Now given that Heard is demonstrably not a reliable narrator, sure warns against drawing any broad, sweeping conclusions. This trial is just a referendum on the reputation of two rich and famous actors who treated each other jaw-droppingly terribly in the most dramatic fashion possible. Shore writes, So that's a solid retort to op-eds in the New York Times that have mourned the resulting death of me too, or complained that the trial is really about the historical misogynistic desire to watch women suffer. Quote, this is a good old-fashioned public pillering, writes Tom Times contributing editor Jessica Bennett, only memes have replaced the stones. Heard was undoubtedly wrong to try to turn her bad marriage into a good PR for her personal brand as an aspiring Me Too feminist and ACLU mouthpiece. That doesn't mean that filing suit was the correct response, the defamation bar is extremely high, and Depp could lose, even if he is broadly correct that Heard's abusive behavior is equal to or worse than his own. Now if one were to try and make some actual useful broader observation, which I'm going to attempt to do here, it would probably start by recognizing that sexual encounters, relationships, and marriages are often difficult. People can abuse each other in a variety of ways. Trying to account for all the ways in which one embittered partner has harmed another in an attempt to assign abuser and abuse status, that's an extremely fraught exercise. But this is of course the exact exercise undertaken at all publicly funded institutions of higher learning since the days of the Obama administration. Under the auspices of compliance with Title IX, the federal law that mandate sex and gender equality in schools, something I've talked about and Emily Jisinski has talked a lot about in our Raiders for this show, the Obama-era education department's Office for Civil Rights instructed universities to adjudicate sexual misconduct disputes in a manner granting extraordinary deference to whichever student filed the first complaint. Often placing accusers in situations where they essentially had to prove their innocence against a presumption of guilt. The Trump administration reformed these policies such that accused students and faculty members enjoyed considerably more due process rights. Importantly, the Trump-era policies allowed for parties in a sexual misconduct dispute to settle the matter informally through mediation. The previous guidance had required institutions to conduct investigations, often involving a single employee with total authority over the procedure, even without the approval or participation of the so-called victim. Unfortunately, the Biden administration has given every indication that it will undo some or all of these changes. The department has said it will unveil new guidance in June. It's not clear how extensive the rollback will be, but with Catherine Layman, Obama's czar of Title IX, back in her exact same position, there's little reason for optimism. Anyone who cringes at the extent to which two people can destroy each other's lives, I'm cringing, and reputations when given the opportunity to air their grievances in such a manner should be steadfastly against any return to form. That's my attempt to bring a Robbie adjacent point into this kind of debate. I was only following the trial here and there, and then I started really catching up on it more recently. I don't see why people enjoy watching this. People are loving watching this. I can't, like it's just so awkward for me to watch people who used to care about each other, go at each other like this, but it seems so clear that there's just like it's a messy relationship, bad treatment of each other. The more serious claims that Heard has suggested and implied could very well be true, but she hasn't really produced the kind of evidence, and she has the witnesses who have testified to her own very manipulative and quasi abusive behavior calls that into the question, but it's a bad relationship. It's some level you shouldn't adjudicate bad relationships because there's going to be a lot of wrongdoing here in both cases. So I mean, then it's worth asking why they are adjudicating this right now. It's because Johnny Depp brought this defamation claim based on some sentences in this op-ed that you referenced that make Johnny's case pretty hard because what she said, she didn't name Johnny Depp specifically, she said, I'm speaking out against domestic violence and making this broader argument about the perniciousness of domestic violence in our society because I too have been the victim of domestic violence and people read into that, but she was talking about Johnny Depp and then he brought this claim, which makes us burden of proof in this civil case. It's pretty difficult for him because not only does he have to prove that it was about him and intentionally about him, that it was a claim that was made with malice with the intent to harm him. And given that, you know, it seems from the testimony that's come out so far, they both were abusive to each other in various sorts of ways. The fact of Amber Heard also being a bad actor here doesn't help Johnny Depp and his defamation claim if he also was a bad actor. So part of what's so frustrating in all of this is that the appetite for this and the focus on Amber Heard's bad acts, which, you know, it's legitimate, they're bad acts, is in some ways, I think indicative of people, for people of an appetite for undermining me too. Since this case isn't actually about that, the case is about what Johnny Depp did, like legally, not morally, but legally it's about what Johnny Depp did. The fact that there's such an appetite for Amber Heard's behavior and the viral hashtags of, you know, me too, gone and all of this stuff, it's adjusted people that the simmering resentments from that movement are still there. And people are capitalizing on this case as a way to push a broader political agenda. And that's unfortunate because this is this is a bad case to make for me too. And it's a bad case for people who are trying to make some broader claims about the non-existence of me too as a phenomenon. I think I mostly agree with that. Yes, the bar, the defamation bar is a very high one to clear for good reason. Especially for public figures. Yeah, I don't know that he's going to even come close to clearing it. You're right, he wasn't specifically named. She said she was a domestic, she that she had gone through domestic abuse. That's not actually very specific language even. And it looks actually clear from airing the facts that there was some abuse of behavior in both directions. But that doesn't matter for the defamation claim. So I absolutely agree with you on all that. The reason that, but she tried to cash in on her. She wanted the victimhood status. She wanted a, this is the me too moment and I am a, I should be a figure of it because of what I went through. And that was not a wise choice on her part either. The ACLU really screwed up by getting themselves involved in this, in my opinion. That whole thing is very shady and then like the promising of the money from the divorce. There's something just not right about all of that, which is a kind of different discussion. Actually, we've had this discussion previous on the show. So that is also, that is a proxy. I mean, he responded to that. I don't know that the lawsuit was really the right way necessarily to respond to it. And now we're in this situation where it's just you're watching two people go through every aspect of a really messy relationship. And it is all, and I would rather, I would rather it was not happening. Well, in some ways, this might be exactly, I mean, I don't know what's going on in Johnny Depp's head, but to the extent that he was hurt or frustrated or made angry by Amber Heard's op-ed, this is one way to have retribution, not because he actually might win this claim, but because now we know all these salacious details about the relationship that Amber Heard would prefer not to be made known. And people can make their own independent judgments about whether or not that's a justified reaction or whether the punishment fits the crime now that we're all talking about Amber Heard pooping in a bed or whatever the next narrative event is. But it certainly doesn't do much for public discourse. And I, for one, will be happy when this private issue becomes a private issue once again. Some private issues should remain private issues. I agree. Well, HBO's Bill Maher made the rounds on social media for his monologue on trans kids. We'll discuss that next. Bill Maher is facing backlash online for a segment he did on the growing rate of self-identifying LGBTQ people in the country, including children who identify as trans. Let's watch. Broken down over time, the LGBT population of America seems to be roughly doubling every generation. According to a recent Gallup poll, less than 1% of Americans, born before 1946, that's Joe Biden's generation, identify that way. 2.6% of boomers do, 4.2% of Gen X, 10.5% of millennials, and 20.8% of Gen Z. Which means if we follow this trajectory, we will all be gay in 2015. And it's okay to ask questions about something that's very new and involves children. The answer can't always be that anyone from a marginalized community is automatically right Trump card, mic drop, end of discussion. Because we're literally experimenting on children. Maybe that's why Sweden and Finland have stopped giving puberty blockers to kids. Because we just don't know much about the long-term effects. Perhaps the most controversial part of what Maher had to say was when he suggested a quote, trendy element to identifying as transgender. If we can't admit that in certain enclaves, there is some level of trendiness to the idea of being anything other than straight, then this is not a serious science-based discussion. It's a blow being struck in the culture wars using children as cannon fodder. I don't understand parents who won't let their nine-year-old walk to the corner without a helmet and epipen and a GPS tracker. And God forbid their lips touch dairy. But but hormone blockers and genital surgery fine. Maher later tweeted, quote, if this spike in trans children is all biological, why is it regional? Either Ohio is shaming them or California is creating them. To which former Ohio State Senator Nina Turner hit back, quote, trans children in Ohio are constantly under attack from our state and local government. Trans people are everywhere. Governments are regional. And that's a fair point. And in fact, the thing he tweeted was probably, I thought the least well thought out part of the entire of the entire monologue because yes, people will come out more likely to do so in areas where the policies or the people, the culture are more friendly. Why are people buying more sunscreen in California than they are in Alaska? It's crazy. Fair on that point. Fair. That was a fair rebuttal. And but most of the monologue I thought was quite good. The point we just did play about, yeah, parents won't let their kids make any choices all because of safety on all sorts of front that way to controlling, I think, in terms of like walking parents won't let their kids walk to the law sometimes doesn't let you let your kids play at the playground by themselves or walk to school by themselves. And yet we're deciding that that very invasive medical procedures for young children with that like no questions asked should be performed. And don't mistake me. I think transgender people are real. I think a lot of people, many children even probably do suffer from gender dysphoria. And I'm sure treatment is a good option. Maybe invasive treatment for some cases. Absolutely. They should talk to doctors about it. Therapists, if you're taught, you think your child is in this scenario. Yes. Not at all saying this should be outlawed or shouldn't be done. But does seem that the activists on transgender issues from my interactions with them on social media from the thing, there's an automatic affirmation of anyone who expresses any, I mean, very young kids, any discomfort at all about their sex or their gender. And there's a kind of, well, this is the answer for you. And this is what you should do that there's no way it fits in even a majority of these cases. So I think the first push back that people would give is that the idea that parents are very concerned about the risks and health risks that their children are facing, the joke about dairy, which I think is a rather in-opportuned joke, you know, week after recovering that babies are drinking or have a formula deficit and who drink dairy milk or, you know, throwing up blood and all these sorts of things. But never mind. The point is that there are actual health consequences that result from not engaging in certain kind of treatments as well. And the very parent who's very concerned about their kid consuming dairy or being unsafe in the world, it's consistent with that concern to not want them to be risking suicidal ideation and all the other things that often come with not responding to a kid with, you know, dysmorphia who believes they were born in the wrong body in the right way. I also think that Bill Mardis, this thing where he pretends as though, you know, hormone therapy or gender blockers or surgery. First of all, he conflates all of these interventions, some of which are indicated at earlier ages than others, many of which the most, you know, involved of which don't come into later in life. He conflates them all to drive a panic about how, what is going on with a nine-year-old, a nine-year-old is what he brings up in this example. As though a nine-year-old is getting top surgery, as though a nine-year-old has a top. So I think all of that is frustrating and also the erasure of the risks attended to not giving kids the kind of treatments they need. I also think that he really downplays all of the psychological evaluations and the difficult hurdles that exist for kids to take advantage of those kinds of interventions. And finally, I think the reason why we can't have these conversations in a reasonable way, and I think there are reasonable concerns that parents have and that folks are raising, is because people like Bill Maher, the least equipped to have a conversation and are such alarmist, uses a chart about growing identification as LGBT to attack people coming out increasingly as trans as trendy. I mean, it's a chart of people identifying as LGBTQIA. That's a lot of people in Mary who are identifying as bi or fluid or asexual and things like that. And it is really frustrating that it seems like the T in that series of letters is constantly the kind of bully, the punching bag for folks like Maher who seem to anticipate and understand that there's not as much of a cultural appetite for beating up on gay people anymore. Everybody knows a gay person that seems in opportunity. That's fair. I think that now there's never any, I'm sorry, it seems odd to me that there's never a trans person involved in any of these conversations. Just have someone, let's just talk it out. Let's just talk it out. But it's always this very one-sided, oftentimes disingenuous conversation that prevents people who might be open to legitimate critiques of having that conversation. I have yet to find the activists on this issue don't want to have conversations about it. In fact, they scream at me that the questions I have about it are examples of legitimating violence against them or something of that nature all the time. The most unfriendly and hostile, shrieking of liberal voices in the entire progressive movement are people obsessed with this issue. I do think that there has been, I have had difficulty sourcing people to come on the show and have a conversation about it because there is a presumption that anyone engaged in the conversation is taking any kind of nuanced addressing of the issues as acting a bad fate. I think that's true. I also don't think interlocutors like Bill Maher are helping in that regard when the conversations are being driven in context like this or context like comedy shows, Dave Chappelle shows and stuff like that where there is some question I think from people who legitimately feel under attack and legitimately feel like there's a lot of difficulty and hurdle to actually coming out as transgender and getting the kind of medical care that they like. That being erased from a conversation makes them, I think, more hostile and less likely to want to engage in a world of fear. We're focusing on this and this is a legitimate public policy question because it involves kids and it involves medical procedures that are so the puberty blockers are right to delay puberty so that you get the surgeries later. But we don't know, there is some, there's reporting on the puberty blockers are not entirely necessarily consequence free and my friend Jesse single has done a lot of reporting on this, a lot of reporting that really, really ticked off the transgender activist community. Katie Herzog has done a lot of reporting on people who did transition, had this procedure recommended to them based on their supposed discomfort in their own bodies only to later want to go back and it was not right for them and you're not supposed to even talk about those cases, which are numerous. I certainly think that you should be allowed to talk about those cases but it's also the case and Jesse single I think was rightly very careful to make this point in his much maligned Atlantic article from a few years back that those cases are very, very rare and de-transitioners are the very small minority people who ever transition and again, this is the risk. The risk is that by talking about the transitioners who deserve to be heard and that deserves to be a part of the public record, you are skewing people's perception of what the risks are against the risks of not, allowing people to transition. That's true of people who go through with the transition but there are a large number of people of kids diagnosed with gender dysphoria but then never actually end up going through with the transition and then later do no longer identify as having gender dysphoria. So all of those have gone. What's the harm in saying, okay it seems like you're presenting with gender dysphoria. It sounds like the medical recommendation there is just a wait off hold off or have a psychological intervention, you know therapy and intervention. No right that was the correct course of action. But if we had been in a mindset of oh no gender dysphoria okay let's start let's get everything going. That would have been wrong. I think there's a misrepresentation of how many people are in that mindset. I'm not saying that there's never a doctor in the whole history of the world that is overzealous. That happens in many cases and many kinds of medical interventions. But it strikes me as curious, you said it a little while ago that this is a public health concern because it involves children. That doesn't strike me as especially a libertarian mindset. We're talking about kids and parts of the, parents and parts of the country that want to teach their kids a certain kind of history, they don't want to talk about what I think are basic facts about American history and the reality of slavery and Jim Crow and all of these kinds of things. Fine if they want to, if they want to you know teach their kids what they want to teach. In that context everyone's like the home is sacred. I want my kid to know what they want to know. Suddenly when we're talking about very intimate decisions being made between children, their doctors and their family members, it's a national point of national conversation and I'm not entirely sure why that is. It should absolutely be a decision between the child, the family, the consultation with the doctor. Yeah absolutely. I'm not disagreeing with that at all. I mean we're talking about it because we're interested in the broader social phenomenon. If there's a contagion aspect to it. I'm not saying it should be banned or prohibited. So let's talk about that. So I do think, I mean this is the point about California versus Ohio. Of course it's going to be the case when people feel like it's more socially acceptable to take a certain course of action. That they're going to take a certain course of action. I think there's the same number of gay people born in Ohio as California the same number trans people proportionately. But of course in a more welcoming environment you're going to be feel more able to come out. Now is there some risk that people, especially kids who are going through puberty which is not a fun time and who are oftentimes feeling very ambivalent about their gender as a girl. You're going parts and men are looking at you in ways that make you feel very uncomfortable. Is that perhaps going to make you think I could not, you know, I could identify as male in a world where that's an option to you. Even though 40 years ago you might not have thought that and even though 10 years from now you might not see yourself that way it was just circumstantial quite possibly. But that is why I think it's important to have psychological evaluation and measure doctors who I want to see Bill Maher talking about the evidence that that's not the case. Tell me some specific examples of doctors that have been overzealous and let's talk about you know what should be done about those human beings not attacking the broader social phenomena. But to do those evaluations you have to have, you have to push back a little bit out. You have to make sure that right that the child is not just feeling just uncomfortable in their own body the way all kids, all teenagers do at some point. And I really reject this you know quasi ideological notion that it right that if you're uncomfortable in your own skin or you're not right not happy with the way you look it must be because you're you're you're born in the wrong like that's not. I would argue that there that is not the case. I certainly don't think that and every teenager who's uncomfortable in their own skin the psychologist who are tasked with doing these intensive evaluations of folks to decide whether or not you know I think there is this perception and some of it is I think the broader cultures fall. I think there's a flippant way that people can talk about these issues. There's a flippant way that it can happen in like the pop culture space that I think is really attenuated from what's happening in these clinical environments when all parents no matter how woke you are I think are hesitant about doing any kind of intervention with their kid that could have permanent consequences when the kid is so young and the decision-making faculties are so underdeveloped. I don't know a parent in the world no matter how woke no matter how progressive no matter how liberal they are that doesn't wouldn't pause and doesn't pause and take this kind of decision very seriously. And that's what's so frustrating. I think there's a broad agreement on these issues. I think parents are all broadly concerned that they want to do the right thing. And us having this conversation I don't think is especially informed is nowhere near as informed as the intensive psychological process that folks have to go through with doctors with therapists. Yes. To the point where they would act. And that's good but I see it in I see it in the training materials in sort of activist the way gender and the ones that activists educators share at conferences about here's how you talk about these issues. Conflating sex and they're conflating the gender the gingerbread gender thing have you seen that? No. We're going to different conferences. It's the gingerbread gender bread thing. You know I'm not making this up. That's too specific for me to pay that up on the spot. Nothing's true for me. And there's eight. And also there's a conflation now with sex and gender that the right used to really make that now I feel like this is an activist progressive's making that you can be that there's I don't I don't accept I don't believe there's anything like a neatly biological about you like you can't tell me that like a little boy likes to play with dolls that necessarily means they're a girl they might they just might be a feminine boy they might be gay they might be or they might just like dolls that doesn't mean they're they we should recommend puberty blockers to this person and in the the training materials they bring that up always but that's not that's gender that's a difference. So this this is an argument that's made by some folks some folks who are characterized as traditional feminists some folks that are characterized as TERFs yes who say it used to be the case that if you you know had not you know interests or proclivities that were different from what is stereotypical to your sex then you should have the freedom to be whoever you want to be not change your sex to align with not be asserting into a different category. We try to erode these categories entirely because we're all individuals yeah there's those are kind of essentialism that can come out and that's sort of my where as a libertarian I get I get animated because everyone is an individual not part of some broad collective or categorization and people are it is people should feel encouraged and free to associate with whatever whatever traits they like and it doesn't mean you have to slot yourself right but this is this is why I think it's so important to get like psychologists in this conversation into Jesse singles credit he did talk to a lot of people who are very authoritative on the 70- many road is articles including people who said yes I've experienced people who detransitioned but I still ultimately feel like this is the best course of action for most people because there is a big difference and people who are clinically able to assess are overwhelmingly successful in assessing the difference between a tomboy or a girl who ultimately you know it realizes she's lesbian and a person who was you know assigned gender female at birth who ultimately realizes that they're male and you know you and I might be confounded in the gender-bred people might be confounded by these kind of distinctions but I would caution folks to again thinking that the level of confusion and mistakes that are happening are as high as people like Bill Maher represent them with their exponential graphs and such on their show I think they're very high in the way these things are talked about by progressive activists and educators and the people like you see on TikTok maybe it's not the case with the actual doctors and medical establishment that I would yeah well let's get some doctors in the room let's get some gingerbread cookies in here first I'm starving next up we will be talking about the fact that former vice president Mike Pence is allegedly eyeing a bid for president in 2024 we'll discuss that next with our panel please do stick around there's been no shortage of speculation about Donald Trump staging a comeback and running for reelection in 2024 but this time it is former vice president Mike Pence who might be mulling a run for president according to the New York Times Pence has kept an arms length distance from Trump since leaving the White House campaigning with midterm candidates Trump has written off and visiting early nominating states here to discuss our Jen Perlman co-host of generational change on YouTube and Rachel Bovard policy director at the conservative partnership institute welcome to both good morning you so Rachel you know what do you think is there any possibility I'm not sure there is that you know Mike Pence could throw his hat into the ring and possibly you know come out of a Republican primary process Trump or no Trump isn't he just too damaged by you know the perception that he betrayed Trump at the end or didn't do what he was supposed to do I definitely think there's a segment of of the Trump base that looks at him that way but I think more broadly and what's more interesting to me is you know you're seeing Mike Pence actually try to resurrect a pre-Trump model of Republican politics then I'm not sure frankly exists anymore I don't know that there's a path for that type of Republican politics anymore and what I mean by that is you know sort of the traditional fusionist emphasis on a lot of issues that Trump sort of turned on their head you know an emphasis on free trade an emphasis on letting big business kind of get away with whatever they want you know a sort of a global international order you know in the foreign policy space all these things were sort of pre-Trump I don't know that Pence has a viable path forward with an emphasis on these things and he's certainly trying I don't you know know that he's really broken with who he used to be so that's what's more interesting to me is can he actually carve out a lane in that regard and my sense is no not right now well Jim what do you make of the alliances that Trump and Pence are making respectively in Georgia where you know Trump is frustrated with Purdue you know with with Kemp for not overturning the election however you want to characterize it and Pence taking the more you know a holding up democracy line of saying that there's certain rules we have to abide you know is there an appetite is Pence anticipating that there is some appetite among even conservatives in Georgia for respecting basic election law and not participating in the big light what do you think the effect of the big lie broadly is going to be on this potential showdown it's interesting I really see Georgia sort of like this proxy war that's going on and I think it'll say a lot regarding what happens there but I agree that there's really not that much of a lane for Mike Pence because he's very niche to begin with like I see him as very very niche and I don't see that as speaking to a broad enough group of people but it almost seems to me that he's just going out of his way to be contrary you know whether or not that works I don't know but he's definitely going out of his way just to say well I'm going to do what opposite of what Trump did but I don't know that that'll be enough to really make him stand out as something that's different than Trump given that he stood by him as his lap dog for four years. Rachel who do you think are the non-Trump Republicans who are plausible candidates in 2024 who are you know speaking to the new kind of policy consensus that animates conservatives the departure from the the penses of the world is it really just DeSantis or are there others? I think at this point it it almost from you know an actionable standpoint it really only is DeSantis which is interesting because I don't think he necessarily has taken the steps that others have taken to sort of you know push out into the presidential primary he seems to be holding back but I think you know to the point that Gen. just made I think she's right you have a bunch of Republicans Mike Pence included who are defining themselves as not Trump and that works for a little bit right but eventually you have to say what you are and I think in many cases you know the 2020 election Biden tried that out right Biden I think tried to appeal to a lot of Republican voters by saying well I'm not Trump I'm you know you want your politics to go back to boring pick me and you know I don't think that that's working out for him necessarily very well either so I don't know that anyone's actually carved out a sustainable lane to take on Trump you know you look at people like Nikki Haley for instance who I don't think has you know come out exactly in polar opposite of Trump but has you know carved a lane for herself that I think is distinct enough and people are gonna want to say okay what is it that you're for and nobody's really put that platform out no one is really willing I think to take a polar opposite stand of Trump because Trump is still really powerful and he's again the most you know popular Republican in the party and doing that at this stage I think has a lot of consequences that people you know aren't yet willing to deal with so we don't have anyone I think that is a foil yet or a viable foil anyway to Trump Well Rachel the counter argument to your point would be you know that Biden's approval ratings might not be so hot right now but he did get elected and there was some appetite for a certain gray haired vice president and silver fauched if you will who promised to return to normal you know is it completely un you know unreasonable that Pence could be anticipating that there is an appetite for that including among people who are in fact frustrated with Biden and his failure to pass much of anything at all over the last year or so and who might have only gone over to the Democratic side because he presented himself as a moderate alternative to Trump is Pence a more moderate genuinely conservative alternative to Trump I do think there is definitely a segment of the Republican Party that you know just doesn't want the drama of Trump that is a definite you know problem that Trump has I think from a nationwide appeal or at least a base appeal to Republican voters what I don't know is how big that segment is and if that segment is going to look at Mike Pence and be like yes this guy because again take you know the baggage away from Trump what was popular about him to the base is that he was you know from their perspective fearless in the face of a lot of the culture wars a lot of the excesses of business a lot of the things that Republicans really wanted to see and I don't know that Pence is really putting himself forward as the natural heir to those fights and I think unless he's willing to do that I actually just I don't know how big the appeal is of well I'm not that guy and I'm boring so you don't have to watch the news every night you know I don't know how big that appeal actually is. Jen do you think Democrats recognize you know the danger they're in they're looking to get really really hurt in this upcoming election you know they last time they they had you know Biden running as yes a moderate a boring non-Trump alternative now well a you might not have Trump in the race he could decide not to run you could have him and and he like the poll numbers for Biden are so low he could he's gonna be he's gonna have a fighting chance he's not gone he's not gotten rid of he could absolutely come back do Democrats appreciate that you know they're not they're not even gonna have a lot of the arguments they have last time to narrowly beat Trump. I find the Democrats largely delusional I don't know what they're seeing I can say like what's interesting is I'm in Florida so when you're talking about DeSantis like you know the Democrats here they're actually thinking that there's a viable gubernatorial race for them this year and DeSantis as far as I can see he's already won that and he's running in 24 for president so absolutely absolutely and so it's our Democrats do not seem to be very aware but then I also think that's partially intentional they don't have anybody that they can put up against either Trump or DeSantis or any of those people actually that has a chance and Biden while he won he barely won during a pandemic and so I don't think that that was that strong of a message that people sent oh yes we really want this that was never really clear um I think it was more that Trump lost than Biden won and so I think we're gonna see that coming back to bite them and know they are very seemingly blind about what's going on all around them yeah he barely won then and now he's had years of you know fair or not no matter what you think clearly people think it's gone badly with the economy with Ukraine, Afghanistan you know the things have not go with COVID even things have not gone well so he's now so he's gonna be underwater trying to make the same case and he only narrowly won last time it just seems very very concerning a reason for concern if you're a Democrat but not a lot of I don't hear that a lot uh Rachel Jen thank you so much for joining us thanks guys we'll have more rising right after this sexual transmission from two recent raves in Europe may explain the recent monkeypox outbreaks according to World Health Organization expert David Heyman Heyman who called the outbreaks a random event said the raves held in Spain and Belgium are the leading theory to explain the disease's recent spread according to hill reporting there is one confirmed case of monkeypox in the united states and four suspected cases in the country the CDC said yesterday us health officials are in the process of releasing some ginnios vaccine doses for use in monkeypox cases for high risk people dr. Jennifer McQuiston deputy director of the division of high consequence pathogens and pathology within the CDC's national center for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases confirmed that there has been a request of the release of the ginnios vaccine from the national stockpile but quiston said the us has a good stock of that vaccine because it has been preparing for the possibility of needing to use the doses for smallpox according to CNN senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for health security dr. Amish Adalja joins us to discuss welcome dr. Thanks for having me. Okay so it's what should people know this is obviously a very scary sounding thing given that we're all reeling from the consequences and a lot of the misinformation and confusing information that we're getting about covid helped to clarify for the audience who wants to know how concerned they should be in this moment. There's a natural tendency for the general public in the press to view every infectious disease emergency post covid through the lens of covid but you sort of miss a lot of the differences between the viruses that distinct biological entities monkey boxes of viruses that's been around at least noticed since the 1950s has been affecting people since the 1970s primarily endemic in certain countries in Africa and we've seen sporadic cases occur with importation and what's happening with this outbreak is that this illness which causes fever and rash is spreading within social networks in a way that it hasn't before but it's something that we know how to contain the key thing was just understanding the epidemiology of how people were getting infected and I think we're getting closer every day to really getting a handle on how people got infected and we can then deploy the geneos vaccine or other smallpox vaccines to halt transmission just like we've done with prior monkey box outbreak set ever occurred including in the United States in 2003. Do we know that it is primarily sexually transmitted or is it it's you know transmitted via close sustained contact including during you know sexual behavior? We don't know that now we do know that skin-to-skin contact close intimate contact even if there's not per se sexual transmission through body fluids is enough for this virus to to move from personal person so for control measures it's not necessarily going to be any different if it's being transmitted sexually or being transmitted through sexual contact because we still do the same thing it's an important scientific question to understand is the virus in the body fluids that are exchanged during sex and I suspect it probably is but a lot of this might just be skin-to-skin close contact based on what we're hearing about lesions being concentrated in the general regions for example. And about regarding the vaccine my understanding from reading about it is that so they can give the vaccine to people who maybe are close contacts of people who've been infected so that they to try to stop them from getting it and that also you can give the vaccine as sort of a therapeutic to someone who has been affected and and it will help them is that is that accurate? Sort of we use the vaccine as what's called post-exposure prophylaxis so we have a case and then we identify the contacts and you can vaccinate those individuals during the 12th or so day incubation period and that may completely abort the infection or it may make it less severe. We don't really give it therapeutically once they've already developed illness but if you can get them in that 12 day incubation period before symptoms have started you can significantly impact their illness and possibly completely stop their illness from happening. That's exactly what we did for the smallpox eradication campaign that's what we've done in other monkeypox outbreaks and that's the kind of concept of operations for this current monkeypox outbreak. Are you surprised by the kind of appetite for the story and the public? Is this commensurate with other similar types of outbreaks that we've seen or do you really think that this kind of focus on monkeypox is driven by some combination of a hyper awareness of viral pathogens because of COVID and also perhaps the monkey in the name which seems to be particularly scary and outlandish seeming to people. I definitely think that the general public as well as the press are now attuned to the risk of infectious disease and see this as an important story but again they have to start to think about these as different biological events not one continuous pandemic from COVID-19 to whatever comes next and I do think when you have a zoonotic infection meaning a country animal has monkey in the word sounds like the word smallpox all of that does have a little bit of an allure to it. What we hope is that the press starts to cover infectious diseases in a way that's not sensationalistic that's not alarmist but actually reflects the threat that infectious diseases pose to us and helps the public become informed and interested in this topic especially our policymakers because preparedness is going to be very important moving forward after the COVID-19 pandemic. So given what we know so far about how it spreads would you I know some people already who are like well we got to keep just you know wearing masks outside you know just in case because it can theoretically spread through respiratory droplets but we are I don't think and based on what you're saying we're not at the point of which like all people need to worry that they're about to contract monkeypox unless they're taking very serious precautions on the level of the precautions they took against COVID-19 which you know very very very broadly contagious. Monkeypox is much less contagious than COVID-19 though it can be spread by respiratory droplets it's usually close contact. The other thing about monkeypox is it's not contagious during the incubation period so very different transmission characteristics from COVID-19 and the general public is not at risk from this monkeypox outbreak it seems to be clustering within sexual networks of men who have sex with other men and it's not something that's a general threat to the public although anybody can get infected if they're exposed in an appropriate manner. So I think this is something that will eventually be controlled now that we've got an understanding on the epidemiology it'll take some time to get vaccine into the context but I don't think that this deserves any kind of alarm and you have to also keep in mind that not every pathogen has pandemic potential. Monkeypox is not something that can cause a pandemic it simply doesn't have the biological characteristics to be able to do so and we have a tried and true mechanism to stop it which is the vaccines. Well we want to what we have here we want to just talk a little bit about COVID-19 scientific advisor at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard Alina Chan tweeted yesterday that she heard new phrase permissage used to describe the spread of omicron and its sub variants of 2022. Can you update us on the status of any new vaccines that are you know catering specifically to the sub variants of COVID? We know that both visor and Moderna are trying to update their vaccine there are there is talk about putting an omicron variant in the vaccine that might be available in the fall so it has the original strain and omicron. There definitely is a need to update these vaccines because they're not able to block transmission the way that they could during the earlier eras when Delta was prominent or alpha or the original version. There's also work to make a universal coronavacine that would combat all coronaviruses and not have to be updated so there is going to be a lot of innovation coming forward in this space because these first generation vaccines are not the last that we're going to see those were those are very very effective at what they do which is preventing serious illness hospitalization and death but there's always room for improvement and technology is going to progress. And Dr what do you say what is your response to folks who have been talking about some studies that seem to indicate that there might be some concerns about waning efficacy at vaccines and boosters the more and more people take them over time that there could be a diminishing returns or even increased vulnerability to the virus over time depending on how many vaccines and boosters you ultimately take. Are those concerns with any legitimacy or that you've been following at all? There's a theoretical concern that you can sort of prime your immune system to only respond to the vaccine strain and it has difficulty being able to respond to other strains and that's something that people have seen with influenza and it's clear right now we're already getting diminishing returns. I don't think there's any danger to the boosting. I think it's just not a proper policy. I think we need to update the vaccine to get the appropriate protection and we will see diminishing returns if we continue to use boosters against the ancestral strain and the immune system keeps getting hit with the ancestral strain when what's circulating is something completely different. There's going to be less and less protection as the virus becomes more immune evasive the way over-run has. Well thank you so much Dr. Dalja. Thanks for having me. And we will have more rising after this. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was banned from receiving communion at any San Francisco church after the Archbishop of the Catholic Church in San Francisco condemned Pelosi for her pro-choice stance. The Archbishop said Pelosi must first confess and receive absolution to what he called a grave sin. The Archbishop found himself at odds with the Pope who said previously that President Biden and others should not be excommunicated just because of their political views on abortion. Whoopi Goldberg came into Pelosi's defense while on the view. Let's watch. This is not your job dude. That is not you can't that is not up to you to make that decision. You know what is this saying? It's kind of amazing. But you know what is the point of communion right? It's for sinners. It's the for the for sinners. It's the reward of saints but the bread of sinners. How dare you? How dare you? Well Robbie I'm not a religious person. You're a catholic. Does that track for you? I mean I'm a lapsed Catholic. I went to Catholic, Catholic education was raised Catholic but I don't like it is the Archbishop's job to decide who gets to have communion. So that's like a very weird remark from Whoopi Goldberg. Look I mean it's a religion. It's a faith. If you violate the tenets of it you're not allowed to participate in the rituals of it. So I don't and then Whoopi is saying that the Archbishop doesn't have doctrinal authority here but then she starts going into what she like what the Eucharist is. Yeah so Archbishop Whoopi I guess is the person who decides this thing. Look I mean it's and different Catholic jurisdictions deal with this question differently I think. I mean there are many Catholics who are pro-choice even. Well what about the Pope? What about this argument that the Pope said the Biden shouldn't be excommunicated so is there an inconsistency there? Does everyone do all the archbishops not have to follow the Pope's lead and if they're going to sanction anti-policing that way do they have to go ahead and excommunicate her to deny her the communion? I think you only have to again I'm not claiming to be like hardcore Catholic by any stretch of the imagination. I think if my in-laws who are very steeped in the knowledgeable in the faith see this they'll be cringing and how badly I butcher what the doctrine is but I think that the Pope has to declare if the Pope declares like no this is the way it is then absolutely but if he's just kind of making remarks about how he thinks the polishes should be then it's still like a policy that's discussed and debated etc. You know when he when he proclaims no this is the way it is then yes there can be no disagreement. I think that's how it works. I frankly think this is kind of refreshing because I think there has been a blurring of the fact that the main driver of opposition to the right to choose has been religious in nature and that's completely fine. If your religious beliefs tell you not to do X, Y, and Z I fully support your ability to practice and follow the doctrine of your faith. However we also live in the United States of America where one of our most important founding principles is the separation of church and state and I think some clarity about people's you know opposite into abortion being based in religion would you know prevent them from being so much cover over the fact that people are trying to impose their religious beliefs on the rest of the populations that are making personal decisions independently in their home the way I would argue they should be doing. Yeah yeah I this is just how it looked that is her if her if her if Pelosi's view is that right abortion should be illegal fine but the church's view conflicts with that and then they say you can't receive you Chris like that's just how it is I did it's it's and it does feel a new but I don't know why whoopi has to bemoan this reality I don't know. Well because they all participate in a kind of politics which is just my guy good other guy bad and they were going to reflexively defend Nancy Pelosi no matter what happened I think the more interesting cases are in some some ways when these Catholics are actually in line with doctrine opposed to abortion but also on team good guy team democrat you know where what was the discourse around Tim Cain you know who I don't know Hillary Clinton's vice presidential pick in 2006 really hi I think you think I'd remember that he's a little bit of a little guy really really boosted the ticket there if you say so brought out the voters for Hillary Clinton I was at the convention I just don't remember but look the most memorable thing about the guy was that he was wildly out of step with the party on abortion he had um champion a number of restrictive abortion bills in Virginia he personally you know he was a post um you know to spinning federal money on abortion services I mean he was all over the place and we were in the middle of a hot a hot primary where Hillary Clinton was claiming that because she was a woman she was better on women's issues than someone like Bernie Sanders who had in fact been so much better on women's issues and who would never have picked a you know pro-life candidate who was one heartbeat away from the presidency to be the VP and I think there was something like really refreshing frankly about these contrasts being highlighted instead of um this cover that is extended to the organizations which are fundamentally you know conservative nature it's perfectly fine if you want to be conservative but when you have these kind of woke popes that are down with all sorts of things I think it disguises the extent to which the fundamental opposition to a lot of progressive politics does come from these more conservative issues do you think it's radically conservative to oppose federal funding of abortion services I don't know that it is well I don't I mean I I think if people are opposed to abortion not wanting their tax dollars to publicly subsidize those services seems pretty reasonable and that's I'm not I don't want to force other people to subsidize things that are against their values I'm sure so let's let's go down the list I'm morally opposed to funding war yeah I would be great if we didn't fund that I agree and I and I morally opposed to fighting an award and also think it's a infringement on my liberty to say that I have to go and sit in a jail cell like Muhammad Ali if I oppose a mandatory conscription should that happen again absolutely I do too and I also don't think I should have to pay taxes because that's against my I mean like look you're you're you're thinking you're gonna get me at some point in this you're not coming from robin a lot of people would draw the line in a lot of different places and so but this is a stints a highly a socially contest something with very strong strong feelings a very unsettled policy question that different states want to adjudicate in different ways and you're saying that we should federally subsidize it no the right to choice is about making sure that people can make decisions personally in their own states I really I'll come to that in a second but I really want to make sure that this point is made people say let's defer to the states that people can have choice no if you defer to the states people within those states who disagree with the state's decision aren't going to have choice what roby way does is protect the constitutional right for everyone individually to make those choices because there are states who want to constrain those choices and make people adhere to their own religious view of where life starts and all of those kinds of things with respect to whether the government should pay for it I have a hard time distinguishing between that kind of a basic health care intervention that has a lot of public policy support behind it you know that all the studies about how people go and seek out abortions and end up in emergency rooms or dead as a consequence of having unsanctioned abortions I think there's a legitimate public interest in making sure that people at least have the state's legal and rare version of abortion instead of these you know back alley situations that ultimately the taxpayers going to have to pay for when you're wheeled on a guerney into an emergency room yeah for millions of american for millions of americans abortion is like something akin to baby murder and it seems extra to make them pay for it to subsidize it and for millions of americans war feels like something akin to murder murder and sometimes there's babies involved I would I would love to not I would love to not subsidize I think maybe it would constrain our government and the bad things it does if more people could uh could be conscientious objectors from having to fund government programs and policies that they object to look I would be open to that conversation but the reality is the only time that people seem to be able to divest from government spending are when it is spending on protecting frankly minority rights or rights or people who have been historically marginalized never for the big bad imperialist truly terrible things that america's does on a much bigger scale so I'm open I'm open to talk about what's putting candles nose under the tent but I know that that only goes one way and it's never in the way that protects those who I would argue are most vulnerable all right well tomorrow on rising military expert lieutenant colonel daniel davis uh favorite of ours will question why american soldiers should die for taiwan this after president viden said the u.s would involve the military if
