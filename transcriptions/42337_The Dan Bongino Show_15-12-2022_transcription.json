    "text": " Get ready to hear the truth about America on a show that's not immune to the facts with your host, Dan Bonjino.

All right, Joseph, let's go. Everything you need to know in an hour. Yeah, in an hour, man. That was always our goal. They want to remember that. That was our target so you could drive home and get all the information you need. But now I absolutely know the information that Joe and I put out there during yesterday's show. Now I know there's something to it. So without repeating yesterday's show, Tucko Carlson dropped the bombshell on the show the other night. And he said, why is it that all of these people from the intelligence and law enforcement community find themselves now working at Twitter? It's not a law enforcement operation. It's a micro block. It just doesn't seem to be to make a lot of sense when you look at it. They call about the smell test. It's just really odd. Also the fact that Twitter we now know was colluding with the government to suppress conservatives and advance propaganda. It made me ask the question yesterday. Pursuant the Tucker show with the show went bonkers yesterday, by the way, because a lot of people are concerned about this. Is Twitter the world's largest intelligence gathering propaganda machine? Rivaling TikTok. I would only say Twitter is more important because more journalists use Twitter to spread propaganda. TikTok is more dangerous to the kids. Twitter for the narrative du jour. Is it the world's largest intelligence gathering and intelligence propaganda adjet prop operation? So again, if you want the entire details on that and the Tucker segment yesterday, I have it on yesterday's podcast, check it out. But how do I know now that there's almost definitely something to this? Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce Philip Bump, one of the dumbest human beings in media. Here he is. Here's Philip education. The Ohio State University, I'm sure a source of perpetual embarrassment for the same people at that university. So Philip Bump from the Washington Post, who has been on the wrong side, Joe, of just about every single significant political scandal of our time, Philip Bump, you name it, voter fraud, spygate, the impeachment hoax. And now this, he writes this lesson, this should tell you there is definitely something to it. Philip Bump headline, Tucker Carlson, conspiracy theories wrapped in conspiracy theories. Now in the, he's talking about the Tucker Carlson story about the Twitter mechanisms being hijacked, potentially on behalf of the deep state, right? This is the kind of story. Sane competent media people who had an IQ in the triple digits used to salivate over. Oh my gosh, a bunch of government intelligence power players now working at the world's largest microblog world that journalists are. What the hell are they all doing there? Why does Twitter find these people's skillsets so attractive? Have a unique set of skills like that Liam Neeson character. Why do they find them so attractive? Why do these people find Twitter so attractive? Are these people communicating with people still in the intelligence community? If they left, this is the kind of story they used to wet their diapers over. Hey mom, the meatloaf. That's the question they used to ask. Yeah. That's what David said. What is she doing back there? Talking about Twitter. What are they doing back there, right? This is not Philip Bump. Philip Bump is the single dumbest human being writing right now. I'm convinced outside of the talking headspace, the actual journalist writers out there bump is by far the worst. Whenever he comes out against something, it's clear someone in the deep state is using him like the little child he is to advocate on behalf of squashing a story. So what does he do? He writes a story. It's a conspiracy. He's not even remotely curious why a bevy of intel and law enforcement officials involved in enormous scandals like Jim Baker at the FBI magically found their way over to Twitter as it emerged the other day. Oh, last week, that Twitter, according to the Twitter files, is working with the FBI and others and was meeting with them bi-weekly. He's not even remotely curious about that. Why? Because he's Philip Bump, the single dumbest human being immediate. Whenever folks, I hate to actually give this guy even clicks, but you should follow him. I hate to do this to you. I'm not kidding. This is not a joke. I'm not trying to be sarcastic. He's a tool of these deep state idiots. He always has been because he's too dumb and has no character at all. He's an embarrassment to the journalism industry. Whenever Bump comes out about a piece trying to debunk something, rest assured, there's almost definitely something near that folks. This is an organized desperate last ditch effort to stop the release of the next set of Twitter files. Why? Because the next set of Twitter files is going to be about COVID, Fauci, the deep state, Ryan Asquash, actual science, which is going to infuriate people. So what's going on? The bumps of the world, sycophantic, ass-kissing media types, their deep state little symbiotes, right? They are desperate to make this story go away. So what are they doing? This is version, I don't know, guys. I'd estimate 8,000. I wrote it down. 8,749 of this story. All right. Here we go. So you got a discredited Elon Musk in the story. What do you do, Joe? QAnon. It was definitely QAnon. Here is Washington Post QAnon story number one, 9,422. QAnon is finding new life in Elon Musk conspiracy theories. Keep in mind, Elon Musk has not promoted any conspiracy theories. Elon Musk posted a picture of a bunny and a link to an article he took down. He's not promoted any conspiracy theories at all. But the Washington Post wants you to believe he's some kind of right-wing cuke, even though there's no evidence whatsoever the man's ever voted for a Republican in his life. Why? Because the Washington Post is interested in killing democracy and extending the darkness over democracy. Some of you will get that conservative, where liberals are confused. That's how dumb they are. Why do you think bump in the Washington Post are now on the attack? I might have to move on to a couple other things, but you're still wondering why the Washington Post, by the way, is struggling, why everybody laughs at Philip. Last, Philip Bump is a source of nothing but mockery. So is the entire Washington Post step? You understand guys, nobody takes you seriously. How does it feel to be at a paper, at a newspaper, a journalism outfit with air quotes, that almost no Republican takes seriously, almost none. Maybe 10% of them would even give you the time of day. And we only use you as a source of what misinformation is not information. But when we see you write about a story, we know the opposite of truth. It's true, how does that make you feel? How does it make you feel to have been on the wrong side of every major political scandal of our time, the Philip Bumps of the world, and protecting the powerful, protecting the rich and the wealthy over the interests of the people? How does that make you feel? Aren't you kind of a loser? Didn't that make you worried? Well because of that, there's going to be mass layoffs at the Washington Post. Did you see this? Adam took some hidden video of the head of the Washington Post talking about the layoffs and chaos broke out after, where are we going to go? Why are you avoiding us? Yeah, gee, why would nobody want to read the Washington Post? I don't know, they've got a documented 30 year history of lying to America on every major scandal of our time. I'm not sure if you're on the holidays. Having said that, there's an easy way to not lose your job, and that's for the management of the Washington Post and the people who work there and publish that paper to actually do reporting and news and journalism. You're failing precisely because you hire people like Philip Bump to write stupid articles that aren't even remotely inquisitive about the biggest scandal of our time. How one of the world's biggest social media companies colluded with the government and law enforcement and liberal activist groups to engage in the largest violation of the First Amendment American history. That's kind of a big story. You'd get a ton of clicks, but your story's the opposite. Don't look here, rugs. And any wonder why nobody reads your junk and why my Facebook page and my show has probably twice or three times the audience as you guys do, despite a staff of about, what, three? That's if you count Paula, really to Joe, you don't have anyone working. Joe's got the dog with them. That's it. No hidden staff. Well, maybe when Justin comes back, but he's only here a couple of weeks of the year, we have a staff of two Washington Post as a staff of thousands and we consistently kick the crap out of them on social media. Because we're telling you the truth while these idiots are lying. Folks, the mandate crowd, the media crowd, the socialist crowd, they're not going to give up easily. The sycophants won't give up easily either. This next batch of the Twitter files about COVID is I'm convinced is going to be devastating. I'm basing this based on some of the tweets Elon Musk has put out there. Some of the suggestions, the hints, the winks and the nods he's made. It's going to be devastating. It's going to destroy the whole liberal ethos that government is somehow a competent entity interested in science. It is interested in propaganda only. That propaganda has diseased people's minds where people have gone so crazy, not just in government, but everywhere. Entertainment, music, sports, they have this infection like crude spell Jacob disease or whatever that is. The mad cow in their brains where prions are eating their cerebral tissue alive. And they say and do the dumbest things because they listen to this small crowd of idiots in the elite with the elites. They can't stop. I want you to listen to this zero, Gene Simmons, who by the way, is a D bag like you wouldn't believe. Oh, listen, I know a lot about kiss. Joe's a Joe knows Joe's a music. I was actually a real performer in a band. I don't know your feelings about kiss kiss is horrible. The band was always horrible. I'm sorry if you like them. They were performative. They were great performers. I'll give them that singers and musicians. Yeah, not so much. Okay. Gene Simmons is terrible. Gene Simmons can't sing. All he does is stick his tongue out. Remember kiss? They all make up these minerals. Now I have an attachment to kiss. I'm going to have to leave for another day. I'm sorry. I have to tell you guys off the air, but it's I know a lot about kiss. Let's just leave it at that. Gene Simmons is a tool. I'm sorry if you grew up liking this guy. He is nothing more than a pathetic ignoramus. Here's Gene Simmons from Kiss. He's on some TV station overseas and he's asked about the vaccine and the kiss crews. These were like the counterculture revolutionaries show, right? Kiss. Now they got a kiss cruise. The cruise. Come on in folks to kiss crews. You get a free doll and even spits blood. This is it. Gene Simmons and the kiss crews. Listen to him. Looses mind over the vaccine. Tell you all to shut up that you don't really have the rights you think you have. Gene Simmons, the revolutionary hippie guy from Kiss. Take a listen to this. Get over yourself. We're not concerned if you agree with it or not. We're concerned about you making us sick. So get your Covid shot and prevent other people from getting your stuff. It's a good point. We're having a debate this morning about that very thing really. A debate about whether mass wearings should be returned to be mandatory here in the UK. The street guns have been lifted. I understand you even suggest people who come to your concerts wear them for their own protection. We are doing the kiss crews shortly and you will not be able to get on the cruise unless you're vaccinated. Look, before you go to school, you have to have your children get the flu vaccine and the polio vaccine. There's no discussion. And you know, what about my rights? Well, you don't have as many rights as you think. When you get up to a red light, you must stop. There's no choice. It's because it's not about you. It's about the other innocent people going by. So get over yourself. Even you get in your car. You must put on a seat belt. Well, you're taking away my rights and the government's telling me what to do. That's right. The government is telling you what to do. Shut up. Be respectful of other people and get a vaccine. Put on your seat belt. Stop at the red light. Stop being selfish. Now you see why I owe the devil. Come on. Yeah, I couldn't hold off, dude. That was a minimum of two. I didn't even bother talking. Yeah. Oh, we haven't done one of those. And what's time for a monthly? It's been a while. I'm glad you're holding it. Because the monthly moments have become very special. That's a minimum of a double motley. Where is our motley guy? We got the motley. Someone sent me a motley soda. Yeah, you got my one hand. We got one handed grab. The motley doll. Thank you to the motley people. You got to have that ready if Joe throws a motley instantaneously. But he don't know either. Joe is Joe is the absolute controller like a monarch. A surprise. Nobody. It's not written into the show at all. That's a minimum of a double. Yeah, yeah. It was a surprise but a good one. Gene Simmons is obviously a clown. But he brought up a good point as we were talking right there while the clip was playing. What is with these 60s and 70s rockers who were these big counterculture revolutionaries now totally kissing their air? Here's the ass of the man as they call him. Kissing the ass of the man. Neil Young. This guy, Gene Simmons. All of these old rockers. Take your back, then, kids. And I love the liner. He says, it's going to keep us all safe. Oh, really? Gene, Gene, listen, I know during the kiss days it may have been some stuff involved if you know what I mean. But where have you heard that? That it's going to keep the community safe. At best, if what the establishment public health apparatus is telling us. At best, it may provide some mild temporary individual protection. It has done nothing to stop community spread of this. Nothing was zero. You go on the kiss cruise, you got to be vaccine. Well, and I guess a lot of people aren't going to be going on the kiss cruise. I don't want to tell you there, Gene. This is what happens, folks. You understand like how this is how society do it. Now you see why younger voters are running away from the Democrat Party. I'm going to get to that later in the show. I always bring the receipts. I always bring the receipts. Younger voters are running away. These are people who question authority by nature. They've got a rebellious street. That's why they fell in love with, you know, in the 60s and the 70s, the Beatles and Kiss and the Stones and in the 80s, the Motley crews and the Def Leopards. They were irreverent. You know, in my ear, a rage against the machine. You rage against the machine. The man organized power. The elites, the cabal. They are the machine now. They are the machine now. Folks, they're not even remotely curious about, I want to put up this New York Post story here. What silly time is over. Okay. Sometimes I can be used a little too much sarcasm. So my apologies if it bothers you, but this may turn out to be the biggest public health scandal in human history. I want to stick to non-hysterical coverages because it's really important and I don't want to get ahead of my skis. But folks, every single day, I'm now reading one, two, three, four, sometimes more articles about this. New York Post, Jeremy Layton, former University of Central Florida tight end, Jake Hescock, dies suddenly at 25. His heart broke, obviously. Tight end, football, pretty healthy guy. You know what's incredible to me that you have these guys like Gene Simmons who use their cultural power and he's got a lot of it. He was the lead singer of one of the most popular bands ever in the history of sentient beings. And he uses his moment on TV to scream and yell at people and tell them to shut up and take the vaccine. Despite the fact it isn't seem even remotely curious as to why the vaccine has been almost entirely ineffective at stopping the spread of COVID and that there is an outbreak of people dying suddenly all cause mortality going up. Is anybody curious about this? Folks, I told you before, I think the biggest mistake of my life was taking this vaccine. I always get negative email. You're an idiot, you're a moron, whatever. You know what, fine. Just knock yourself out. I had cancer at the time for the thousandth time. You make really poor decisions when you've got an expiration date staring you in the face or you think you do. I should have let the science on this play out. I never push this thing on anyone else ever. You've got a library of shows to prove it. So I'm not going to debate that. You can just go watch yourself. Matter of fact, that was very cautious even though it involved me. But I worry. Every single day I worry about this. I have doctor friends, many of them, and they can attest to this. If I put them on the show, they'd vouch for me. Probably twice a week I text them or email them about articles and ask you think I'm okay with this. Are we not even a little bit curious about why all these young healthy people are just dying suddenly? Again, I believe it's going to turn out to be the biggest political scandal of our time. I got a piece of video coming up next who must be lovely being ignorant. Imagine being one of the most prominent scientists of our time. A guy in the name of Richard Dawkins going on the Bill Marshall and acknowledging publicly you've never heard of the Great Barrington Declaration about COVID. It was only one of the most prominent, accurate scientific declarations written in modern times that was prescient about COVID and the response to it. And yet this is what you get because Fauci and others wanted to suppress it, make it go away. You've got Richard Dawkins who hasn't even know what it is and admits to it. I got that coming up next.

Is AARP really a seniors group or have they become a marketing arm of massive insurance companies? As Senator Rand Paul recently pointed out UnitedHealthcare pays AARP roughly $800 million per year. This explains why AARP supported the Inflation Reduction Act, which had nothing to do with inflation but did give billions of tax dollars to big corporations. If you're a senior, it's time to drop AARP and instead join the conservative alternative, AMac, the Association of Mature American Citizens. They're fighting every day to pass common sense policies for American senior. They're working to preserve Social Security and Medicare past healthcare transparency, secure election integrity and protect our children and grandchildren from the less dangerous agenda. Join me in 2 million Americans nationwide and become an AMac member today for as little as a dollar a month. This is our chance to remind Washington that we have a voice and with the help of AMac, we'll fight to preserve our value. Join AMac today at amac.us slash Dan to that's amac.us slash Dan number two. All right. So this was a Bill Maher apparently as a podcast. I didn't know that, but Bill Maher had a very famous scientist on a guy by the name of Richard Dawkins. Some of you have heard of him. And again, speaking about this is the there is a class and a cabal of elites, academics, entertainers like Gene Simmons, whether they know each other or not. And it's a deliberate cabal is irrelevant. They're all part of this kind of tacit pack that we're all going to engage in group think and never get outside the accepted media gaslighting narrative of the day. We're never going to ask questions. We don't care why people are dying suddenly. If people continue to die, it's totally irrelevant. The result of that has been this, this like hive mind like the Borg from Star Trek, where no outside information is permitted in. That was a role of Twitter and social media isolate people from the truth. The fourth component of gaslighting lie, lie often, lie confidently, isolate people from the truth. How is it? This is the world's one of the world's most famed scientists. And Bill Maher asked about the Great Barrington Declaration. It was a declaration by thousands of hundreds of scientists. I think it was 1600 people who signed it saying, listen, we have to take care of the old elderly and the infirm. But this, but this idea of of quarantines and all of this other stuff is not going to work. It turns out they were right. Fauci and then wanted to shut down Francis Collins. This guy's never even heard of it. Check this out. Why, why are those 16,000 doctors? Why? Why are your doctors better than I know about this 16,000? He's never even heard of it, folks. He's never even heard of it. You know, I think we make this mistake. It's kind of an affirmation bias because we see and, you know, we're subject to it too. Sadly, we're in our own information bubbles too, not nearly to the extent liberals are because unlike liberals, we go out and seek their nonsense like Philip Bump's obvious deep state piece trying to protect the deep state from any kind of observation, right? The left doesn't do that to us. Why? Because the left isn't interested when we have to say, because of my theory, we believe the left are people with bad ideas like Philip Bump. Therefore, we go to see those bad ideas and debunk them. The left thinks we are bad people with ideas. So instantaneously, Tucker Carlson's a conspiracy theorist, that's it. Shut it down. Do no further analysis. The fact that Tucker exposed a bunch of deep status, working at Twitter, that fact is irrelevant. Tucker's a bad guy. And that's it. You get it. You get the difference. You see the difference. The fact that Donald Trump may have supported some people with the Great Barrington Declaration and espouse some of its principles was enough for them to shut it down. So much so, one of the world's most famous scientists, he's never even heard of it. He's never even even admits it. You know about them. I don't know about you. One of the other components, by the way, this cabal of elites, government bureaucrats and deep state buffoons and social media companies, the cabal's real. The cabal's real. I mean, I can prove it. You can't. You can't prove the counter, the inverse. You can. I can prove it. One of the other goals, this cabal is division. Division plus ignorance. That's that's how you guess like people. You get them to believe that the reality we live in, base reality, if we're not in a simulation. But that's for another day. Base reality we live in is not real. That there's an alternate reality out there where vaccines stop the transmission of COVID masks work, social distancing is fantastic. That's an alternate reality. Why? Because nothing I just told you is real. None of that stuff actually works in real reality, okay? But they need division too. Division, they need to in order to make sure that the base realities continue to do the next generation with the kids, they have to divide the kids from the parents. This is important. Please pay attention. This is important. They've got to divide. Please pay. That was how I can turn. Please pay. Forgive me for that. I mean, that's to come off in a ridiculous way. Folks, this is super important. I'm just trying to emphasize it. Where did that point? The way to keep the gaslighting and the alternate reality going forward, where you don't question government, you put your mask on, you take your vaccine, and you shut your mouth like Gene Simmons said. The only way to do that is to separate the kids from the parents so that the parents are in a source of truth for the kids. Really important. One of the ways they're doing it is through this transgender activism. This is not by accident. They are trying to confuse kids about base reality. You were a boy and you were a girl. Hoping that these kids, when their parents say, who told you that? You know, no, you're a boy. Like you're going through a stage. We're going to work through it. Kids tend to be confused about things. The, what do they call them in this clip? Listen to this clip, I'm about to play. They trusted adults. And you heard that. You caught that, right, Joe? When you hear this clip, the trusted adults are going to be the ones to take over and separate you from the parents. This was a hearing up on Capitol Hill yesterday about LGBT to one a plus BIPOC activism. I want you to listen to Jesse Pollock. She's from inside out. Suggesting to this congressman that parents really don't have the right to know about their kids gender transition and that they'll go and they'll intervene with kids as young as 12. Listen. Do parents have a right? Should they be informed about what's going on? Do they have a right to know what's going on in their kids lives? So I think, again, those of us who are protecting and supporting young people are there and trusted with the information of the things that they are dealing with. In terms of parents' rights to know at schools, I mean, here in Colorado, parents don't have the right. If a young person is questioning their gender or their sexuality, their laws in place that say that they have the right to process that with their trusted counselor and so forth. You do a significant amount of your work with kids even starting at age 13. Yeah. What would be the age of consent then in your mind? In our community, the age of consent to mental health therapy is 12 years old. So we have laws that enable young people to connect with trusted adults who can support them. That is just so important. It prevents suicide. And so we serve young people at 13. Listen, I play a lot of clips on the show. I rank that top 10 on how much I've been infuriated by listening to someone speak to people like this. Openly condoning the idea that parents of kids as young as 12 should have these parents should have no right to speak to their kids about some gender confusion episode they may be having at the age of 12. That parents should be isolated from the process as quote, trusted adults trusted, not the parents. You're not trusted. Jump in to tell the kids. This is one of the most important segments I would argue I've done in a long time. This is not by accident. I get these emails, Facebook messages, tweets all the time where people say to me, why? Why? Dan, why do they keep pushing this down our throat? It's trans activism. I don't hate anybody. I don't dislike it. I just want to be left alone. And I don't want my kid groomed. I don't want my kid indoctrinated. I certainly don't want to be isolated from my kid by trusted adults at the age of 12. This is not by accident. People destroying our culture, the cultural socialists for a long time have needed a mechanism to divide the kids from the parents to keep them away. The kids from base reality and living in liberal fantasy land where tax hikes are great, school choices, terrible boys can be girls. They're all methods of division. They need to divide the kids away from the parents because the parents in the family unit are a source of objective truth. That is competition with the state. None of this is by accident. None of it. Here, another perfect example. Story B in the newsletter today, Post Millennial, Mia Ashton. Maryland teacher gives tips on how to keep students gender identity secret from parents. This is not an accident. This is not an accident. The division is intentional. The proof is right in front of your face. All right, I got a lot more to get to including on a lighter note, a Joe Biden mental health check coming up. This is more video Joe Biden and this guy. I got a plan for it. My only regret is I can't play this on the radio show because the sound is kind of useless to video. But you got to watch this. Go to the rumble account and check it out coming up next. The guys always lost on stage. I got that. And he's giving away our money to Africa. But the amount he's kind of confused about. See what I mean in a second. I have the midnight locks mattress from here. Look, sleep. Why? Because sleep, especially as you get older is so critical, especially that deep comforting sleep.

It's time for a Joe Biden mental health check again, folks. It's getting worse. The man clearly is cognitively compromised. I'm not sure what he has. My mental health professional friend thinks it's a frontal lobe dementia case. Here it is again. He's up on the stage. He's sitting there with a bunch of gifts at this, I guess, Toys for Tots type event. Great. That's a good thing. Watch him just walk around closely. No one pays any attention to him. And again, he has seemingly no idea what to do, despite the fact that I've told you well over a hundred times, having done events like this in the past, that he's told what to do. He just can't remember here. Check this out. Again, I don't, I don't, he's told what to do. He is given a card and they do a walk through a rundown with him. Like, here's what you will be. He never, he doesn't remember. Have you ever seen him? Now this does happen in isolated incidents. I mean, she's not the first president to get lost in an event. He is however, the first president to get lost at every event all the time. You got to go to rumble, please and watch us rumble.com plus slash Bongino. It's about 33 minutes into the show. Just watch it. You'll see what I mean. Here's another one yesterday. He's given his speech on giving away more of our taxpayer money to Africa. It doesn't matter that we're in an inflation crisis. We printed $249 billion more dollars last month to pay for government programs. We can't afford. That's not what we spent last month. That's just the deficit last month. $249 billion in one month. Yeah, one month. So we're just giving it away. Even though we're going broke and the economy's about to collapse. Here's Biden yesterday talking about giving money to Africa. This is about a minute. I want you to listen to how many times he changes the amount. Now some of it's due to different programs and regions, I get it. But listen to how many different amounts he puts out. He seems confused about how much money we're giving to Africa. Check this out. Since the start of my administration, MCC has announced new investments of nearly $1.2 billion in Africa, working with Congress to invest $350 billion dollars to facilitate more than almost a half a billion dollars in financing to make sure people across Africa can participate in a digital economy. The $8 billion in public and private finance to help South Africa replace coal-fired power plants. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation is investing nearly $370 million dollars in new projects. $100 million to increase the reliable clean energy for millions of people in Sub-Saharan Africa. $20 million to provide financing fertilizer to help small holder farmers, particularly women farmers, increase the yields of their crops. $10 million to support small and medium-sized enterprises that help bring clean drinking water to communities all across the continent. We announced our intention to collectively mobilize $600 billion dollars in the next five years. That goes on for another minute. Big hat tip to Grabian Tom Elliott over there. He put that supercut together. You get a car. You get a car. He's like the Oprah show. Everybody gets a car. Keep in mind we're in a massive inflationary crisis right now. As you'll see in a minute, and I'll talk about the Fed hike in a second too, but you're watching the collapse of liberalism in live time right now. The complete collapse of government spending programs and inflationary crisis, a border crisis, you're watching it all collapse right now, as people desperately try to escape liberalism. Now, Dan, they're not voting that way. They're not, it's not bad. It's clearly not bad enough for them yet. But the fact that it's bad is factually accurate. Border crossings, fentanyl deaths, the inflation number, the debt numbers, the long term, excuse me, the labor force participation numbers, the productivity numbers, those are facts. Your opinion about how bad that is is fine. That's up to you. But that the situation is unparalleled in 40 years. The inflationary crisis is a fact. It's an opinion. I'll get to that in a second. I wanted to play this first. The inflation crisis, border crisis, the public safety crisis, they're just exploding. You're watching the collapse of liberalism in live time. And it's gotten so bad that even outlets like CNN can't ignore it anymore. It really shocks me. They're covering this and not just totally ignoring it. That's how little faith I have in these idiots. I guess the situation is so bad and the elections over. They figure, okay, now we can talk about it. Here's just a quick clip from CNN discussing in real terms, nitty gritty dirt under the fingernails, meat and potatoes money. How bad the inflation crisis is for the average American family. Take a listen. $396 more the average American household is spending each month to buy the same goods and services it bought a year ago. That 7.1% annual inflation rate is painfully high, but it is cooling from the extra $493 a month of an American households were paying more in June when the rate was 9.1%. They got to throw that in at the end, Joe, don't worry, you were paying $493 more a month than you would have prior to the inflation crisis in June. Now it's only what 370. Oh, that's pretty good. You feel I feel better too. That's just fantastic. Thank you, CNN, for clearing that up. Why are they covering this? Because the elections over and they can't run away from it anymore. Folks, you understand the situation is going to get worse. It'll get better. I'm long in the United States. I am. I don't want to get too knee deep in it, but I'm telling you that fusion story. One years away from the technology, I get it, but that breakthrough in fusion energy proves my point that I've said, you guys have heard it. You heard it if you're P1 listeners mean and you're dedicated diehards have been here from the beginning. I've said it over and over. I'm long on the United States. You should be too. Bedding against the United States long term is one of the stupidest decisions you can ever make. We'll get out of this, but it's going to get worse before it gets better. Why? Because we're just printing more money and we're not producing enough stuff. It's just that simple. That's on Monday's show if you want to watch the evidence there Monday or Tuesday's show, but it's right there. Now, despite the fact that we're in an inflationary crisis, as you can see, the Fed raised the federal, the Fed Reserve number raised it by 50 basis points yesterday. So they raised interest rates to a half a point to the highest level. It's been in 15 years. They're going to continue to go up because they're trying to squash the money supply by making the cost of money more expensive. Here's the problem. Dan, you just said it's going to get worse. It is because the Fed can raise interest rates all at once, folks. If Joe Biden keeps spending money in the Democrats and swampy Republicans, too, that we don't have, which they are doing, they're proposing an omnibus package. It's going to spend trillions more we don't have. It doesn't matter. The Fed can print all the money they want. Excuse me, can raise the interest rates to whatever they want to try to squelch the money supply. If they're printing more, it doesn't make a difference. It doesn't make a difference. And if you don't address the production side to create more stuff and get rid of the productivity crisis we're having, none of this is going to matter. So I'm telling you, it's going to get worse. But they are looking to pass an omnibus, too. And our good friend, Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis had something to say about that. This is a latest installment of Ron DeSantis strikes again. So he was on Laura Ingraham's show and the Democrats and swampy Republicans, the McConnell crew and all the others, they're looking to pass an omnibus package. Here's the nitty gritty of that. They want to pass a spending package that'll carry through next year. Now, you're probably saying to yourself, why would they do that? Because the Republicans just won back the house and they're about to be seated in early January, where they could probably stop a lot of this crappy spending. Didn't we vote for change? Oh, you did. But the swampy Republicans just want to go home for Christmas and give you the middle finger. So Ron DeSantis was on Ingraham's show last night. He addressed just this, check this out. Why do you think the Republicans would not want to do that? Kevin McCarthy or whoever will be speaker? Why do you think? Laura, you're looking to a guy that has voted against omnibus bills in my sleep when I was in Congress. I mean, that's just the way these guys operate. I never fit into that. And part of the reason I read for governor quite frankly is because I didn't like the way Washington operated. But yeah, you have really both parties have been addicted to these big omnibus bills. They'll put it out. It'll be thousands of pages. No one will really be able to read it. And it's basically back to Nancy Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi government, pass it to find what's in it. And I think the American people are sick of that. I need a favor from you. I don't ask for a lot of favors. Please call your congressman and your senators or send him an email. Please do it today. I'm begging you to do it and tell them you are watching their vote on any omnibus bill and the omnibus bill is a big no. Pass a stopgap. Fine. Get us to the next session when Republicans take over. No omnibus. There's no reason to do it. You're just quitting, which swampy Republicans are good at. All right, I've got a lot more coming up, including the mass evacuation from New York continues. I told you younger voters are leaving and liberals fighting back against the Second Amendment. Yeah, in a very interesting way. They've got a devious tactic they're employing. I should say tactics. We'll finish the show with that today. Don't go anywhere. Let me get to this first. Patriot Mobile. Have you seen those offers for free iPhones? Usually too good to be true because just like freedom itself, you know, nothing is free. Mobile phone companies not only lock you into long term contracts, but they also build the price of the phone into the bill with hidden fees. That's a trick with Patriot Mobile. They can show you how to get that same iPhone interest free without the games. No contract. Patriot Mobile's America's only Christian conservative wireless provider. They offer nationwide coverage on the best 4G and 5G networks because they use the same towers as the major carrier. So you hit the same great service while supporting a company is fighting to preserve our God given rights and freedoms. Patriot Mobile also offers a performance guarantee like that. If you're not happy with your coverage, you can switch to either of the three major carriers they provide for free. Go to patreon mobile.com slash Dan or call them 100% US based customer service team at 972. Patriot. Get free activation today with the offer code Dan. If you're fed up with well companies that don't care about your values or our country support a company that does Patriot Mobile. The websites patreon mobile dot com slash Dan or call 972. Patriot. Thanks, Patriot Mobile. So this is all intentional. Obviously the bankrupting of the United States, the division, the cabal of censorship. We've talked about it through the whole show, you sense in the theme. Folks, they know it's grossly unpopular. They just don't care as long as they're winning elections. And I would argue they did well in the midterms, not necessarily in the house, but with governorships and clearly in the Senate, they actually picked up a seat. Of course they did well. Nothing's going to stop them until you impose real material losses on them. And you give them a one way ticket out of their seats in office. It's not happening yet. Democrats want more of this, which is strange because Democrats are abandoning New York City in mass. Look at this Breitbart article in my newsletter today. Democrat run New York City loses 16% of its top taxpayers. I'm telling you, the power of the gaslighting is so strong that people by their actions will acknowledge they don't like what's going on moving out of liberal cities, i.e. and then go and vote for the same thing again. It's almost like being in a cult. You know you're not supposed to drink the Kool-Aid because everybody's dropping around you and you do it anyway. A lot of this also explains, as I said in the beginning of the show, why young voters enthusiasm for the Democrat party is waning significantly. This is from the AP folks. You can read it right here. Voters under 31, 53% for them house candidates compared with only 41% for Republicans according to AP. But that level of support was down compared with 2020 when it was 61, 36. Of course, young voters enthusiasm for Democrats is waning. Who wants to be a part of the machine part? The man back in the hippies, 60s and 70s and the late, you know, all these people wanted to do is get away from the man again, rage against the machine. They are the machine now. Young voters don't want to be told what to do. I had a bumper sticker on my car, question authority when I was younger. Where are the rest of the, I'm actually surprised that Democrats got 53% of the house vote. Here's a troubling article too. I wanted you to read. I'm going to talk about this here. I'm going to give it a second. It's in my newsletter, bongino.com slash newsletter. Please check it out. You can subscribe. It's free of course. Watch the examiner. These blue states, these liberal states that people are evacuating in mass, not just are they attacking your money. It's why people are leaving. They're also attacking your freedom, public safety is a mess. So we had the Supreme Court decision on the Second Amendment that basically told New York State that this shall issue stuff, this may issue stuff is an nonsense. You shall issue permits. You can't determine if someone's a legal citizen in the United States and has done nothing wrong. You basically can't stop them from getting a gun permit. So what are they doing? Blue states that hate freedom and liberty and don't want you to be able to protect yourself from against the public safety nightmare they created. They're doing this little slick kind of maneuver where they say, okay, the Supreme Court said, I have to give you a gun permit. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to make you do X, Y, and Z first. That makes it practically impossible for you to get a permit. So even though we're told to do it, we can Joe, wink and nod. We're doing it, but you're going to do this first. So here's some of the tricks Sarah Westwood covers them in this piece. First, they're declaring these sensitive zones, which have just been struck down in corporate. The left doesn't care. They'll do more of them. So what they're doing is they're saying, yeah, you can carry a gun. We'll give you the permit, no problem. But you just can't carry them in these sensitive zones. Schools, churches, malls, streets, non streets, buildings, office buildings, any place with a blue sky, any place with water within 500 miles, anyone with a bike around anywhere with not a bike around, near a car, near a kid, near an adult, near a senior, near a nursing home and you're like, is there anywhere I can carry a gun? No, but yet you can carry. We'll give you the permit. The sensitive zones thing is their latest trick. There's another one. They're doing this little stunt with permitting. We're going to give you a gun, Joe. We'll give you that permit. No problem. The permits $42 million. Oh, okay. Oh, thank you. We'll give you the guy. He's got to be exact hyperbolic stuff 42 million. That you get the point. They're trying to make the costs of the process prohibitive so that ironically, the low income people they claim to support who be trying to protect themselves in high crime areas are the ones who get screwed the most. Oh, trick. Oh, oh, you're all this trick in the book. Another one magazine restrictions. Now, not only you're not going to be able to buy a magazine that says eight rounds or more, but you're not going to be able to buy a gun that supports magazines that has eight rounds or more. Yeah, yes, yes, that's it. There's more. That's not just it. So again, no, give you a permit. You just can't carry it anywhere. It's going to cost 42 mil and you can't carry a gun. We don't light. Here's another one. They say, you got to take this training course. You're like, oh, okay, where is it? Well, the training course is you reading this thing. It's so ridiculous that most of the states don't even offer the course. So yeah, we'll give you the permit. You got to take a training course. That course doesn't exist. That sounds like your problem. Now mine. And here's the last one. They're doing character checks. Yeah, yeah, we'll give you the permit. No problem. Turn over your social media handles. Wait, what? What is this North Korea? You see how they do this? They kind of tinkle around the edges to say, yeah, yeah, we're going to give you the permit. But time out, baby. Only if you meet these conditions that are unattainable. They're all all this stuff is going to be litigated. The left never gives up. Swampy Republicans do, however, they gave up on the omnibus already. You see how they fight? You don't have to like this stuff and you shouldn't, but you should admire their tactics. I wish the swampy Republicans would do the same. Let me throw in one last piece here. I want you to read in town hall because it's important. It's about the witness testimony in Arizona. Folks, there are tons of stories emerging in Arizona, specifically Maricopa County over the elections over there. The Carrie Lake, specifically Katie Hobbs, Governor's race in Arizona. And Rachel Alexander is a good piece in town hall. I'd like you to read. She talks about how, you know, the left, they're always talking about voter disenfranchisement. Members, Stacey Abrams, oh, my gosh, all these people in Georgia couldn't vote. She's the governor in her initial Brian Camprace. And yet no one could seem to find anyone. It's kind of strange. The left cares about voter disenfranchisement because the Carrie Lake team has found a whole bunch of people who are disenfranchised from voting. And it's weird how the left doesn't care. The piece is called Stop Pretending Witness Testimony as In Qualifies Evidence in GOP voter disenfranchisement lawsuit. Folks, the next time the left brings up some story about Jim Crow 2.0 or voter disenfranchisement. I want you to just laugh them off, laugh in their faces as loud as you can. And say it's interesting because when we had these testimonials come up in Arizona, you didn't care at all because you're a candidate woman. Sesame, you have zero principle. She's always been the case. You're only a principal's power. All right, folks, thanks again for tuning in. I really appreciate it. I ask at the end of every show.
