    "text": " According to a new report out of the UK, the leader of the World Health Organization, quote, privately believes the COVID pandemic started following a leak from a Chinese laboratory. And this is, of course, very strange because for years now, I have been reliably informed by the always trustworthy establishment media that the lab leak theory was a wild and irresponsible conspiracy theory. President Trump is pushing a conspiracy theory again. That coronavirus began in a lab in China that the five eyes, these are America's closest allies in the intelligence community, are now saying, that's not the evidence we've seen. The evidence we've seen points us to animal to human transmission. Someone saying that the virus came from a lab. The publications say it's actually something the virus has happened naturally. It came naturally. The CDCs that are based in Hubei and Wuhan and also they told me they spoke, they hope to go to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. That's a place that had a lot of focus on it, particularly under the former Trump administration, when many senior officials, they're pointed towards it without evidence, without facts, to suggest it might have been the source of a lab leak. WHO investigators say they've seen no evidence of a lab leak. World Health Organization, I should point out, Don, they say the lab leak theory extremely unlikely. Extremely unlikely. Just another conspiracy theory, except now, according to this report that cites a top government official, quote, while publicly the World Health Organization maintains that all hypotheses remain on the table about the origins of COVID, the source said, Tedros Adonom Gabrizis, the director general of the WHO, had recently confided to a senior European politician that the most likely explanation was a catastrophic accident in a laboratory in Wuhan, where infections first spread in late 2019. Of course, normal people have known that the lab leak theory was likely almost from the very beginning. That's not what's interesting about this story. It's not even all that interesting that the WHO has changed its mind. The most interesting part and the most important part of this new report is that while the head of the WHO apparently now believes that the lab caused the pandemic, he's trying to keep that information private. The reason is that the WHO, which is the institutional face of science with a capital S over the last two and a half years, is primarily a political organization contrary to the fantasies of the libs and the squishes, there are no neutral institutions. Big institutional power means big politics and the organizations that deny that they have a political bent are usually the most politically dangerous. I'm Michael Nolzis, the Michael Nolz Show. Welcome back to to show my favorite comment Friday is from old school. Oh, man old school has been on the board number of times who said the problem isn't that there are people who are getting things like icons and mascots canceled. It's that there aren't enough people willing to speak up against them and push back. That is such a good point. The iconic class mobs are always going to be around. They're always going to be trying to tear things down. In healthy societies, you've got people who will say no, here is why it's good to have a George Washington mascot. Here is why it's good to wave the American flag. Here's why we're going to stand up for our symbols and for our civilization. The problem with our society is you've got the barbarians at the gates. They're frankly past the gates at this point. And then all the people who are supposed to defend the society, we just shrug our shoulders. We say, well, you know, we just, well, we all have to be neutral. Well, maybe you're right. Maybe it's got maybe we shouldn't. Maybe we shouldn't let American flag. Maybe it's not very inclusive. Maybe we shouldn't. They throw their hands up in the air and they don't defend any of the symbols they don't offer and affirmative vision.

Right now, we've just had this two year, more than two years of the coronavirus pandemic and the World Health Organization is hiding what it really believes about the origin of the virus to play politics with China. Okay, great. And now we've got this monkeypox virus that's spreading around, not quite as quickly as COVID, but it's spreading around the world. And the World Health Organization, Tedros Ananum Gabrizis, I could try for 10 years, I will not ever pronounce that man's name correctly. I keep trying. I have a different pronunciation every single time that that man and the World Health Organization that he runs, they're focused on the really important things, namely, changing the name of the virus. W.A. Joe is also working with partners and experts from around the world on changing the name of monkeypox virus, its clades and the disease it goes. We will make announcements about the new names as soon as possible. Thank you so much, Tedros. I'm so glad the WHO is devoting all of its resources to changing the name of the virus, not just stopping the virus, not to trying to figure out why this virus is spreading right now, not to trying to investigate and then publicly explain how that first virus started. No, no, we've got to change the name. They did this with COVID. They did this with COVID. They discouraged the term Chinese coronavirus, the Wuhan virus. They discouraged all of that. They then changed all of the names. You couldn't talk about the South African variant or the Indian variant. No, no, no, it was Delta, Ami, Lamit, and that's great. They finally have controlled our language and that's what's important, isn't it? They don't want to call it monkeypox because they say monkeypox is racist because the virus comes from Africa, which you sort of think, I didn't make that connection. When I heard monkeypox, I didn't view that as racist because I don't view black people as monkeys. The World Health Organization, it's the liberals who are doing, they're saying, wow, this monkeypox virus, it's just people's first thought is going to be that black people are monkeys. Say, no, that's your first, that's not my first thought. What's wrong with you people? So they say, that's really important. We've got to reduce stigma. They say, quote, in the context of the current global outbreak, continued reference to a nomenclature of this virus being African is not only inaccurate, but is also discriminatory and stigmatizing. So it's not inaccurate. It's a primarily African virus. The virus was first discovered in Zaire in 1970. That's where most of the breakouts have been throughout the history of monkeypox. The only other place where you had big outbreaks was West Africa. So yes, it is African in origin. I don't think there's anything discriminatory about referring to the virus by the name that it's had for 50 years. And then there's this question of stigma. Our culture wants to get rid of stigma. Stigmas are really bad that we want to get rid of shame. We want to get rid of stigma. We want to get rid of anything that's particular, but stigma can be an important thing. The stigma that most people are talking about with monkeypox is that it's primarily infecting gay guys. It started at a gay fetish orgy in Belgium and then at another gay bath house in Spain. That's where the big outbreaks have been. That's what's driving the global spread of monkeypox. But the World Health Organization and the rest of the liberal establishment doesn't want to point out that the virus is primarily a gay thing because they say that's homophobic and for goodness sake, during Pride Month, we can't mention something like that. But if you want to save gay people, shouldn't you mention that? Far from it being homophobic, don't you think it's actually quite homophilic? And don't you think it's quite pro gay people living to let them know that this is primarily a gay thing and they should cut out the bath houses if they want to not catch the monkeypox virus? In the United Kingdom, 99% of monkeypox cases are among gay guys. 99% of the people who have monkeypox in the UK are gay guys. And 1%, maybe they're being honest, maybe they're not. I'm not sure. But the overwhelming, overwhelming, almost 100% of people who have it are gay guys. So if you want to stop the spread of the virus and you want to protect people from catching it and potentially dying, shouldn't you say, hey, gay guys, be on high alert, stop doing that stuff that's going to have you catch monkeypox. Don't go to an orgy and do that thing you shouldn't be doing with 100 guys at night. If you don't want to catch monkeypox, I've had gay friends of mine say that if you really wanted to protect the gay community, you would rename monkeypox gay orgypox. And then because it would increase stigma, and it would increase stigma specifically around orgies in Belgium and bath houses in Spain, and that would be a good thing. It would be a good thing on lots and lots of levels. But the WHO can't do that because it's very politically incorrect to suggest that certain viruses will spread more rapidly, much more. Almost infinitely more rapidly among the gay community. And so they put all their focus on political correctness and try to rename the virus and distract from certain facts that are crucial in trying to stop the spread. That is because it's political. So knowing that it is political, we shouldn't pretend that it's this totally neutral scientific institution. It's not. It's bankrolled in large part by China. It's politically allied to China, and so they cover up for China a lot of the time. And it's part of a broader apparatus of liberal transnational institutions that push all the weird pathologies of liberalism, like vocation and political correctness, and all the rest of it. Normal people are pushing back on this kind of thing. You want to talk about orgies. I don't really want to talk about orgies, but parents are pushing back on this in schools and libraries. That parents movement that you've seen at school boards, that you've seen at libraries pushing back on drag queen story hour on critical race theory on the weird gender ideology in elementary schools, that isn't just conservative Republicans. That isn't just right wingers. That is people in the middle. That is centrists. That is liberals. That is center left too. And they're showing up. There's an incredible meeting at the Dickson Illinois Library Board. Dickson, I think that's where Ronald Reagan is from, actually. And they show up to the library board. The library wants to have a bunch of porn for kids in the library, and the parents show up and they say, hey, here is what's going on, and we don't want this.

Parents in Dixon, Illinois are pushing back on the weird stuff at their libraries. 4XX. Doesn't belong in our library, not accessible to children, completely inappropriate, not okay. Not okay, completely inappropriate. Keep this stuff out of the library. One, I love that these parents are doing it. Two, I love that people are videotaping it, so the rest of us can see it because I imagine that library board doesn't want this kind of video getting out. Three, please send me your tips. I think it's very important on this show that we not only comment on the crazy TikTok videos, we comment on the national news story, but it's very important to be able to bring this kind of information out there. Courage is contagious when one community that feels bogged down by wokeism sees another small town, another local community pushing back against it. It can really spread. It can create a movement. So send me your tips. Send me your videos. You can do it through my personal website, michaeljaneolds.com. You can send it to my daily wire email. I don't care. You can send it via carrier pigeon, but send me your tips from your local community. I think we need to get a little bit more activist, especially as the midterm elections are rolling around. The parents are coming up there. They're not exactly calling for book burnings. Worth pointing out, by the way, that some of the greatest people in history have supported book burnings. I know this is an unpopular view in some corners of the right, but it's true. Plato supported book burnings. The apostles supported book burnings. It's in the New Testament for goodness sakes. Martin Luther, I'm Catholic. I'm not a huge Martin Luther fan, but Martin Luther supported book burnings. But anyway, they're not calling for book burnings. They're just saying, look, you can have whatever books you want in the library, even radical content, even content I don't agree with, but not pornography, not obscenity. There has never been a protection for that ever in our whole civilization, certainly not in this country. And so no, where kids are going to be accessing this, we don't want that stuff. This is why you don't go into a library and say, back in the 1970s or 80s, hey, I'd like to check out 10 playboys today. And they say, well, sir, we don't have playboys. They say, this is censorship. This is a book burning. This is no, it's not. You just can't, you're not entitled to smut in the public library. And if the taxpayers don't want to pay for smut, they shouldn't have to. We have the right to community standards. We have the right to obscenity laws. We have to remember that schools, libraries, these are political organizations. Conservatives don't, they don't notice that all the time, because we think, well, let's get the politics out of schools. Let's get the politics out of entertainment. Let's, but political just means public. That's all it means. The words are synonymous. Things that pertain to our public life together. And so a library, of course, that's political. Well, it's funded by the taxpayers. It's pushing certain messages. When the library is promoting drag queen story hour, that is the political community endorsing perversion and weirdness and confusion and a sexual ideology. When the schools are promoting this stuff, that is political. The point of public schooling is to create citizens. There is almost nothing more political in America than public education. So of course, this is going to be political. The left knows that, so they wield the politics to their own ends. And the right for a long time has just said, well, let's just be neutral. Okay, let's kick the Bible out of schools. Okay, let's allow the drag queen reading hour. Okay, no, of course not. Then you're just giving your whole politics to the left. Do not do that sort of thing. On the topic of sex and politics, FIFA, the soccer organization, who's just made a major ruling or I'm sorry, is proposing a major new rule on sex and politics. That would be dropping the testosterone requirements for men who want to compete against women. So men who identify as women, they play in the girls league. And as of now, there are certain requirements that they not have testosterone above a certain threshold. And FIFA is considering dropping this. The current eligibility standard for men who identify as women is less than five nanomoles per liter after at least 12 months. But now they'll say, no, look, look, that man is a woman no matter how much testosterone she has pumping through her veins and through her male anatomy and through her just heaving, hulking muscles and through her giant manly masculine frame. She truly is a woman no matter how much she is a man. Of course, of course, this had to happen. Mark my words. I'm making a Nolstradamus prediction right now. If the transgender ideology is going to advance, if it's not rejected, they're going to have to get rid of the testosterone limits. They have to because either these people, these men really are women or they're not either either they're women or they're not. They can't they there is no way to maintain any even semblance of coherence to for transgenderism if they say that the demarcator of whether a man is a woman is the amount of testosterone he has. They can't as the premise of transgenderism is my body has nothing to do with who I really am. The premise of transgenderism is I'm a woman trapped in a man's body. So you can't have a body requirement to advance the transgender agenda. You have to get the body out of it completely. Either they're men or they're women and we have to decide even FIFA is a political organization. Sports leagues are political sports athletics has had a very close connection to patriotism to the business of the state going all the way back to ancient Greece going all the way back to the Olympic Games and in every civilization and society since then. That's always been the case. This is why it was such a big deal when Colin Kaepernick came out and protested the American flag at the NFL. Why do we waive the American flag at the NFL? Why do we have the star spangled banner? Why do we have the Pledge of Allegiance in some sports games? Because sports always has something to do with the political order. And so Colin Kaepernick pretty pretty wisely. He's not a very wise man but he had a clever move here. He said I'm going to subvert that. So the issue is not that we're injecting politics into sports as some people held it to be. The issue is we are using sports to subvert the traditional political order that sports plays a role in. And here you've got this sports league making a political decision. Men can be women. That's what they're saying. And increasingly what sports leagues have said. We have to decide the issue one way or the other. We the people. You know how I want to decide it. I think transgenderism is insane. I don't think it's a real category of being. I think people who consider themselves to be transgender should be given psychiatric help and philosophical help and spiritual help and all sorts of help but they should not be indulged. And I think that the people who promote this stuff should probably be imprisoned. That's how I want to decide it. Maybe you want to decide it differently. Maybe you think transgenderism is totally real and we need to be really tolerant and men should be able to go in the women's bathrooms and men should be able to play on the women's soccer team. I certainly don't care about women's soccer. I couldn't possibly care any less about anything than women's soccer. I do care about truth. I do care about reality. But I'm just observing even outside of my own political preferences. I'm observing the fact that we have to decide the question publicly, politically, for everyone. There's only going to be one standard that we're all living under here and you're going to see it in the sports teams and at work and at school and in our government and everywhere else in society. It's not enough to say, well, you do you and I'll do me. You can't do that on basic questions about how we're going to live. It'd be like saying that we can't have a national language. For right now, we still have a national language in America. The language is English. That's what our signs are printed in. That's what government forms are printed in. The Libs kind of one on one do that and have lots of different languages. But still, the language of America is English. We don't each have the right to speak our own language. If we did that, if all of us spoke our own language, we wouldn't communicate. Society would break down. We just walk up and say, Ghibli gobbledygoot, Shammalamadam, Bump Bump, B-Bop Nengdong watermelon and say, huh? And then some other person would come out and speak a different language, and there would be no communication. You have to have some shared experience. You have to have some things in common if you want to have a political community. And one of those things you've got to have in common is, what is a man? What is a woman? This is why the marriage question had to be decided politically you couldn't have everyone just decide well it's my own personal preference of what marriage is no you have to you have to have that kind of common language and the libs know it which is why they're pushing for their radical wrong vision on these questions and the conservatives have thrown their hands up in the air i heard this during during the marriage debate they said well look i'm a libertarian on this question well look i'm agnostic on this question well look i just want to get the government out of it oh okay so you just you're just going to concede it to the lips that's all that means is look i just don't want to get political here i oh okay well the other guy wants to get political and the other guy who who is pushing a campaign that totally opposes what you believe in then he's going to win because the guy who's willing to wield political power who's going to actually engage in political questions he is going to be the one to succeed that's why it's so important to lean in here to the culture and to these political decisions that's what the daily wire is doing right now we are not only commenting on the culture we are going and creating it too and that is nowhere clearer than in the daily wires newest movie the movie that uncanceled jina korano terror on the prairie you want to watch that movie head on over right now daily wire dot com slash subscribe join us today that code is null skenw les daily wire dot com slash subscribe we'll be right back with a lot more either transgenderism is real or it is not real that's why they've got to push it on kids they have to push it on kids some conservatives some squishes they want to say well look i'm fine with transgenderism but just not for the kids it's not that doesn't make any sense if transgenderism is real and you can really be a man trapped in a woman's body then for sure we should let the kids who have that problem transition if if some kid is really born and he's a woman trapped in a man's body and he's just this this woman trying desperately to get out then of course we should if it is the case that the medical interventions and the chopping and the puberty blockers and the hormone replacement really does allow the true woman inside of the little boy to come out and flourish then of course we should do that we should do it as soon as possible but that's not the case it's not a real thing it's a fake thing it's a delusion it's a fantasy and a psychological problem that should be treated not indulged but if it's a fake thing then we just shouldn't indulge it if if the the experience of of feeling like a woman trapped in a man's body is is just pathological if it's just a if it's just a mental illness then we should treat the mental illness not chop off functioning body parts you you have to decide it based on reality based on truth the left is making a truth claim they're saying transgenderism is real the conservatives up until this point have made a preference claim they've said well look I don't I don't want to adhere to that ideology but I don't want to stop you from blowing I have no right to force my views on you and if you want to do that that's just fine I throw my hands up in the air I don't want to get political I don't come on I just want to live and let live oh okay so you're just conceding the issue to the libs and they're going to push it on kids they have to push on libs or on the kids rather the libs have to push it on the kids it's confusing to say they have to because you're you are tacitly granting their premise and the logical conclusion of their premise that transgenderism is real is that you should allow the kids to transition and that's what they're doing a major transgender health organization has this is the world world professional association for transgender health says it's going to change its advice on when teenagers should be able to get treatment also known as poison and mutilation because it is unethical and harmful to withhold early treatment so the updated advice is saying that kids should be put on cross-sex hormones starting at 14 and the kids should have mutilation surgery where they chop off their genitals starting at 15 this is sickening stuff I actually feel nauseated reading this information by the way the puberty blockers start way earlier the puberty blockers could start at eight and by the age of 17 you should be able to have full-on genital mutilation not just the cosmetic stuff but semi-cosmetic stuff not just the top surgery as it's called where you lop off perfectly healthy breasts but even the downstairs stuff too of course they're going to get away with this because the conservatives totally seated the ground because we're not we're not even engaging in the debate we're saying well i'm agnostic on whether it's true or false even if i think transgenderism is false i don't want to push my political views on you and three this isn't a place for politics this is this should just be decided by individuals and oh okay well then then the other guys are going to make the truth claims and the other guys are going to force their views on everybody else including poor little kids and the other eyes are going to order the culture and the politics that's what's going to happen and by the way the the conservatives and the kind of squishy people who have been saying the whole time well just let people make their own decisions they're now leaving these poor kids who by definition can't make their own decisions they're below the age of consent they're leaving them to the predations of these psychos and these perverts and to be charitable that charitable about it these confused people who have fallen under the thrall of transgender ideology which is completely absurd and incoherent is that good is there anything good or compassionate about allowing that to happen i don't think so so what's the solution it's a very simple solution we just say no we say no i'm we've let this go way too far transgenderism is absurd people who think that their transgender should be placed in asylums or at least in counseling and the people who promote this stuff the doctors and the teachers and the media people and the politicians we should pass laws against that of grooming little kids for this nonsense and we should put the people who break them in jail and that's that and we're deciding that it's not real anymore we're going to be charitable and compassionate about the issue but it's not charitable and compassionate to mutilate little kids bodies and sterilize them when they're 14 years old and frankly starting even even earlier at eight years old there's no whatever train of thought has led you to the place where you're sterilizing little kids you've gone down the wrong path your premises are wrong we need to try something different if transgenderism is real which it's not but if it's real then this article that i just read in Time magazine is totally normal if transgenderism is not real and it isn't it is not real using lots of double negatives here then this article in Time magazine is the creepiest thing i've ever read it's called the pain and pride of a generation changing how it sees gender the cover photo i'm going to block out the poor kid's face the cover photo is freedom a two-spirit 13-year-old posing for a portrait for Time magazine Time magazine just spent a year going around the country taking photographs of sexually confused little kids this is how they describe it they say that they're they're taking photos of gender expansive kids where is Chris Hanson when you need him i i wish Time magazine had called my house said hey do you have any gender expansive kids living with you yeah no what's the age limit all i don't know 13 maybe even younger yeah we want to talk to them about their sexual desires and identities say sure come on over at five o'clock i'd have Chris Hanson waiting in my kitchen oh yeah Time magazine yeah why don't you take a seat right over here oh no i wasn't going to do nothing no no why don't you listen Time magazine why don't you take a seat right over here what were you planning on doing you want to take pictures of little kids with sexual confusion it's super duper creepy we our whole society would have known this five years ago and exploitative and wrong and child abuse now we celebrate it why we celebrate it because we're letting the libs run the politics and the conservatives are just backing off i'd bet you i guarantee you the majority of americans don't think that we should be taking pictures of sexually confused little kids i guarantee you the majority of americans don't think that 13 year old boys should be dressing up like girls and putting stilettos on and stuff i promise you they don't think that so why are we letting it happen it's not because the liberals have been and the progressives and the leftists and whatever term you want to use have been so incredibly genius and they're just they're just unstoppable it's mostly because the conservative surrendered and gave up even the drag queens get this even there is a great viral video going around of a drag queen an actual performing drag queen saying guys what why the hell are you all being so supportive of the drag queens what in the hell has a drag queen ever done to make you have so much respect for them and admire them so much other than put on makeup and jump on the floor and ride around and do sexual things on stage i have absolutely no idea why you would want that to influence your child would you want a stripper or a porn star to influence your child it makes no sense at all a drag queen performs in a nightclub for adults there is a lot of filth that goes on a lot of sexual stuff that goes on and backstage there's a lot of nudity sex and drugs okay and honestly you're not doing the gay community any favors in fact you're hurting us okay we have already had a reputation of being pedophiles and being perverts and deviants we don't need you to bring your children around so you keep your kids at home or take them to disneyland or take them to chucky cheese preach preach drag queen you're telling it like it is i love that line take them to chucky cheese what's wrong with you people what what has a drag queen ever done to make you have so much respect for us you think oh right it was amazing how quickly the the libs did this they blurred all the lines he said gay guys and we need to tolerate gay guys and by tolerating gay guys we need to embrace transgenderism for some reason i don't really quite know how that necessarily follows and and then if we're for an embrace transgenderism we need to support drag shows there's even a difference between transgenderism and a drag show transgenderism is when a confused man thinks that he's a woman a drag show is when a deviant man knows that he's not a woman but thinks it'll be kind of funny to dress up like one and put on a body sexual performance those are totally different things and then this drag queen he says what we're basically strippers why are you why are you taking your kids to the stripper shows what have we done we haven't done it all the defining feature of a drag queen is putting on sex shows sexual shows in nightclubs for adults the difference between a drag queen and a stripper well other than the anatomical differences is that a stripper puts on a sexual show and a drag queen puts on a funny sexual show a drag show is just basically a stripper burlesque show with more jokes and humor right and you have the drag queen and the drag queens are really outrageous and that's why when they do the parades up and down new york they're telling jokes and doing all sorts of comedy but it's that's it it's just kind of a funny funnier sex show you wouldn't take your kid to a strip club why would you take your kid to a and you wouldn't take your kid even to a late night raunchy comedy show why would you take your kid to both of them at the same time with a lot of sexual confusion added on in addition because we've it's because we have lost our minds on indulgence i'm not surprised that the libs are pushing this stuff the libs have always had an interest in sexualizing well everybody and especially kids they've been writing about this for a hundred years villehelm Reich going back to the the early 20th century this leftist intellectual said that the problem all of the problems in the world war disease everything between they're caused by a lack of orgasms not joking and he said that he invented an organ accumulator to collect the essence of of life and the essence of the world the orgons floating around this was mocked in the pop culture is in orgasmatron and lots of intellectuals on the left had it norman mailer had it jd salinger had it bernie sanders wrote about this kind of stuff and how we need to sexualize kids he wrote about it in the 1960s in essays in the vermont freeman you can still read them they've been i get why the libs are pushing this stuff it's part of their their campaign to upend society in the words of marks ruthlessly criticize everything that exists my only issue here is why i'm being so harsh on the conservatives here is what have you been doing they've been telling you what they want to do for 50 to 100 years now they've been doing it successfully and then what do you do you say well you know it's not my place if someone wants to put on a drag show for children that's a blessing of liberty and that's it's not my place to ever have a point of view about that well what the libs don't think that the conservatives didn't think that until five minutes ago i don't i'm not even sure you really think that i just that you've just been deluded or you're so beaten down by the leftist advances in the culture that you don't you don't have the hoods but to go out and fight come on push back and fight guys you know the other aspect of the drag queens that's important here is the transgender person wants to pretend that he's really the woman it's a it's a realistic performance of a woman the the essence of a drag show is that it's a very unrealistic performance this difference between realism and unrealism is at the heart of it there was a tick-tock that went viral the other day of some confused woman describing not just her transgenderism but her neo pronouns and specifically why she uses them so neo pronouns are any set of pronouns that aren't officially recognized in the language that you use someone might use neo pronouns because uh officially recognized pronouns might give them dysphoria or using neo's could give someone gender euphoria i use them because they give me euphoria because i really enjoy confusing people with my gender identity which sounds kind of weird but it gives me euphoria so whatever i really like using they them and fafare in conversation like when i'm talking and i really like using bun bun self uh like if i'm texting someone or i guess just on my internet um that's that's the way i like using them so an example of fafare pronouns could be i really like fair jacket today it's fair favorite color fae like the color purple and an example of bun bun self pronouns could be bunched up on my fuyi page today bun really likes using neo pronouns bun really gets a kick out of this and bun would prefer if you would refer to bun by bun self's preferred bun buns and pronouns that's true it does not give me euphoria it gives me bemusement but it doesn't give me euphoria euphoria is the key word there i'm so glad this gal gets it this gal i don't think she intended to point this out but she says the opposite of dysphoria is euphoria in the transgender ideology dysphoria means this unrealistic view of your own body that is a negative view of your own body but euphoria as it is used in modern life is an unrealistic feeling of happiness euphoria is what you get when you shoot up heroin that's the if the feeling that you get you're not you're not really happy you're not really thriving or flourishing but it's the feeling that you get and this this gal seems to suggest that those are the only two ways to live in this dysphoria or this euphoria how about you live in real life how about real life with real happiness grounded on real things that is entirely missing from the conversation the extreme the extreme unrealism of what the left is pushing especially when we're talking about the sex stuff is a big problem and i feel for this girl this girl who says you know refer to me as bun bun self and fairy pronouns and whatever all these pronouns that are even beyond the 57 usual ones that we get these days this girl is it has been raised at a time of such surreality where life is not lived primarily in the real world but has lived in the virtual world it's increasingly going to be lived in the metaverse it's lived on social media it's lived with a focus only on oneself it's lived with a focus on how i feel not with a a care to other people's pain or objective reality but only a care for one's own pleasure a a culture of narcissism and so it's no surprise that she says this gives me euphoria what a weird thing to say she doesn't say this makes me happy or this is a good thing to do she says it gives me euphoria it's like when people it's when people describe themselves as a bag of chemicals they say gosh i got such an adrenaline rush they don't say boy i was excited wow that thrilled me no they say i got an adrenaline rush because you're just thinking of yourself as a big bag of chemicals that just reacts to different stimuli and when the stimuli poke you and make you feel good on the inside then you want more of that that gives you euphoria and when they make you feel bad you want less of that with no care to objective reality or to discipline or to some temporary pain that might strengthen someone over time something tells me that these people who are just focused entirely on themselves and their own low base pleasures something tells me they don't have a great relationship with their parents just i'm not saying it's a hundred percent of the time but usually when you see people dancing around talking about bun bun self and all you know all sorts of mutilations on them and they're screaming and they're yelling and they're protesting outside the supreme court justices houses you look at that you say huh something tells me you don't have a great relationship with dad it's a little harsh to say but 999 times out of a thousand that is going to be the case this is why this is one this is a problem that you've got to solve first before we figure out the debt and the deficit before we figure out immigration before we figure out the tax rates and the and the way that we can fix some of the institutions and the energy policy before you can figure out higher level political issues if you've got a country where your family has completely broken down you're not going to solve any of those political problems because the family is the basic political institution daily wire just did an analysis of new census data according to this analysis there are a lot lots of parts of this country where most people do not grow up with two parents Puerto Rico just kind of America kind of kind of sort of part of America only 38 percent of Puerto Rican children live with two parents Washington DC only 48 percent of DC residents children live with two parents Mississippi Louisiana New Mexico it's a little higher it's above the 50 threshold but not much 55 percent 57 percent according to census data you you can't have a flourishing country that way that is going to create just think about it just think about something that happened in your childhood whether you grew up with two parents or one parent or no parents or however you grew up think about one thing that happened even if you grew up in the greatest household ever leave it to be her father knows best Donna Reed household did something happen in your childhood that kind of messed you up a little bit did I don't know daddy and mommy fought a little bit too much or I don't know daddy traveled too much or there was some there was some big fight that broke out or even in your extended family aunt so-and-so didn't talk to uncle what's his face and did something happen when you were a kid daddy yelled at you one time okay think about that that relatively minor experience of childhood trauma and now have it be that your parents just don't care about you and they don't care about you enough to try to to focus on your upbringing and daddy disappears for for huge stretches of time if he's there at all and or maybe mommy doesn't really care about maybe maybe mommy just leaves daddy and you know she puts the kids kind of second or third if she's thinking about them at all and you know look they're just going to focus on them they're going to live their best life okay and frankly it'll be better for the kids if mommy and daddy are happy quote unquote pursuing their own selfish desires do you can't if if one incident at the dinner table is going to kind of mess you up as a kid no matter how nice your upbringing was imagine you're living in a society where most kids don't live with both of their parents maybe they get to maybe they get to see both their parents sometime i don't maybe think about how much that's going to mess up all of those kids think about how much that's going to mess up society you know it's not not every political issue comes down to some textbook explanation when and some formal academic debate and frankly more of of what shapes our politics is that ronald reagan said politics begins around the dinner table what happens when there's no dinner table what happens when mommy and daddy just aren't home and you're sitting at home on a snack tray alone watching tv well then that dinner table that's going to be your politics and especially when the tv that's that's being pumped into you or the streaming now is promoting radical woke propaganda especially when you're the only solid relationship that the kids have is going to be with their teacher in a public school they're a great public school teachers but there's a lot of crap that goes on in the public schools too or their only relationship is with some movie star on tv or their only relationship is some parasocial relationship on social media pushing crazy woke stuff that's a major major political problem that's not enough to say you do you figure it out well i'm just going to focus on no we we need to structure our society in such a way that it's better for those kids for society as a whole if we don't do that we're just conceding the culture to the radicals we've done that for 50 years it's led us to this madness maybe it's time to try a new strategy i'm michael knolls is the michael knolls show see you tomorrow the michael knolls show is produced by ben davies executive producer jeremy boring supervising producer
