The show where we talk about the differences between us without letting them divide us. There is an unfortunate theme to today's show. It is the ways in which our public conversations and public policy affect the private lives of vulnerable people. Specifically in this case, young queer people. And that unfortunate theme means I have to give you an unfortunate message. And that message is if you are not up for hearing people talk about mental health and specifically suicide and suicidal ideation, you might want to set this one out. Take a break, come back some other time when you feel more up to it. It's a good conversation. I think you'd benefit, but you know, it's kind of heavy. One conversation heavier than the other. Our first guest is Karamo Brown, and that is the somewhat lighter one. You may know him from the new Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. He is also a former social worker and a suicide attempt survivor. We talk about why he doesn't use the term coming out and how he's used his place on Queer Eye in his mission to eradicate stigma around mental health. The second guest and somewhat heavier conversation is with Parker Malloy, a longtime friend of the pod who is back for a kind of terrible reason. She is here to discuss the recent moves by the Trump administration to define trans people out of existence. It's a heavier conversation, but so worth it. So I hope you can stick around for both. Coming right up, Karamo Brown. So I guess the first thing I want to ask you about is you came out as gay at 14, is that right? Pretty? Sure. Yeah, I know I started letting people in my life when I was 15. I don't use the term coming out. Okay, actually, okay, cool. Put a pin in that because I have a question about that too. And the reason, the only reason I ask is because you also started talking about your mental health publicly. I guess not too long after that a few years on Real World, you talked about your depression. But I'm curious about the inner realization about both those things. I feel like people realize what their sexuality is. It's just natural. They grow up with it, right? Of course. You are who you are. And I think one of the key things for us to remember, and especially the pressure that we put on young people, or people as they are just matriculating through life, is to understand you are who you are, no matter how much growth may happen throughout that journey, you are who you are. And there's that whole argument of nature versus nurture is true to some point, but you're born a certain way not to be something like Gaga, but it's the truth. And it's ironic this morning I woke up because I'm a nerd and I watch O'Donoughue, Phil Donoughue episodes and Oprah episodes. And I was watching an Oprah episode from 1998, where she had a man on that his mother raised him as a woman for the first 11 years of his life. And now he's 20 years old and he's on stage with his mom. His mom's all torn up. But what he was saying was, I'm a straight man. And it gave me a better understanding when I see trans people and people who identify as LGBTQ, because everyone told him he was a woman and he was supposed to be this way. Yet he knew who he was. And he kept saying that I knew why I was. And I didn't have the language because his mother kept him out of school. So he didn't have any training about genitalia. But it's a clear lesson of people can't change. You know, when I see little children and people debating about a child put on makeup, that child has no idea. It's the same as paint to them. It's not going to change their sexual orientation or their gender identity. Yet for some reason, we get consumed with, oh my gosh, he's not playing with a truck. He's going to be gay. Doesn't work that way. Well, I'm interested in the ways that kind of realizing what your sexuality is or who you are in that way is and isn't like realizing you're someone that you know, suffers from, I don't like the words suffers from, but someone that has depressive tendencies. Because for me, like, because I'm a straight person, I don't mean, our culture makes that kind of invisible. Like I didn't have a process by which I realized I was straight. But I do kind of remember the ways that I realized I was different from other people in terms of my mental health and how I struggled to put a name on it for a long time because it was something that we don't talk about very much. So I'm curious for you, what was that like for you to kind of realize my head, my brain, there's this way that I'm different. And then there's this other way, that I'm going through something, but not everyone goes through. So first of all, I want to say that you did have your own process, even though you identify a straight of letting people into your life. It's just that society, we put more pressure on people who identify as LGBTQ to make more of a grand announcement. And we make that announcement either something that we applaud or that we boo. And for most straight Americans, that ideal of who I am, you actually do have that own process. It's when you start coming home and you say, Mom, I have a crush on another little boy. It's just that you're not getting the same response. So in your mind, you feel like you're not having the same process. We're all going through the same thing. But to answer your second question, especially when it comes to mental health and identifying, how do I need to process that? That for me was something similar to you is that as a culture, we don't discuss mental health. And it's because people are afraid of mental health. It's scary to talk about things that are dark. It's the reason why we like the sunshine. It's the reason why we like to stay out in the daytime. It makes us feel comfortable because we can see everything. And when it comes to mental health issues, you can't see it. You know, if mental health issues cause physical gaseous on us, as a society, we would talk about our mental health more. But because none of us can actually see the brain and don't get brain x-rays enough. Is that the proper term brain x-rays? Yeah, who knows? I'm like, as it came out, I'm like, there's something there, but I'm not that smart. It's not brain x-rays. Are you talking about, are you talking about like a literal, like the MRI? Like a CAT scan. MRI CAT scan. Here we go. We're gonna go with brain x-rays though. We're gonna make that a thing. But you know, we don't get those normally. And so people can't see, you know, the dark matter in their minds that's causing them to feel depressed, feeling anxious. And I think it's important for us to have that conversation as shift. For me, it started, I would say in high school, when I was playing sports, I was physically active. And I noticed there was an obsession from my coaches for me to be physically fit, but never to be mentally fit. And the reason I was able to realize the distinction was because a lot of my teammates were going through a lot of dark times because they were worrying about college. They were worrying about pleasing their parents. They were worrying about just doing well in the game, the next game. They were worried about so many things that were causing them to act out either using drugs, alcohol, violence. And I was looking around and I was saying, something's not right here. And whatever's not right is in their minds and is in my mind. And but yet our health coach, you know, our health teacher and our coach, one in the same for me, was always saying, get to the gym and do 40 pushups. Build your body out. And for me, it was clear that we put more of a onus on physical fitness than mental fitness. And that's where I started to realize that I have to try to figure out a way to work on my mental fitness, just the same. And I think it's about breaking it down in that very clear way for people so they understand that it's okay to want to work on your mental fitness. I hate, and I hate is a strong word that I normally don't use, but I hate the fact that as a society, we'll go to work and tell people I worked out today. I lost five pounds. Oh my God, some changing my diet. We have no problem with telling people that yet we will not go into our job and say, I feel really anxious. I'm feeling depressed. I'm having you fill in the blank. And it's because again, you can't see it. If it's not a physical change, then people are afraid of it because what I can't see, I don't understand. And we have to help them to understand that though you can't see it, it's real. If you believe in Adams, believe in mental health. You know, it's funny that you frame it that way because when I was rewatching some queer episodes, you know, I was reminded that they identify you as the culture coach, right? Girl, that was my biggest bane in my existence. I can't, I just, you know where I'm going. I don't really go. I especially to be honest with you, and I usually don't lead with ego, but a part of my ego was bruised when the show came out and I would see comments from people saying, what's Karamo's job? What is he here to do? And I was hired to make over the hearts and minds of the subjects, but because the title of culture was held over from the original show, they felt very comfortable and saying like, we can't change that. People need to see these five categories. And so you'll do whatever you want in it, but we're going to call it culture, which was misleading to people. And even though culture is all about shared attitudes and attitudes and values, which are some part of emotion and the way you view life, people automatically think of museums and plays, which are my product of that. But my job is to go in and, you know, fix a certain thing. And so it bothered me. And so like, there's parts in season one and I, first of all, I've only seen season one one time because it hurts my feelings to watch. And I will, I love the show. I love the cast. I'm so thankful for the Netflix and to the producers of the show. So let me be clear. This is not like a, rr, rr, rr, I'm complaining about the fact that my dreams are coming true. Not at all. But I knew what I was there to do. And so sometimes when I'm looking and I'm building a website in season one, I'm like, I'm not helping the audience. Like I know I could help right now, but it was because I was trying to find a balance with being the culture guy, whatever that means, and also doing what I wanted to do. And it was a hard struggle for me. And my mental health was tested, because many times I felt in a dark place and I felt like I wanted to give up, because I thought, what am I here to do? Everything else, everyone else is a physical thing. You can see it. He's going to cut the hair. He's going to change the clothes. He's going to cook for you. He's going to change your house. And here I am fixing the inside. And it wasn't enough for some people. They were like, no one's going to understand what you're doing because they can't see something physical. And it goes back to exactly what I said. And luckily now that the show has been out and it's been a big success, they're like, Oh, people got it. And I'm like, I know, because people are smart. So people are smart. And now we're in shooting season three. And I can happily say, I'm not building any more websites. I'm not doing any more photo albums. What else did I do that was crazy in season one? I was like, Jesus, I don't even know. But after a while for any people who really watch the show, that's why after a while, I used to only have conversations in cars because it was my way where Oh my God. I wondered about that. Yeah. I mean, honestly, like, I was like watching it and I was like, this is something I was like trying to what can what smart questions can I ask? Yeah. And part of me was like, why are they talking in a car? Because there's no reason why this particular conversation should be in a car. It was the only place that I could have a one on one true therapy, s session without anyone being around me and forcing me to do something that they considered culture. And so it was my moment to say, because the other guys when they had their connections, they're cutting hair, they're building or whatever. So it was my way of like sort of escaping everyone else's opinions and saying, I'm going to drive. And so while I'm driving, Hey, let's have a conversation about really what's going on with you. And they didn't catch on until too late. So it was like me in cars talking, me in cars talking. Everyone didn't anyone ask you, like, why are you driving everywhere? Or did you have a good ex? Did you have like a place you would tell them you were going? No, so it was all so what happened? This is the beauty of it. I was always driving to a field trip, but the field trips always got cut because the meat of what I was doing was in the car ride. So you never even saw. So like, for instance, there was an episode with the police officer, her name is Corey. He and I have a really amazing conversation about race politics in America. We talked about the militarization of police. And I take him after that to go create a chakouta replay. Sorry. It's really cool. Yeah, it's cool. But like, why the hell am I taking him to go create a chakouta replay? But they cut it because they were like, Oh, I'm out of conversation in the car. And now it works. And that happened over and over again. So like my field trips, you wouldn't see me doing them because there was no point because I had the conversation on the car right there, which is my strategic little plan of like, Oh, I'll show you we're going to get to the mental health of this all. But in season three, we're not having those issues. And they're like, dive in, go for what you know, you're really good at it. The audience is responding at it. And we have faith in you. And I'm happy now because as we go forward, the audience knows that culture isn't really culture. It's about me fixing their mental health. I do want to kind of move backwards a little bit because I am curious about the process of kind of figuring out what's wrong with me, you know, or not necessarily maybe wrong is not the right word, you know, I mean, language is really important. And like I appreciated a man paying attention to the phrase coming out. Because I do really remember the different times in my life where I've had breakthroughs about my mental health that have usually come about in part because someone gave me the language I needed. That's right. Yeah. Like, I don't remember, I remember I was diagnosed as being depressive in college. And I was like, I mean, I knew what the word depressive was and everything. I mean, I knew what that meant. And I knew what was a thing that people had. But like, someone telling me like, that's what I was exhibiting symptoms of was kind of a revelation. You know, like, Oh, so that's what's that's that's what you to call this thing that's happening in my brain. Yeah. You know, yeah. Did you have a time like that? Oh, of course. I mean, the saying that I always tell people is you don't know to, you know, and that goes clearly for mental health. You know, that's why language is so important and why I perceive and try to teach people to think about the things they're saying. You know, one thing that I say intentionally always is how I grow through life. And by me saying grow through life means that I have an opportunity to continue to change and flourish. And then where I am right now does not define me because I might be a little stub right now, but I may grow into the biggest tree ever. And that's going to be part of my journey. And that goes with coming out. You know, I understood working with LGBT youth when I worked in social services that they were putting undue pressure on themselves because they felt that they had to come out to every single person of in their life. They had to make this grand gesture. And that is unfair to them. And it doesn't help their mental health. It doesn't help their growth. And so by saying to them, you, it's your opportunity to let people in who you trust and you love means that I don't have to make this something bigger than what I wanted to make it. And that's true for all of us. We all have parts of our identity and parts of our who we are that we let certain people into. I mean, we can go as something as ratchet as you know, like sometimes I like to turn up. Does my pastor and his wife know I like to turn up? No. Does that mean I'm ashamed of turning up? No, it just means I'm not letting them into that part of my life with the same thing of I'm a very sexual being. Do I have just open open conversations with my sons about my sexual experiences? No, because they don't need to know that they're my kids. So am I ashamed of me being a sexual being? No, it's about me saying the boundary I'm sitting for myself is to let this let you into this part of my life. And it takes the pressure off of me and allows me to know who I am is okay. And you know, even the way you corrected yourself at the beginning of this is saying, what's wrong with me? That's something that hurts my heart when I say here, people say that there's nothing wrong with any of us. Each phase we are in in our life, every place we are with our mental health, with our physical health, that's a phase that we can grow to the next phase. It's an opportunity for us to learn, to be, to understand who we are. And there's nothing wrong with you. I try to tell people when I speak around at colleges and corporations around the country is that you're perfectly designed. And I try to chant that mantra for people so they understand that by being perfectly designed, that means that who you are right now, there's nothing wrong with it. Does it mean that your design might not change in a way that you want it to? Of course it can. But who you are right now is fine. And that's okay. And if you ask for help knowing that you're perfectly designed, it gives you an opportunity to grow at a pace that works for you. You are perfectly designed as such a lovely way of describing, you know, people. Um, I agree. Thank you. It reminds me that I would love to talk to you about faith. Um, when's the last time you prayed? Right before I walked into this interview. I was like, okay, and I gotta tell you this, prayer for me, um, is something is also about setting intentions. My prayer to the God, I believe is setting intention for my life. And I think that sometimes people who are atheists, like my son identifies as an atheist, and I love him and accept him for who he is. But it's when we get around the table, I say prayers and I say to him, set an intention for what you want. And it's the same thing. Um, mind is rooted in a belief of something bigger and his is rooted in a belief in himself. And both are rooted in love and truth and everything that's good in this world. And so I always pray or set clear intentions for what I hope before I walk into a room. So today, as I walked in here, I said, dear God, I pray or my intention is that I say something that will at least help someone to grow and to feel better about themselves and to know they're not alone, allow my voice to be used so that someone knows that they can make it too. That's clearly just an intention I'm setting. And when I'm at the dinner table, my son says, you know what, Jason, your intention after you walk up from this dinner table is to finish your homework and to do the best and be the best you can and inspire some of the other kids in your school to know they can do it too. Nothing is different. And that's why it always boggles me when people feel as if faith and an intention to be a good person are somehow different. They're rooted in the same. I actually prayed before we talked to. Oh, I guess we're on point then. We're on point. Yeah, my prayer before interviews is that I hear people as they wish to be heard. Hey, oh, that's beautiful. Yes, empathetic listening. Can we get some time for that? Yes. So I hope you feel like I heard you as you wish to be heard. I did. Thank you so much. Oh my gosh. Can I use it on Queer Eye? Sure. Go ahead. Yeah, I will quote you. I will quote you. I wouldn't tell you. Yeah. Point people to the pod. But yeah, I will. I will. 100% I will. All right. Go say hi to Ira for me. This was great. I do. I would love to talk to you. You know, I think we can go deeper and longer as it were. Oops. It's some other time. Okay. I hope so. Again, say hi to Ira. Thank you so much for this.

He hosts up front on Al Jazeera and is a columnist for the Intercept and in his new podcast, Deconstructed. Mitty unpacks a game-changing news event of the week while challenging the conventional wisdom in a tight 30-minute package a little quicker than what we do here. He starts his show with his take on one topic and what the mainstream news is getting wrong or what context is being missed. And then he goes into a deep analysis in conversation with his guest or guests of the week and get this. His guests have included Judd Apatow, Bernie Sanders and Hassan Minhaj. So he kind of covers the gamut, I would say, in terms of who you might be expecting. It's everyone from comedians to politicians to, for instance, Stefan Clark's fiance. So you're going to hear from a lot of different people. And the show has covered such topics as the violence in Gaza. From the perspective of Israeli activists against the occupation. And of course, police shootings as through the eyes of the fiance of Stefan Clark. Also, he's talked about the dangers of John Bolton with former diplomats. As a Brit and a Muslim and immigrant based in Donald Trump's Washington DC, Mitty Hassan gives a refreshingly provocative perspective on the ups and downs of American and global politics. Deconstructed the show that cuts through political drivel and media misinformation to give you a straight take on one big news story of the week. It is out every Friday, just like this pod. You can listen and subscribe at the intercept.com slash deconstructed or on any podcast platform. And now Parker. Parker Malloy is an editor at large media matters for America. She is hilarious on Twitter. She has a wicked sense of humor, but is also one of the kindest people I know. And as I said in the intro, she's here to talk about the Trump administration's moves to erase trans people. When she and I talked, we'd only heard about one such move, which was the redefining of gender and sex by the Health and Human Services Administration. And we go into some detail about that. Since we spoke, there has been another action from the Trump administration against trans people. And that is on behalf of the Department of Justice, who has told the Supreme Court that they do not believe that existing civil rights laws protect against trans bias. There is a specific court case at stake here, one that may still be heard in front of the Supreme Court. And the ACLU has said it will step in if that case does in fact move to Supreme Court, but make no mistake. This administration has declared war on trans people. And it's a war they think they can win, in part because so few of us think about trans people as part of the fabric of our country. We don't know any trans people or more accurately we think we don't know any trans people. But trans people, whether they are out or not, will be injured in this war. Some of them by direct action of the government and many more will be injured by the pervasive message the government sends. You don't matter. I am honored and privileged to have had Parker on to talk about what that feels like. Parker Maloy. Parker. Hi. Hey, how's it going? Well, it's pretty shitty. How about you? I, you know, I mean, grading on the like Trump relativity scale. You know, it's a normal, it's a normal day, normal week, TJF. Right. In other words, pretty shitty, I'm guessing. Like, and if we're, if we're judging, you know, by any, actually, I think even for Trump terms, it hasn't been a good week. You know, I mean, as, as we're recording this, the news is all about bombs being sent all over the country. So now that I think about it, it's actually been a terrible week. Yeah. So I hope that you're, you're practicing some good self care because we're going to have to talk about the terribleness. All right. Let's dive in. Let's do it. So it started, started on the first day of the week on Sunday. People listening to this show are probably aware of the Trump administration trans memo. But just in case they haven't, or they need to be updated because a lot of news has happened since then. It still being only midway through the week for you and me. Do you want to kind of just give an overview of what that was and what it meant? Sure. So, so yeah, so Sunday morning, the New York Times came out with this article that basically said it said something to the effect of Trump wants to, or Trump administration may define transgender out of existence, which is, which is a scary thing as a transgender person to wake up to. You know, it's like, check the phone and see that like, oh, cool, I may not have legal recognition soon. So I dove into the article to see exactly what that meant, thinking that maybe it was being hyperbolic, but it really wasn't. So, so basically what the, the whole thing is about is since taking off as the Trump administration has been taking kind of chipping away at trans rights, as well as, well, various rights, you know, for all sorts of people, but especially trans people, he seems to like really kind of go to that whenever he needs to toss some, some red meat to his base. So, so they pulled back on the, the trans student guidance in February 2017 at right after he took office. They made the argument in court that they don't believe trans people are necessarily covered under existing non-discrimination laws at a federal level. You know, he obviously tried to ban trans people from the military. So he's been doing all these things. And they've all kind of sucked a lot. But on Sunday, it was the worst of them all in the scariest. So on Sunday, the New York Times reports out this piece that says that the Trump administration is considering creating a federal definition of, you know, a sort of federal definition of gender and sex to apply across agencies, which would, you know, affect how it's interpreted under, you know, the Civil Rights Act and other, other non-discrimination protections at a federal level. And essentially, what it would do is it would, it would say that it is totally legal to discriminate against someone on the basis of their gender identity, because, while sex is a protected class, gender identity is not. And the Trump administration's definition is that people are whatever their original birth certificate says, you know, unless they can prove that the birth certificate was wrong through genetic testing. So in other words, trans people will forever be the gender that they were marked on their birth certificate, no matter what they do. No matter what I do, in this definition, I will always be labeled a man, which is not good for a number of reasons. And it's more than just like, you know, oh, that would hurt my feelings. Yeah. Because as I mentioned, it strips away legal protections, you know, it strips away who you are. It would make it legal to basically discriminate against trans people in health care, because this is coming through HHS, but it may go across agencies, but it could be health care, employment, housing, public accommodations, just because we're not a protected class, you know, otherwise, under this sort of plan. So this was really scary news. And what else does this mean? We still don't know exactly what's going to happen with it. But the end goal for this, the reason that it's coming out of HHS, a lot of people seem to think is that one controversial aspect of the Affordable Care Act was this thing called Section 1557, which is the non-discrimination section. And it says, you know, can't discriminate on the basis of sex. And the Obama administration interpreted that to mean can't discriminate against anyone, you know, can't discriminate against trans people. So all plans that were receiving federal funds had to cover, you know, transition-related expenses, which was really cool. And they couldn't deny us care, which was very cool. But with the Trump administration coming in, they quickly stopped defending that, because it was constantly being fought in court. So they stopped defending it. And this is them coming out with a new rule to replace what the Obama administration put in. So that's where this all kind of comes together. But basically, the end result is that it will be legal to discriminate against trans people in health care right now. But it could soon cross agencies. And if it makes it to, let's say, the state department, which controls passports, it could essentially void my passport. It doesn't just make it okay to discriminate based on gender identity. It says gender identity doesn't exist. Right. All the conservative articles have been revealed. They've really been celebrated. They've been doing a touchdown dance ever since. Yeah. And this is just, I don't know if I could understand it, you know? Like, I don't know if it's possible for someone whose identity is pretty well recognized. To even get to a place where what does it feel like to be told? Yeah. You don't exist. It's very lonely and alienating, honestly. I've heard it from so many trans people who since Sunday have sent me messages saying that they are scared. They don't know what's going to happen. And they see these fights coming up around the world. Over in the UK, they just had a big public fight over trans rights that's been going on in the press for a while. But things just seem very unsure. And even in Canada, there's pushback on some of their advances. So it's starting to get to the point where sometimes I look at this and I'm just like, is the world going to be okay for people like me to exist in it? Are trans people going to be allowed to exist peacefully? Because I don't, when I think about, so this is something that I think a lot about. One thing that a lot of people who are anti-trans will say to trans people is, no matter what you do, no matter how many hormones you take, no matter how much surgery you go through, you will never be what you want to be. And the reason that hurts so much is because it's 100% true. It's so true, at least to me, because that is something that eats away at me. I sit around and I think, why am I not? Why am I like this? I hate being like this. I wish I wasn't trans. It's something that I think about constantly. And I don't want to be a trans woman. I don't want to have to think about that. I just want to be a woman. Or, hey, if I was just a cisgender dude, I would be fine with that too. I just want to be like this. So, I do what I can to feel as comfortable as I can. But knowing that I'll never quite be happy, which is kind of a, it's very bittersweet because it's like progress, but I'm still not as real as I think I am. Or as I know myself to be, if that makes any sense. It does make sense. And honestly, Parker, it's heartbreaking. It sucks. And I think about that so much. One of the things that, especially lately, especially the past few months is, so before I came out as trans, one of the things that I kind of, there were three options. There were three options. There was coming out as trans. And entering this super scary world where people would gawk at me. And all the rest. And which is basically what I ended up doing. And it was scary and terrible and horrible and everything like that. But the other options weren't really any better. The other options were just try to ride this out as long as I can. Just being a dude, just trying to be a dude or act like a dude. But I was so hollow on the inside that it just kind of sucked. And it kind of hit me with this thought that was just like, you know, it's not like once I get to the end of life, it's like, I don't just get to be like, okay, cool. Now I get to do this over. It's like, do I really want to live out 60 years like that? And I had a tough enough time getting through 26. So that was the other option. And then the third option was killing myself. I mean, which I get that it's a tough topic. But I had to suicide attempts before that. And I was very, very, very seriously thinking about a third. But kind of found myself at this point where really what it came down to was I was too scared. So I went with somehow the decision to be publicly seen as a trans person, to be gawked at, to have comments made to, you know, to just be to be treated horribly at the job I was at to see my hopes of a promotion, just evaporate. All of that was the less scary option. So I did it. And the past few months I've been thinking, I don't know if I made the right choice. Because there are very good things. There are very, very good things in my life. There's Kayla, there is meatball, there is Snickers, there is Jeffrey the Bunny. You know, like these things are great. I really love my new job. You know, I'm lucky because I make a living by writing, which is something I love to do. You know, I get to stay at home. I don't have to put pants on the work if I don't want to. So it's like, I'm lucky in all of these ways that are very, very cool. But still, in the back of my mind, I wonder, did I make the right choice? You know, back in 2012, you know, it's not a choice of whether I was trans or not, but whether I would, you know, which, which path I would, I would kind of go down. You know, would I, would I hide the secrets my whole life, you know, be someone I wasn't, or would I be someone that I'm closer to, but not quite, you know, like, like I said, I'll never be, I'll never be the person I want to be, but I can try to get as close as possible. Today's show is sponsored by TalkSpace, the online therapy company that lets you message a licensed therapist from anywhere at any time. All you need is a computer with internet connection or the TalkSpace mobile app. That means you can improve your mental health, even if you had trouble making time for it in the past. I am fortunate enough, I don't use TalkSpace that often, because I have a good, like, you know, therapist that I see all the time, but it is an excellent thing for those times when you are hit, you know, with the case of the shoulds and the case of the night thoughts. I get those sometimes still that thing that happens when you can't sleep when you think of all the mistakes you've ever made in your life. So it's good for that. And also I have friends who've used it as a kind of stepping stone to get to maybe more intensive therapy as a way of just kind of reaching out for that very first time and getting someone to metaphorically hold their hand. I have some friends who actually just use it as their regular therapist as well, but it's a great service. And if you are someone that is hesitant to get a therapist or you just can't imagine fitting it into your life, I would suggest trying TalkSpace. It really is as easy as sending a text message. You can get something off your chest whenever you need to. You can talk about everyday challenges at work or at home. You can just chat about life. There are no commutes, no leaving the office and no judgment. Remember that therapy isn't just about venting your innermost thoughts. It is some about that, and that's great. It also isn't just about digging into childhood memories. It's also about practical everyday strategies for stress management and living a happier life. Having a therapist simply provides you a designated person for you to talk to who is trained to listen and to help you make positive changes. The TalkSpace platform has over 2,000 licensed therapists who are experiencing addressing the life challenges we all face.

The ZipperKruder script starts with the question, you know what's not smart? Honestly, I sat here for a minute and tried to think of stuff that wasn't necessarily political or timely to say what's not smart. I was going to say, you know what's not smart is voting in a Congress that won't hold Trump accountable. You know what's not smart, not voting for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable. Who knows when you're going to listen to this? I want to keep it timely. You know what's really not smart is leaving your husband and puppy at home and not being very clear about what kinds of things the puppy can eat. That is not smart and I discovered that over the weekend and I won't get into any more detail. ZipperKruder once you know what's not smart is to be overwhelmed with wrong resumes.

I want to point out a couple of things though. One, in case people don't know, the suicide attempt rate among trans people is astronomical. I think because of the pressures that you're talking about, right? No option feels like the right option. No option feels like a safe option or a satisfying option. 29% of transgender female teens say they've attempted suicide and among non-binary youth in general, it's 40% that have attempted suicide. And like I said, I'm not going to challenge you on this interior journey and the feeling of never quite being what you really want to be. But I do want to point out that this is where the personal and political meet, right? Because you are now hearing from the government, they are underscoring that terrible, what I would say is like a terrible voice in your head. Yeah, well, exactly. They are legitimizing the voice that tells you that you will never be a woman. Right. Yeah. And the other thing that it's doing, that message from the government, and we haven't brought it up yet, you alluded to it, but I just want to make it very clear, is it sending the message to people who are bigots that you are not a woman. Yeah. And that you are okay to discriminate against at the very least. But perhaps even coming by one line that was in the New York Times piece that's really kind of stuck with me, which it wasn't a quote from the Trump administration, but it was just, it was written into it by the New York Times journalist was something like, wrongly extended civil rights to people who should not have them or something along those lines, which thinking about that, that's just, that's scary, you know, where it's just like, imagine thinking like, no, that person wrongly has rights, because that's all that trans people want. We just want, we want equal rights. These are not special rights. These are not extra rights. These are the same rights that are written into law for so many other groups. And some are equally as vague, because one thing that comes up a lot in this discussion is, well, being trans is, you know, just sort of how you, if it's how you identify, or we have to just go with your word on it, then how do we defend that? I mean, it's the same way that you defend religion, because that's not something you can really quantify any other way. It's you take people at their word that something is a strongly held belief, but we still protect, you know, anti religious discrimination. So, you know, there are ways to have protected classes that are not cut and dry. But I just, you know, also know that, you know, my life will get a lot harder, you know, if this goes through. And one thing that, that hurts, you know, that's like, it's like an extra twist of the knife is so you see these stories. And then you see how, how democratic politicians and, you know, will just kind of be silent. And how people will say, see, all the left does is focus on identity politics. This is just identity politics. And there's no good, there's no good, no good response here. Because really, if, if, if, if, if, if, I got one to stand up for themselves, oh, you're playing identity politics, if we don't, we lose it right. It's I got one, I got a response, which is that we don't say that at least people who are Democrats don't say that about race anymore, right? Like, we don't say, if someone made a, let's just say a bathroom bill about different races using the same bathrooms. Oh, yeah, people would object to that. Yeah. Well, you know, but we see this, this sort of thing play it play out in other ways. There's, there's a, there was a story, I think last week about a, I think it was an adoption agency. Yeah, I can't remember the state, but basically they, they wanted a, they wanted the Trump administration to give them a waiver that would allow them to only, you know, adopt children into Christian families and turn away a Jewish family. And people were like, this is outrageous. How could this happen? This is un-American. It's like, but, you know, states and the, you know, the, the, the federal government, you know, has, has been, you know, have been pushing for, for similar type things, but to deny people on the basis of, you know, are you straight or are you gay? You know, we, these discriminate, discrimination is discrimination. And that's, it's, it's so weird that we're, we're still in this place where people have to say discrimination is bad. And the people on the other side, what they do is they, they try to frame it as this isn't discrimination. Yeah, they try to say there's no such. That almost makes it worse. They, they say, okay, so when people, one side are saying discrimination is bad and the people on the other side are like, well, why are you bringing that up? It's not even, when there's not even, they're not even bringing up in the first place. They're not even arguing the point about these bathroom bills in, you know, into state houses. It's not, you know, there's, there's not some giant trans lobby, you know, that's super well funded. There was a Breitbart article recently I was reading that said the increasingly powerful trans lobby and I'm like, dude, are you kidding? But, you know, there were not the ones doing this. We're just trying to exist. It's that these, these groups, which is something that in a recent story I wrote about at media matters, you know, these, these groups, after they marriage equality ruling, you know, the groups that were fighting back against that, they kind of re pooled their resources and they decided to instead of fighting against marriage so much, they would take their fight to, you know, against trans people because they have to keep that culture war going because identity politics are important to, you know, to, to that side of things, you know, the, the very conservative side of things, you know, as much as they, as much as they say they're not. And they actually tend to vote more along identity lines than people who identify as progressive or democratic in the sense that their identities determine their politics. If you're a white, cis Christian, straight man, especially like your politics are probably determined by that. Oh, yeah. Pretty clearly. You know, and this is, it's another thing I touch on in that, that piece that I wrote where, you know, you have, you know, the reason that one of the reasons that this maybe doesn't seem is obviously identity, politic, or whatever. When you're talking about conservatives is that they are a much more uniform group, you know, there's less, there's less diversity in there, you know, it's, uh, people, progressives tend to have to work as these coalitions, you know, people of color teaming up with LGBT people teaming up with, you know, women fighting for reproductive rights and, you know, stuff like that, you know, it's all coalitions, but on, on the conservative side of things, it's, it's a lot of, you know, there's still some, you know, various kind of groups broken out, but demographically, they're very similar, um, or tend to be. So that's maybe it doesn't seem like identity politics when more or less everyone that you're, you're trying to convince it falls into those identities. And what I was going to say to be clear is that when I say that being, you know, white, straight, male, Christian, um, culture, Christian culturally, at least, it's not that your, your politics are just determined in a, in a very definite and hard way that by those things, it's that it is so much easier to predict someone's politics. Oh, yeah, based on those things. And, and this is maybe just a, a slightly different way of putting the point you were, you were just making, um, when the term identity politics gets thrown around by conservatives or liberals for that matter in a critical way in a negative way, they seem to forget that white, straight, Christian, cis, male is an identity, you know, like they only name, it's only identity politics. If it's someone who's not white who's not so straight, you know, they, they, otherwise they're pretty, pretty much cool with it. They're just like, yeah, no, we should be able to do this. You know, but if when we, when people wrote, take any of the, any of the discrimination cases, you know, that come up and flip them around and think about, you know, a, uh, a trans baker who turns away a gay couple or something like that, people would be like, oh, you know, and if, and if like, you know, the, the left rally behind the trans baker trying to, you know, turn away, you know, Christian couples or something like that, you would, you would hear a ton of stories that were just like, look at these identity politics, otherwise it seems to kind of be like, no, that's just America. The other thing I wanted to say just before I forget, um, because this is, again, lots to talk about in a way and there's, there's so many ramifications here is that Parker, I, I don't want you to ever forget that by making the choice that you made to be an out trans woman, you know, that is powerful beyond who you are. And it's, I know that that can feel, it can feel lonely, but I know that you are making a difference. I know it. And, and that's, you know, that, that's something that over the past few years, you know, I was a, kind of a bit of a hell raiser on, um, on the Twitter's in, in 2014 or so. I remember, you know, and, and have, you know, attendancies, I sometimes still do that, but I try not to. I try, I try, I really try because, you know, I have, I had some situations where I would just like really just, you know, just, just blow up friendships and, you know, really just screw up and I was horrible and awful. And, uh, you know, a bit in the ass, you know, I lost a really steady freelance gig back in 2014, um, because of some like dumb internet fight. And so now, you know, especially since the 2016 election, really, I've been really trying to be like, okay, if I'm gonna be here, I need to, I need to be a net positive on the world. That is, that's the one thing that's important to me because if not, what's, what's, you know, it kind of comes back to that. What's the point kind of question? But, you know, obviously there, there are all sorts of other arguments to be like, no, no, no, this is important, but, well, I think that I don't want to, I don't want to make anyone else's life harder because I know how hard it can be, you know, like I know how hard just dealing with myself as a being in my own head can be, you know, and I know that there are people with, with, you know, really serious issues, you know, whether it's financial or the relationships or anything else, you know, it's like we were all dealing with something and it's, yeah, why, why make something harder for anyone else? And of course, I applaud your growth in, in that area, in part because I'm someone that you have blown up at. But, I actually want to make a point here. No, no, no, let me make this point, which is that you are valuable to the world, not just because you're on Twitter and how you behave on Twitter. Like, I want you to understand that. And also, to the extent that that matters, being someone who makes mistakes in public and then keeps growing is pretty fucking valuable. Yeah, I, I try to, you know, the, the TLDR to, to life, at least as, as I follow it, is to try to be a little less shitty than I was the day before. You know, it's like, if I can keep doing that, that's, that's a really easy, attainable goal. It doesn't have to be a lot less shitty, just a little less. No, like, like shave a little shave a tiny bit of shit off. And, you know, that's, that's progress. I don't, I don't think Jesus said something exactly like that, but, but it seems close. It seems, it seems like this is, this is bumper sticker worthy. Yeah. Um, so we, we have to wrap up, but, um, I want to thank you for being on the show. And I, I just really need you to hear how valuable you are to the conversation that not just we just had, but, you know, to the public conversation and, and how, like, hmm. Like, I don't know what the etiquette is around telling some, a trans person, you know, what I think about who they are, but parker, like you are who you are to me, you know, like your parker. And if I, that's all you need to be. I really needed to hear that, you know, it's, it's because it has been, it's, it's been a really, really terrible week. And like, I, I really appreciate that. And it's almost awkward having this discussion on a podcast, but thank you for that. Thanks so much. And that is it for the show. Thank you for making it to the end of that one. And if you're here, you are probably thinking about parker and people like Parker. So I want to remind you about the existence of the Trevor Project. The Trevor Project is a suicide prevention service aimed at lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and other queer young people. If you are a queer young person and you are thinking about suicide, feel free to call them. The number is 866-488-7386. And if you are someone that knows a queer young person, you might want to have that number on hand as well. And especially if you are someone that knows a queer young person or if you just care about queer young people, consider donating to the Trevor Project. It's an awesome organization and they're very needed right now. Until next week, please take care of yourselves and take care of each other."
