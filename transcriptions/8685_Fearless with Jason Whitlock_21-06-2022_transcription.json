The day before a hump day, it is Tuesday. And I'm so glad you've made the right decision to join me and us on this journey for maybe about an hour today. I've got a great fire starter, great show planned for us today. Royce White and Shamika Michelle will be here as well as the Korean Co-Sell. Steve Kim will wrap up the show with Steve Kim discussing. Steph Curry's place in the NBA Pantheon. Is he one of the 10 greatest players of all time? The Warriors had their victory, their championship parade yesterday. And so we thought it would be appropriate to discuss Steph's legacy now that he's got four NBA championship rings. I'll do that with Steve Kim toward the end of the show. But before that, I got a discussion. I want to unpack with Royce White and Shamika Michelle about... I got a lot that I want to talk about a marriage that has transpired between black voters and the Democratic Party. And so let me start this fire and then we'll invite Royce into fame the flames he'll be followed by Shamika Michelle. Then we'll, you know, you guys can hop in the comments and give your thoughts, particularly if you're watching on youtube.com slash Jason Whitlock. Make sure you're in the comments, leaving the comments. Make sure you're hitting the likes and the subscription button. Make sure you're out recruiting for this fearless army. I'll be there live in the chat discussing with you as well. I'm sure Shamika will be there as well. So let's get this party started and then, you know, we'll have a little after party where we talk amongst ourselves. The political left has been planning the wedding of black people to the LGBTQ movement since the days of Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. They are at Rustin. A gay man helped organize Dr. King's March on Washington. Huey Newton, the national leader of the Black Panther Party, argued as early as 1970 for an alliance between black people and gays. In the last two decades, American academia exaggerated and elevated the profoundness of the writing of James Baldwin, a gay novelist in the 1950s. During his second term as president, Barack Obama gave black voters permission to drop the religious pretense, come out of the closet as bi-political and be supportive of same-sex marriage. At the clothes of Obama's presidency, black people were officially engaged to the LGBTQ plus movement. Post Obama, three black lesbians, the founders of Black Lives Matter, married black people to the LGBTQ community, forming the BLM LGBTQ plus Alphabet Mafia. Now gay is the new black. For the mascots, the internationally recognized symbol for the gay movement and all forms of biblical sexual immorality. Yesterday, my fearless colleague Delano Squires texted me an internet billboard promoting a drag queen story hour as an event celebrating Juneteenth, the newly federalized national holiday celebrating the end of slavery. The poster references Juneteenth and of course includes a reference to Black Lives Matter. Is there any other racial ethnic group as closely aligned to the gay and trans community as black Americans? What does Juneteenth have to do with drag queens? Nothing. The underlying message is black people are connected to drag queens and gender dysphoria. Their mascots for the Alphabet Mafia. This is the deal black political elites have cut. New York mayor Eric Adams symbolizes the bargain that has been made. Since last Wednesday, Adams has been tweeting up a storm about Juneteenth, LGBTQ issues and drag queens. As of early this morning, 17 of Adams' last 30 tweets related to Alphabet Mafia issues. So let's understand this. The mayor of America's largest city is obsessed with race and sexuality. Adams is the second black mayor in the history of New York. He's a former 20-year New York police officer. He grew up going to church. He previously supported Louis Farrakhan's vision of black male masculinity and self-responsibility. New York has a multitude of high-profile issues including a rise in crime. But somehow 11 tweets about Juneteenth and 6 about sex and or drag queens. Eric Adams' priorities are not in proper alignment. Neither are his values. Eric Adams, like most black political elites, is a dragged king. His allegiance to leftist ideology has dragged him away from his values. Here's the tweet that kind of got me started. I think this was on Wednesday when he tweeted this out. Drag storytellers and the libraries and schools that support them are advancing a love of diversity, personal expression, and literacy that is core to what our city embraces. That was kind of at the beginning of his tweet storm about LGBTQ drags and Juneteenth. Black people are locked in an unholy political marriage. We swore matrimonial vows to a movement that directly contradicts biblical values. You guys remember you've been to a wedding to have, to hold from this day forward for better, for worse, for richer, for poor, in sickness and in health until death do us part? Well let's go look at the scorecard. In general, we're financially broke, mentally and medically sick and dying in the womb at the hospital and in our communities. The marriage to progressive ideology and secular values is killing us. We've had to abandon everything we say we believe to remain loyal to a political ideology that has not improved our condition. The political left defined who we are and what we believe. The regime now requires us to serve as the mascots for gays, trans and drag queens. I'm not homophobic, but I'll never support men dressed as women reading books to school children. That's grueling. I'll never support biological men competing in sports against biological women. It's not fair to women or girls. I'll never support surgeries or puberty blockers that stop young girls and boys from developing naturally. That's abuse. I'll never support same-sex marriage. It's inconsistent with what's taught in the Bible no different from how my previous promiscuity made me an inappropriate candidate for marriage. I'm a Christian. I'm not going to abandon what I believe and join a movement that violates my beliefs because a narrative has been spun that puts us in direct opposition. A narrative has been spun that opposition to leftist values is anti-black. I'm not wearing the clown suit the left has stitched for black people. It's a wedding dress. I don't wear dresses. Eric Adams does. That's my fire. I just want to add a little gas to the fire before I bring Royce into the conversation. I made these generalizations about black people. We're broke financially, medically. We're medically sick. We're dying in the womb. We're dying in hospitals. And we're dying in our communities. That's a generalization. There's a bunch of black elites that will go on MSNBC and CNN. Oh, don't you, General? And they're speaking for elites because they're disconnected from working-class black people. They're disconnected from working-class people in general. I'm not. I'm not speaking for elites. And yes, all the elites, many of them, and again, I say this with no negativity. Anybody that knows me knows I got no problem with interracial dating. None. But many of these elites that are on TV, black elites, they're married to white people. And they're out living a completely different life than the stuff they're talking about on TV. Completely different from Katanji Brown, what I can't remember her last name, the Supreme Court Justice and her white husband, Kamala Harris, who's 25% black and her white husband. Colin Kaepernick, who's half black, half white. We don't, again, half white and half something else we don't know about. Arab, black, whatever. And his white Egyptian girlfriend, they're all talking about something that they're divorced from. And I'm not saying all of them, they've all been bought and paid for and don't understand the reality that they're selling you and working-class people down the drain, down the toilet into a life that will never be prosperous by attaching you to this progressive leftist ideology that does not serve you and does not improve your life. And then they'll demonize someone like me who has stayed true to his Christian values, that get framed as conservative, but they're just Christian values. I've tried to stay true to them. Again, am I a center? Hell yes. Hell yes. And I don't say that bragging. I'm just saying that in being honest because I don't want anybody that knows me in a real way to be like, hold on, man. I used to hit the club with Whitlock. I know his ex-girlfriends. I've been to Vegas with Whitlock. Again, I'm a center, but I held on to my values even while doing a lot of debauchery stuff. But as I applied my Christian values to my life approach, and it's helped me to attain some level of success and certainly self-sufficiency, self-responsibility, and the ability to help myself and others and my family. And all I'm trying to do is turn back around and tell people, this is what I did, this is what you need to do, adopt these values, fall in line with the values consistent with American culture and tradition, and you too can make it in this world. There are values taught through Christ, through Christianity that render racism powerless. It will make people that may not like you, like you, and at least respect you and be willing to work with you and be willing to promote you, employ you, loan you money, invite you over to their house, live next door to you. But if you want to adopt all these progressive values and all of this immorality that goes along with progressivism, there will be people, black and white, who won't want to employ you, who won't want to promote you, who won't want to live next door to you, who won't invite you to their house because they don't want to be involved with that BS, they don't want to be involved with that lifestyle that leads to poor conclusion. I used to get mad because, look, I'd holler at anybody back in the day in my more secular life, I guess, or more sinful life, I would holler at anybody. But if a woman took it, I don't do fat dudes. I wouldn't get offended, she got a right to be like, I don't know, I don't do fat dudes. She has a right to say that and to have those preferences and taste, just like people have a right to say, hey man, if you're going to bring that garbage lifestyle and mentality to my neighborhood, I don't want you in my neighborhood, I don't want baby drama mama or baby mama drama in my neighborhood, I don't want my neighborhood filled up with single mamas with kids that aren't properly supervised. That's not racism, that's a preference. All right, before I go any further, I think I'm going to bring in Royce White and let him add to the conversation. Royce, welcome back to the show. The little poster that I showed set me off yesterday when Delano sent it to me. And I'm just like, how did we as black people become the face of the LGBTQ movement? How did that happen? Can you help me understand? Absolutely. I think black people are lost in the wilderness politically in this country. And it basically stems from the greatest lie we've been told and bought that our freedom, our civil rights, our prosperity here in America, our American citizenship for lack of a better term is inextricably linked to an ever expansion of government that without government, without a benevolent government, without benevolent politicians, corporations, institutions, so on and so forth, we could never hope to have access or achieve the American dream. And that is really what what seeded the territory and carved the path for all these other faux ideologies to, you know, blind us to what the fundamentals of American is. And we have a terrible sense of what the core American values are and how they work to our advantage. We've been the victim of an infowar in that way. And your American citizenship at bottom fundamentally suggests that nobody is charged or mandated with the security of your freedom or your American rights. You as an individual are charged with your own security and freedom. And because of our history, we were kind of phased from not having access or equal access to American rights in the beginning. And we skipped the stage, you could say, of understanding American rights in the traditional sense and were brought into a phase where we are permanent wards of the state. And although the left likes to pretend like they revere people such as James Baldwin, who would, you know, traditionally be seen as on the left of the spectrum, he cautioned against black people being seen or looked at as permanent wards of the state. And 60 years later, that's exactly what we've become. And it was a pretext for the state to make everyone a permanent ward of the state. We are now expanding the black welfare state to the broader racial spectrum of people in the working class. So Royce, you said something, everything you said, I really loved it and enjoyed it. But you said something that I slightly disagree and I want you to clarify. We skipped basically the understanding of American values. I'm not so sure. Did we not abandon our understanding? Because I think previous generations knew exactly what America, and fought, when I think of black people fighting to participate in World War I and World War II, that's like them saying, no, no, we want to fully ante up and guarantee our American citizens. But we want to be sure to be sure to have a leadership by ante up and sacrificing our lives for calls that we believe benefit America, no different than the Union soldiers did during the Civil War. And so, and again, I think of the Civil Rights movement as basically Martin Luther King and those guys arguing in that time, like, no, we want full American citizenship, we want the right to be a man and to provide for our families. We want to be full of America. Yeah, no the the Participation or the desire to have participation in the armed services in the 30s and 40s in the World War one in World War two may have been an example of a spark of nationalism or national honor national pride in the black community You could say you could also say the same thing around the Civil War times when we were Conscripted to help the Union fight in that war that but but also our circumstances in both situations Economically politically were so dire that we were kind of In a no-choice position to participate in both of those conflicts The Civil Rights Act was a complete scam The Civil Rights Act was the ushering in of us becoming permanent wards of the state and that in no way was an example of us embracing an American a traditional American core values Understanding because the core values understanding would have went more along the lines of a Malcolm X who at the time wanted a separation Between blacks and whites, but but the idea that Malcolm was Prescribing was that if we're not going to get equal rights Underneath our government underneath our government or institutions We as black communities need to secure our own our own rights and it starts with two things sacred honor and faith and The sacred honor are the values and the ethics and the morals that you live by and are also willing to die for that's the ballot or the bullet That's the by any means necessary. That's the You know bear arms rifle clubs matched with not to be divorced from a faith in a higher power higher ethic God which which really is fundamental but but securing your own freedom was a Malcolm X approach Martin Luther King No disrespect to him. He was a profound man Wanted the government to secure his freedom and as as that happened the government and the institutions tied to the government Which make up the corporatocracy? hijacked the civil rights fight hijacked civil rights and merge civil rights with government with government expansion and now you have Nike the NBA Google Walmart all synced up into a global corporation of which they're going to send Ideology down from the top all the way to the community And it's not an American ideology and it's not an American ideology it's a globalist ideology and so You stand by that we've never had not individuals but just in general we've never had a full understanding of our American values and what it truly means to be an American and how to succeed Absolutely not not only have we not had that the deep state the secret this the security state actually made a concerted effort to kill Silence or other all of the black leaders who had the opportunity to introduce us into that more traditional American view now again every individual has the the The opportunity you could say through their own journey path in their mind to find these ideas and the core values and the and the value in the ideas for Themselves but what Christianity solved and this touches on the abortion issue a bit But I want to use it to show something The real gift that we were given from God is historicity to have history to have to be able to keep accounting accord and That allows us to perfect ourselves over time Which is why the Constitution is great because it allows an amendment of itself for a better version in the future Which they want to get rid of because they don't like history they like a relative history that they can change whenever they want But what the Abrahamic faith did Christianity Judaism the the combination of the tooth it introduced Turn from a barbaric culture Abraham goes up into the hills into the mountain and he comes back and he was gonna sacrifice his son and God tells him We're not doing that anymore There's no longer child sacrifice because when you when you when you practice child sacrifice You lose a sanctity of life and you have barbarism and I say that only to frame how history allows us Collectively to become better it introduces us to ideas This was Aquinas in the Catholic Church that the logos is not only the Holy Spirit But the Holy Spirit combined with man's thought and understanding perfected into Christian path in the physical realm And in Augustine spoke on that as well So not only did we never have a time where we fully understood and embraced American values or core American ideology But it was actually subverted in black communities intentionally by the security state at times So I'm gonna hammer this or ask this one more time because I'm sitting here You've given me as you always do a lot to think about in real time Frederick Douglass Booker T. Washington these guys were both seen as the leaders of the black community during their time You don't think at and again as the leaders they didn't have an understanding and didn't promote Black Americans to fully embrace American citizenship and the values that lead to success in America Frederick Douglass absolutely and there have been a few black leaders throughout history who understood it My point is that there's been a concerted effort by the institutions that preside over us to keep that understanding From the broad spectrum of American city a black American citizens That's the most the thing that the establishment the globalist establishment fears the most maybe in the entire world of Politics is for a strong contingent of black people to embrace and understand their American citizenship And then be willing to fight die vote and purchase according to it and and and that so you know Fred Frederick Douglass is is only tacitly revered as a hero in any depiction of Political framework in race. I mean, yes his images there But they they they hijack his story and they make it seem like it's some leftist progressivist You know Iconology and it's really not he was as American as it gets and he was Christian You could tell by the way that he spoke and the things that he said but they never acknowledged that and so Exposed fact or you can tell how they they disregard the true American black leaders like Frederick Douglass in the current But even back then they were pretty quiet. I would say on on on just how profound Frederick Douglass was and and the meaning and intention of his words We've been infiltrated right we've been infiltrated by communists since The late 1800s you could say I mean so you know that this thing is a this thing is a hundred and ten hundred and fifty year war That's taking place with with the security state global global governance and many other institutions So and again, I'm just cuz I find this fascinating Booker T. Washington. I'm a huge fan I love the whole cast down your bucket. I thought he got it understood it I felt like my father's life was patterned after and I'm not even sure if my father understood the Booker influence on him But again the whole mentality of like hey, man, you can complain about this that another but you're better off doing For yourself and building something for yourself right now where you stand cast down that bucket and That's the actual path to the American dream. That's what he founded schools Businesses and all of that and he to me they use W. E. B. De Bois and Others to discredit him and like totally High schools all around the country and black communities were named after Booker T. Washington and now They've kind of they've disgraced his name or portrayed him as a guy that you know made peace with racist white people And and basically all he did was tell black people man quit worrying about them and do for yourself and trust me It's all gonna work out It's the same exact thing that Malcolm tried to preach He said why are we still talking about what white liberals or the or the government white white politicians will or won't give us When we're still stabbing each other in Harlem and so the greater issue with black America is as a byproduct of being lost in the wilderness Politically that that loss of national identity We were we are forced to fall back on our spiritual identity and that's been attacked as well And that's where this LGBTQ agenda really comes To foster and foaming chaos in a very sinister way and it you know We as black men we understand and we can feel that the overt symbolism that's trying to Feminize black men, but it's really attack on black women This whole LGBTQ movement is an attack on black women through Demasculation what what they're trying to do is they're trying to leave black women and all women This and this is the entire feminist movement has a unique effect in the black community for the black woman But they're trying to leave black women isolated and psychological chaos That's what this whole deal was about because nation building the the mechanism of nation building is central to a nation's survival to a nation's strength and if you can Misappropriate gender if you can disincentivize childbearing or childbirth You have fundamentally attacked a nation at its most At its most Bottom root and and and also psychologically I mean women are in a psychological crisis There is a full-blown crisis of femininity as a byproduct of not understanding that America is not some borderless nation Where anybody can come and go? We're not the protectorate around the world We are a nation with sovereign borders and sovereign borders place physical constraints on man's lack of wisdom and his his lustful ambitions and keeps us anchored In a way that's meaningful and when you lose that you have chaos So what is your reaction to my contention that and I don't even it's not even a contention my statements about From MLK to Huey Newton to Barack Obama. There's always been this LGBTQ connection and What what's your understanding of that history and do you think I almost think it's like it's a requirement of the left If you want acceptance in the left as a black man You have to jump on board with the whole LGBTQ mission and statement I think you're a hundred percent spot on that the LGBTQ Movement has always been laying in the shadows and now it's it's completely out of the shadows And its intentions are you know the intention is to use black people as a stopgap All of these black folks believe that all of these organizations that want to pair up with our history and our fight for civil rights Have some deep affection and love or sympathy for black people, but that's not the case The true mechanism is we're going to ride black people into a new age of society Where there is no more race and in it you'll actually lose your own history again because History being relative is a key component for tyranny to run amok and the LGBTQ right now is is is is is Activating one of the biggest cultural political coups in human history And and the coup is there is no more black. We're all just omnissexual Right and and if we if we proliferate a sexual culture enough Then then it broadens the tent to where everybody either identifies as omnissexual or they're sympathetic with the omnissexual Identity because of familiarity with somebody in their immediate community family friends College room at whatever the case may be so it's it's just a way to expand identity as a stopgap to expand governance You've made an argument that I've made the last few weeks that the great replacement actually is the LGBTQ that That is going to the black voting base will no longer be important the LGBTQ voting base Which is rapidly growing we've seen Bill Maher talk about what now 20% of these kids are Generation Z you're saying they're gender fluid or trans or by anything other than heterosexual and and I see it like as a strategy of the left that Because just what you said like let's say you're not LGBTQ But your child is That's going to make you sympathetic to the LGBTQ movement and think you need to hop on board with that political movement For your child's salvation Absolutely and the real question is how can we have a real headcount of who's LGBTQ and who's not at this point? But not only is the identity blown out to a place that makes it hard to comprehend or pin down what any of this really means the other clear signal in the noise is that our Education system all the way down to the elementary level and parents alike are so indoctrinated with this LGBTQ movement that they're pushing LGBTQ Ism on young people so you know getting a headcount is almost impossible And this is the point and so you know I talked about like you're saying the replacement theory and the people who Real have real historical basis for some grievance and should had that national honor and sacred honor lose it in this and this chaos The other the other problem with this whole deal is it's a it's a diversion. It's a distraction from real politic Right, so you have a constant wave of LGBTQ Political emphasis meanwhile you as a black person you never ask Why are we sending a hundred and sixty billion dollars to the Ukraine or what happened to the six trillion dollars that went to Afghanistan of which a portion was for us to try and push LGBTQ left politics on the abgani people and the abgani people Rejected it because they don't play that and that's part of the reason why they kicked us out and when we finally made our exit We thought that the abgani military was gonna hold the line for our leftist views here in America and The Kurds and everybody in the Taliban just overran them because they didn't believe in it They actually believed in a more traditional faith-based Muslim culture than Afghanistan So again, you know all of the black were lost in the wilderness There are real political decisions that are being made right now here in this country in this next 12 months and this next 24 Months and this next 36 months that will shape the outcome or the the survival fate of this nation And and and the fate of this nation for the people who we voted for as black Americans have no interest in our survival as black people the Outcome of homosexual Intercourse is not to have another black life born and it's it's not ironic It's not a coincidence that that political worldview is on the side with the same worldview that is ready to riot To retain the right to kill majority black babies I mean these are these are the Distractions and diversions and infowars that will be the end of of black people in this country if we don't wake up and get wise Your thoughts on eric Adams and what his political future is this guy has his Sellouts in a quanton Quintessential sellout. I can't stand them. I don't know why the people of New York What I do know because New York City has become this affluent yuppy white liberal place where all of these political misinformation And and infowars are deeply rooted because and here's the thing And I talked about the afghainy culture and I think this ties to this Faith based culture puts the contemplative at the center of your life. Okay? This radical materialist culture puts you in a rat a Rabbit Consumer mentality and it makes it necessary for you to get your politics in worldview with french fries You have to get it on the go and there's no symbol of that greater than New York City New York City is a is a is a ongoing rat race to try and climb that radical materialist ladder and in that of course You're gonna pick up the New York Times Which is a complete Marxist newspaper and read whatever it is They tell you if they tell you that white supremacy is on the move and Steve Bannon is the is the progenitor and Royce White is the new darling and and and Adams is is your savior? You almost have no choice to believe that unless you have a contemplative faith based lifestyle And they've eradicated from that because you can't survive in New York City Barely with a face faith based lifestyle and that is the real sin of modern capitalism And and it has allowed for black sellouts black boujois Elite sellouts to to walk around with black skin and pretend like they protect the interests of black people while they sell us out at every turn The thing I don't like about him is that I think he's perfectly Intentionally packaged a's his former cop He's masculine. He he's like a symbol to other a dog whistle to other black men to like hey look Eric Adams has jumped on board with the whole LGBT movement It's safe for you to do it as well. It's a thing to do. Look. He's the mayor of New York. I think The Democratic Party has plans for him to go beyond New York City Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, you know people who are great at manipulation and infowards are gonna continue to mold and craft the False idols and props that they put in front of us to appease our Desire to appease our want for for familiarity for trust This is American. This is where our understanding of Americanism has gone astray, right? In in in our in our our conditioning to have this radical materialism we've given away our security we've given away our freedom for security and materialism is what I meant to say and You know part of it is we want to believe that the people who are in charge know what they're doing and have our best interest So we can continue to jerk off That we become a jerk off society. We become a jerk off culture and in jerky I mean, that's we want to believe that Eric Adams that that Barack Obama that Bill Gates that dr Fauci that the World Health Organization the World Economic Forum the World Bank the list goes on We want to believe these people are competent, but never lent empathetic and and and good Yeah, and experts so that we can continue to jerk off with with with without fear And that's a faithless mentality and you know My problem with Adams and my problem with all of these black booze Wars these sellouts is that they understand fully There are some black people out there like like people in my family who are just working class blue collar people that watch CNN and don't really know any better These people these few selected individuals They've been briefed they know what the endgame is and they've taken a pay cut or payout in order to push this agenda And anytime you take a bag of money and it comes with the unspoken agreement that you don't tell the people the truth You are a sellout Royce I'm not gonna call it your best work because I don't want to disrespect what you've done previously, but this was great work Fantastic loved it.

That's how you can be a good fearless soldier Support organizations like preborn that are out doing the work that needs to be done to save babies lives All right, Shamika Michelle. We're gonna continue our conversation about dragged kings and Eric Adams All right, welcome back Time for some more shimok shimok show Shamika Let's roll out to North Carolina and bring in Shamika Michelle Shamika I argued in my Firestarter my mono that three black lesbians started black lives matter and they married the black community and black voters to the LGBTQ movement What say you about Black Lives Matter marrying us to the LGBTQ movement I I agree with you Jason, but I feel like they did it long before like you were talking about with Huey pea Newton and we think about Jesse Jackson and the rainbow coalition. I think it's been done for a long time There's nothing new under the Sun, but what bothers me and what kind of stuck out to me in your column? Were the words dragged king? It actually took my breath away and brought me to tears literally Because I just begin to I mean to drag means to pull someone along forcefully and I thought about how we complain, but I have to ask men When are you gonna stand up? When are you gonna be what the Bible said and that's the head and not the tail? You know, of course our history is deeper and greater than slavery But when I think about black men in America, I have to think about them being dragged by by slavery and that system dragged by the Government in the Jim Crow era and now dragged by women Royce talked about how feminism has had an effect on especially the black community and black men that dragged king for me just really hit home and I Have to ask the women a question as well. Where are you? Where are you? Because of course, I'm not saying that black men are Incompetent and they need a savior. They've already they have a savior I'm not saying that they are helpless because their help comets from the Lord But the Lord put something in place which was women to help when God looked at Adam He looked at him and said it's not good that man should be alone He could have given him a dog because he's omniscient and he's all knowing He knew that one day they would say a dog is a man's best friend But he didn't he could have given him a child because he's God and he could have done it in any order that he wanted to do He could have even given him another Adam and through a wig on him threw up his hands and said my work here It's done, but he did and he gave him a woman to help So I have to ask women. Where are you? With all of these drag Kings are we helping or are we hindering? What are we doing from the whole house to the White House? Are we in position or are we out of order and my answer? I think is that we are all out of order Let me Come at what you just said a slightly different way and because I think we're in agreement But like to me what I see from women and in this case I'm talking specifically Black women, but it's like the incentives that a woman offers a man are out of line and because again because There's something about a man that are most men that that special place between a women's thighs is his greatest incentive or you know it competes with nearly God and everything else and and and It's like the incentives to get to that place now are Basically to fall in line with the matriarchy Let the woman dominate let the woman be the leader Feminize yourself and we will give you access to that very special place And that's where the incentives are wrong and it's like a masculine man a man that wants to be a leader He's not getting those incentives and to the point again Because I just sit here and then I just ask us Black men and just black people in general and again, it's not to denigrate or But but just to ask like are we in line just biblically? Well what we say we believe that three lesbian women could start a movement and We all hopped or all the strong word but many of us hopped on board with black lives matter They didn't lie about who they were and what they were committed to lesbian train Marxists that they they Acknowledged all this and we just hopped on board. I mean we just hot and so Clearly the incentives they're offering men Forbid them from getting to that special place that men like to get to and so but and I'm looking at us as men We hopped on board with that. What here's three women is saying nine nine nine. I you have no access To whatever it is you're looking for for me And we're starting an organization But we think so little of you and you're so stupid and shallow You'll you'll hop on board with the movement. We're starting that is actually dragging you Away from all of your beliefs and values It that's where I Question like hey, what is it we're doing and and do we fully understand and and almost to the point where? You know I come off as sexist But but again, I'm just there's just no part of me that's going to bow to the matriarchy and And to and again it's not that I have a problem I've I've had female bosses who have helped me and have been assets or whatever But in terms of my core values and allowing them to shape them No dice. I'm gonna go to the Bible and I'm gonna go to some religious elders and elders By the nature of the Bible have to be meant that's gonna be my path moving forward Anyway, I don't even know if I have a question. I'll just let you respond to that. I Don't think you're sexist at all Jason. I think you're absolutely right You better not bow because to to obey is better than sacrifice So you better obey God because we have seen the fruit of what happens when we don't and you're absolutely right that me and our Bowing I saw a post from a woman she put a picture up of her daughter in a pink tutu and the father was holding the daughter in a pink tutu and She said, you know, it's a great feeling to see my daughter fall in love with the man that I fell in love with This man is in a pink tutu, but this woman is praising him because to her this is like love This is what should happen. Your man is bending over We talk about Bookbreaking you've heard that term for for years, but you're actually Assisting in breaking this man who was supposed to be your protector who was supposed to be the head who was supposed to be the leader of your family Who was supposed to be the provider you're aiding and assisting him in being Feminine and he feminized in front of the world It's it's it's it's era it's wrong and we see what has happened when men have bowed down to women and it's time again When are you gonna get tired of being dragged? It's it's you have to stand up and put your feet flat footed and say no more because It's obvious that women are not going to take their rightful place until men take their rightful place And you have to just say it might be good But you're not good for me if you're not doing what you're supposed to be according to the to the Bible You're not being to me who you're supposed to be. That's not the right woman for you If she's not the eve to your Adam you need to turn around and run So Jason I totally agree with you do not bow so The the latter part of our column motto gets into how Okay, we're being dragged away from our Biblical worldview we're being dragged away from our religious beliefs that this marriage to the alphabet mafia separates black people from religious beliefs and and that It's so obvious to me that That it has done that this merit with the LGBTQ and the political left that you have to abandon all your religious beliefs But we do it under the pretense of well the other political side doesn't like us and and I Don't think that they don't like us Because of our skin color I Believe that the other side doesn't like us for the same reasons I'm objecting to it's like this culture that you have adopted. I don't want I don't blame people that say hey Look, I don't want to live in a neighborhood where all the kids are unsupervised Because the single mama ain't got or the grandmama that's raising them ain't got control I don't want to live in a neighborhood where everybody's playing music that So that celebrates the n-word celebrates drug use celebrates crazy Irrational sex celebrates violence and drug-beeling Again, and I know music is rebellious and there are rock and roll songs and celebrates sex and all that other stuff But let's don't lie to ourselves ain't nothing more debauchers than hip-hop and Nothing is more denigrating than hip-hop and so I don't blame people for saying you know some of this stuff is so over-the-top Say tannic, I don't want to be involved with it and and the whole abortion issue and things like that It's like their values and the values that we have chosen to adopt in order to remain loyal to the left Makes people be like I don't want to be bothered And I'm one of those people Jason I don't have an allegiance to my skin color where I'll actually put myself in an uncomfortable position or live a certain way Because somebody is the same color as I am the people that are my mother my sister my brother are those that actually Follow Christ and live a certain way So it doesn't bother me to actually be you know called a bigot or whatever Because I don't want to associate with those type of people and yes Black people have walked away from their religious values Regardless of what it is whether it's Christianity whether it's Islam They have walked away from their religious values to to you know cater to the left or to to be a part of the left And the scripture says that you're drawn away by your own lust so you have to then ask yourself What's your lust is it materialism is it power is it you know wanting to be light by people instead of pleasing God What is the lust that is driving you know pulling you away from God because it's nobody has a gun to your head You're drawn away by your own lust So so what is that and I think people need to sit and figure that out if the if the LG and that's all I'm Acknowledging is pulling you away. You're drawn away by that lust you really better check yourself Shameka thank you so much great job as always. I'm gonna keep it moving Take care of a little business here.

We're gonna talk a little Steph Curry Eric's I Let's lighten things up talk a little sports with my favorite Sports broadcast to the Korean co-sell Steve Kim Steve the Golden State Warriors had their championship parade yesterday gives us an excuse to put a bow on the NBA season The the Warriors closed out the Celtics in six games last week now everybody has been talking about Steph Curry's legacy now that he has four NBA titles two MVP awards and now he's the MVP of the NBA finals and there's a whole debate is Steph Curry now a top 10 NBA player of all time Doesn't crack my top 10 But wanted to have a little talk with you about it Let's first unveil my top 10 players of all time Most of us pretty obvious Michael Jordan cream up dual Jibar number two. I got magic three Larry Bird for Bill Russell five LeBron James six and I know there's a lot of LeBron lovers out there that mad at me I'm gonna brine that'd be number two because he's number six Will Chamberlain number seven Number eight Moses Malone probably my most controversial pick for the top 10 Number nine Tim Duncan and number 10 Kobe Bryant Steph Curry does not make my top 10 as of right now What say you I? Don't necessarily disagree, but there's a caveat to this this thing is very fluid as it relates to Steph Curry He might have another championship run or three left in them I've got to give the Golden State Warriors that organization a lot of credit They have seamlessly added components and complementary parts that have really aided this dynastic run if you want to call it that and I thought Andrew Wiggins while not the MVP was certainly I think the second biggest story Of this title run because as clay Thompson kept missing one open jumper after another. It's obviously he's not himself Andrew Wiggins gave him that ability to play above the rim and at least finish and take it hard to the hole and play Above the rim, but with that said Steph Curry In my personal list is just outside, but he's knocking at the door very very hard and let's go back one week To Friday a couple Fridays ago. It looked to me that in game four Boston was gonna really lay the dagger down They were up by about five points at halftime It should have been more but you just got the sense that the Celtics were the younger stronger fresher more athletic team and Golden State just didn't have enough athletes on the perimeter They couldn't finish at the hole and Steph Curry in that second half I think he quieted all the slander in my view That's a shining moment in the way the west of the series played out even though he was very bad in game five I don't think there's any denying Steph Curry is certainly an all-time great All right, so let's see your top 10. I think it's very similar to mine Not particularly the first six or seven of your choices you go Jordan Kareem Matt you put Bill Russell ahead of Larry Bird. You got LeBron James at number six Well at seven Then you got Hakim Elizewon basically in my Moses Malone slot then Tim Duncan Kobe so not not a lot of disagreement there But then we went to our second ten and there's a lot of disagreement here With our but but hold on before I get to our second ten Steph Curry not in either one of our top ten Do you think and again based off your comments because I tend to agree with you they can get another championship? Or two or maybe even three can you see Steph Curry's legacy and reputation and accomplishments surpassing LeBron James's I You know what I don't think he has the overall floor game That's the thing I mean size matters in basketball and LeBron James His ability to make other people better not saying that stuff can't But I'm just telling you for a better part of a dozen years LeBron James was the best basketball player on earth I'm not gonna hold his political or social statements against him. He's been absolutely brilliant I mean think about it every organization that he's been to Since 2009 has won an NBA title now those come at a cost But with that being said I don't want to be prisoner of the moment think about this If you had to start a team as a GM and the rule was and you get these guys for seven years at their peak value at their absolute Best who would you take LeBron or Steph? We have to be we have to be honest with this. I think most of us at least I would would take Braun So Basically what you're saying is Steph Curry can go no higher than number seven on your all-time list because he's got to stay below LeBron James That that's he can his ceiling is seven. Mmm. Well now wait a minute. Wait, what if he wins two or three titles now Now I want to have the ability like I said this is very fluid I'll say one thing the one guy he could surpass just by having a much better descent in his career is Kobe Bryant I had Kobe at 10 step at 11 Kobe Bryant's last three years were an absolute dumpster fire I mean he basically shot a good batting average I mean literally he shot in the 30% the Lakers had their worst run as a franchise ever during the last several years of Kobe being Bryant We have to be honest about this and nobody wanted to play for that organization and be a part of that mess We have to be honest about that I know I'm gonna upset the cult of Kobe But Steph Curry if he just has let's say 80% of the statistics he's had for the last seven eight years He absolutely has to be considered among the Mount Rushmore of guards All right, I want to start with your second ten You've already said who number 11 is Steph Curry because I found it I found it fascinating And I just want to add I want to Were you high on crack cocaine when you did this second ten? Oh my god now you're calling me puking Moses Melo isn't one of your top 20 players of all time, you know, okay I love Moses fo fo fo but at the end of his career is like Barry bonds. He was on a team every year I don't think his career ended up that great. I'm gonna say this. I deserve 50 lashes for not including Jerry West and Carl Malone I will throw myself under the bus on that. I wasn't high. I was just drowsy. I'm on Pacific time I just came back from a trip Give me a break But the one guy that's really shaky on anyone's list is Durant and it's going back to Korea real fast How bad does Kd look? Let's go back to three years when Kd left I think they lost to the Toronto Raptors everyone was injured and everyone said oh my god now Kd is gonna be the number one He's gonna lead Brooklyn to great things and it's over for Golden State. Well fast forward to 2022 Kevin Durant's probably on multiple burner accounts sticking up for himself But right now in that divorce, it is Steph Curry that really upgraded here Okay, so you were driving while doing your top 20 and that's your excuse for not there I was drowsy Had me wake me up early Yeah, I could your second 20 was like holy cow or your second 10 Steph Curry Oscar Robinson shack Julius Irvine Isaiah Thomas Charles Barkley is on this list ahead of Carl Malone and Mosemann. I love Charles Barkley But come on man. Mosemann was a three-time MVP All right, all right, let me just stick up for Sir Charles people forget how good he was this guy's a six form undersized power forward who was every year in his prime among the leaders in Rebounding not only that he's one of the few guys that could get the ball amongst the big man rebound on the defensive side of the floor Take the ball up by himself and take an end-to-end like Bobby or and throw it down and then later in his career Extending his game where he could actually shoot three pointers Let's not confusing for the Malaysia Philadelphia the last couple years where he was disinterested He had a great run with Phoenix and if it wasn't for a couple of key shots here and there They could have beat the Bulls. He's one of the most extraordinary basketball specimens that ever existed again a six four Power four that did the things he did. I actually think he's underrated Steve if we were putting together a list of NBA players you would want to go watch Barkley would probably make my top 10 if not top seven But again, and I love Charles Barkley. I could try I consider Charles a friend but Moses Malone's a three-time MVP. He won an NBA title Carl Malone MVP Appeared in two NBA finals second all-time leading scorer. I think right after curating Does he still have second after LeBron? I don't think it's past him yet. And so I mean We're gonna drug test you if you come out with another list anything like this again Here's my second 10. I got Shaq then Steph Curry Hakeem Elizawan Oscar Robinson Julie serving Carl Malone Jerry West Isaiah Thomas Kevin Durant and then Elgin Baylor and I agree with you Kevin Durant I don't know how good I feel about because I think this last Warriors title kind of exposes him a bit and and Just I don't know it takes a little shine off his two titles He would have been better off just staying in Golden State and collecting championships and Yeah, and Jason the other guy Jason the other guy that was really difficult for me to leave off because I have an immense amount of respect for him His career fell apart late with some foot injuries But when they talk about all-time power for everyone talks about the mailman and obviously Tim Duncan made it Kevin Garnett But the most fundamentally sound postgame at its peak it was not the text book Kevin McHale And I will say this as a Laker fan that grew up living and dying with that series It was not Larry Bird who was the toughest matchup for the Lakers Before they got Michael Thompson at the All-Star break in 87 We had to always line up Kurt Rambus against him. It was simply did not have the length McHale at his peak I think is as dominant in the post and he had a myriad of moves the drop step the up and under the fade away He had every single move and he can do it an incredibly high level. That's another guy that was a really really tough omission for me Mmm. All right. Let's go to our approval rating on Steph Curry Mmm And thank you for the update LeBron is number two in all times going he surpassed Carl Malone But let's go we're talking approval rating for Steph Curry job performance I'm not gonna go perfect here. Although he was close to perfection. How can you do any better than finals MVP? But I'm gonna go 24. I'm gonna just mark him down a point because you know What in the great in game five and Andrew Wiggins looked like he was headed to Finals MVP for a minute there. So I give him a 24-inch job performance You know what I mentioned game five. It's probably the worst game. I've ever seen him play because it wasn't even just the fact that he was missing Shot it's also the shot selection. Sometimes there's a heat check where you give a guy a license. That was not the game But with that said hey look Tony Gwen went 0 for 4 one time or twice it happens I'm gonna give him a 25 that guy put up a brilliant series against a really tough defensive squad in the Boston Celtics Character I'm going to give him a 19 You know he's out there in the Bay Area. So he's a look he plays a little bit woke likes to play that game You know I can't I also marked him down a little a point slightly on character This will be a very unfair reason but I did because his parents got divorced And and so I think Steph should have done more to keep that marriage together. I'd love the Sonya and Dale marriage And so I'm punishing Steph for them getting divorced. So I gave him a 19 in character Okay, first off a little unfair, but basically the rebounds of both parents have been very interesting by the way But I give him a 20. I like Dale's rebound. I got a lot of people are trying to knock her Yeah, he really does like There's no doubt about it. Look here's the thing The fact that Steph has been able to be the nucleus along with Clay But he's really the number one guy and then was so gracious and Seamlessly putting in Kevin Durant and letting him have like the one a spot and he be one B I thought said a lot and I don't think he's gotten all that political I mean, it's almost impossible out there in the Bay Area. I want to give him a 20 Mmm So authenticity I'll give him a 20 here I think he's as authentic as you can possibly be while working in the Bay Area and Working that close to Silicon Valley But just based on location and geography. I gotta go. I can't give him a perfect score So I'll give him a 20. He's about as authentic as you can be in the Bay There is always seem to be very sincere. I don't think they've ever gotten caught up in a lot of bad situations He's been a great face for the franchise hard to knock them. I could probably go higher on this But yes, I like you Jason. I also gave him a 2-0 You Know what Steve I've noticed a pattern with you all your score is every timer in fives They're all divisible by five. You're not a very good master. You don't want to test yourself Mathematically, no, I don't I am like I said I'm the anti Asian stereotype I'm a good driver bad at math and I'm also over six feet tall. I'm breaking all the rules here with locks what I do What I do what I do all right it factor He Would probably crack my top 10 players of that I would want to pay money to go see Play he's definitely got it. He's undersized. I can remember I was at those NCAA tournament games where he made a name for himself When he was a star at Davidson. He's had it for a long time. So I gave me 24 In it factor. Well, of course, I'm gonna go into visible Increments of five it's perfect to me 25 He's the most influential player style wise of anyone I've seen in the past 15 years think about it There used to be a time on a three-on-one break everything was a transition You're gonna finish at the hole because of Steph Curry and again not everyone should do this now you see on transitions People fanning out to the three-point line And honestly there are certain coaches and systems that say hey look if you have a Steph Curry take a three-pointer We'd rather have that than a dunk Steph Curry has changed the way games are now played with the drive-in dish Everything's a perimeter thing if you have an open 30 footer and you're good enough to shoot it Which not everyone is it's a better shot than something that's in the paint according to the analytics that's been the Influence and the impact of Steph Curry that he has actually changed the game and with that of course I give him a 25 All right, so Very easy to do the math on yours you gave my name always blazing hot I've got even 87 a smoke show Not quite blazing hot Steve good job. Thank you. We'll see you later this week. I hear tomorrow Means we'll see you tomorrow We are I"
