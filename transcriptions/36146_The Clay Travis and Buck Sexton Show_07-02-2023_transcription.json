    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucks, Xt and show podcast. Welcome in Tuesday edition clay travel Wednesday edition Tuesday. I don't even know what day it is. This is a rough, this is a rough start buck. It's Super Bowl week. I know I'm traveling out. Basically, right as this show ends, I'll head out to Phoenix. And I've already got so many things that I've got planned out. I already have forgotten what day of the week it is. So it is Tuesday. I hope I didn't panic anybody else out there. Almost almost the flawless opening by remembering what day it was. It is also state of the Union Day, which is going to see Joe Biden head up to Capitol Hill. And I'm curious whether we'll see. Remember last year, state of the Union, if I remember correctly, ended with Joe Biden saying go get him, which everybody was like, what exactly was going on there? And we think and we think it may have been a message to Biden's handlers to go get him up on the day, as they are speaking. But instead he read it thinking it was a part of his overall speech. So so many different moving parts here, but, buck, I wanted to hit you with this, which just came down from CBS. CBS, not exactly renowned for being biased in favor of, of anyone out there, who is a Republican, ask George W. Bush about that. But they asked several questions that to me make it really hard for Joe Biden to argue anything other than the state of our union is not very strong. But I'm going to hit you with these. This is as devastating of a numbers as I can remember seeing for a sitting president. Are your own our Biden's policies? This is the question from CBS. Are Biden's policies making your own family's finances better or worse, better 18% worse, 49%. Making political division. Remember Joe Biden ran on, I'll get everybody back together again. I'm going to be normal. I'm going to end this divisive era that we live in. Are Joe Biden's policies making political division better or worse, better 19% worse, 50%. And this one, and I'm going to build on this one a little bit more, but because I know you'll love it given your focus on the border, making a legal immigration better or worse, better 21% worse, 51%. And let me build on this immigration for you, Buck. They then broke it down by everybody's parties out there. Do you think the Biden administration should be tougher or easier on immigrants trying to cross at the border? Tougher, 54%, easier, 20% Buck. Democrats by 10 points think that Biden should be tougher at the border. Not surprisingly, the GOP 83 to 11 says tougher. Independent voters, 53 to 23 tougher. White 61 19, black 40 to 21, Hispanic 44 to 25. As bad as Joe Biden's policies are, he has managed to unite the entire country in believing that he is awful on many things, but that the worst single thing that Joe Biden is doing in his presidency right now is handling the border. I just thought even from CBS, these were pretty staggering numbers that came out today. And here we are watching as the preparations for the state of the union addressed tonight, Clay, for this regime includes re erecting the big black fence around the grounds of the Capitol. Do you see this? They're actually doing it this morning. Yeah, they're they're setting up the anti riot fencing around the Capitol because of the insurrection. They're they're really doing this. And and as much as people of reasonable minds and emotional stability can see this and understand the pathetic theatrics that that it is comprised of. I think unfortunately, you know, we look at all this data. We look at how people feel about the economy and then we see them preparing for the siege of what's going on at the Capitol state of the unit address tonight, which is going to be boring. You and I will watch it. I do not recommend that everybody else. I'll tell everybody, don't waste your time watching the state of the union address. Clay and I will watch it and we will tell you whatever is interesting about it tomorrow. It is not worth your I was going to say, watch football instead. But I guess there's only one game left in football because I know about that one. Yeah, Super Bowl is coming. You know who's playing? Do you remember the Kansas City Chiefs? And another very good team. I've actually impressed you got one of the two, the Eagles, thank you fly Eagle fly fans out there, my beloved Eagles, the majestic bird, of course. So here we are, they're watching all this unfold with the Biden administration. And it feels a bit like there must be either some plan or some reality that we're not necessarily taking note of because all these polls indicate a regime that is floundering. But we did not see a Democrat party that got its butt kicked like all the polls were showing in the midterm election. And so I'm also now I'm very I'm more skeptical of polls now than honestly, I have ever been. I was skeptical after what happened in 2016, obviously, but that was a happy skepticism. Like, yeah, look at them. They were wrong this time around. It proved that people can get it wrong and the pollsters will get it wrong in both directions. That was one of the lessons learned. And it just feels to me like for all of the idiocy and the incompetence of the Biden administration and the hysteria they surround themselves with while they're I mean, they're erecting anti riot fencing around the Capitol, you know, get a grip lives with any riots after the last election just calm down. But, you know, they're nefarious and they're ruthless and they're organized and they move as a collective. And so I just don't want us to underestimate them because yeah, Biden sucks at the job. Biden could very easily get reelected president of the United States of this country unless we make the case and have an agenda and do everything right. You know, I just that's where my head is with all this, right? Like, yeah, he's terrible. Yeah, the polls show it. Does that mean he's going to lose? Does that mean that they'll actually have to seed power to the other side? I just I feel like we need to be very sanguine about it. I feel like we have to make sure that we look at it for what it is not for what we wish it would be based upon the truth of the economy and the truth of the book. How much worse could the border be clay? Could it be worse? Honestly, no, I don't think it could be worse. And I mean, that's really this is effectively the start of Joe Biden's reelection campaign, the state of the union, right? Because he's going to make his case for 2023. There are already reports that he's going to call, for instance, for a billionaire's tax, there will be several things that he puts in the state of the union that he knows have absolutely no chance of passing because he wants that to be the message coming out for 2023 as we roll into 2024. And so I don't think there's any doubt at all barring a major health related setback that Democrats are all in on Joe Biden. And I think we talked about this, son, but I'm surprised it hasn't gotten more attention. The fact that they remade the order of the primary season for 2024. So that South Carolina is first, which is Joe Biden's most reliable of all the locations. Remember, he did awful in Iowa. He did awful in New Hampshire. And so they've recast the DNC has the overall primaries for the Democrats to basically ensure that even if Joe Biden were to get a challenger, he would be able to snuff out that challenger very quickly. Now, maybe somebody still is going to run against him. I saw where Marianne Williamson, you remember her, the, uh, the sort of new AG, uh, guru for lack of a better way to describe her. She ran, uh, a couple of years ago, and it sounds like she may run again. We've talked about the idea of Eric Adams, but a lot of the legitimate big time contenders have dropped out of this race. And so, uh, it now looks like they basically cleared the decks for Joe Biden and barring a major health issue, Joe Biden is going to be the nominee in 2024. And so this is his beginning stage to make the case that he is the best to take us into the next four years. And cause I think effectively, if Buck, you agree with this by and large, we're in a gridlock to era that chances of anything substantial coming out in 23 or 24 very low. Yeah. I think that that's where we are. You know, we're, we're in a political trench warfare and we're trying to fight over a hundred yards of territory, but unlike in trench warfare, whoever gets that hundred yards of territory gets to actually call the shots for four years, right? So it matters a whole lot, but the margins are very small. The we're on a razor's edge for what will determine the political and with it, the rest of the future of this country. I think that's very meaningful for us all to understand. So I'm hopeful that that the right will not only be effective in producing. I mean, what is our health care program? I mean, these are things. Do you hear anyone even talking about that right now, Clay? I mean, I can't remember the last time I heard a politician on the right, any Republican, any concern of anybody speak meaningfully about health care in all the polling. That's one of the biggest concerns for people. Look, I'm glad that Kevin McCarthy is saying social security and Medicare cuts are off the table right now because anything other than that is just electoral suicide, right? I mean, if you want to if you want to lose, start saying, well, let's, let's just, you know, deal with Medicare right now. That's a terrible idea, but we are entering a presidential election cycle. I know it seems crazy because we just had our midterm election, but we had said this all long. And I just think that we need to see not only a program that is make, well, rather that is putting America first for the Republican party that is conducive and is compelling, compelling rather to people in the middle, but also that we understand where the Democrats were able to with a weak economy and with a a stumbling, bumbling buffoon as the president to avoid a midterm wipeout. I mean, you know, we have to be very steel AIed about that as we look at all the polls and everything else. Because I think you do you agree with this? I think we're going into a kind of a meh economy right now. I don't I don't see it. Who who knows, right? I mean, if you want predictions that are wrong to look back at most major economists, I think it's probably going to be kind of okay. Yeah. But if it's just okay, then it turns into what is that last one or two percent decide when they're in the election site? What does that last one or two percent of the electorate think about when they're actually pulling the lever? Yeah. And I think you're right. I think it's going to be blah. But you know, Joe Biden's going to go out and say, well, we've got 14 million new jobs or whatever the heck it is. Again, new jobs being defined mostly as people who already had the jobs that they weren't allowed to have because blue states were shut down. And so look, to me, the Democrat line is set. There's not going to be a lot of drama barring a health scare, in my opinion, from Joe Biden. They're going to run him. I think it's crazy, but they're going to run him the best option. All of the drama is going to come in the next year out of the Republican side of the equation because I believe whoever Republicans pick will beat Joe Biden. I really do in 2024. The question is by how much and to what degree are we all sitting up at 230 in the morning waiting to see what a few people in Scranton, Pennsylvania decided to do in the election? I would like to. This is my book book. I want to win a landslide. I want to be able at nine o'clock to start having drinks and not have to worry about whether the fire alarm is going to come on in Fulton County outside of Atlanta and whether we're going to have ballots come pouring in at 3 a.m. that change the outcome in Wisconsin. I want it to be outside the margin of error, but that's going to be the choice that Republicans have to make in 2023. Who is the guy or the girl who is going to beat Joe Biden? Because that's going to be the matchup on the Democrat side.

We got a lot to talk to you about today on the show, my friends, Eric Adams, Mayor of New York City. Clay mentioned him in the last segment. He slept in the Brooklyn cruise terminal with the migrants. Did you see this clay? Just to show that it's all okay there. The mayor slept. Oh, he did a sleepover at overnight in the Brooklyn cruise terminal. We can talk about that in a little bit also. Trans live matter. Trans lives matter protesters. Have stormed and occupied the Oklahoma state capital because of bills under consideration in the Oklahoma state legislature about transgender surgery and hormones for. There's a bunch of different bills. You have to be careful because if you say one thing, they'll say, well, that's not what it does. There are several bills we can get into the the variations. We will. We'll bring you up to speed on this. And we'll see. We'll reach out to the governor of Oklahoma, Kevin Stitt to see if maybe he can join us in progress during the show. Needless to say, with the capital full of shrieking protesters, it's going to be a busy day for the governor, I can imagine. But we'll see if he might feel the make some time for us. But that's obviously a big news story. And Clay, there's there's even more. Now they've got photos of the F 22 Raptor, probably the most incredible air to air dominance plane ever. And it's now being phased out. That seems like given what's going on with China, seems like a great idea. Let's go with the, you know, the the F 35 program, which everybody says is is inferior. I'm sure there's some Air Force guys who are shouting right now, either I'm right or I'm wrong. But anyway, the F 22, um, shot down that Chinese balloon. There's a whole lot more information that's coming out about this. And what we've what we've seen, I think at this point, for sure, on the balloon, Clay is, uh, the Biden administration was either caught totally off guard by some aspects of this and said things that they thought were true that weren't or they were just lying or they were just lying to people about what was really going on here. I think I think that's something we're going to have to dig into a little bit. Yeah. Honestly, I think it's actually an important story. And we talked yesterday with the acting defense secretary at the end of the Trump administration about whether they had any clue that some of these, uh, Chinese spy balloons ever traversed U S territory. And I think CNN had the story up, Buck. If I'm not mistaken, where it was very different, right? Like the Chinese spy balloon may have gone a little bit into Hawaii territory. And then also may have come across Florida a little bit, but it's nothing compared to Hey, we entered in Alaska and we spent six days slowly having this Chinese spy balloon traverse the entirety of the United States. It's quite a bit different. Um, and how do we spend $850 billion a year? The thing that I'm most concerned about is when did we know that this Chinese spy balloon entered into the United States? And if we didn't know why didn't we, but this thing should have been shot down immediately in Alaska, where there are massive areas that are, uh, you know, uninhabited and Buck. We could have done this potentially without the media ever needing to know it all. And without creating an international incident, keeping this all under the radar that it had ever occurred instead of becoming a massive story like it did.

Clay Travis and Buck Sexton on the front lines of truth. Welcome back in clay Travis Buck Sexton show. I hope all of you are rolling through and having a fantastic Tuesday where we may be across this great country. I wanted to hit you with Kareem Jean Pierre. And she was asked about the spy balloon. Buck, I don't know about this. My mom actually texted me this suggestion. Would it be permissible for any members of the Republican house to walk into the state of the union with a small white balloon? You know, like you would give to a young child attached to their wrist or holding it in their hand to point out the Chinese balloon. I mean, I think that would actually be pretty funny. I don't know what the rules are about whether you're allowed to walk in with a, you know, I'm talking about like a kid's balloon that you would get if you were at like a kid's birthday party or something funny or, or not funny in your mind. If a Republican member came in with a white balloon or if multiple Republican members had like, you know, kid white balloons with them for purposes of the state of the union. I mean, it would be even funnier. Do you remember the big Trump baby balloon they had? Oh, yeah. There were a lot of memes. Over the weekend about how Trump should send over the Trump baby balloon, which the whole thing was was very funny. And Trump actually had a sense if you were about it. I think Don Jr retweeted a meme about that too, because he thought it was amusing as well. Yeah, I would do a little good nature, a good little good nature trolling of the Democrats on this occasion if possible. I might show up. I probably don't allow people to have placards or balloons or anything. I don't know what the official rules are on state of the union because yeah, they may be that it is impermissible to do, but it would be actually kind of funny to see if somebody did it. All right. So Corinne Jean Pierre, who is the worst White House press secretary, I think that any of us can ever imagine. And she got her job. Let's be honest because of her race, her gender and her sexuality. Corinne Jean Pierre is Joe Biden's diversity hire as his, as his White House spokesperson. Again, she got that. I did not think that that that, you know, Corinne Jean Pierre was going to be that much worse than the other White House press secretaries. And to be fair, she is in a really difficult position because the Biden White House is quite incompetent, but she was, she regularly gets asked about about the most important issue, the one that's on the front page of the newspaper, the one that you would think you would have a prepared answer for because it's not exactly like these questions come out of nowhere. I understand if you get asked about, I'm just going to, you know, toss something out about, you know, water policy in Angola. Like, oh, okay, well, you probably not expecting water policy in Angola to come up as a question, just throwing something random out there. Getting asked about the Chinese balloon is literally the most expected question you could be asked about. But listen, I don't even know if you've heard this yet. Listen to Corinne Jean Pierre when she is asked about whether the Trump people were informed or knew about these allowed supposed incursions by Chinese balloons. It is a disaster. So look, I think that, and we've talked about this before about how when the PRC government surveillance balloons trans trans transited the continental US briefly at least three times, as you just mentioned during the president's prior administration, and once that we know of the beginning of this administration's, but never for this duration of time, as we know, this information was discovered prior to the administration left. But the intelligence community, as I said, is prepared to give briefings to key officials. But this is something that we, we, they did not, they were not aware of as we've just laid out. Okay. So she's stumbling all through this. But Buck, she seemed to say even in the midst of that word salad that actually they withheld the information. I mean, it's hard to even understand exactly what she's saying there, but it sounds like she's saying that they withheld the information from the Trump administration that these Chinese balloons had been found and or she might also be saying, because it's a jumble there, that this was not discovered until after the Trump White House team had left. Another one is incredibly scary, I think, in general, either they weren't telling the president because they were worried about what he might do, or they didn't know this was happening. I'm not sure which is worse. Yes. Well, this reminds me of something that used to occur during the Trump administration when the hashtag resistance, remember them, you know, working behind the scenes to prevent nuclear catastrophe by undermining the duly elected president of the United States, Donald Trump, they would talk about ways that they would either ignore or subvert his ability to be the president. They wouldn't tell him certain things. And they thought there were heroes for that. And they would even decide to withhold information from them. That was something else that they were remembered that there was a whole storyline of we're concerned about telling Trump things because he'll spill that classified by, you know, recklessly or something. And this was one of those times had a op ed from someone inside of the Trump White House. Yeah, it was a schmoe, by the way. I mean, that was one of the things I've ever the anonymous staffer. Yes. He's like, I'm a senior Trump administration staffer, and I'm working day and night to save America. And it's like, you're a glorified intern kid. Calm down, you know, like, they treated it. Remember all this speculation about who it was and who exactly I mean, as if it were going to be, you know, somebody in a real position. I knew a lot of people. We both do a lot of people in that White House, all folks in the comm shop and the domestic policy shop at the high level. I never heard I never heard of that guy before, but it's like, I'm single hand, at least standing for Trump to save America and the media created this whole thing. I don't remember the guy's name to this day, which I don't remember his name either. There was a people were like, Oh, this is, you know, Kelly and Conway. This is, you know, like, I mean, there were tons of people were saying it was Jared. They were saying it was his son in law. I'm like, I don't think it's I don't think his son in law. Can you imagine that Thanksgiving? If you wrote an anonymous op ed to the New York Times about how you were trying to subvert your duly elected father in law's ability to actually be present in the United States. Dear diary, I think my father in law is going to create nuclear war. So I'm undermining him. I mean, give me a breath. The whole thing was so crazy. But but I do think that what what this also should be a reminder for everybody is that this notion of we didn't tell Trump things. That also meant in some cases they were hiding things from the American people. We should know. Yeah. Let's just let's just take them at their word for a second because the story on this keeps changing. If China really is sending surveillance balloons over our airspace, that is going to trigger in everyone's mind who knows the most basic history, US Soviet Cold War surveillance stuff that was going on. And what did I say? Francis Gary Powers, right? We talked about the YouTube that got shot down and and the different, you know, the cat and mouse game between the US and the Soviets to understand each other's full nuclear capabilities, understand if there was any kind of a shield that could shoot them down. All the different, you know, the decades of Cold War espionage and counter espionage. That was underway. And we should know that China is doing that, right? This is not something if they're flying balloons over airspace, the American people do have a right to to know that the notion that they would hide that from us is I think very troubling or hide that from the president is super troubling. But even that then it is in a sense hidden from the American people. But also do we really believe it because Clay, this thing was really high in the air, but people could see it from the ground. Right. No, I mean, that that's the point on this. I mean, they were hoping, I think that we would never become aware of this, which is why my point on it is shoot it down in Alaska. No one would have known if that got shot down over the Alaskan wilderness, it would have landed. It probably wouldn't have been a story for months until somebody decided they wanted it to be a story. And then it would actually look good for the Biden administration. Hey, we, we recognize that there was this Chinese spy balloon that came into our territory. It was clearly a spy balloon. Why would we allow it to go across the whole country and then shoot it down over water off the coast of South Carolina when you're going to have difficulty getting all the salvage job done? And if we're talking about troubling revelations that have come out of the Chinese spy balloon issue, by the way, our friend Gordon Chang will join us in the third hour to address the why is China doing this? And what does this tell us about Chinese intentions vis-a-vis the United States? I think that's really important. Apparently, they don't just want to sell us really cheap things for Walmart. Apparently, they have some other things in mind too, everybody. I think we all know that. But the look, the Daily Mail reporting here that the intelligence community had had classified these previous Chinese balloons as UFOs. Now, I guess technically they, you know, they would be UFOs at first, but shouldn't the intelligence community be able to figure out the unidentified part of this? Like how many countries are really going to risk the ire of the United States by sending surveillance balloons over our, you know, this isn't just like skirting the edges of our, you know, national boundaries or something. This is going on over our nuclear strategic command sites in Montana. This is bad stuff. I'm also, am I the only person buck who wonders where they let this balloon go? Like, I mean, in all honesty, if it comes over Alaska, where, how far out was the, I presume it left from a ship? Well, I don't know. But I mean, I don't think it would have left from land in China. They're probably not flying it all over. Maybe they maybe they did. I'm genuinely curious about all of this. Like, right? How did it get here? And what was the method by which they allowed that to occur? I mean, I remember when there were, I was in, when I was at US military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan, you would see the, they had these tethered balloon and it was a giant surveillance balloon. So it makes sense. I mean, because when you think about it, anything that's jet powered or runs on a rotor or runs on propellers, gonna run out of gas pretty quickly. So if you need static long term surveillance, old school technology can sometimes be your best friend, a balloon lets you just sort of sit and sit and sit. And so the Chinese have clearly developed an interest in doing this. And also I assume maybe there's some ways because it doesn't move that fast. Perhaps it's not as easy to pick up on certain radars. Again, I don't know. I'm not a, I'm not a radar or missiles guy. But you know, it is interesting to me that this is now suddenly a conversation we're having as a country and yet the Biden administration was like, Oh, well, like they didn't even tell Trump and this happened a bunch of times before that that shouldn't make anybody feel better and it certainly shouldn't make Biden feel better. And I'll just point out again, if this thing is loaded down with explosives, what's to stop them from delivering an attack inside of our country through these methods? Can I ask you know, I know we don't have too much time for this, but in our audience, we've got people that know missiles, people that know radars, people that know air to air, got some air force guys out there. Take a step away from the golf course. It's an air force joke. And give us a call 800-282-2882. You know, there's a little joke about the air force. What's the first thing you do to build every air force base? Figure out where the golf course goes. I'm just kidding Air Force. I love you. I'm just telling you funny jokes. 800-282-2882, give us a call and tell us what you think about this balloon situation, what the Biden administration's claiming. I'm really curious.

All right. So we want to we want to bring you into this year. I have a conversation about something that you wouldn't expect to be blown up the internet. By the way, we'll talk about important policy and political matters here coming up in a few minutes. We do have Kevin Stitt joining us later on the program to talk about this transgender surgery for adolescents blocking that. There's a bill. There's a few bills or some details. We'll get into all of it in Oklahoma. Basically, is a state of Oklahoma going to stop young people from having transgender surgery and or hormone blockers? What would the age limit be for that? That's all underway now. And there's a a trans lives matter, which is what they're calling themselves. The group has seized or you know, stormed or whatever you want to say protested inside of the cap taken over the table. They're occupying the Capitol. Obviously if they were, you know, if they were Donald Trump supporters with MAGA hats, they'd be calling and then you know, actually, no, it's Oklahoma. They wouldn't be calling in the National Guard. But if this was in DC, we all know what would happen. But now we're just talking about how right now, all over the internet, a lot of a lot of consternation from the feminists out there, particularly about the latest Leonardo DiCaprio's love life. So my understanding is Leonardo DiCaprio is 48 years old. Yes. And he is now publicly dating a 19 year old. Is that right? I believe that's correct. He's closing in on the 30 year gap. Now, quite let me just say as a married man, I feel like connection and and having some compatibility goes beyond just these, you know, the physical and attraction. But I do think it's interesting to hear different people's views on what the cause I think for a lot of women, I'm just going to say this, you know, for any of the young ladies listening to show right now, you know, if you're in your mid 20s, I think a lot of those young ladies would be very well served to date guys in their early 30s. I think, you know, if you're because guys in their 27 to be immature, yeah, not necessarily faster than men and men are trying to build a career so that then they can turn around and then build a family and women are on a different timeline. So, you know, I think, you know, 27 and 34 26 and 32, you know, stuff like that. I think that's kind of standard in New York, but 30 years of age gap is Leo's pushing it a little bit. So here's my theory on DiCaprio. I think that Leonardo DiCaprio decided a long time ago in order to be truly elite in his profession. And it's fair to say DiCaprio is an elite actor, right? I mean, maybe the greatest actor of his profession, of his generation. I mean, I don't think that's crazy when you look at the variety of his roles and how successful he's been. I think he decided that he needed absolutely nothing other than like a total casual, not serious relationship partner. I mean, for the rest of his life. And that's what he's done. He's never gotten married. To my knowledge, Buck. He doesn't have any kids. He's 48 and he basically is dated, you know, 20 year old Victoria's Secret models. That's what he dates. 20 year old Victoria's Secret models almost exclusively 21, 20, 22. But you know, Clay, us normal married guys, we get into our 40s. We want conversation. We want nap time. It's very different. I think DiCaprio wants what DiCaprio wants, which is 20 year old Victoria's Secret models. And I think he doesn't feel like he has to give it up. And the girls continue to date him. So I don't really have any issue with DiCaprio. I just wanted to keep making good movies and maybe not talk about the blue hair. The blue hair that Cat Lady's online are very upset at Leo over this though. A lot of Cat Lady."
