    "text": " The following is still a pandemic recording presented to you in a round sound. Hey, this is Lady Don't Take No. Your weekly roundup of all of the real and none of the fake. I'm your host Alicia Garza. This show is pro black, pro queer, proudly feminist and pro do what you like. Every week you're going to get the best of what goes on in my head, what we loving on and what we hate on. What we might be and what we ain't going to do. Politics, pop culture, how to catch a predator and hold them accountable. We cover it all. This podcast is based in Oakland, California, the center of the known universe where we are dealing with Rona and Reconstruction. It's a challenging time, a changing time, it's a time of transformation. It's all the things all the time nowadays, but we are going to help you understand the dynamics of this time every single week. So be sure to tune in, tell a friend and leave a review on Apple Podcasts. We do it for the culture so the pod is free 99 because we know that with a country and chaos, the least we could do is keep you from putting your money anywhere else than where it's needed. Our guest this week is an elected official, a writer and commentator on political, race and social issues. She's a proud co-founder of the National Black Justice Coalition, the nation's largest and oldest black lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights organization. For her work, she was named Out Magazine's Journalist of the Year, one of Essence Magazine's 25 Women's Shaping the World, and one of Los Angeles's most fascinating Angelenos by the LA Weekly. Her list of accomplishments could easily fill our entire show, so we're just going to go ahead and get into it. Please welcome Jasmine Canick. Hey Jasmine, how you doing? Hey girl. It's how are you? Yes, it's so good to have you here. So look, I mean, I don't even know where we are in this pandemic anymore. I just know we're in one still. And I know it seems to be causing a lot of confusion because people are out here refusing to wrap it up and back it up. So I got to ask you, what has your pandemic life been like? Have you developed any unique habits, live and direct from Ms. Rona? My pandemic life. Well, when I first, thanks for having me. Happy to be here. Let me get that out the way. So yeah, when the pandemic first hit, I was still working in City Hall. So it was very different for those of us who work in service and who are basically responsible for the people, right? So we were spending a lot of time figuring out how to get, and this was pre vaccine, right? So we're figuring out how to get resources to people who were unable to work, who are being told to stay home, people who were sick. So I spent the first part of the pandemic very much focused on supporting my then boss, Los Angeles City Council President, her blessing in working on that. And I left City Hall at the end of the year last year. So after that, at some point, I decided that I didn't want to come out of this pandemic the same way that I went into it. And for me, that meant a whole bunch of different things. Definitely around my weight, am I eating? I'm like an emotional eater. I've always had a really bad, love-eight relationship with food. And a pandemic is just asking for you to stay at home and eat. Come on. That was a struggle. I did some crazy things. I picked up and moved at the beginning of the year during the pandemic. That was interesting. I wanted to live in downtown, I wanted to have my sex list in the city year. So I can cross that off my bucket list. So I'm rounding up my sex list in the city year now. But really, I moved downtown LA because as someone who's really, really, really focused on this unhoused crisis, being down here, you can never forget it. Because every time you walk out the door, all you see are black people on the streets laying on the streets. I mean, it just breaks my heart. And so for me, I can't stay down here any long amount of time because it's too depressing in that way. But I wanted to really be in the middle of this so I could really get a handle on it. So I got dumped. Yes. That was quite, you know, I teetered on the edge there for a minute because there's nothing like being in a pandemic and getting dumped. Because, you know, normally, you know, it's a bad situation on the way around, but when you're not in a pandemic, maybe you go to a bar. Maybe you go here, you go there, you do the, you know, do you do all these different things to keep yourself preoccupied. But in a pandemic, your options are limited. Yeah. So, and I don't recommend drinking alone at home to anyone. And that's been an interesting situation learning how to, because I was a relationship for like seven years and it was. So I'm like trying to figure this whole single business out. That's all been very interesting. So I'm definitely not coming out of the pandemic. The same way I went. Yeah. Well, that's a blessing. That's a blessing. That's a blessing. And you know what? Solidarity because I feel you. I ended a 17 year relationship this year. And it's a lot learning how to be single at our illustrious. Our illustrious stages in life. I'm not even going to say age. I'm just going to say stages in life. So solidarity to you, dear one illustrious is absolutely right solidarity. And because, you know, you know, I can do a whole show called what we ain't going to do at my age. Okay. And what we ain't going to put up with in the dating world. So we don't have to do that show. That's a whole separate show for women. We might have to do that. We should definitely do that show. I'm not really dating for this exact fucking reason because it's just too much for me. I'm too old for this shit. I'm like, yo, just come correct. That's it. It's not that hard. Girl, don't give me. I please do not get me started on this topic. Because people are looking me and they're like, she's political. She's this. She's that. They have no idea where my real passion is. It is dealing with this societal shit. Right? That's real relationships and being a black lesbian woman in 2021 with morals and values. Oh, honey. It is just not easy. Are there any new skills that Miss Rona has given you? New skills. Well, new skills. Mm. Improved upon. Yes. So I love interior design. So I played a lot around with my space and colors and things like that. Normally, I wouldn't have the time to do, you know, so more than anything more than anything. I did a lot of talking to Jasmine. A lot of talking to myself sometimes answering myself. Come on. You know, just trying to figure life out. Like we have. We've all had a lot of time to spend with ourselves. Some of us more than others. I, you know, like I said, you know, I'm teetering and I don't want to fall off the edge. So I'm trying to like, you know, figure it out. And so I don't know if that's a skill necessarily, but I definitely. Spend a lot of time trying to get more in touch with myself and be more honest with myself just about who I am, what I want, what I don't want. So yeah. I love that. That is actually a skill. Lots of people. Could you? Well, you don't get me started. I mean, yeah. And then besides, you know, my other stuff, I'm a plus size fashionista. That is my side thing that I find a lot of pleasure in. And so I did spend a lot of time, you know, designing clothes and just doing these things that have nothing to do with like my day to day work because sometimes you have to have that hobby that something that's just not related to your work. And for me, it's make up and close and choose. And particularly for women my size, because I'm all about, you know, the fashion world realizing that we just don't want to wear moon moves. Hello, no, we like fashionable clothes too. Hello. And so I spent the summer wearing bikinis and I had never done that in my life. But I did like I look at you. Thank you. You look like a kid in Jamaica. I was in bikinis everywhere. And I, you know, just trying to let people know like, look, you know, whatever size you are. You have to embrace who you are. And one of the lessons that the pandemic that Roan had taught me because one of my best friends died from coronavirus was just that, you know, you can be here. Thank you. You could be here today and gone tomorrow and it's sort, you know, life is not a dress rehearsal. So if there's something you want to do, just you got to, you know, get to it. Do you know it? Yeah. Oh, I love that. One of the reasons I wanted to have you on the podcast, as I alluded to earlier in our intro, is that you have done a lot of work around a story that caught my eye maybe about a year ago. And just for people who are listening, you know, about a year ago, I was scrolling through something or other. And I caught wind of a case that literally blew my mind. It was a rich white man who was a major donor to the Democratic Party, who was a person of interest in the overdose deaths of quite a few black gay men. Now, at first I was like, wait a minute, like, is this some like true crime type shit? But then I kept seeing stories about how this dude kept getting away with what was clearly murder. And it was obvious that the reason that he was not getting held accountable in any kind of way was because black gay men are seen as expendable. So imagine my relief when I saw that there was a black woman on the case, honey, making sure that this man, Ed Buck, was no longer able to get away with murder. So Jasmine, first, let me just say, thank you for your work. I want you to say I've been following it and following you, and I deeply, deeply appreciate it. I'm hoping you can talk to our listeners a little bit about this case in case they haven't heard about it. When did you get involved and what spurred you to take action? So I got involved because a friend of mine knew, so Jamel Moore was the first young man who died in Ed Buck's home and his mother, Miss Latisha Nixon, had been trying to reach journalists in Los Angeles because she knew that something was not right. And one of my friends, a journalist, was on the receiving end of one of her emails and he asked me to reach out to her because he thought I could help her. At that time, I know she was trying to get a copy of, I think, a police report from the sheriff's apartment, and she wasn't getting any help. And from there, four years later, here we are. And so I'll try my best to do it as short as possible. I mean, what you had was a pretty well known white man in West Hollywood named Ed Buck, who's very active in local politics, like super active. And he was also a major donor. So when I say major donor, I mean, within the span of maybe 10 years, he contributed over half a million dollars to candidates, mostly in the Los Angeles area. So that gave him a lot of access to people. And he was behind the fur ban in West Hollywood, which was the first city in the country to ban the sale of fur. So he, you know, he was pretty well known. He was notorious. But while he was doing all this stuff in the daytime at night, he was using apps like Grindr and other dating apps to find homeless black men who are more often than the ones that were in the West Hollywood. And so he was often than not ended up being gay and paying them to do crystal meth. Some of these men were already addicts, some of them were not addicts, and he turned them into addicts to men died. One was Jamil Moore, who died in 2017 and then Timothy Dean, who died in 2019. And he had been doing this for over 20 years. He, we still don't know where he gets his money from. But that was basically his, his MO was black men. He had a fetish and a thing for black men. And, you know, he would make them dress up in white underwear. He would do all sorts of things to these men that, you know, I'm trying to get this book done so I can, because a lot of people, I wish the world could have sat in on this trial, but since they can't, I will have to write it out for them. I didn't get this done, but I knew he was a bad person, but after sitting through the trial, it was clear just how sick he was sick and depraved. And I really how much he hated black men. So, you know, for a long time, we couldn't get our DA Jackie Lacy, first black woman, DA in LA, could not get her to lift a finger to do anything about at Buck, which is how Timothy Dean ended up dying because how'd she done something. And it would have been free for Timothy Dean to die, right. So this is the same Jackie Lacy who led her husband, pull a gun on BLM, LA leader, Molina Abdullah. And the same Jackie Lacy that the movement in LA kicked out of office child because she was doing too much and too little at the same time. Who he says she must go as she gone. So, I was a huge part of that and I'm happy that that's happy to be a part of that campaign. So, eventually the feds got involved and that's how he got charged and he was facing finally nine. Well, he got arrested in September of 2019 now Timothy Dean was killed in January of 2019. He was finally arrested in September of 19 2019 the pandemic hit slowed everything to a grinding halt. So we didn't have the trial until July of this year. He was facing nine counts he was found guilty on all nine counts he had a strategy of let me hire step it and fetch it to represent me for the optics. And I hired Christopher Darden and Ludlow query the second to black men male attorneys for the optics. And as I announced to the world yesterday as soon as they couldn't get him off he fired them and he is now hired Harvey Weinstein's attorney Mark works in a white man. He has no use for those black men. He just needed them for the optics and they couldn't get him off so he quickly got rid of them. So, he's still sitting in jail jail is where you go before you go to prison. So he you know you sit in jail until you get sitting. So he's still in jail. He is going to be requesting a new trial. Hopefully the judge will not grant it. Nobody wants to sit through that again. And he's supposed to be sentenced later this year doesn't look like that's going to happen since he switched attorneys. Now everything is again slowing to a grinding halt but that's sort of the sanitized version of what happened but his victims were for the most part black gay men who were homeless here in Los Angeles. And if you know anything about the homeless crisis in Los Angeles and you know that it's a playground for him. There is there's no shortage of black men who are unhoused in this city. Sadly, you know I hear I heard so much criticism over the past four years of his victims and I always say to people you don't know what you would do until you are faced with it. You don't know what you would do if you were living in a tent on the street or didn't have a tent and we're on the street or we're hungry or we're this or with that. You know we like to sit in our homes under our roofs with our clothes and our refrigerator full of food and pass judgment on people. Not understanding that we seriously do not know what we might force ourselves to do just to have a roof over our head for a night or how money to buy food. And no one who testified during that trial got up there and said that they were in love with Ed Buck. Everybody who testified said I did it because I needed a roof over my head. I did it because I didn't want to sleep on the street that night. I did it because I needed money to eat with nobody was in love with that man. They don't even like that man. See these straight up ticket bandage of them and sadly two people died of overdose. And you know Christopher Darden, just like my cousin Deborah O'Kannick who represented R Kelly, they get no invites to the picnic. Ever again in life to nothing to nothing. They don't get invited to shit. Okay, don't even invite them to a funeral. They get nothing. Christopher Darden's whole defensive ed buck was that Jamel Moore had AIDS. And that's why he died not the crystal meth in his system, but AIDS. Yeah, that's what killed him. He spent the whole entire trial telling the jury that Jamel Moore had AIDS. And that Timothy Dean died because of alcohol. And not the meth in his system. Alcohol and a bad heart, but not the meth in his system. And Domino's we have a saying that all money is not good money. And certainly in my career, I have turned down jobs. I have turned away money because morally, it was just not the right thing to do. Christopher Darden should be ashamed of himself. Ludlow query should be a shamed, Deborah O'Kannick. You should be ashamed of yourself too. All these attorneys, these black attorneys taking these cases, it just breaks my heart. You know, you know, your client is guilty. Given these odds, everything that you were up against, whether it be, you know, stereotypes and perceptions of homeless people, whether it be, you know, high profile defense attorneys, right, who are willing to take up these kinds of cases, what did it take to keep the spotlight on this case and ultimately secure consequences for what Buck did to these men. Consistency. And for me, I mean, I've worked on a lot of cases involving black people who were hurt or done wrong. And they're, Matrice Richardson, her disappearance and death. I mean, just various different situations. And so like with this one, you have families of the families and they're looking to you to help them. So Jamel's family didn't live here in LA and Timothy's Dean's family didn't live here in LA. And so it was really on us, those of us that were here and that cared to keep the pressure on because if we didn't, at Buck would still be in his apartment right now. I'm doing the same thing he had been doing. When I get asked that question, I just tell people, one, it takes consistency. I mean, you just need to be consistent. You don't give up. You know, one of the things I, when I talk to Molina, I, we kind of chuckle sometimes because I remember when people say nothing's going to happen to Jackie Lacey. I, I, y'all protesting her every single week for five years and we're Jackie Lacey at right now. Right? So it paid off that they were persistent and they kept doing what they were doing. Right? And sometimes you have to do that. Things don't always happen very quickly. Sometimes it takes time. In this particular case, we had a Democratic Party establishment that still doesn't really want to acknowledge what happened. Like, people don't want to talk about it. Right? Although I don't ever let them forget it. I got two of his highest, two of the people who took the most money from him are running for mayor right now here in LA. So, you know, while I'm running my own campaign, I'll be busy making sure to remind people, hey, do not forget about these two men who took $20,000 from Ed Buck, $18,000. And, you know, and, and that never said anything. So I'm still dealing with the Democratic Party on that, right? Because they still, and, because you know, because we don't acknowledge what we did, we're going to repeat it. And you can't tell me as a party that Black Lives Matter, if when one of your very own donors who has funded nearly everyone in office right now is found guilty on nine counts of something is heinous is, you know, causing the death of two black men from Crystal Math. And we can't say anything as a party, but yet, and still you want, you want to depend on the black vote to get you through every time. There's something wrong there. So either Black Lives Matter or they don't matter. That's right. That's right. If the silence tells me that they don't matter. And you and I both know we don't need lip service. That's right. Last thing we need to live service. Right? Tell the whole truth. Tell the whole truth. Well, let me ask you this. What was the catalyst for you to get into political work? I mean, your resume is long, and it's also eclectic. From a beauty blogger to a plus size fashion model to Democratic Party representative to a civic engagement extraordinaire, registering voters with EZE's son, all the way to fighting for black immigrants. I mean, what has spurred your involvement in politics? I got my start working for the late Mervyn Daimley, who, if people don't know who that is, you should definitely do your research. He was a history making black man here in the US. He was actually the first foreign born member of the House of Representatives. He's from Trinidad. Yeah, he was the first black lieutenant governor in the state of California. And I have the opportunity to work for him. His last go around in the state assembly and be mentored by him. Wow. And that's really where I got my start at. And, you know, I look at my background to and I say, Oh, yeah, you are kind of all over the place. But not really because at the end of the day, like all of everything I do is for the people because I'm of the people. Like whether it's, you know, helping a family figure out what happened to their kid or dealing with the at-butt case or working on policies or helping to get progressive leaders elected. Like, to me, it's all in the same pot. But, you know, my background, look, I don't have a conventional background. You know, I grew up in Hermosa Beach, around a bunch of white people. And tell my parents got divorced. And then after that, you know, I ended up, you know, moving to Compton. I ended up in the foster care system. And so I think even my work life even kind of reflects that sort of, you know, just kind of all over the place a little bit, which is why I care about so many different issues because I have a, I've had a lot of different things. I've dealt with in my life. Like, I've been on my own since I was 17. I was emancipated out the foster care system at 17. So there are a lot of things that when we talk about renters and the horrible housing and homelessness and foster care and all that stuff, all of that is really personal to me because these are all things that I've experienced, right? You know, I tell people you can sit around and complain about things all you want, but you can also decide to be involved and try to be a part of the change. That's why I ran for the Democratic Party because I was like, well, I can complain about these people. They ain't never going to listen to me. So I better run, get on this ballot because once I'm elected, they have to let me in the room. So I get to be the one in the room all the time. Now, that's like, where the black people, how many black people did you hire? Oh, well, you know, that's me all the time. And I love it. It doesn't win me any big prizes or anything or friends. I don't get the invites to the special things, but I feel good at night because I know that in a state like California, where the black population is shrinking, right? That we have people who still care about us, right? And I'm one of those people. You know, I believe in complaining about a lot of things and calling a lot of things out, but I also believe in trying to figure out how to dismantle, you know, change, get in there and do what we got to do to effectuate change. I mean, we want to Jackie Lacey gone, but it wasn't as simple as Jackie Lacey being gone. And if there's somebody in there that was going to make the changes that we wanted. And that's why I try to impress upon people. Yeah. Okay, you're mad. I get it. I understand. But what's plan B? Like once we get this, what's the next step in the plan? Because that's how we need to be looking at things. We need to be looking at the bigger picture. And so that's sort of been my whole entire career. And now hopefully I can do it from a point of perhaps, you know, being in the legislature on the city council. Like, I want to do it from that point as well. Speaking of making change and making a plan. I mean, damn, Jasmine. Look, this week, it is national voter registration day. And the midterms are around the corner. And as a political strategist, I'm curious to hear what you think about what Democrats need to do to keep it from being a complete bloodbath, especially as it relates to black voters. I mean, what do the Democrats need to do to make it right for black voters who save their asses every damn election cycle, but especially the last one. First of all, we, we, the people have to stop letting all these political parties lie to us. But especially the Democratic Party. And I love being a member of the Democratic Party and talking shit about the Democratic Party, because that is the Democratic way. So you could be a part of the party and challenge the party and hold them accountable. And that's what I do. Look, we belong to a party that, like you said, depends on our vote. But very rare. What do we get in return? That's what I always challenge people with. What do we get in return? What we just witnessed in terms of cutting off the pandemic, federal unemployment. I said to myself, well, Jean, whiz, now would be the time for folks to be threatening people talking about you. We are reelecting you next year, because that's the only thing that gets some of these people on the right side of issues is when they think that they are going to come back to their district and not be reelected. But I just heard crickets. Well, I guess everybody was OK with not having their federal pandemic unemployment money anymore. So I hear your question about, you know, what do they need to do, but really more what do we need to do? Because I keep trying to remind people, I don't know when we went from public servant to VIP celebrity. But elected officials and politicians are servants of the people. Like, you literally put those people there to serve your best interest. And if they're not doing that, you need to hold them accountable. And accountability looks different for different people for Jackie Lacey and then taking her out of office for our sheriff down here. It definitely means taking his ass out of office. But for some people, it means having a meeting with them, seeing if we can get them on the right side of the issue and if not then taking them out of office. But we have to do something really, I don't always necessarily blame the politicians because they only get away with what you let them get away with. And believe me, when I get up there, I'm going to have this exact same edge. I'm not going to change to be a different person. Like, I believe this in my heart, people will only get away with what you let them get away with. You have to not vote for somebody in November and then not check in on them again until three and a half years later when they're campaigning for their reelection. What kind of sense does that make? But that's exactly what we do. So that's what we do every time. Last question and it's a deeply important one. What is your favorite beauty product that you're using right now? And what is your favorite plus size clothing line? Oh, easy for the second one right now. I'm totally a universal standard girl. I love universal standard. My second and third, Eliqui and Mm LeFlore. Yes, love. Yes, but I am a universal standard universal standard used to be like a third of my closet and I feel like they're like more than half of my closet. I know your closet is lit. I know it's lit. I know it's lit. I know it is. Beauty product that I play around with so many beauty products, but I guess one that I really like is I'm the Mac face and body in terms of like the foundation because I, as much as I like makeup sometimes, I don't always want to wear makeup. And I find that the face and body works for those days where you just kind of have to have something on, but you don't want to be like completely like with like full coverage and stuff. So, so yeah, I would say that. And when it comes to the products, I have so much stuff. I got I sometimes I wish somebody would just take my phone for me at night. In the hours of like nine and six because that's when I do most of my online shopping and I'm just laying there like. I do. I don't know what that's about, but I like it. I love it. And I support it. And you know what? If you could only see what's going on around here, you would know I'm right there with you. And just like that, it's time for our weekly roundup of all the things. Lady just ain't going to do this week. Number one, Kelly Price. Girl, what? This shit is really bizarre actually. Last week it was reported that R&B and gospel singer Kelly Price was officially categorized as a missing person. Now word out on the street was that Price had contracted the RONA and it was so bad in fact that SIS had to be hospitalized for three weeks in the ICU. But here's where the shit starts to get weird. Apparently her kids get a call from the hospital that she's being discharged, which seems odd because at this point she hasn't fully made a full recovery. And then she essentially vanishes into thin air for over a month. Apparently the family started getting concerned and asked police to do a welfare check at Price's boyfriend slash husband's house. I don't know who he is. He refused them entry apparently. Girl, what? So nobody knows where she is. Boyfriend, husband, don't know. Her family don't know. And then in a weird turn of events, here she come talking about, I'm good, but I almost died of the RONA. Sissy, what the fuck is going on? What you talking about SIS? Then we come to find out she was like, yo, I don't really fuck with my family like that, so I don't know what they talking about that I'm missing. I just been in the cut recovering and almost died in the process. According to CNN, she got the RONA, we don't know if she's vaxed, and then her husband got it, and then she got super sick. But other news outlets identify the dude as her boyfriend. Now, she gets weird as fuck when she says she was never missing, that people were definitely seeing her while she was recovering, but they were prevented from saying so because of HIPAA laws, which are basically patient privacy laws. Now, y'all know this don't make no damn sense. SIS, you telling me no one said, hey, she's alive, she's not missing because they were respecting patient privacy? What the fuck? All of this to say, it's clear that something is going on here, but she don't want us to know what it is. And that's fine, SIS, but keep it cute, because this 5G story just don't add up. But we're going to let it go for now and let you recover in peace. We're glad you're okay, and we're glad you're still with us. Haiti updates. Where did all the migrants go and what's happening with them now? So last week we reported that Haitian asylum seekers were being chased by border patrol officers on horses with whips. Now, of course, this caused an uproar because what's it looking like when men on horses with whips are chasing black people? Well, you guessed it, slavery. Well, over the last week, several prominent civil rights figures visited the bridge in Del Rio, Texas, where migrants were gathered, bringing more publicity to this predicament. Now, y'all, 14,000 Haitian migrants waited across the Rio Grande into this tiny border town. So where are they now? Well, 4,000 of them were deported back to Haiti, which is shameful and reprehensible. But thousands more have been allowed to stay in the US while they await immigration hearings. But still, there is no proposed solution to what to do about immigration, how to both undo the damage of the previous administration, but also how to make sense of what also didn't make sense under the Obama administration. Massive deportations of migrants as a substitute for political battles that Democrats, surprise, aren't willing to have because why? Well, because they're still chasing old white voters rather than cultivating new voters with better politics. So here we are approaching midterm elections and both sides act and funny, but not moving no bills or a comprehensive approach to immigration because everyone is scared to use power in case they lose power. Does that make any fucking sense whatsoever to you? Me neither. Other things, Lady Anco, do this week infrastructure negotiations. So make it make sense. Look, y'all, we have to give a more comprehensive update in the next roundup because it ain't looking good this week and they ain't even voted on the shit. Today, Congress did pass a bill to fund the government before it ran out of money, and this bill apparently is going to get us through to December. But at the time of this roundup, Congress hasn't even voted on the $3.5 trillion infrastructure proposals. Now, listen, the holdouts, you know who they are. Drum roll, Kristen Sinema from Arizona, and Joe Manchin from West Virginia. Now, this shit is literally so typical. Now Manchin is railing on about how he's not a liberal, but really, my feeling on this is that he's a plant. He's working too fucking hard to not just derail, but detract, and as you and I both know, that's Fed behavior. And I wonder who's paying them and how much they've contributed to their coffers. Something don't smell right here, and that's not conspiracy theory. We're gonna come back to this next week. Other things, Lady, just Anco, do this week. Portia and Cynthia out at Real Housewives of Atlanta. Y'all, it's the end of an era, as it was announced this week that Portia Williams and Cynthia Bailey are leaving the Real Housewives of Atlanta franchise. The big question remains. Is this signaling the end of that franchise? I mean, Nini's gone, Shirei is apparently coming back, Kim is gone, but where is he really going? In any case, one of the best moments of this show was when Portia, granddaughter of the late civil rights icon, Josea Williams, wondered aloud at a stop on the Underground Railroad, which was like a church with a secret room beneath the floors, how the train fit through. Woo, Jesus, take the wheel. All right, y'all, but here's what Lady wants more of this week. Number one, R. Kelly convicted of racketeering. Now, the best news of the week is that R. Kelly was convicted on eight counts of sex trafficking and one count of racketeering, and he faces ten years to life in prison. Don't forget that's just the charges in New York. He also faces child sex images and obstruction charges in Chicago and sex abuse charges in Minnesota and Illinois. Now, here's why this is on the Lady Loaves list this week. It ain't about jail time for R. Kelly. It's about the fact that after decades of these people trying to tell their stories and be heard, be witnessed, and be believed that we are now listening. Now, as a survivor myself, the gaslighting is really the worst. For years, the voices of these survivors have been scrutinized, questioned, and frankly diminished. Let me also take some time to just also say thank you to Dreamhampton, my friend, and a guest of this podcast, who brought us the brilliant and poignant surviving R. Kelly docu series that shifted this conversation in important ways and helped us see comprehensively how all of these pieces fit together. How this was a pattern and a practice that was supported, encouraged, and enabled by a wide range of individuals and institutions. And I, for one, hope that the next step here is an assessment of the systems and structures that allowed this to persist. Now, of course, there are some who would try and muddy up this whole thing by saying only black men get persecuted for sexual violence in assault and white people don't. And I am going to say to you very clearly that you can stand up for the ways that black men are railroaded without dying on this hill. This man was literally and is literally a predator, and any claims to the contrary just can't be taken seriously. Should we all have access to redemption? Absofucking Luely. I truly do believe that nobody is the worst thing they've ever done, and I really mean that. However, there is no redemption without accountability and treatment. R. Kelly has had neither. So I don't want to move forward to redemption when you niggas won't even acknowledge he has a problem, much less hold him accountable for it. Anyway, this was an important week for the survivors of R. Kelly. Maybe for some it's about the punishment, but for me, it's about the acknowledgement that it happened and that it was wrong. He clearly has some serious problems and those problems need to be addressed. Now the reality is, not much of that is going to get addressed in jail. Jail is for punishment, not rehabilitation. R. Kelly is on time out for the time being. May everyone find a little more peace and have a little more room for healing because of it. Other things Lady loves this week. The group chats when they work well. So this week Lady wants to give some appreciation to the ancient art form known as the group chat. No, but seriously, my group chat was lit, lit, lit this week as I shared with my girlfriends that I am closing on a house and finally, finally, mending this little broken heart of mine. This is good news of course because I told y'all this wasn't exactly the hot girl summer I expected. And the last time my girl saw me in person, I was depleted, I was fucked up. And when I tell you that chat lit up talking about helping me live my best single life, I cackled four days on it. A group chat when it works well can give you all the life you need to keep going and keep a cute. Sometimes group chats don't work child, but mine were lit this week and Lady is grateful. Other things we love this week is that Britney Spears is officially free. So this week a judge ordered the immediate removal of Britney Spears' dad from the conservatorship. Marking the end of 13 years in which he has managed her finances and her life. We love to see it. Next hearing is on November 14th and it's expected to eliminate the conservatorship altogether, which is really important. Now, I'm interested in checking out that free Britney documentary because this whole shit sounds nuts. I mean, pops apparently planted listening devices in her bedroom? Come on, man, this is like my age or older child, time to let go. Other things we love this week, Mercury retrograde all up in your business. So speaking of which, we are back with the final retrograde turn of Mercury this next couple weeks and I don't know about y'all. Dear listeners, but hey, I am grateful that's one of the last ones. Anyone else out there feeling like a strong urge to set boundaries and establish new patterns in your relationships? Well, if you are, it should come as no surprise to you that this retrograde is all about that work, honey. This retrograde is in Libra, our house of partnerships. And woo, boy, let's dive into this for a second. Now, I've been resetting boundaries that needed it, setting and holding new boundaries and working on me. And I will tell you, child, sometimes people don't like it when you set boundaries with them. They deflect, they try and diffuse, and otherwise, gaslights you into thinking that your boundaries are inappropriate. But when that happens, this is when you know that the boundaries actually needed. For me, though, it's not about the other person's behavior. I mean, yes, that sucks and it's annoying and all of that. But this time around, it's about holding the boundaries themselves. I mean, I feel like we don't talk enough about how hard it is to hold boundaries with people you love. It can be downright devastating, to be honest. I love someone right now who I'm having to set boundaries with and it's deeply painful. But on the other side of that is also my dignity. I mean, you got to treat me right if we're going to be in relationship. And like Prentice said, boundaries are the distance at which I can love you and love me at the same time. And I'm with that shit. Yes. Unfortunately, we got to wrap it up. But before we do, please tell the people how they can find you and follow you on the socials. For sure. So my website is I Am Jasmine and my dad was very creative. So it's J-A-S-M as in Mary, Y, N as in Nancy E. So most people spell Jasmine with the I. So just replace that with a Y. I'm at Jasmine on Twitter. Hello, Jasmine on Instagram and Jasmine on Facebook. I was on Facebook and Twitter early enough to get my name. Come on. So, yeah. So, and my email address is on my website as well. And yeah, I would encourage people to follow me, particularly folks in California and folks in LA or just folks who care period. Because like I said, I got big plans coming up and I'm going to need everybody's support to get there. Thank you so much. It's been so good to have you. So that's it for Lady Don't Take No. But I'll be back here every single Friday morning to accompany you where there's a chance you might be communicating again. We appreciate you joining us and please, let's keep the conversation going. Tell us what's on your mind. Tell us what you like. And tell us what you ain't going to take no more of. On Twitter, we're at Lady Take. On Insta, we're at Lady Don't Take No Pot. We're also on Facebook at Lady Don't Take No Podcast by Alicia Garza. We post ways to do something about things you hear on this show all over our social media. So if we got you amped up today, check out the socials to find out how you can take action. And let's give a special shout out to Jhaari Ferrar for making sure the people get what they need from our socials. Since we appreciate you. Please subscribe and write us a review and let the people know what you heard here today. Our producer is Phil Circus. Our incredible theme is by LaTirix. This pod is supported by the Black Futures Lab. And me, I'm your host, Alicia Garza. Remember, free Britney, make it make sense Kelly. Ain't no sense in talking about redemption when we haven't even had no damn accountability. Time to move real things for real people and move obstructionists like Manchin and Cinema out the way. And make way for those boundaries. Because Jha, Mercury in Retro Grey go help you do it whether you want to or not. That's right, I said it because Lady Don't Take No. She won't speak unless it's something worse so I'm gonna play. A girl take herself so seriously. People still curious. She got a natural way. Her hips way furious. You got a luxurious. Love y'all."
