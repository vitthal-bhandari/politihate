    "text": " You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears. And boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, I hope all is going well today. My name is Ryan Mikler, and I am the host and the founder of Order of Man. Whether you are new to the show today, or you've been with us since the beginning, or even sometime in between, I want to welcome you to what I consider the manliest podcast available today. Each and every week, my goal is to get the world's most successful men, whether that's athletes, warriors, entrepreneurs, New York Times best-selling authors, or basically anybody who has a message to share with us about being a better man, that's who we're going to bring on the show. Now, if you don't already know, we have this show, our Friday Field Notes, where I share some of my thoughts and my ideas, my ramblings from throughout the week, but we also have an interview show I just mentioned, which is released each and every Tuesday. So I suggest you just subscribe, wherever you get your Fix a Podcast, so you never miss a single episode. Now, with that said, I do want to make you aware of a couple of resources before I get into the meat of the discussion. First, if you haven't already done so, make sure you go join right now, our closed Facebook group, with thousands of men. I think we're close to 19,000 men in the group, and thousands of conversations centered around the topic of masculinity. And you can do that at Facebook.com. And next, make sure you take a quick minute to check out our exclusive mastermind, the Iron Council. This is designed to help you take your life to the next level with regards to your relationships, your health, your wealth, your self, your life. And you can see what we're all about and what's included, and you can join this incredible brotherhood of men who are committed to being better leaders, better fathers, better husbands, business owners, better men in their lives, and of course the lives of those they care about. You can do that at order of man.com slash Iron Council. Now, let's get into the discussion today, which is that of sovereignty. The idea of sovereignty is the ability that you and I have to govern ourselves. And if you're going to be the man that you want to be, you are going to have to latch on to and embrace this idea fully. And there's a reason you're going to have to do this, and that's because there is not a single person on this planet who can take care of you better than you should be able to take care of yourself. Now, I've got to throw a disclaimer out. It seems like I have to do this every week because inevitably somebody's going to tell me that a quote unquote real man does not live for himself, that he should be there to serve others. And while I definitely agree with that, wholeheartedly agree with that, if you can't learn to govern and be responsible and accountable for yourself, you are not going to be able to serve those that you feel like you have a responsibility and even obligation to serve. A man is somebody who is a protector. He's a provider. He's a presider. We've talked a lot about this in his life and others' lives as well. And so to that end, it is critical that you and I learn how to take care of ourselves first. And that's what I want to talk with you about today. Now, I've broken this down into 12 principles. And I think I'm going to break this into two shows for the sake of time. But today I'm going to break down the first six. Then next week I'll give you the next six. Now, the sad reality is that most men have all but given away their individual sovereignty to some organization or government, some party, even their spouses in some cases. They're expecting that somebody else will do it all for them and believe, believe they're entitled to some things in this life. And the fact remains, nobody owes us anything. And if you're going to have more, do more, be more, it is up to you and me to develop the mindset and the skills and the tools that we need to do that. These aren't in any particular order today, but let's break this down. First and foremost, no one owes you a thing. I already talked about this one a little bit, but understanding that it is not anyone else's responsibility to make sure you have in this life is a crucial step in controlling your own destiny. It's not your boss's job to make sure you're employed. It's not your client's job to make sure you're paid. It's not your wife's responsibility to ensure that you're fulfilled in your marriage. It's not your or fitness coach's responsibility to ensure you're in shape. And it's definitely not the government's job to ensure that you and I prosper. It is all on us. And when you and I come to that realization and we live our life accordingly, we have taken the first step to power and control over our fate, our future, our destiny. Next, everything in life is a choice. A lot of people don't like when I say this because there are no doubt some things that happen to us that are beyond our control. I understand this, but that said, those situations probably represent less than 1% of the way that we actually live our lives. And even if something does happen to us that we can't control, we still have a choice in how we respond to that event. And another point I want to make here is that you are constantly making choices every single day. Sometimes you not making a choice is actually making a choice not to choose. So understanding that you get to choose your life and the results of your choices determine how successful you'll be in your relationships, your fitness journey, your money, your business, every other area of life. Now, along those same lines of things happening outside of our control, you need to understand that you can choose to consume yourself with the things that you have no control over. Or you can choose to focus only on what you can control. And that's point number three. You cannot control another person's behavior. You cannot change the economy. You cannot change the weather. There's a lot of things that we cannot change. And to believe that we can is arrogant at best and destructive to our own success and well-being at worst. A lot of people will focus on the way that the world quote unquote should be unicorns, rainbows, fairy tales. Instead of focusing on the way it actually is and then acting accordingly. And this brings me to the very next point, which is operating in reality. Most of us walk around with a fog haziness in our lives. We deliberately or even unintentionally pull this wool over our eyes because the world is too difficult to handle at times. We don't want to jump on the scale, for example, because we're afraid of what that scale, what that number will actually say. We don't want to ask our wife how the relationship is going because we know that it sucks. And we don't want to pull up the bank account because we know it's in the negative. This is how children behave. For example, my daughter, she will cover her eyes when she gets scared. Does that mean the threat is now gone because she can't see it? Of course not. It only means that she can no longer react to it properly because she can't even see what's going on. We laugh when we see a child doing this, but forget to actually look in the mirror and realize that we do it only with much more at stake. Gentlemen, pull the blindfold off. Step into the reality of the life that you have created through your choices. As difficult as I know that this can be to face, it is the only way to progress. Next, accept responsibility. How easy is it to say it's somebody else's fault? How easy is it to blame our wife for the marital problems? How easy is it for us to blame a vendor for not getting the product out on time? How easy is it to blame the economy for our lack of financial resources? Men, we live in a time where relatively few people are actually willing to accept any measure of responsibility in their lives. Quite honestly, it's pathetic. Men accept responsibility. That's exactly what we do. I know that burden can be heavy to bear, but welcome to manhood. And keep in mind that accepting responsibility for something does not mean that you're accepting blame. It only means that you recognize that something isn't quite right and you are willing to shoulder that weight and say, I will make this right. And the last thing I wanted to talk with you about point number six today is this idea of accountability. It's a buzzword. It gets tossed around all the time. And I want to talk with you about what it actually means. And I want to share with you that there's actually two levels of accountability. Number one, being accountable to others. This is the foundational element, I believe, of accountability. I'm going to be accountable to a boss or my coach or my wife, et cetera. And there's nothing wrong with being able to be accountable to others. But there's a higher level of accountability, and that is the idea of being accountable to yourself. This is the higher tier of accountability. This is about being a man of your word. This is about taking initiative and understanding that you should be holding yourself to the highest standard, that you don't need anybody else to keep your feet to the fire and that you can do it for yourself. Both tiers of accountability are important, but we ought to be continually striving for that higher level, that higher tier of accountability to ourselves. Gentlemen, self governance is a critical component on this path to masculinity. I've given you six of the 12 principles, the individual sovereignty today, but make sure you tune in next week. Subscribe if you need to for the remaining six. The first six again are no one owes you a thing. Everything in life is a choice. Focus only on what you can control. Operate in reality, accept responsibility, and be accountable to yourself. Until next week, gentlemen, make sure you check out our exclusive mastermind where we're teaching these principles and a ton more. You're going to get the tools, the resources, the guidance, the direction, and that first tier of accountability to others to the other 200 plus men already part of this brotherhood. And you can do that, and you can join this brotherhood at order of man.com slash iron council. Until next week, remember and implement the ideas of individual sovereignty I shared with you today. Take action and become the man you were meant to be. Thank you for listening to the Order of Man podcast. You're ready to take charge of your life and be more of the man you were meant to be. We invite you to join the Order at order of man.com."
