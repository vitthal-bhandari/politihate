    "text": " Today, pro-abortion advocates get violent over the weekend and the White House softly scolds the radicals and new details about the Hunter Biden laptop emerge. We've got all that and more coming up, but it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. Happy Monday. I am Sarah Gonzalez. Today joined by the one and only chat host of the chat. There's a lot of funny God. I don't know what we would do with you. I don't know what we would do with two of you. And then also joined by Blasey the contributor, John Doyle, also host of Heck Off-Cami. I'm expendable. There's this million just like me. That's true at all. Absolutely not true. These are two gentlemen that we definitely I don't know what we would do if they were cloned. I think we would be in trouble. We need more John Doyle's. It'd be a very smart but silent place. Like John says, John only talks. You see, I'm trying to like always say less than you know. That's a new philosophy for me. Just try to say less than you. See, John knows a lot. He says exactly the exact right things in the right amount. It's true. It is a quantity of the content. John's good at that. And he does not care who he affects. And I never say anything I shouldn't say. You know, I was corresponding with your producer this morning. And I said, she mentioned that I'm going to be corresponding with a new producer. And I said, I'm so bad at goodbyes. And they said something like, oh yeah, I'm really going to miss hearing you like being OJ apologies on the show. That is funny. I'll have to give her a high five after the show. All right. So, let's talk about- Nothing's happening in the world today. No, no, no, no, no, no. Not a bunch of protesters, a bunch of pro-abortion protesters lining the streets outside the homes of Supreme Court justices to protest their right to protest for their right to kill babies, which they say is some sort of constitutional right. I have yet to find it in the Constitution. But I don't know. The document's very old. It's very dusty. Who knows what's in there that we don't know about? But let's look at a clip that we have here of the protesters outside of Brett Kavanaugh's home over the weekend. We will not go back. We will not go back. We will not go back. I don't know what they're- We will not go back to what? I'm not sure. I think these people are acting like we are actually in the Handmaid's Tale. They're not going to be allowed to take birth control or anything like that. But these protests actually, they were not just protests. There were actually also some violence, some vandalism that took place over the weekend. A pro-life group in Wisconsin called Family Action was vandalized and hit with Molotov cocktails over the weekend. We have a tweet from here's Wisconsin reporter, Alexander Schur, that shows graffiti reading. If abortions aren't safe, then you aren't either. There was more graffiti that included the anarchy symbol. And of course, the building was also set on fire. By the way, the response from the left, regarding this one, left-wing reporter Carolyn Caroline Riley tweeted more of this. May these people, I assume she means conservatives, never know a moment of peace or safety until they rot in the ground. Shockingly, she also deleted that tweet shortly thereafter. She never deleted her entire Twitter account. Oh. She got an answer as of this taping. Nuked the whole account. That did not go the route. It rarely goes the route. You think it's going to go with the results you're expecting. Well, when you're on the left, look, you got to give them a break. They don't have every man of brain cells to work with. So. I've done giving them a break. Honestly, I'm this whole thing. So if you watch CNN or MSNBC over the weekend, you know, their rhetoric is these. This is Christian extremism. This is what you have to do. And while showing pictures of protesters, leftist protesters, pro abortion protesters out in front of the Supreme Court and in the streets of Washington, D.C. and then out and around. I mean, they showed a six-panel thing on CNN. And then they said, it's religious pro-choice people. Religious pro-choice groups are being targeted by extreme right-wing terrorists. Y'all are the ones in the street. You're the ones chanting. You're the ones walking around half naked tearing up baby dolls and screaming, you know, suck this bastard out of my body. I don't quite see the correlation, but they're going to keep spoon feeding the general public this problem to try to make a narrative. And they were even saying, you know, we see these people in the streets. This is reminiscent of January 6th. How's it reminiscent of January 6th? Those are supposed conservatives, right? Now, you have leftist protesters out there and you're comparing them to people on January 6th. You pull the string on that and the narrative falls apart pretty damn quick. Yeah, you know, it is interesting too, because, you know, you mentioned that they keep talking about January 6th and how it was so horrible. Everyone should be jailed, I guess, forever if you ask the left. But, you know, you have these people who are surrounding. It wasn't just Kavanaugh's house. It was Chief Justice Roberts as well, which is interesting to me because I'm like, that guy is basically on your side for everything. So it probably doesn't make much sense to surround his house. But, you know, they're out in the streets. There's a part of the US code. I mean, it's supposed to be a felony to try to intimidate judges, to show up at their homes, to do it right, to do any of these things that they seem to be doing. And they're getting off scott-free. I don't see any police officers coming, arresting them, doing all these things that were told is blatantly against the law. But we're still supposed to be screaming about a bunch of grandma's running into the Capitol, waving their American flags. Yeah, because the rules don't apply to us. I know they don't apply to them. They apply to us and they also like invent and play with the semantics to get us in a lot of trouble for doing things that like, again, grandma's occupying the Capitol. We now have legitimate political prisoners in Washington, D.C. But these people can act however they would like with complete impunity because they're in control of the institutions and the narratives. And I think conservatives need to understand that we're kind of playing with an outdated rulebook. Like, we still think that we can all come together and agree to disagree. And it's like, if you acknowledge that what this is, is evil, which is literally people melting down at just the prospect that they're not going to be able to kill children when they would like to, then you know that evil is like fire, right? Like, you have to suppress it or else it's going to spread. You can ignore it, but then it's just going to spread. You really have to be proactive in suppressing it. And that's what these people do with us. They think that we're evil because we don't want them to be able to kill babies and basically like destroy the entire country. And you can even trace this back ideologically to, I think, the Frankfurt School, which is all the Marxists over in Germany. And one of their like leading intellectuals, quote unquote, was this guy Herbert Marquise. And he had this principle that he called repressive tolerance, which is literally the idea that we can be tolerance on our side, but anything that threatens our side and its progression, we have to repress because that seeks to undo our progress, which would be intolerant. So that's bad. So literally, that is their like smart people way of saying like, when we do it, it's okay. But when you guys do it, it's not okay. So we now have to decide that given that those are the rules, we have this like prisoner's dilemma where it's like, okay, maybe we should start like, you know, deploying our DOJ if we ever take it back to go target these people the same way that they've done to us because otherwise it's just going to get worse until like she said, we're all in the ground, which they would love by the way, they would love to see that mass execution. And then the next night you'd have people like, who's the guy? Stephen Colbert making like little unfunny jokes about it on his talk show. And everyone would be clapping like seals at the idea of like patriots being executed in mass, which is what they didn't in Russia. Well, like this Riley chick, I mean, she can't even keep her Twitter up. I don't think she's really defending her place. I don't think that little fantasy world is going to go the way they dream it's going to go. Again, to your point John, I mean, we play quote unquote nice, right? We're not throwing Molotov cocktails. We're not spray painting the buildings. We're not burning our cities of the ground. We're not storming into federal buildings. I mean, even by that says January 6th, I always say October 14th. I mean, there's all these things people want to keep talking about it. Listen, they're breaking the law. It's you're trying to coerce with threats of violence and these kinds of things. The White House is basically silent on all of this stuff. Jen putt Socky comes out talking about, well, we don't want violence and we don't want vandalism and we don't all this kind of stuff. But you're not condemning it. You're actually condoning it. Yeah, I mean, Samuel O'Lito had to be moved to an undisclosed location. That's how serious they take the threats against him. What how much culpability do you think that John Roberts has at this point for not releasing the opinion? I mean, we talked to Josh Hammer last week and Josh was like, I really think they have no choice but to just finish it, be done with it and release the opinion just so that we cannot have this this back and forth. Well, all you have to do I think is trust me, Josh Hammer is always right. So just give a much sad episode. He'll pull some obscure thing from 1895, some precedent case, you know, a lot of times when he's talking, I'm like, nodding like I understand what he's saying. Nobody knows what Josh Hammer said. But it's very smart. The, what was that going to say? Oh, yeah. Just look at the fact that they haven't released a name of who released the memo, right? They haven't done anything. And then a single Democrat has come out and condemned it. Yeah, and they're not going to, they're not any calls for justice in that regard. So, you know, I like what Clarence Thomas said, I think today where he said, or at least over the weekend where he said, we're not going to be bullied into this. You know, that's that's not how we operate. We're not going to be bullied into this. So I like to see, you know, the the intestinal fortitude at least of a, of a, you know, a jurist like Clarence Thomas who says, we're not going to be, you're not going to change who we are. This is, you know, this is a hill worth dying on. You know, if you don't, in life, if you don't have something that you know you'll die for, then is your life really worth living? You know, when you talk about, and I try to clarify on my show, I say there are people who have had abortions. I get that. People have made choices whether you're okay with that choice, whether you're living in some form of guilt or shame. I'm not, I'm not trying to come out and condemn you when we condemn abortion, we're not coming out trying to condemn you, shame you or anything like that. That's the difference between a true legitimate conservative standpoint. It's one of compassion. It's one of grace. What we're after is an agenda. We're after a narrative that says this is a, this is a clump of cells. This is a protoplasmic blob. This is a fetus. This is an it not a he or a she. You know, this is something worthy of dismemberment and have its brain sucked down. You don't believe that. You truly don't believe that. I don't care. Well, how much you argue and embrace that narrative and listen, I can get on TikTok and I can go through reels for hours and watch people pop sense. It's just clumps of cells, right? It's just, but you can. I can watch somebody get an appendectomy. I can watch somebody get their gallbladder removed. I can go watch them do lasic surgery on an eyeball. I can watch all of this stuff on YouTube. You can't go watching abortion. You can't, they don't put that out there. That's not on television. You can't just go out there and watch that. You know why? Because you know it's infanticide. You know it's genocide. You know it's murder. You know it is and you do not want the general public seeing that on a mass wide scale. You know it. You know it. That's what I'm talking about. The people who look at that barbaric activity and say, yeah, this is where we need to pursue. When they say, we won't go back. Go back to what? Monogamy? Responsibility? I mean, what are you not going back to? Right. Yeah. Well, that's a great point. And also, I mean, Roe versus Wade has been, what they would say is a constitutional right, which we know is not actually a constitutional right, but it's been at least case precedent for almost 50 years now. Where have all the riots and the Molotov cocktails been this whole whole entire time? Yeah, it's been this way for a while. I haven't seen us. Like you might have a religious, you know, pro life advocate go out and like hold a sign or whatever in front of an abortion clinic. It's about it. Haven't there been a few cases of like people bombing Planned Parenthood's? Yes, but I can't recall the last time that. I mean, it's been a while. There's been some violence. There's been some things like that. There's been some shooting years. Absolutely. But what I'm saying is as a whole. It's not because yeah, we just don't do that. That's not a personality. That's not that's not art. That's not we don't. The entire Republican party doesn't identify with that. No group is ever painted on a wall of a Planned Parenthood that I know of that says this is going to happen to all of you. Yeah. Right. Like what we just showed. Yeah. I mean, it's like, as like saying like Westboro Baptist has also done and said some horrible things and they would call themselves Christians, but like that doesn't mean that they get to speak for all of us. Yeah. It's funny, because what he mentioned there with these people or people in general nowadays lack any conviction and like things they will die for. Like people don't have that conversation with themselves. Like what's something that like I would be willing to die for? Nowadays, people just don't have that. They're like, what do you mean? Like I have all these Marvel movies I want to watch and like I have all this Netflix I want to watch. Like they only can like conceptualize life as like a checklist of like all these things I want to do. But it's interesting because the people who have this attitude of like, I can't have a baby right now. I'm going to kill it because I'm focused on me. These are the least interesting people you'll ever meet. And you're like they basically just sit inside all day and like just watch degenerate media and use drugs and they're just like the most just depressing people you'll ever meet. Like they're not going to the Colosseum. They're not composing symphonies or doing anything interesting. So it's just like, oh, I want to kill the kid almost to like get off probably is like this weird sort of very ritual. But yeah, and you know, you look at like the way we behave typically you'll have like Catholics praying a rosary outside of their church defending it from these people who are like trying to steal property from within the church. And it's just I think it's really telling when you look at how we behave towards an issue that we know is wrong and how they behave towards an issue that they pretend isn't wrong. Yeah. All right. So when we get back, let's I want to play a couple of the protests that were happening in churches, in and outside of churches, yesterday of course on Mother's Day, first we want to thank our sponsor Keeps. So did you know that two out of three guys experience hair loss before their 35? Yes, it's not your fault.

So I want to play a couple more clips or at least this one because, you know, we're talking about the the pro abortion position, which you realize they've started calling it anti abortion advocates, which I think they think is some sort of slam. I'm like, yeah, sure, that's okay. That's accurate. I am very much anti abortion. But these pro abortion advocates versus the pro life movement and just how different I would say like their their personalities are. And I want to play for you this psychotic person. It appears to be a woman outside a church in New York City where she was protesting in front of pro lifers who were simply praying watch. Okay, that's we've heard enough man. Cardi B has really let herself go. I want to play. So you saw the way that the the left treats this. I want to play for you just at the clip where you can really just see the contrast between this pro life group praying. And then of course the insane leftist who are just screaming and swearing if we have that clip as well. The rosaries. Yeah, I. These are some people calling for the sex strike because I'm all in. Oh, no, they really are. It's like, yeah, I don't think you're you're better. I don't think this is going to do what you think it is. I don't know what to do. You swipe left or whatever. But I'm out like, I don't want any of that. And I caught a lot of crap over the weekend for you know, your body shaming these people who are calling them. No, I'm just shaming them. They should be ashamed. They should be ashamed of everything. Like, you should really you. This is I don't want to have nobody wants to have sex. But you you already weren't having sex. So you're not you're just calling it a strike. It's nobody wants to do it with you. Anyway, right, which is okay because we know what happens. You don't take responsibility. You wind up getting pregnant. You go get an abortion. So we appreciate the sentiment of just abstaining. So I go ahead, John. I was gonna say, I think that's a great idea. It's any young leftist women watching. If you really want to like make men mad, stop having sex with them before marriage. Be like, Oh, yeah, you want all that commitment. You're not going to let me kill the baby. I'm not having sex until we're married. Take it further. Be like, Oh, Democrats are not going to fight for me. I'm just going to stop voting. Show you how much we can go more. It's a good. Yeah, you can be like, Oh, you know, fine. No abortion. Well, then you know what? I'm going to just stop taking birth control too. And I'm going to show you and you know, we can slowly fix these women over the course of various strikes. But that one black woman was possessed by a demon. Yeah. And I've noticed that the crazier Christians are just the ones who actually like read their Bible more because I remember I used to think like, Oh, these people are crazy. And I read the Bible. I was like, Oh, there it is. And it's like the same way that like a woman will occupy a house and turn it into a home because that's like an environment that's more comfortable for her. A demon that occupies somebody will make it ugly because that's the environment that's more comfortable for it. And you look at these people, they're all very ugly. And it's not like, you know, they're just not the nicest looking flower in the prayer or whatever. It's like they tried to make themselves ugly like they're dressed that way. They've got these weird, you know, hair things and jewelry and piercings. And she's like flailing around like that woman is possessed by a demon. And I am so proud to be a Catholic. And you see these guys totally stoic there. I think the Anglican church in the 1930s was the first denomination to capitulate with birth control. And then after Griswold versus Connecticut, which of course is the precedent upon which Roe v. Wade is built after that was passed in I think 63 or 65, all the other Protestants and nominations one by one capitulated on birth control. Except Catholics. Catholics are really liberal because we're bad at reading our Bibles. However, the church at least hasn't capitulated yet. So I'm very proud. Well, I want to get back to something that you said, Chad, that I think is just really sums it all up is that, you know, there you should have a little bit of shame if you are or a lot of shame if you are one of us. But I think that that's where the conversation has moved so greatly is because you used to, I mean, Roe v. Wade was supposed to be, it was the whole idea was safe, legal and rare. And it wasn't something that you were supposed to. It wasn't like a contest of who could get the most abortions. It wasn't something that you're supposed to be proud of. And now you've got this entire generation of women who really think it's like, it gives them bragging rights that they should be proud of it, that it should be celebrated. I want to play an MSNBC guest who was on over the weekend, I believe. This is Lori Kilmartin who, again, this is just, it's bizarre. It's not even that they just want the right to do it in private, knowing that it's a horrible thing and a horrible decision to have to make. This woman is like, yeah, I want to make sweet love to whoever leaked this document and then abort the kid. Watch thing. Here's my feeling about the leaker. I I would like to find out who the leaker is. So I could make sweet love to that person because that person is a hero to me. Okay. And if the leaker, a lot of people are saying it could be a conservative if the leaker is a Republican. And if I get pregnant during our lovemaking, I will joyfully abort our fetus. I don't, it says, it's said that she's a comedian, but I didn't, that wasn't funny. Well, I mean, I'm the leaker. Chad. I mean, sweet love to me. Now, the point is, the point is, I don't think this woman knows what making sweet love is, first of all, I mean, this is their entire personality, to John's point, loving your own babies. When you operate with, unless she was the phrase, a demonic mindset. And that's exactly what it is, right? It diverges from order. It diverges from peace. It diverges from anything rational. It gravitates towards chaos and entropy, right? Everything just kind of starts to fall apart. That's why, and I'll get, I'll get theological with you for a second. So that's why, you know, you read your New Testament that continually talks about Jesus instituting a kingdom. That is a system of government, the kingdom of God. The kingdom brings an order to it. And that order by its blueprint brings peace. That's why Jesus was referred to by the prophet Isaiah as the prince of peace. That's a government title, bringing peace because he brings the right form of government. These people aren't operating with a governed mind. That's why it gravitates to chaos. It manifests itself in your, in your, in not only in the way you speak, the things you say, but your physical form. I mean, these people, again, this is a spiritual issue. People can deal with this on a legal issue, all they want to legislatively. But this is a moral issue. This is a spiritual issue. And you go back to the book of Ezekiel and we, we talked about, you know, the people of Israel who wanted to be like the nations around them and they sacrificed their babies on the arms, the fiery hot, hot arms of the, of the, the idle bale, or I'm sorry, mama, mawak. And, you know, they burn their children to a crisp as a sacrifice to this false God. That's what's happening here. Not only culturally, but spiritually in America. And I call it the cry of the blood of the innocence, right? And you can rest assured, even as the prophet Ezekiel says, you know, the children, which were my inheritance is what God said. You have sacrificed to an idol and I have heard their cries. And this is what we cannot continue this type of chaos and spiritually thumbing our nose at order that God has established. I mean, the fact that you would sacrifice your own baby, an unborn, innocent child in this manner speaks to this volumes. In fact, this is, we become a nation under judgment. I don't like this. I sound doomsday-ish, but yeah, this is exactly what we become. Yeah. John, I want to, I want to bring this up before we go to break the White House. We chat alluded to it earlier. The White House released a, I found it to be a very like soft statement from Joe Biden. By the way, this was just this afternoon because when the White House was asked Friday about all of these leaking the Supreme Court justices, addresses and the planned protests, Jen Psaki stood there and said the White House does not have an official position on where people choose to operate and use their First Amendment rights. Now, since the weekend has transpired and they sat back and let that happen, they have said President Biden strongly condemns this attack and political violence of any stripe. The president has made clear throughout his time in public life that Americans have the fundamental right to express themselves under the Constitution, whatever their point of view, but that expression must be peaceful and free of violence, vandalism, or attempts to intimidate and Jen Psaki followed that up with a tweet that Biden strongly believes in the constitutional right to protest, but that should never include violence threats or vandalism. I didn't see anything about like not standing outside Supreme Court justices' houses. Yeah, I mean, they're just saying that to save face, but of course, actions speak louder than words. And if they wanted to stop this, they could. They could ping cell phones. We have footage. They could have arrested any of the people who were rioting over the summer in 2020, but they didn't. But then again, we have grandmas going into the Capitol and we've made like hundreds of arrests. They had billboards in every state in the country saying information on the one, six people contact this number. They actually use their effort to go after those people because they were politically dissident. These people, they can't be seen being the ones with the blood on their hands. And so they have these people being their paramilitary wing, Antifa, Black Lives Matter, these pro-abortion people. They're the ones who do this for them so that they don't have to. And they can say, oh, we don't condone this. By not enforcing the laws and maintaining order, you are in effect condoning this. And I really, I don't think it can be overstated how much all of this is a consequence of just like miserable women. Because in my, no, seriously, in my opinion, like the most beautiful thing in the world is like a feminine woman who was allowed to be in touch with her femininity. I think these women are miserable because we have so many weak men that have made it so they have to occupy this like in draging a state where they're not allowed to flourish. And women, because they're crazy will like literally go as far as to kill their own baby just out of spite for their fathers who have failed them or for the men in society who are supposed to be strong leaders or strong husbands who have also failed them. If every woman was coming home not to leftover pizza and cats but to Chad Prather, we would have, it's literally a fact they would not be going outside killing their babies. They would be fulfilled. They'd be wearing dresses. They'd be going to the gym. They'd be in shape. But we don't, we have too many Brian Stelters and I don't have Chad Prathers. That's the problem. Yeah, I told you we need more John Deuels in the world. Yeah. All right. All right. All right. Just go with it. We've got to take a quick break first. We want to thank new sponsor of the show.

We would be remiss if we didn't talk about Hunter Biden and what is going on with his laptop saga. What was this? This is the shop owner who got the laptop in. His name is John Mack Isaac. He is publishing a book about the night he met Hunter Biden, which quite frankly, after reading this, this is an exclusive over at the New York Post that you can go read. Quite frankly, after reading this, I read this whole article and I was just like, when can I buy this book? How do you write a book about somebody dropping their computer off at the shop? How can you make a book out of that? It's funny that you ask that because he talked about Hunter when he came in right before closing time. He smelled like alcohol. He was like, this is actually like a fear and loathing in Las Vegas. Like some big acid trip. Turn it into a movie too, please. I would totally watch that movie. He said he looked older than me but had a surprisingly high pitched voice, which I loved. An air of entitlement radiated off of him. He came in and kind of stumbled and drunk as the idea and said he brought in three laptops and said, I need the data recovered off of these but they all have liquid damage and won't turn on. Turns out, of course, it was Hunter. Whenever the guy, the shop owner asked him for his last name, he acted kind of miffed that like, oh, you don't know who I am. He said Biden. So he asked for permission for the password and look, I'm sure I can't say it on this program but it's just a very messed up password. Really, you're saying if that password and it's anal F69, you get the point of what it is. I mean, if that were, I mean, no one would guess that I junior. Yes. It would be everywhere. Yes. Thank you. Yes. I mean, Donald Trump at 3 a.m. tweeted Cuffife. I mean, whatever that is, it's all we're still talking about it. Can you imagine if Donald Trump Jr. goes in there, turns in a laptop and his anal blank. No, 69. That would be wall to wall coverage for years. So not to mention just that password but the pictures of him in the weird, like, underwear pictures. Yeah. The pictures of him with drug paraphernalia, the weird income documents that he had that was like all of the years of his earnings. That's where that's what matters. He's doing freaky, dinky stuff. Not if he's doing pedophilia and stuff like that. I don't know. But that's another story. But I said a long time ago, you said what you want about Hunter Biden, he knows how to party. But this stuff, when it starts talking about 10% to the big guy and things like that, that's what that's what we got to get to the needy greedy. Well, I mean, do you remember when they tried to attack the Trump's for their, what was it, for their nonprofit? Yeah. And that was supposed to be a giant scandal that they were misusing funds from their nonprofit. And how much money Ivanka made in her business, her clothing business, you know, which they don't talk about. The fact that she's set all that aside in order to work at the White House. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, everything was supposed to be a scandal when it came to the Trump family. Now you have an actual scandal and you have this guy who turned everything over to the FBI. Thank God that he saved copies and gave them to other people. He's like, I thought these were really messed up. So I turned them over and still we don't hear about any of it, except from the New York Post, who by the way gets like de-platformed off of social media for showing it. Hunter had to be hammered to get the laptop. Right. You didn't go back and pick him up. Oh, you, you have to know he didn't remember going there. No, he doesn't have a clue. Yeah. Well, I mean, he does now, but like, oh crap. It should have thought of that place. I mean, I woke up on the couch this morning. Don't really remember how I got there. Much less what I did with my computer. That's just a key. Yeah, that's not all the things that Hunter was mixed up in. I'm just tired of being hated in my own country, you know. What do you mean? What do you mean? Like the double standard. That's not just like, oh, we just got things confused. It's because they hate you. Like every time, whether it's stuff like this, where they have to manufacture like, oh, well, on anonymous source that Donald Trump had like a Russian hook or pee on him, that's wall to wall coverage. Literally, actually things that are worse than that within the Biden family. I mean, this kid will not kid. His son exists as basically a way to facilitate bribery. And then he's also doing very degenerate things that we couldn't even probably discuss at length on this show. And it's like, they literally suppress the story. They said actively that's fake news. That's not true. And then the retraction always gets like five tweets. But you know, the initial coverage gets like, you know, a million tweets. And it's like, or even you'll see videos of like, every day, youths in major cities ransacking stores, but a couple white grandmas go into the Capitol. And it's like, they call it, they compare it to 9 11 1 6. And they're terrorists. They're on watch lists. They're being arrested. And it's like, you can't at a certain point, you have to stop thinking like, oh, they're just the government so incompetent they can't get anything right. You're making a perfect point though. I mean, you see this is coercion. This is intimidation tactics. If the federal government won't do something to protect Supreme Court justices, they're sure it's not going to do anything for us. They don't love us. They don't care about us. They're not here to protect us. You know, how many people are walking around with an ankle bracelet on them because they happen to be in Washington, D.C. within a quarter mile of the Capitol steps on January 6th. In political prisoners in Washington, D.C. they haven't been indicted for anything. There's no charges that have been brought. You know, why aren't we discussing? You can denish decisions got the whole 2000 mules movie that's come out. Why aren't we discussing these things? Why can't we discuss these things? We're not allowed to talk about them. Yeah. All right. We've got to we've got more to come, but let's try take a quick break. We'll be right back. Walt Disney, the Walt Disney Company, has repeatedly donated to an organization that infiltrates public and private schools with LGBT ideology. This is according to Disney's Pride collection webpage. They announced that they donated a portion of its 2022 Pride collection funds to the organization GLSEN, this is GLSEN among other global LGBT organizations. In 2020, they announced that it would donate a hundred thousand dollars to GLSEN. And apparently, Disney's 2022 funds will reportedly create new LGBT oriented programming. So their Disney's Pride page actually dubbed GLSEN a leader in quote, educational equity, end quote, and stated that the organizations have collaborated together for more than 20 years. This is the organization, same organization that is crafting, you know, political activism, LGBT activism into K through 12 curriculum. They craft school policy guides, they craft teacher training for schools nationwide. This is not what you would call a great organization to trust with your children. And here we are. This is the the staple, the the American staple for where you take your children on vacations. And they are, I mean, way more infiltrated than people thought, I think into this particular activism. Mickey is a freak. We know this. They are. They're very deep in it. And listen, we just keep, you keep giving them enough for up. I said on this show four years ago, when I first started at the blade, I said, it's a house of cards that give it enough time. It will fall in on itself because it's built on a bad fault line. It's structurally these things are, you keep pushing that pendulum that far. I'm telling you, it's going to come back. It's going to bite you. And that's what they're starting to see. These things, you know, we're just seeing a little bit, we're just seeing tip of the iceberg stuff right now. It's it's going to come. I'm telling you, when it flows out, history is not going to be kind to these people. Lord, I hope so. John. Well, yes, I was just going to say that, you know, wow, John's choosing his words carefully. Good. Steak houses don't have to advertise. Right. Everyone just knows this is good. They don't have to dress it up. When you get away from all the rainbows and parades and dancing and fun, you really just have to ask yourself why people whose entire identity is centered around anal sex and genital mutilation want to spend so much time with your kids. You know, straight people create more straight people by having sex. Gay people create more gay people by grooming children. That's just the way it works. You know, you've had millions of dollars over the course of the last 50 years poured into grants and research, trying to find what they call the gauging. They've never found it. You can get into some biological arguments with like prenatal hormone exposure, like kids who have, you know, a disproportionate amount of estrogen if they're boys, for example, are more likely to become gay or sexually deviant, but ultimately it literally is impossible for it to manifest without some sort of environmental influence, which is typically some form of trauma or grooming. That's what this is about, like literally grooming your children, which is going to lead to a life of despair. And the way this entire system works is by creating this victimhood narrative where you're not allowed to question anybody's amount of despair. Oh, you've had it so hard because you're black. You've had it so hard because you're an immigrant or whatever. So it's like, if you can get kids to become a part of that, then for the rest of their life, they're going to vote for your support, whatever you're doing, because your entire thing is we're going to get those mean conservatives because they're the reason you're depressed. And so yeah, it's evil. Well, it's interesting because they keep doing this. We keep seeing the left double down on all of this gender ideology and, you know, critical race theory, all of these things that parents are unanimously striking down. We just saw here in Texas, candidates running on opposition to this type of ideology, critical race theory, gender fluidity, social emotional learning. They all dominated school board elections in DFW races. By the way, shout out to Patriot Mobile. They donated $500,000 to a pro-parent pack that was able to help these particular candidates win these races. And Tarrant County, this includes Fort Worth and has a population of over 2 million conservative candidates won at least 10 of the 11 open seats. And Tarrant County is about 30% Hispanic, and it did in 2020 tip for President Biden. So these are seats that we are flipping because the left is going all in. In Tarrant County, also for the first time in its history in 2018, went blue for a rock over Cruz. So that trend happened in 18 and 20. And now maybe we're seeing this flip back. That's home for me. It'll be interesting to see what they do for the governor's race, then. With O'Rourke being on the ticket, because he has been very, I mean, you saw him with the don't mess with trans kids t-shirt on. I mean, he is going all in on all this stuff too. Well, they all are. I mean, this is a thing that's a frightening deal that, you know, there's a TikTok video that's out there right now, the fifth grade teacher who says, all my kids after they leave my class, they all come back to me and they're all queer now, because I'm queer. This is her words. She said, you know, we play this game, you know, pick out which character is gay and all this kind of stuff. I'm like, why are you, you've got eight-year-olds, nine-year-olds in your classroom. You know, if you're doing math word problems, you don't have to talk about Gretchen and her girlfriend Amanda and what time the train gets into the station. I mean, that's not education. But right now, they're pushing for what they're calling, you know, all-encompassing sex education or, you know, that means they're going to put sex education in math class and science class and in reading class and everything. They're disguising it under behavioral health or mental health, whatever. This is where we're at. So what John's saying is he's absolutely right. This is grooming. They're creating a culture of oppression and we've got to go after the bad guy who's kept you down for so long. The Democrats have been playing this thing for a long time. They did it with the black community. Now they're doing it with a, you know, hyper-sexualizing with children and growing the next generation. They're playing a long game on this regard. So I hope, Taryn County, I hope that does flip back around. We'll see because it is happening, folks. You could say, nah, it happened. It's happening. It's happening. It's happening. I don't, the parents so far not willing to tolerate it. John Mossword. Yeah. And I'm really worried about whether or not we're going to capitalize on this momentum too because people just aren't having children as much. So like 10, 15 years from now, if we try to run this back, it's like that same sort of like mama bear energy is just going to be dissipated. So we need to capitalize on it and double down on like Hispanics too. Like we've been trying to win the Hispanic vote by like appealing to immigration, whatever. You want to win the Hispanic vote. These people are like comically homophobic. Like that's the way to do it. They do not like all of this stuff. So if you start broadcasting like videos like that, that TikTok in their neighborhood, they're pro-life, but they're also very homophobic. And like they would turn out, I was going to do an impression, but I won't. But it's like this is just, this is an important issue. And we can use black people too. You know, every weekend in my childhood, I was in the black churches in Detroit, working on their instruments with my dad. And he would always talk politics with the pastors. And he would, you know, so what do you think about all the Trump stuff? And they'd give, you know, a very sort of basic answer about like left-wing economics, helping the community stuff. And he'd be like, well, what do you think about all the GBLT key stuff? This is a quote. The guy would just go, oh, you mean a queers? Like they just do not have tolerance for that. That's why I keep saying all your pronoun issues and your gender stuff and all this kind of stuff. You keep opening the borders of, I promise you, you're going to see something you don't like in terms of inclusivity. Yeah. Yeah. They don't play that game. No, they do not. All right, we got to take a break. We'll do that. But they do want free everything. My daughters? No. We'll be soon. If you liked what you saw and you know you did, if you haven't yet gone over to where you get your audio podcasts, you got to go over there, subscribe, rate and review the news and why it matters. You know what? You got to direct people there. Make sure that they know that it is, you can hear the whole thing for free because you never know when you might have another episode like Fridays where we had to, like YouTube was censoring the entire first segment when we talked about the vaccines and we could only put it behind the paywall at Belize TV if you want to watch video, but then audio version on podcasts. So make sure that you subscribe and you may see a review read live on air like the one today from a politically homeless scientist who said wonderfully entertaining and relevant. I always enjoy this podcast because it is both informative and entertaining. I get a lot of satisfaction listening to this at work as a public high school teacher. There are still some of us not trying to indoctrinate your children. We appreciate you. Thank you for being in the lion's den and trying to save our children. We all, I think we all know that you guys exist and we appreciate you so much. Thank you for leaving your review and we'll see you guys tomorrow."
