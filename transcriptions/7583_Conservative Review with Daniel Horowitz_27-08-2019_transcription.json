    "text": " politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative true the conservative review with Daniel and welcome back fellow American Patriots to the conservative review podcast here at conservative reviews northern command we welcome everyone from conservative to moderate to even liberal because frankly those of you who think you're liberal you don't understand this ain't your grandfather's liberal movement it's not your grandfather's liberal Democrat Party I'm here to tell you today on this fine Tuesday August 27th that what we're confronted with as a nation by a very small fringe group of people that have taken over government law media entertainment foundations now really consuming some of the business elites they are part of what Mark Levin described a couple of years ago a de-civilization agenda it's not liberalism it's not even socialism per se it's a de-civilization agenda to de-rasinate to uproot to undo the basic building blocks of a civilization in addition to particularly a constitutional republic system of government built on top of that civil society and so the civilization before things get really busy again next week with the Congress critters back with the Supreme Court coming back it's important to reflect on where we are where we are as a nation where we are as conservatives why is it that the left is succeeding on winning 50 year cultural battles overnight without firing a single shot if you really look at this de-civilization agenda if you think about it there's a number of facets to it but the ones I want to focus on today and even then we're not gonna get to all of it but that we've been focusing on in recent days recent weeks so obviously you have the economic Marxism where government is judged during executioner over our economy they could redefine economics they could redistribute wealth they could at any whim just go in and distort the markets mandates regulations subsidies whatever they want but then there's more to it there's more to it than just Marxism there is the man is a woman a woman is a man redefine lineage redefine humanity redefine sexuality redefine national borders foreigners are citizens citizens are foreigners and strangers in their own country criminals are really victims let out all the criminals that's another facet of it and then on top of that is what we've been warning about for so many years probably more than anyone in the public sphere judicial supremacism see it's crazy enough to push a de-civilization agenda man is woman woman's man criminals victim a legal alien is citizen it's crazy enough to push that in the political branches of government where you actually have to stand for election you have a you have to get elected be you have to get reelected see you have to engage in a robust public debate where there's a democratic process to pass a piece of legislation and enacted but what the left has done is over the years they have brainwashed the public into this notion of judicial supremacy that we don't have three branches of government we really have one branch of government and it's not just the Supreme Court but any lower court that they pick to redefine the Constitution that's it and if the Supreme Court overturns it they'll just come back again a couple years later start the cycle again slightly different case slightly different tone and seek the same thing until they succeed again and again and again totally succeed remember Obergerfeld the gay marriage case where they redefined the building block of all civilization marriage that in itself for the first time ever in to my knowledge in Supreme Court history overturned a 9 to 0 case 1979 where they first sought to redefine it and it was unanimous not to do it but again they only have to win one time they get all that bats they could strike out but they could come back again for another at bat and constantly win it's a perfect system of heads they win tails they win and the beauty of it as we noted yesterday and by the way if you haven't heard yesterday show go to YouTube like our show episode 479 on how elections don't matter if we're gonna accord any judge the power of God greater power than God God himself doesn't take a guy with a male plumbing and call you know referred to the person as a female but the beauty of this agenda is that they get to do it through the unelected judges so here's the deal no one has ever heard of these cases they're quiet until they go to the Supreme Court and even then no one has ever heard of them until we try to enact legislation like all you can't do it the courts edits in the Constitution well what do you mean why is the court the sole and final final expositor of the of the Constitution well they're not but we've been brainwashed into thinking that and it's not true not true at all but it allows the left to quietly implement their agenda without transparency without a public debate without the legislative process and without standing for election so they don't even suffer the reprisal of implementing their agenda so again they have their de-civilization agenda and then they implement it through the unelected federal courts so with that I want to continue our discussion from yesterday because this case out of Idaho was more insane than I could ever imagine I didn't even realize it I was focused on Friday on the insane immigration ruling where they just ruled 8 130 year immigration laws unconstitutional you had this gender dysphoria case in Idaho where the Ninth Circuit on Friday mandated that the state castrate a prisoner and pay for it with taxpayer funding of course and that if you don't castrate the guy it's a violation of cruel and unusual punishment I didn't realize yesterday that this individual who was suing in court was convicted of child molestation molesting a 15 year old boy this is a 22 year old man yes he's a man and this guy is seeking to get government to pay to self-destruct himself self-immolate and you know right off the bat we have to ask ourselves folks have we been asleep at the wheel how have we allowed things to get this radical that blithefully and blissfully people that appear to be sane and lucid in politics and media could just refer to a man as a woman a woman as a man refer to literally I'm not exaggerating there's no hyperbole we're gonna see in this case cutting off someone's testicles or for a female their chest and mutilating and injecting them with all sorts of stuff putting doing his direct amies on males and I don't know adding penises to women I don't even know what that means and just refer to it as surgery surgery like something constructive how is it that the left has been able to get away with this de-civilization agenda and the answer is because even in the reddest of red states much less nationally at the 50-yard line in American politics we don't have a conservative party and by golly you don't even need to be conservative to believe that castrating so on is evil in moral illogical and needs to stop and we've allowed this to go on even conservatives use their language ljbe tank yao um transgender surgery like we use their language a lot of conservative publications I notice even use refer to a guy with a ging and anyang as a female and because we have social media and there's so much inculcating people's brains they can't think for a minute they can't they don't have any respite you know in the beginning of uh of uh of exodus believe it chapter five so when pharaoh was sensing some sort of rebellion in Egypt when Moses initiated the conversations with him to let out the Jews and he was scared that that Moses would spawn a full-scale rebellion so pharaoh said you know what I'm gonna increase their hard work that not only do they have to construct the bricks and the swamps and ramsies they now have to gather the raw materials in the straw to construct the bricks in the first place and in the purpose of that was he realized that you might be outnumbered you know let's say there were more Jews than Egyptians and they could easily rebel but if you shut their brain down by not giving them any respite of thought to the body mind soul emotions that's how you beat down a slave and they can't rebel and we've all become slaves to this system this immoral illogical gender bending system where we've allowed the left to do this and we just it's become normal if if I go up to you and I say I'm chopping off my arm would you say you're a an lgbc american a chopping american um government needs to pay medicaid needs to fund the removal of my arm or my leg surgery daniel wants surgery are you gonna deny daniel his surgery you know here this is what it is this is what the guy wants to do okay this is a razor this guy in idaho department of corrections um evidently tried to cut off his testicles a couple of times and maybe partially succeeded this adriene edmo and now a ninth circuit could just come along and say the constitution mandates that you must complete that for him so if i were to do this to my arm okay i think we would all recognize i would be mentally insane a danger to myself and others and it would be a no brainer that such a procedure unless my arm was gangrene or something god forbid it needed to be removed is such a medical procedure would be outlawed it would be against the law it would be a felony to commit such an act much less mandate that government officials must pay to have it done right how is it then when when somehow we extrapolate that to someone's penis or breast and i i just want to like make it very clear because i think we talk around the issue a little bit too much uh a transgender surgery no let's call a spade a spade somehow when you extrapolate it to that it's like no this is this is who uh surgery uh it's cruel and unusual punishment if you don't castrate the person how have we gotten to this point and the answer is because there is no check and balance on the left's behavior because we have a phony conservative movement and a phony republican party that depending on the issue either fails to push back against it or downright supports it to varying degrees and that's certainly the case with open borders and the pro criminal um agenda known as criminal justice reform but even with this stuff republicans are like oh i don't know i'm too scared i don't want to look like i'm too religious dude you don't have to be a religious conservative to appreciate that a man's a man and a woman is a woman and that cutting someone's breast or balls off or balls off is castration you know we have had in this country we have had at our founding a revolution over taxation without representation now a day is what we face is social transformation without representation meaning it's not just that the left is enacting a social transformation through elected representatives they're enacting it through the courts and the courts have no such power but i'd go a step farther now we're at the point where we have taxpayer-funded castration without representation that's what we have today and if we cannot call a spade a spade if we're gonna dance around this language then just go home i don't understand it these people don't live long nobody understands what's going to happen to these people when you do that to them my analogy is not even good because in arm and a leg it's it's important for mobility but it you know if you cut off a hand it doesn't systemically destroy the entire system of the body like destroying someone's male and female plumbing and the hormones to go with it that's what it is so we have this case where a judge could just say oh it's cruel and unusual punishment you know it's sad so you know the court ruled supreme court in 1976 is Estelvie Gamble that there could be a point where prisons violate criminal unusual punishment if they deny prisoners of basic medical care and the way they define that is denying care that such medical care is the denial of such medical care is so unconscionable as to fall below society's minimum standard of decency minimum standard of decency now we have judges telling us 43 years later that the minimum standard of decency in our society is offering to castrate people so the judge is ordering to cut his balls off i guess do everything else i don't know if that means adding a female version i don't know what that even means how that's done um and then adding a chest performing that type of stuff um but it involves you know in Wisconsin the case was a female who wanted to go you know go the other way and the judge mandated Medicaid funding that the state used Medicaid funding for i mean i looked at that case it included castration mastectomy is hysterectomies general general reconstruction and breast augmentation so there you go now obviously this garbage has been tried before in the courts earlier this year in the fifth circuit they left it out the first circuit a couple years ago they left it out but the ninth circuit gets to do this you know some of you might say well daniel look now that there's a circuit split it's going to go to the supreme court and as bed is roberts and some of these phony conservatives are on the supreme court there's no way they're going to go along with this and that might very very well be true but here's what you guys need to understand the left has first and goal at our end zone with an unlimited number of tries everything they do in the courts is a violation of history tradition and law and precedent and supreme court precedent they only need to win one time so they come back again and again again until they get it and a lot of these cases are allowing to percolate in society for so long that it creates this political momentum for what they're doing i don't understand why there is no effort on the part of conservatives to go on offense thankfully the governor there says we're not funding it but you know he kind of said more like they're appealing to the supreme court what i don't i don't i'm not opposed to that but it's like if let's say a judge says i want you to chop your head off are you going to say i'm going to appeal to the supreme court no there's got to be a point in time where we say no you don't have that power we have separation of powers you can't force a state to appropriate funding for something illogical immoral and dangerous under something that is transparently the most radical adulteration of a constitutional clause imaginable think about it cruel and unusual unusual means it's unusual what government is doing in this case they admit this would be the first time ever forcing a department of corrections to pay for castration for an inmate it has never been done and they're saying that if Idaho doesn't do it it will be cruel and unusual remember the um founders did not and the courts have said this a number of times the supreme court the eighth amendment doesn't ban anything that's cruel it has to be both in order to violate the constitution cruel and unusual so if there's something you might think is cruel but it's been in common practice for a while you know it's it's kind of social where we're like the frogs in the boiling water we don't jump out why our conservatives not pushing an agenda to go on offense and downright ban doctors from violating the Hippocratic oath and performing such mutilations i mean tell me if you have someone's arm someone is mentally ill and they say i want to chop my arm off okay and a doctor did that wouldn't he be a criminal shouldn't this be a criminal act by a factor of a hundred that's the question i want you to think about this how much we have devolved into a decadent society and again i don't think most people are like this it's a small elite that scares everyone into thinking that everyone believes that but they don't but i want you to think about this thought for a minute hmm ponder this juxtaposition in a number of states like New Jersey but there's many i don't have the list off hand it is now states have banned what's called gay conversion therapy now what is taking place is nothing physical right the guy's not touching the person it's merely therapy psychology just counseling it's counseling of someone who is a legitimate male and you know over having the normal male attractions as opposed to the opposite that is banned yeah we are told that somehow not only can you but you must take a male and physically cut his balls off because he says he's a female what they are in fact saying and this is kind of a deep thought that it's more natural for a man to be a woman than for a man to be a man because again for a man to have normal male sexuality you're telling me you are not allowed to take a guy who says he's gay whatever that even means and just engage in a you know counseling you can't can't do that can't do that but we are told you could go ahead and cut someone's balls off and say he's a woman because he's a woman so i'm allowed to do it and not only that courts can now mandate that Medicaid must fund it prisons must must fund it you know it's funny people often joke around you know not such a joke but half jokingly that child sex offender should be castrated well here's the irony here the case in i-do the guy was a child sex offender and now courts are saying you must castrate him so maybe maybe some good will come out of this after all but but that that's the irony if we were to say if we were to pass along say child sex offenders should be castrated right immediately all the courts you know every court would say it's cruel and unusual punishment right but yeah if you do it for this somehow it's cruel and unusual punishment not to do it what i'm trying to say is look at what we are willing to do to service the sexual licentious agenda and that's what it's all about because again if you cut off someone's shoulder knee hip everyone would say what i'm saying but somehow if you extrapolate it to a woman's chest or female and male plumbing between the legs somehow like no what do you mean Daniel you're a hateful person nothing stands before the sexual licentious agenda in society and that's the problem no one stands up to these people they're destroying our society and we don't take the fight to them it's out of control you know i was thinking recently where is this i saw a story this is talk about out of control this is from the dailywire.com this case happened in england single woman marries herself on 36th birthday to celebrate 36 years without marrying anyone a single woman in west Sussex england elected to throw a wedding themed birthday party where she cheekily married herself a single mom rang in her 36th birthday in an unusual fashion by wearing a wedding dress and tiara and celebrating making it all the way without marrying anyone i was thinking to myself recently what's to stop the left from doing this this is no less absurd than a court saying a man and a man is a marriage you know everyone focused again on oh Daniel stop judging people and like you know the bible and sin we're not talking about that that you know i have my beliefs you could have your beliefs it's fine we're talking about redefining unnatural law you could do whatever you want in your own but you can't mandate that a state must redefine marriage to something that's not a marriage and say it's in the constitution so the the question that this reminded me of the fact that see the courts will only push what the licentious agenda is doing they wait until it becomes popular not among majority of the people but among the elites and then that's when the courts come in so they could win the fight for them in the broad population without ever having to have it out in the legislature so i made this point in chapter three my book stolen sovereignty i said to strike down state marriage laws the court declared that marriage is no longer a special union between one man and one woman as such they had an obligation to explain to the country what a marriage is this is where they were a polynly silent this case is different from all other areas where the courts strike down state or federal statutes normally when the courts strike down a law they deem unlawful the law reverts back to what it was before the passage of the flawed law in their mind in this case nothing predated traditional marriage so to speak this leads to the question none of the proponents of redefining marriage from the bench could answer if marriage is no longer limited to one man and one woman why should it not include polyamory polygamy and incestuous relationships again were managed to be redefined through the political process these are the particular particular conditions that can be worked out but if courts are going to find an unalienable right to a homosexual marriage and state recognition thereof why do those rights not extend to the four-mentioned non-traditional relationships so long as they are consenting adults and by the way even that you know they're they're slowly sanitizing pedophilia too but that's a different story this was the question posed by justice elito to marry bonato the lawyer arguing the case on behalf of the same sex couple she had no legitimate answer checkmate in fact there are three reasons why the four-mentioned relationships should have a stronger case in their quest for marriage recognition then homosexual couples if we are to consider Anthony Kennedy's opinion the law of the land first from a natural law perspective polygamous polyamorous and incestuous marriages can result in procreation whether you like it or not and in the case of polygamy it is certainly more rooted in history than homosexual marriage while marriages in combat while marriage encompasses a lot more than simply having children procreation has been the hallmark of the institution since it's an inception because civilization could not perpetuate itself without it that is the defining characteristic differentiating a marriage from any other friendship or relationship moreover so much of Kennedy's ruling is rooted in his fabrication of new constitutional rights namely the right to quote dignity quote nobility protection against stigmas and the right to quote define and express their identity if Kennedy believes it is his responsibility and prerogative to bestow those new post-constitutional rights on perhaps the most powerful and trendy class of people in the country how much more so for a group that is still scorned stigmatized and denied their dignity to express their identity homosexual marriage is in vogue and glorified by hollywood whereas these other relationships are still heavily stigmatized don't they need an even greater degree of protection where is their right to love third what about the children of these relationships shouldn't we be concerned with removing this stigma from their children just like Kennedy was so concerned in regards to the stigma against adopted children of homosexual relationships again this is all from the text i'm taking these arguments all from the text of overgafell and unlike children of homosexual relationships which by definition are only adopted polygamist or incestuous relationships can produce biological children don't these biological children deserve at least as much protection against stigma as the adopted children of homosexuals again we're not making political and societal arguments here court should be concerned with legal arguments and it is simply indefensible to deny multiple partners three sums or tensums that dig in the oven marriage license imagine how well-rounded the children would be having the luxury of multiple caretakers picture middle-aged man who tragically loses his wife to cancer in her forties and views his daughter who is a spitting image of his late wife as his next soulmate to console him over the heartbreaking loss doesn't this scenario epitomize quote the highest ideals of love fidelity devotion sacrifice and family unquote Kennedy referenced at the conclusion of his illogical and tempestuous screed yet amazingly Kennedy blatantly limited his decision to two individuals in the most brazen act of legislating from the bench of all time restructuring the foundation of civilization this is a quote from the opinion the nature of marriage is that through its enduring bond two persons together can find other freedom such as expression intimacy and spirituality this is true for all persons whatever their sexual orientation there is dignity in the bond between two men or two women who seek to marry and in their autonomy to make such profound choices a second print in some of this court's jurisprudence is that the right to marry fundamental is fundamental because it supports a two-person union and then I go on to say as Chief Justice Roberts noted in his descent Kennedy's insertion of the adjective to into his edict redifying marriage marriages between two individuals of the same or opposite sex makes it clear that personal social preference now Trump Trump's legal consistency see if you say I have a right to love and anyone I love and want to marry a state has to recognize that it's indefensible not to do it in the case as I mentioned the only reason is is because it's all political but if it's political then let's have a political debate in a freaking legislature and not do it in a court that is why the gay marriage case in the court was so indefensible from an intellectual or legal standpoint irrespective of your views on morality and biblical values and whatever that's a totally separate thing you can't have social transformation with our representation yet now it's become so bad we have castration without representation the only question that remains here is if Republicans will actually finally push back you know it's funny how sanctuary cities are somehow able to thwart the immigration laws passed by the elected branch of the federal government related to its most foundational power over sovereignty of the union and no one no one does anything about it yet somehow when the unelected weakest branch of the federal government just destroys the states the states just give into it so we'll see what happens we might follow up and have a someone from the state legislator on in the Iowa Idaho state legislator to discuss this in the future in our remaining time I just want to move on to the next social transformation a legal is citizen citizens are strangers in our own country weak on crime laws there's so much on my docket I don't really have time but just real briefly um the city of d.c the d.c government city council is looking to now expand their jailbreak programs d.c. California many states have now created a new law whereby those convicted to life in prison without parole as juveniles now those are some really bad dudes because it takes a lot to get that these days you know straight up first degree murder probably not even so much rape um I don't even know how often that happens basically just first degree murder after 15 years they could reopen that sentence 15 or 20 years depending on the state the d.c. government is looking to now extend that to those convicted of crimes up until the age of 25 not just 18 so in other words and the washington post put this out the washington post didn't editorial against this republicans won't talk about it jared kushner is out there you might have seen the axe these article he said in front of a group of republican donors don't worry felons are voting republican yet even the washington post is railing against this and they noted that under d.c's proposal both the el Paso shooter and the d.e.t.n. guy would be out at the ages of 36 and 39 respectively after 15 years that even though you were sentenced to life in prison without parole but after 15 years we could reopen that and potentially let you go and yet republicans are all on board with this then if if the american people would only know this we could destroy the other side but we don't have another side that's the problem so there's a lot more on that front I want to get to um it's endless there's endless new cases that demonstrate these weekend crime laws republicans and jared joining along with it we're going to continue dogging this issue but real briefly as i've been recording this another story broke as we noted before Montgomery county maryland is a sanctuary county where they defy federal law and there are now four cases of alleged rape most of them child rape at the hands of salvador nationals in the jurisdiction and now it's breaking news that there is a fifth case kevin louis is the local abc news reporter he's been breaking all of these stories he is a rare gem in this industry of random journalists that recognizes that wait a minute Montgomery is a sanctuary if we have all these heinous criminals you know committing crimes often being released that's a big story we need to report on meaning it's not immaterial to the fact of the crime that the guy is an illegal alien because that means this is an avoidable crime and a lot of it is caused by its sanctuary status so this is a big story the problem is every other reporter i know of in these local areas they do everything they can to cover it up so if we had a kevin louis in every single area of the country we would have a different country because people would know about this they would know about the social transformation taking place and by the way there's no greater social transformation than importing a large group of people that have in their culture to have sex with children that young this is a very pervasive problem i'm just going to read to you from his twitter account just came out new nelson rayas midrano is accused of crawling into bed with a 16 year old german town maryland girl as she napped the 46 year old proceeded to rape the teen at knife knife point please say this is the fifth undocumented immigrant arrested on rape charges in montgomery county in last month more cops say rayas midrano grew impatient and placed the knife against the victim's neck he then ripped off the 16 year old's clothes what is a legend to have happened next is too troubling to publish you could look at the police report linked to in his twitter account um the victim told detective she was in pain during the entire assault more rayas midrano is married with 10 children six are under the age of 18 for the last three years he's worked at a bakery in p.g county maryland another sanctuary i says the accused raypis is alvedura national living the u.s. illegally it's lodged the detainer against him i obtained that same statement from isis spoke's woman in maryland folks i just want to before i read his last tweet this is yet another case in montgomery county where you have a married man with a bunch of children raping an underage girl in a previous case this um mandoza guy we were we uh reported on last week this guy was alleged to have attempted to rape a 12 year old girl while his wife was given birth birth to their first their giving birth to their fourth child had three children giving birth to another anchor baby think about this we are now stuck with the family members of child raypis thanks to the erroneous illogical and illegal notion of anchor baby birthray citizenship which is absolutely not true trump needs to pull the trigger on that we need to keep applying that pressure but i go on he noted that montgomery county police recorded 314 rape cases in 2016 an average of 26 a month moco does not collect data on criminal suspects immigration status so it's very challenging to decipher what percentage of r u s citizens legal residents or undocumented immigrants commit crimes and that that point is true of every jurisdiction we have no data so we're left it's left to people like us to really scrape for these cases but you wonder how common it is they will not report on it if you think illegals commit so few crimes you should you shouldn't be ashamed to report this right but there's another important thing montgomery county is another example of where jailbreak meets um meets uh sanctuary cities in other words the general week on crime mentality meets week on illegal immigration aside from the fact that they don't believe in sovereignty montgomery county is they don't believe in criminal justice they're remaking our criminal laws it's no surprise that after violent crime going down remember we talked about how the more we locked up people and the more we had tougher sentencing and tougher policing and more of a deterrent the more crime plummeted well guess what guess what it turns out as they become weaker the last number of years crimes going up so um kevin louis the abc seven news reporter said that the abc seven news reporter reports on his twitter account here a graphic here showing a spike the last few years and this is around when it happened 2014 2015 2016 now we don't even have 2018 2019 data i'd love to see where the trajectory is but you could just see it went from like you know 130 or so rapes a year 120 130 to 314 i mean folks that it that that's like a 70 percent increase i mean that's a story in and of itself that's a story in and of itself this is what we have castration without representation social transformation without representation judicial supremacy jailbreak illegal immigration transgender this and that we are having our soul as a nation as a people our security our sovereignty our civil society ripped to shreds and often without our saying it where are the republicans talking about this where are the republicans in the trump administration working to make september a fight over sanctuary cities over crime making montgomery county a rallying cry for that agenda just like the left is making el Paso a rallying cry to infringe upon constitutional rights of law binding of citizens while they meanwhile let gun felons at a prison where is the counter agenda where is anyone in conservative media doing this well we're certainly going to keep doing this but we need your support we need you to go to conservative reviews youtube page like our videos subscribe to our youtube page send this show and every other show we do to 50 of your friends and family members spread the word because as you see the more people know about this the more demands reaction one of the things about jailbreak is they cannot tolerate dissent conservative publications i hear from friends are spiking columns that are critical of criminal justice reform conservative publications are saying you can no longer publish stuff that is critical of soros' crime agenda think about that the reason is very simple because unlike any other issue this issue is such a universal slam dunk among 90 percent of voters that if people actually knew what they were doing that this is not about all first time low-level non-violent offenders this is about deconstructing our entire system abolishing prison across the board abolishing deterrent pro-criminal laws across the board nobody would support it if they knew about it but nobody knows that this is even happening because it happens either under the radar or it happens by the courts or both these are the issues if today is the first time you're tuning into the conservative review podcast these are the issues we're going to continue to cover as well as many others but certainly these issues the social transformation without representation now morphing into castration without representation paid for by you and me the taxpayer hate to end off on a grim note but until next time thank you for listening and god bless you all"
