Every week you're going to get the best of what goes on in my head, what we loving on and what we hate and on, what we might be and what we ain't going to. Politics, pop culture, mercury and retrograde, fucking with my podcast recording, we cover it all. We are recording from Oakland, California, the center of the known universe, where we are dealing with Rona and Reconstruction. It's a challenging time, a changing time, it's a time of transformation, it's all the things all the time nowadays, but we're going to help you understand the dynamics of this time every single week. So be sure to tune in, tell a friend and leave a review on Apple Podcasts. We do it for the culture so the pod is free 99 because we know that with a country and chaos, the least we could do is keep you from putting your money anywhere else than where it's needed. This week, this week, look, before we get to our guests this week, I'm here to tell you that lady don't like no mercury retrograde. Okay. Why, you might ask? Because mercury messed with our podcast recording for this episode. Well, don't tell mercury, but we made a backup recording. So the sound quality of the interview I'm going to share might not be quite up to ladies' high standards, but stay with it because it is still so, so good. Now, our guest this week is currently the point guard for the New York Liberty. She was recently reelected to a second term as WNBA vice president, where he helped to negotiate a groundbreaking CBA agreement that will serve as a bedrock for women's professional sports leagues moving forward. In 2017, our guest was named a WNBA All-Star when she led the league in total assists and broke the franchise record for assists in a single season. They are a noted social advocate, speaker, and writer who has been published in Esquire, ESPN, and many more publications. Y'all are in for a treat. Please enjoy my chat with the amazing Laysha Clarendon. What? What up? What up? What up? What up? What's going on? It's so good to see you. The smile on my face right now. I'm just so happy and excited and thrilled to be having this combo. This is what I'm talking about. I'm so happy to have you here. I have been waiting for this conversation for a hot minute. You'll schedule a busy. I'm glad I was able to get on it. I got to ask you because I do this every week where I'm flabbergasted at the fact that people don't understand what time it is. You know what time it is? It's time to stay as home because the Rona is raging, and Rona got feelings about how y'all won't sit the fuck down. I got to ask you contrary to popular opinion, we are still in a panty. And I got to know what has your quarantine life been like? Are you developing any unique habits? Live and direct for Ms. Rona? Oh my God. I mean, I'm a new parent. So that has been my main and new habits. Oh my goodness. I'm not telling you about this. What's going on? Our babe is six weeks old, so this has been all of the joy and adventure, I think, is the one amazing word I would use about having a newborn child. It's just been the journey of loving on them. So that is all my time and energy and effort that's been going towards them and parenting and just so fun. Oh my gosh. First of all, if I could put newborn babies smell in a bottle and spritz it all over my mouth. I hugged my wife this morning. The baby was like down and I just smelled them all over her. I was like, Oh my God. Like that that scent is just it's intoxicating. I wish we could give it a little bit to every person right now. So we all just like need that. Does endorphins and just like that calm and joy. That's not saying like even thinking about it, my ovaries are like, Hey girl, what's going on with you? What's your finna do? We'll come back to that conversation another time. I need the scoop on your pandemic skills. Like in case we go into the apocalypse for real, which, you know, literally like white folks in this country trying to take us back to 1776. So I'm preparing. What are you bringing to the table in the apocalypse? Oh, well, my fighter flight skills are phenomenal. My wife will tell you like I will go into fight mode in a hot second. Like the time she's seen me, which she's like, Oh, I didn't, I didn't know you even had that in you. So if the revolution comes, like people will be surprised because I will be like effing some people up. And then, um, I mean, I'm a great cook. I love to throw down the kitchen, having a baby has obviously changed that song. So the creativity has gotten even more like, okay, I'm going to take this frozen pizza and throw some fresh spinach on it. And then we go and get real great. Cause I'm trying to be trying to roll any crust or do that whole scratch situation. So I'm adapting those cooking skills to, and then I'm just super resourceful. I've always been really creative since I was a kid. Um, but just like repurposing and reusing things like I'm, I'm that person. Oh, I love it. Okay. You can be on the team. Consider yourself drafted. I, every time I get the opportunity love to shout out the W.A. MDA for really helping to leave this movement and shout out to you specifically for the leadership role that you've been playing as vice president of the players association. Now, you all were really the first to really embrace Black Lives Matter and this movement as a leak. So y'all were telling us about Kelly Loughler and how she was catn off way before I was invoked to do so, honey. And actually as I was prepping for this conversation, I read an op-ed from you where you literally called Kelly Loughler the anti movement. Yes. I was like, are we going to the answer Christ here? But you know, I'm going to let you tell it yourself. How many of you have this all came to be? Because you know, we see a lot of people wanting to have conversations about whether or not the way people are stepping up in this moment is all of the real or all of the fake. And I'm like, well, it's complicated. But in y'all's case, it's been all of the real and y'all have kept it real. So break it down for us. Like, is there a lot of pressure to not be political on the court, especially when it comes to women? Tell me about how you all are even organizing yourselves to be able to make these bold statements and what people should know goes on behind the scenes as they're seeing you on their television screens. That's a really good question. It overwhelms me in one instance because so many things flash through my mind. The first thing I'll say is we are political, as you know, and as people listening probably know, the fact that we play women's basketball is political. And so in that sense, in the WNBA, a league that's like 75, 80% black and I always say just like, hella queer. I don't know statistics. We don't have numbers on that yet because you don't sexualize fluid. That's right. We are political, existence is political. And so that sets us up in a way that we, the way we experience the world. And so fast forwarding to like how we were able to organize this work has started back through the CBA. And a lot of what I read in your book that really resonated with me, like you were giving me so many words and so much life for like what I've been experiencing is the tiny, tiny steps of organizing and talking to people and like the hours it takes and the time it takes. It's just such a, it's tiny little steps of just like showing up, showing up again, having that conversation. And so when people do ask like they did a view of like, you started a hashtag and then a movement popped up is like, I wish, right? Like I would love to just go viral and then we, it's popping. But like, you know, so the time and energy it's spent us through the collective bargaining agreement where we started to build this trust and collective power amongst ourselves with the way we were able to talk and organize because we have 12 teams, we have player reps for each team, then we have the executive committee that makes up the leadership group. So we have all these different pyramids and umbrellas of the way the leadership works. So then fast forwarding through, I think the trust and the collective power we built through that to lead us to this moment where we were going to play was like, we kind of been battle tested like we knew we had strength in numbers, we had that power. And so when it came to this season and the Kelly Lopler, aka Karen situation, specifically, you know, we were standing up for ourselves and we saw the opportunity and really just took it and we were unafraid because we often have the most to lose, but we're often the first people to speak up. And that is always just an experience that so many marginalized people can resonate with. And you know, that just slaps me in the face over and over again where I'm just like, we just fucking do it. And it's amazing. I loved about your op-ed was how you ended it, which I was like, yes, honey, it took like breath away. You said, when you come for one of us, you come for all of us. And you basically were like, look, you don't want none of this. Yes. And even that like, I try to wrap my mind around the fact that like this woman was in her league, tried to tell us not to put Black Lives Matter in the court. And then like we, we went ham after her and that has been so the thing in the mantra of so much of this league has been like, you can't mess with us because we know our strength lies and our collective power. And that I think the political side of that too is like, we know, let's say LeBron James can tweet or share something as a male in the sports world and it's going to pick up traction. And the way we've been positioned in the sports world, we know that one person can tweet something, but it's not going to pick up that same traction. So it's almost, it's forced us to work collectively in ways that we look at other leagues that were like, if they just did that, but because we're positioned the way we are, it's really forced us to look that way in the mirror. And so when Karen came for us, we were like, Oh, I hope she's sitting at her house right now, wondering like, I should have never, I should have let them live. And I could have potentially even in the Senate right now because we know statistically when we started to support her the way Reverend Warnock statistics grew the way the funding he got and he was able to buy advertisement, then you throw in the work that Georgia was doing on the ground and we got to send it. Listen, I didn't know who Kelly Loeffler was. And when I seen y'all wearing them t-shirts, I was like, you know what, let me look up who Reverend Warnock is because I know y'all would not be out here stuntin' if you didn't have something to say. So let me go see what y'all talking about. And I started to think today, you know, I wish Kelly Loeffler would have thought to herself, maybe I should keep my eyes on my own plate because as a co-master in this league, there's really rampant wage inequity. And I want to talk a little bit about that because I think number one, people sometimes look at social justice work like charity work, right? Like soup kitchen, AKA, I'm going to go do something for somebody else who's less fortunate than me. But what I think is so important about the activism and the advocacy that you all have been doing is that it's deeply personal for y'all. It's not like y'all were trying to jump on a bandwagon. You were like, oh, this is my movement too, right? Yes. So, you know, people like Megan have been out here super vocal about the wage gap that exists in soccer. Y'all are experiencing that too and you've been talking about it and you're right, it takes a lot of work to get that message out there. Not a lot of people know, right? That y'all are fighting on these levels, not just against police brutality, not just against police violence, but also against all of the ways in which Black lives don't matter on and off the court. So help our listeners understand what's happening there, especially as it relates to pay equity. Yeah. So that is why we renegotiate our collective bargaining agreement last year. And that is the contract between the players and the league. And so I'm so grateful that we have a union, right? We know there's a deep history of unionizing and how unions have been squashed, particularly in this country. And so the fact that we have a union, the longstanding union and women's sports, and we were able to negotiate a new CVA with the WNBA League. And so a lot of even approaching that was like educating people like they're talking about to the issues we face. So some people were tweeting or writing back to us when we started to share stuff. And we're like, oh, I thought the WMA made like $300,000 a year. Like they assumed our salaries were higher than they were, right? Because they're thinking they're a professional athlete. They're making X amount of dollars and insert all the reasons why. They're just being greedy. Oh, they shouldn't get this amount of money. And we're like, do you know the best player in the world then? And trusty at that time was making like $100 and something thousand dollars. And so part of that was just educating people on one salary was a huge issue. But it money is not the only thing. It was showing up to work without like dignity and decency for how we were able to do our jobs as professional. So a lot of what we also had to educate people on and what we were fighting for was like how we travel when we travel. Hotels we stay at, the kind of buses we're taking and that, you know, flying off some Southwest flights where we're, we have people who are over six feet, six foot five who are sitting in these planes. Being their body is their job. And so you're asking us to show up and do a physical labor job without providing the things we need to be at peak performance. And so it was things like that. It was, we're a league full of a lot of women with uteruses. A lot of people with uteruses, right? So how, what about childcare? We have various moms in our league. So we fought for like a childcare stipend, things like that that make your day to day experience a lot better that we had to fight for. So money was like, we need the money, but it was so many other things that folks just don't even realize that we face and, and as professionals that are just as like, you're not treating your product like a professional, but you want me to go out there and give you 110% professional performance. Like you need to meet me a little bit better than that. Come on. I love this. I literally, my heart is like fluttering right now. And really I'm not a sports person. You know what I'm saying? Like anybody you talk to will tell you, I'm lazy. I don't like to play sports and I don't like to exercise. So I did use to play soccer back in the day, but I have been so motivated and so inspired by the courage, the clarity, the resilience that you all have offered. I have not heard any of you backtrack your statements. And I think that whole situation with former US, former, really kind of set a point. And I think that you've made a tone for I think what it means to use your platform for politics and not just products, which I know y'all are encouraged to do. So I want to say from the bottom of my heart, thank you for inspiring me and for making me so proud to be a part of your social justice advisory council. Yes, I mean. You recently announced that you had top surgery. And I want to say congratulations to you for doing so. One quote that I read from an interview with you said, now instead of gender dysphoria, I feel gender euphoria. Oh my gosh, this is like giving us love. You have chosen to be very, very public with this. And I worried about you, Cha, I did. I was like, how's this going to go over? And then I saw a tweet that was supporting you from your team and it made my eyes well up. So I want to know, can you talk with our listeners about what you mean by gender dysphoria? Talk with me about how you're feeling now. Talk with me about what you're learning from this experience. And as a side question, I've noticed that particularly with trans folks, people are obsessed with the body obsessed. They want to know. Well, when did you transition? When did you do this? When did you do that? I don't need you to do a trans 101, but I am curious to just hear. Because y'all, if you don't know, do your work. Okay. For now, Google is free. I don't need you to do a trans 101, but I do want to just get a sense from you of how you're navigating those waters and why it matters that those questions don't matter. Oh, you become in deep with the question. You might have to collect me again on later on. Just don't worry. Don't worry. I forget to answer one part of it. But with gender dysphoria, just not feeling good in your body. So for me, like very simply was when I saw my breast in the mirror, I was like, like, you get kind of a y'all can't see me because I'm doing emotions on here, but you get kind of a yucky feeling that makes you want to look away from the mirror, or maybe the way my breasts felt in a shirt or, you know, feeling them bounce when I was, you know, jump rope, feeling or working out. Not to be confused with like body dysmorphia, right, which is a different. Not condition is a different feeling. And so gender dysphoria, I had experienced that for quite a while. And moving to the point of gender euphoria, which shout out to my best friend, Miranda Warden, because this was a conversation we were having just before I even had top surgery when he had top surgery. And maybe even before he had it, we just talked about how much we were struggling with dysphoria and like imagine for a moment, like what euphoria could feel in your body. And so think of talking about the vision and where you want to be. And so to then experience it in myself and what it got to be to that point, like it was just the perfect saying to move from dysphoria to euphoria where you feel so good with how flat my chest is and the way shirts fall on me and mirrors aren't enemies anymore. Mears are like, you know, I'm like a teenage boy, I can't look away or my wife is like, if you don't come get this child, I'm like, OK, I was just starting to flex in the mirror with my back a little bit. And so. And that's why I told everybody like, y'all better wait till this summer because the pool got to be lit. Oh, yeah. And so just feeling really good and euphoric and just so joyful in the skin that I'm in is the best way that I can put it. And I'm feeling overwhelmed by the amount of like attention I've gotten. I knew in our little basketball world, you know, particularly women's basketball world can be pretty tight in its space that this was going to be news. But so often, right, when we break out of the news, the way we did with maybe the Revan Warnock situation where it gets picked up like USA Today and People Magazine and TMZ. I was like, I knew this would be a press release, essentially, because the way social media works that anything I put out was like going to get taken. But I wasn't expecting that level of take in, which I'm so glad I put stars over my nipples because I was not ready to have my nipples like everywhere. But just to see the response has been like overwhelming and the amount of support. And so one of the things I did, and I think this is where having learned through the CBA, having learned through like quite literally becoming an organizer of people and someone who's trying to empower folks around me has been how important this collective power is. And so I was talking to my, our union director, Terry Jackson, about top surgery before it ever came out and asking questions of like, you know, do we have protections with gender identity? Like I do not want to turn into this public spectacle of debate about whether like I can do my job or not, because right, my livelihood, how I make money is occupied from my family and myself. And so I had conversations with her and she was phenomenal. And then we had conversations with the commissioner of our league, Kathy Engelberg, and then with my team. And so for me, it was like, Oh, I'm y'all going to support me. Like we need to have these conversations now. And thankfully they were super supportive to the point that, you know, we read over the statements together, like, let's make sure they're good. Let's make sure nothing is said that gets kind of, I did not want this moment to turn into a reactionary moment. I wanted it to be a stake in the ground where my story got to be told and supported wholly in 100% where there's no question or debate about it. Because this is not a public debate. That's right. Contrary to what's going on in all these states trying to pass these anti trans bills. And so to see what New York did and the statements come out just meant so much to me. And you could see people's responses of like looking to the league and the teams and them just being like, yeah, we support leisure 100% and that kind of like relief or like, Oh, so it's not a problem, right? Because that's so often we look to make the problem where it's not. And so I was really proud of like that strategy that I'm learning to, like how to work with people and organize that's led to this moment, which was just so, so powerful for so many. Are you having to navigate people being obsessed with your body and the changes that you are making to it? I noticed that as it relates to trans folk in particular, people get obsessed with what body parts you have as if that is like your name tag. Yeah. And this people don't do this with each other. Okay. We are not obsessed with what parts you have. We have this kind of unspoken language, right? Where we make a lot of assumptions based on the way that a person looks, presents outwardly. I just got to ask you, like, are you having to navigate that? And why is that the wrong conversation to have as it relates to trans folk? Oh, well, one, it's none of your business. What's anybody's pants gone? Which interestingly enough, having just had a child have to say this is fascinating because people strangers, like when my wife was pregnant, just ask us constantly, what is it? Do you know what you're having? What is it? We're like a baby? Like, I said, it's not a puppy. Like what are you asking? And the more and more we can start to like really parse what we're talking about here is like you're asking about someone's genitals, which is creepy, particularly with a baby. Sure. And you start to look at these questions that we're asking like one, it's not your age. Because it overwhelms me in the craziest ways because of how not sadistic, but really like vile, it becomes because of our obsession with it. And I think trans people face this because people think they have a right to our bodies or how our bodies move. And we're seeing this with anti trans bills right now, particularly with girls and women because we police girls and women's bodies, particularly for power and control. And so the hyper focus on women and girls bodies, which we experienced in the WNBA, right, is a black woman, even looking the way people play Serena's body. It's like, oh, you're too masculine. You're too strong. And so there's just this. I don't know if it's writer entitlement that cis people feel particularly to trans people's bodies. And it's really disgusting and really disheartening to see. And I've luckily my wife has done a really good job in my social media. And she's like blocked and reported and so many people have. They're in both. Yeah. She's like, she put it on the first little comment. I was like, if you're here to troll, just know. And so there's always those kinds of questions of like, oh, now you're a man. Oh, now are you taking testosterone? Oh, what's next? What's next? What's next? Implying a right to know what's going on with my body. And particularly in sports, it's really interesting because our body is our job. And so our teams have a right to know things that could affect our job or how we play or perform. So that's always really interesting too, having gone through this is at least no other athletes that I know of in the W bay that have had top surgery. It's like what rights do the team have to know, right? How to had a breast in plants? Like, is that the right of the team to know or not? And I wanted to work with them upfront and just let them know so they could support it. But it started to bring up all these questions of like, who has a right to know what's going on with my body and what's my personal information to share and cis, so cis people collect yourself. It's similar with people. It's like, who are you sleeping with? And they're like, why are you talking about sex? Like, I literally just said, I'm gay. And you're like, who are you sleeping with? The answer to all these questions is mind your business. So let me ask you something. Alisha, because you are so clear and profound and like dedicated. And to me, this isn't your first time at the rodeo. There's something that has inspired you to get active. How did you get into activism and organizing? What is there like a moment that really catalyzed you? Talk to me about that. Well, I had my activist moment, right? And then I had my organizer moment, which I learned are very different. So we can definitely complete the two. Um, so my activist moment, I would say I was in college. I went to UC Berkeley. I live in Oakland now. That's all I was like, Hey, every time you post a video, I'm like, where did she live? I'm speaking on you. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. So when I was at Cal, I had, you know, come to terms with my queer identity. I've always loved to be gay, you know, won't give me my life story, but wasn't able to be out when I was in, um, at home. So went to college was like flaming all over the place, finally free. Come on. Um, and, you know, come, I heard a Mohawk, my senior year. I was just like so embodying who I was in that joy. And in that moment of becoming more of my full self, I realized like how many people needed help because I really struggled to be gay and Christian for so much of my life. And to reconcile those two things. And so I had a moment when I wanted to play basketball at Cal to put it rainbow shoelaces in our shoes. And because I wanted to make March Pride month, Pride LGBT awareness month. And, you know, because we wear pink ribbons for breast cancer, we use sports as politics in so many ways. And loves people want to talk about we don't. And long story short, a coach at the time, like didn't enough letting us do that. And so it was like, that was kind of my moment of like, Oh, I'll never have my power taken. Away from me in sport again. And so I ended up just painting a rainbow my shoe, calling it a day. Went to the final floor of his ball and out. Okay. Come on. Yes. Get drafted to the W and B and then I that was the moment I realized my power and that I hadn't really been honing it in the way I could particularly as an athlete. And so thrusting into the W and Bame, I rookie year when I asked us about things we want to get involved in. I was just like, anything and everything day, like I was like from the very beginning, like, Oh, y'all going to get this activism. Like, y'all are going to get this platform. Like, I'm not holding back. Yes. Yes. And then fast forward to organizing has been really through the CBA when I started to see like, okay, this isn't only raising awareness about an issue, drawing attention, you know, maybe trying to raise money, change people's consciousness. This is like organizing and building power to reach a goal to change people's lives. And so that's our realize like, Oh, this is time and energy and effort and talking to people. And what's that being over and over and over again? Because that's the app we use to organize around our league. And now that I realize the power of organizing and how something you said in your book that really resonated with me was that like leaders build the next leaders, like that's what leaders are supposed to do. And I'm at that point in my career where I'm fighting to empower people to realize like how much power they have and how much power we have together. Because folks look at me and they're like, you post this online and you're so brave and you do this. And I'm like, that might be your not be your avenue. Like you might not be posting a boopik or your boop job all over online. That's okay. But like you have power to and how we can leverage it together. And I think that's kind of the legacy I want to leave of like, okay, I'm doing this work in the WBA. But like, how did I empower the people around me? So when I'm gone or even folks right now can bring ideas and they can feel like empowered leaders and not like I'm just the only one that's leading this movement. Oh my gosh, I love this so much. So y'all had a really big year and talk to me about what's next for y'all. What's next for you? How can people show up for you and support you? But also what's on deck for the WNBA Players Association this year and how can we support your efforts? Ooh, well, you can support me by not wondering what's in my pants. Number one. Or what's going on with my body or any other trans person's body. Um, and by doing your work, I think that's one of the biggest things of like doing your internal work. So when you get bumped, when you get rubbed, your reaction doesn't affect people like me and people of color, etc, etc, etc. Like we all need to keep doing our work. And particularly you could support trans people right now by paying attention to a lot of these fights that are going on in various states that are trying to stop. Listen closely, trans youth, we're talking about kids from playing in youth sports and from getting life changing gender affirmation surgery, which is something I just went through. We're denying that access or making it a felony in some states for parents or surgeons to provide this type of surgery for a child who knows their transgender and needs it so they don't experience gender dysphoria for years. And so plug into those fights, go to the ACLU, which they're doing this work all over various states and get involved. And especially in your local communities, there's a lot more happening around gender than you realize. It's not only these, you know, middle America states that we love to make stereotypes about. And then the WBA is, whoo, I mean, we got to spin it. So we took a little bit of a breath. I think I'm definitely pushing on the trans rights issue that I'm like, we got to dedicate the season to trans girls now. So we'll see how that works. And we want to continue to do the work with the say her name campaign, of course, and how we can support them and women who are victims of state and police violence. But we plan to do a lot around the coronavirus vaccine to to be educators. Which is we know like healthcare is a social justice issue. So that will be one of our main front and center conversations. And then we're having a lot of conversations about the national anthem. And y'all know how I feel. I'm like, cancel it. It needs to go by. And so we're having those conversations now to educate ourselves on the history of the anthem, why we started playing the anthem in sports in the first place and where we can go from there. And just like that, it's time for our weekly roundup of all the things Lady just ain't going to do this week. Number one, keep QAnon in Congress. I mean, have y'all been catching his heat that we have legit conspiracy theorists running congressional districts? This week's What the Fuck award goes to Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has made a name for herself by being a QAnon adherent. Though she claims it's in the past now, child, it ain't. And she wants to make laws for you and for me. Now, her claim to fame now includes being kicked off the committee she got put on, but we're going to talk about that in a second. Heckling Parkland shooting survivor and gun control activist David Hogue and calling him a coward, refusing to wear a mask when her comrades were storming the Capitol and believing that Donald Trump was saving the country from a cabal of child molesting baby eaters. The best part is that she got assigned to the Education and Budget Committee by her Republican colleagues. Cha, you can't make this shit up, but word out on the street is the house just voted to kick her ass off those committees. So there's that on that. Speaking of shit, you just can't make up. Your homey ice cube is in the news again this week. As apparently he has set up a meeting with Joe Biden to discuss the platinum plan that he developed with Donald Trump. Michael Harriet, award winning make me crack the fuck up or who is going to be on this show next week, wrote probably the best rap about this that I think I've ever seen. I'm going to ask him to share it on the show, which I'll next week, but suffice it to say we are waiting with bated breath to see how a Trump approved plan is going to go over with build back better Biden. Now, I'm all for reparations. For real. I really am. What I'm not down with is this crabs in a barrel crew that cube is running with. And I'm feeling away that cube never really saw the error of his ways, taking this approach that was basically like, yo, I'm not going to be a little bit of a bad guy. Yo, I know I'm dancing with the devil who's trying to throw you in the dungeon, but I can't wait anymore because I got to get mine. Huh? In the Lord's year of 2021, in the holy month of Black Futures, what we ain't going to do is act like the platinum plan is anything but a front for a Black Conservative agenda. Now, I'm surprised Daniel Cameron hasn't signed on, but hey, we'll work with anyone who wants to work with us, right? Anyways, let's move on to things that Lady loves this week. Speaking of Daniel Cameron, Queen Rihanna gave us big Black Futures energy when she slapped the living shit out of Cameron in these Twitter streets when his white social media intern fixed their fingers to type out a message from the disgraced district attorney. Talking about happy Black History Month. Clearly they hadn't gotten the message that the Black delegation has traded Daniel Cameron to whoever the fuck will take him because we ain't wanting. Now Rihanna said, and I quote, sup, nigga, hashtag justice for Brianna Taylor. And when I say I stand a queen, Rihanna is queen and I love her so. I bet he ain't going to try that shit again. Next thing Lady loves this week is the season finale of Real Housewives of Salt Lake City. Okay, I gotta be honest. I've been a captive audience this entire season, but I'm not sure we need another one. And I say that with a Kanye Shrek. Jen is unraveling at the seams and really all of the stems from her being one of a few women of color in a sea full of white women who don't clap back when she pops off. Next thing on things that Lady loves this week, forward motion on impeachment. Now the first time around, honestly, I was a little agnostic because truth be told, y'all nudist man was a crook when you elected him. So to act like you gave a shit then seemed disingenuous. But this time, it's way more serious. Look, my mom used to say, you teach people how to treat you, and I have never found that advice to be wrong. Now, if you let this man orchestrate a full on coup with no consequences, just because he didn't get it this time, don't mean he won't be back for more next time. Republicans are the party of, we don't give a fuck about your rules. And so right now what's on the table is whether or not you try to talk to Little Donnie about how he's feeling and why Donnie thought it was okay to bring his friends with nooses and zip ties. Or whether you cut a switch for Little Donnie. Now, I am team cut a switch, and if you don't know what I'm talking about, ask a black person. Let me ask you, if people want to follow what you're up to and they want to get involved, how can they find you on the socials? Just my name, Leja C, LAYSHIAC on Instagram and Twitter. Excellent.
