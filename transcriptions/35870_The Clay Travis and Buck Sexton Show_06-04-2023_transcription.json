Clay Travis Buck Sexton Show. Yes, they have cranked up the music there, Buck. I am 44 years old today as an old man born in the 1970s. I know this is unbelievable for you, whipper snappers out there. 1979 this day, 44 years ago, I entered into the world. Thanks to my mom who is excited to share photos with Ali. I think they're up on the Clay and Buck show. You know what? It's a lot less of a crazy world back in 1979. I'll tell you that much. What was it like with your plaid pants watching mash at night after a long day at the factory? You don't even know what it was like to be alive during Jimmy Carter's tenure. And well, maybe now you do because it's basically like Joe Biden's tenure right now. We've gone back in time, two generations later. And Buck, I was last night looking at some of the brand advertising. We got a lot to get into, by the way. We appreciate all of you hanging out with us on 500 odd stations all over the country. The tens of millions of you that are downloading the podcast every single month. We thank you for hanging out with us. I last it's. It's rare buck that I watch something these days and I just think this is even crazier than anything I could have expected. And when I watched this crazy fake woman that has taken root all over TikTok and social media. Also known as a man. Yes. Yes. Fake woman, AKA a man that is getting millions of dollars now in endorsement income from some of the biggest companies in America. I sit here and I look at it and I think to myself, how do we get back to normalcy? You guys haven't seen. I'm sure it's going to be up on clay and Buck. It's certainly up on my Twitter feed at Clay Travis. Nike and Bud Light, who are two of the biggest probably ad spenders ever. And for all of you out there listening to us right now, Nike and Bud Light would never spend money on this radio show, Buck. Because you and I are too controversial. And the opinions that we share on this show are too controversial to be associated with beer in tennis shoes. We're so nice guys. It's so I know. And if you're if you're out there and you're like, I don't even know what you're talking about. Let me share a quick story with you before we start playing some of this crazy audio. Buck, a couple of years ago, I was scheduled to get paid by Jack Daniels to appear at an event. I'm not opposed to whiskey. I'm not opposed to alcohol. They reached out to me here in Nashville where I live. They said, we'll pay you several thousand dollars to show up and just have a drink, have a take a couple of whiskey drinks. Jack Daniels, local Tennessee company. I was like, fine, I'll do it. The week before I was scheduled to go, news broke that one of the schools that I'm an alum from Vanderbilt University here in Nashville was going to pay over a million dollars to sand blast the word Confederate off of the building that was built in the 19th century that was called Confederate Memorial Hall, which was designed to honor the memory of soldiers who fought for the Confederacy. Nobody could even see it. Nobody even knew that it said Confederate Memorial Hall hardly all the way at the top, but they did Vanderbilt made the decision to spend over a million dollars to sand blast that word off the building. And I came out and I said, this to me is everything that's wrong with trying to wokify our history. I disagree with it as an alum of Vanderbilt University. But when I said that, Jack Daniels canceled my endorsement appearance and said, we can no longer be affiliated with you just for sharing my opinion that the word Confederate shouldn't pay a million dollars at Vanderbilt to sand blast it off a building. Now people can have whatever opinion they want on that. I don't particularly care. I just think the idea that we completely erase a historically relevant issue is a bad precedent to set no matter what the history is in general. Okay. But yet Jack Daniels is paying all of these now transgender activists probably hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions to endorse their product. And I think a lot of people out there are finally saying, this is enough. We can't stand for this anymore. And when you see Nike and you see the Bud Light move, I think people have finally had enough. So, so Nike has a sports bra promotion with Dylan Mulvaney. I also think this is an important moment to remember that anybody who ever says anywhere online on TV, in line at the supermarket to you, why they're not going to be able to get the money. And I think that's a good thing to do. Why do you make such a big deal out of this stuff? We aren't the ones making a big deal out of it. Correct. They are the ones making a big deal out of it. The left, the Democrats, Biden, the White House, the media, they have decided that this is a crusade for them. This is something that is of the utmost social importance in the country right now. It is a civil rights struggle. It can only work if people refuse to think for themselves and are all scared, basically. It can only work if a degree of mind control of brainwashing is effective from the apparatus itself. And this is why, you know, you also are a reminder clay. You're talking about these different brands. If you were to just sort of think about this, if you hadn't spent a lot of time dealing with corporate America directly, you're just an American buying different stuff, buying different brands. You would assume that Budweiser and Jack Daniels and some of these brands you would think would be the least likely. But based on just who is drinking beer and whiskey, right? Who's the audience? Right. Who is really into Jack Daniels? Who's drinking mostly the Budweiser? Now, also just as a function of numbers, the transgender community is very, very small. So they're clearly not trying to broaden the base to correct. Run up sales with the transgender community. It's too small to make a difference to the numbers of companies like that. So this is a combination of virtue signaling, of pressure, I think, from government that's just always implicit. Government regulators, you know, I know it's a conceum, a little conspiratorial, but I mean, look what just happened to Donald Trump, right? You know, you get on the long side of the system and all of a sudden nonsense happens to you and they try to ruin your life. So for a lot of these corporations, this is just either insurance or, you know, kind of like social justice insurance. Or I think that they are terrified of people within their ranks who will make problems for them if they won't go forward with this. But I mean, you're selling to sports bra with a guy is what that's what they're actually trying to do. A man who does not have breasts. This is important. If you haven't watched this video, they have this dude who is pretending to be a girl and he is pretending to be, let's be honest, it's woman face. It's a modern day version of blackface is incredibly offensive because it's not how normal women behave, but they are trinikie is selling sports bras now that they want women to purchase that a man is wearing and he has no breasts. I mean, in the advertisement and I just I look at it and I think to myself, how much crazier can this get that they and to your point, Buck, if you raise an issue with this and I understand some of you, by the way, you say, well, why would you give attention to this? The goal of advertising is to get attention. And I understand that on some level, but to me, you have to call out hypocrisy, absurdity and and things that frankly are indefensible, even if it leads to us paying attention to an advertisement. We have seen what happens when the right retreats from different battlegrounds in this country of ideas in the culture. We've seen what happens when we just hope for a neutral space. That's always the thing that people talk about. Oh, we just want, we just want neutral teaching in the classroom from, you know, pre K all the way up the college. We want a neutral space for sports teams and sports leagues and well, guess what? They don't. And they're going to use these as tools of politicization. So you can either allow that to happen, right? You effectively give them exactly what they want, which is unrestricted messaging dominance. I mean, if you think about it in a military context, it's like scyops or information warfare. If you're going to seed the battlefield to the other side entirely, you're not showing them how, you know, smart and tough and strong you are by doing this, right? You're allowing them to run unrestricted information operations. Marketing, by the way, marketing propaganda, scyops, these things are all very similar. There's a lot of connective tissue between these ideas. So you can either look at this. This is cultural propaganda clay. That's what the purpose of this is. It's not to sell more beer. They're not going to sell more beer. I would like to hear. I'm going to open it up again. Women only 800-282-2882. When you see a Nike ad that is designed to sell sports bras and a man without boobs. I mean, let's just be clear. This is not even a man who's had surgery to be a woman. He still has a penis and testicles. He has no, they have to be specific. He has no breasts, right? He is wearing a sports bra pretending to be a woman. Nike is likely paying this man. I bet hundreds of thousands of dollars, Buck, in order to be in these ads trying to sell leggings, which I guess allows space for women for for genitals now for for penis and testicles and a sports bra without having breasts. Like how insulting is this to women? Like I watch it and I just think if I were a woman, I would be so thoroughly disgusted that Nike is actually paying a man to pretend to be a woman to sell women's athletic gear to me. I think the only response you can have if you are a woman listening to us right now is say, I will refuse to buy any Nike gear. This is crazy. I think it's important to note that it also is coming from the White House, folks. This is not us beating up on some, you know, small or even, you know, large, like sorrows funded, you know, non fake nonprofit that does propaganda against the right or something. This goes top to bottom. This is all the way across the spectrum. Here is Korea Jean Pierre and the White House on the issue of transgender surgery and gender and hormone blocking for minors. Does the president have a position on at what age these kinds of therapies and surgeries are appropriate. That's something for a child and their parents to decide. It's not something we believe should be decided by by legislators. They're such a cowards play. They're such cowards because this is actually what they did on COVID-2. They're going to say we leave it to the experts, but they're actually going to legislate and push for it. And whenever they get pushed back, they say, Hey, we're just leaving it to the experts. And then any expert who says this is mutilation of children will lose their license. This is the game they play. It's totally dishonest. And also legislatures and politicians are involved in a massive amount of laws, right? We say you can't get a beer until you're 18 years old. A parent doesn't get to say one feet. Yeah, sorry. It's 21. I don't know how it is. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I lived in the Virgin Islands. I was a little bit out there in Nashville area. Still 18 there. Hey, I'm on a college campus is a lot. There's a lot of fake IDs out there. The other thing is the, you know, yes, you have to be 18 years old to vote. That is a legislature based decision. You have to be 25 by and large to rent a car. Most states will not allow you to get a tattoo until you're 18. Age of consent is a variety of different ages, but you can't say, Hey, this 12 year old wants to sleep with this 35 year old. Her parents say it's okay. We're going to be fine with it. There are lots of things that legislatures make decisions on. To me, the idea that you could chop off someone's breasts or take away their genitals before they're 18 years old and the White House would be saying, we don't think it's appropriate for legislatures or politicians to get involved in this issue is flagrantly indefensible. And I can't imagine hardly any parent in America who agrees with it. And I have to, I have to say this because I do understand the extremes of what the left is really trying to accomplish and where they're trying to go. They're focused on your kids for all of you across the country. The reason they want to focus on children here as part of the transgender agenda is twofold. One, they are, this is why they say that doctors get it wrong with babies. They are trying to create the narrative of this is a from birth condition, effectively, that this is something it is an immutable, transgenderism is an immutable characteristic that develops at some later, you know, at some point, some later, you know, at 50 or whatever. That's what they're trying to say though, right? That's one part of that's why they want it to be. Oh, this is your transgender from birth. That's one. And the other is they want to be able to claim that the transitions are more complete by blocking puberty and destroying normal reproductive organs in young people because then they think they'll be closer to be able to say, well, biologically, they're not really male either biologically. This person is going to be able to say that they're not going to be able to do that. So biologically, this person is some is, you know, some, but what they're, remember, the ultimate claim is not that Daniel Mulvaney is a transgender woman. That, you know, okay, I could, you could call her transgender call him a transgender woman. Fine. It is that it is a woman indistinguishable from all other women, which is crazy. Yeah. That is their actual claim. Do not forget it.

It felt like my movements were in the spotlight. In Gresa, Valbenasine Capsules is a prescription medicine for adults with TD. It's the only TD treatment that's always one pill, one staley, and it's number one prescribed. And people taking in Gresa can stay on most mental health meds. In Gresa can cause depression, suicidal thoughts or actions in patients with Huntington's disease. Pay close attention to and call your doctor if you become depressed, have sudden changes in mood, behaviors, feelings, or have thoughts of suicide. Don't take in Gresa if you're allergic to its ingredients. In Gresa may cause serious side effects including angioedema, potential heart rhythm problems, and abnormal movements. Report fevers, stiff muscles, or problems thinking as these may be life-threatening. Sleepiness is the most common side effect. Now that treatment has reduced my TD movements, it's nice. People focus more on me. Thank your doctor about in Gresa or learn more at engresa.com. That's I-N-G-R-E-Z-Z-A dot com. Welcome back to Clay Ann Buck. We got a lot we're going to get you today. We have DeSantis was in Michigan, the Nike campaign we just talked about. Tennessee House may expel three members. Clay will give us the latest on that one plus some saber rattling from China over Taiwan. Looks like Hezbollah's fired a bunch of rockets into Israel. A whole bunch of things. NPR. Kree Jean-Pierre waited a moment ago on the transgender children issue. But NPR has lost its blue check on Twitter, National Public Radio, and also Clay was slapped with a state media label. Here is what the White House said about this. The hard-hitting independence nature of their coverage speaks, speaks for itself. And so I'll leave it there. First of all, no one thinks NPR is hard-hitting. That's the last thing you'd ever think about NPR. Like you got to be kidding me. And it is state media. Guess what? Yes. If you don't want taxpayer-funded dollars to support you, then do away with taxpayer dollars and just say you're not going to take them anymore. I'll also point out that NPR put out, frankly, a statement that said we're not going to cover the Hunter Biden story because we don't want to waste our audience's time. Certainly very interesting how the state-sponsored media ends up covering the Biden administration. If they're not state-sponsored, how about not being state-sponsored? It's pretty straightforward. Give up our tax dollars. Yeah, if you're so great, then no more public funding. You know, compete like everybody else.

We are talking about the crazy insanity that has taken over our country. We actually got a ton of women who want to weigh in about these latest advertisements, which to me in many ways are erasing women. One of our writers at Outkick Buck, she had a really good tweet that she put out there. I feel like she speaks for many different women. She's doing good work for us at Outkick, Amber Harding. Yesterday, after this ridiculous Nike ad started to circulate and obviously coming on the heels of the Bud Light ad that is effectively erasing women, she tweeted out. I think there's a lot of women out there that would agree with this. Day 12, because the big thing that this Dylan Mulvaney character does is he's been on TikTok counting each day that he's been a woman. He's only been a woman for like a year or whatever it is. She tweeted Amber Harding Snyder. Sorry. She just got married. Day 12,482 of being a woman and not one corporate sponsorship yet. What am I doing wrong? And I feel like there's a lot of women out there who feel the same way. Michelle in Alabama, you're a retired army vet. When you see this thing, people trying to sell sports bras to women by putting men in sports bras who have no boobs. I mean, what do you think? I think it's horrible. Absolutely horrible. We have four children, two boys, two girls and the girls were somewhat tomboys, but never in my waffle stream nor my husband's ever thinks that they needed to be trans-agendered. I mean, I feel bad for women today. I feel bad for the young girls coming up behind us, even our military women, because now they're going to be competing with men who want higher scores like on their PT test. They just identify as a woman. So does that mean that they get to run with those scores, get higher promotion points? Michelle, it's not fair. And thank you for calling in. I would just say Clay, womanhood is in a in a healthy society, which I think ours was healthier before the last 10 years or so. Oh, no, no, no. Womanhood is a revered thing. And you and I, as guys, you married a long time, me married a short time, understand that a lot of what we do as guys is in reverence of and to appeal to womanhood. It's a special thing, you know, to be a woman in society is something that has to be nurtured, protected, revered, respected, and to just make honestly make a mockery of it in this way is absurd. I mean, I'm sure you saw the Matt Walsh exchange or it's gotten millions of views with a transgender EMT and he asked the question about, and there are variations on this people have been asking for years now. But if somebody said that they were having a miscarriage, but you know, it's a guy, are you going to check them for a miscarriage? Yeah. And the EMT says no, and you know, credit to Matt Walsh at the daily wire for the exchange. But you know, there still is this belief. People say like, well, you can't even tell you can tell actually. Yeah. I mean, it's not even just into the theoretical and the world be polite to people. They'll say, well, you can tell that you can tell that it's a guy. So why do they keep lying to you? Because their arguments are terrible. Nancy in Rhode Island, your reaction. To say that this is nothing new in the fashion industry. I'm 59 years old and I grew up, you know, getting Vogue magazine every month. And since the early 80s, starting in the early, probably even before that, the women that would model Calvin Klein and you knew and all that were very unrealistic bodies for women. Anyways, they're rail thin, they have no brass, they have no hips. And they have graduated from that to just having men in the print ads wearing the dressings. So what next, what Nancy's talking about. I mean, Clay, there are people who call there. Well, there are people who say that the fashion industry, which is not necessarily, you know, how do I put this? That the fashion industry was pushing for androgyny a long time ago based on who was set. Now, not across the board, but high fashion. And this has been creeping into it and becoming more and more mainstream for a while. But I don't really see necessarily. I'm not really sure what the connection is here. Yeah. Look, what I would say on healthy skinny models and transgenderism. Yeah. What I would say is there is certainly the case that beautiful women who were supermodels had not normal bodies. Oh, right. I don't think she was referring to not normal as in, in the app, you know, winning the genetics lottery. Yeah, there were times when there were there were models who were thin to the point where it was clear they had eating disorders, things like that. Yeah, right. But, but you know, like you use Victoria's Secret for a, for an example, when we were growing up for as Victoria's Secret became a dominant brand, their brand was we want hyper incredibly good looking women. I've made this analogy for a long time, Buck. The giselle buncheons of the world, let's just use her as an example, are like NBA draft picks. She won the genetics lottery. Clearly. They won the genetics lottery. There just aren't very many people like them. And now if you go walk like I don't, it's not like I'm in the mall very often. If you walk by Victoria's Secret, they just have kind of a fat chick in a bra. There was a there was a tran, transgender people like now selling the clothes. There was a whole documentary on Netflix actually about Abercrombie and how Abercrombie was effectively destroyed by the woke or I should say transformed, I would argue destroyed by the woke social justice movement. Because they said that, you know, it was what was it? It was too beautiful. There are too many straight people and too many white people. That was the, that was the attack on it. And eventually the whole brand effectively caved. I mean, I don't think anyone wears that. I think it still exists. But it's a, it's a, you know, a small fraction back in the day. Did you know they said Abercrombie at the while I was in college, you worked at you worked at Abercrombie? I worked at Abercrombie. They only low well. Excuse me sir. Look at that one. I worked at the Pentagon City for anybody out in the DC area, the Pentagon City mall, I would hop on the subway from GW where I was an undergrad and I would go work at the Pentagon City Abercrombie. My, you know, my wife Carrie worked at Abercrombie too. And it's like the best, best, most fun, one of the most fun jobs I ever had. I worked at Abercrombie and American Eagle. I asked her, I said, Oh, we're, we're the other employees. Yes, everybody was very good looking. They hired you based on, you know, you selling the clothes essentially by being there. Not that I'm very good looking, but I do remember you couldn't have facial hair. I mean, I mean clay, you know, drop it. It's a birthday. Everybody's led, you know, you know, I wouldn't say used to great Parmesan cheese on those abs back in the 70s, you know, back. Best job I ever had Buck because you could approach whatever good looking girl came into the store, walk right up to him, start talking to him. And it was completely normal and not threatening. You have no idea how amazing that I think I made $7 an hour, $7 an hour. And I just stood in a store filled with hot girls and got to walk up and talk to them all day. And occasionally like fold some jeans or whatever learning to sell in any capacity is a life scale. Yes, it's a good thing for people to, you know, a lot of people will get it even just working in a restaurant and whatever. But but being able to interact with people and sell them on something. But in your case, yeah, having an excuse to talk to hundreds or at, you know, thousands over the course of your employment of, you know, women your age you wanted to talk to, they're worse gigs in the world for sure. It's amazing, amazing job. Donna in Northern Idaho. What do you think about this? Um, you know, we don't. I didn't hear what she said. All right, Denise in California, Buck, I don't know what happened to Donna there. She got that was maybe you said, you know, and then left us on the cliff. That was the shortest caller opinion that has ever been shared on the college. You want to be like, you guys know what's up. Click done. Denise in California. What do you think Denise? How do you guys? Two points I want to make about this Dylan Mulvaney thing. And it's really irritated me. These corporations are supporting and promoting someone with a mental disorder or a disphobia, this, this phobia of some kind or phobia. I don't know. Dysphoria or phobia. Yeah. It's for you. Thank you. That's what I'm here for. That's why I do the radio. Um, and they're also exploiting this mentally ill person. Second thing is when you watch him behave the way he behaves, which you guys talked about it yesterday, he is acting like a flamboyant gay male teenager. So he's not reflecting female behavior whatsoever. He's reflecting gay male flamboyant gay male behavior. Why do you think women accept this, Denise? Like, because men, they argue that we made on the show is that there is no male equivalent, right? There isn't a woman pretending to be a man who is wildly popular with men, because I think men just kind of feel sorry for these people. Women seem to be lifting them up. There are lots of celebrity fake women. Why do you think that is? I think, um, I won there. They're all liberals. That's what I think. I don't think there's a conservative female that normal thinking woman who thinks any of this is okay. So when anything goes, everything goes and there's no rules. And so I want to be liked. I want to be popular. I want to sell my brand. I want it. And listen, I have stopped doing business with Nike a long time ago. That was all over the Colin Kaepernick thing, but I stopped going to my, my makeup store. I'm, I'm starting to order my stuff online from other businesses that I'm not going to support this. And I think women, we don't have to get up and, you know, yell and scream. We just have to quietly make our voices heard. I've sent my emails. They're not going to care about me not buying Nike products. I'm one little fish in the sea, right? But if we all just collectively put a stop to it and we can, we outnumber these more on the anyway, we hear, we hear a point, by the way, they assume that people like you won't do what you are doing.

Thank you for calling in Denise. We'll come back. We have more calls. We got more to talk about, including, you know, Clay, there's some follow up on that, that awful stabbing in San Francisco I talked about yesterday. You know, the guy was running around. I mean, not, you know, fast, obviously, but was, you know, moving around as quickly as he could after being stabbed, nobody would help him. I saw that nobody would help this guy. He's bleeding out. He did bleed out. He died at the hospital. And begging for help in on the streets of San Francisco, a very wealthy liberal enclave. No one did a thing. So I want to come back in second hour.

I will not pose for another Vogue cover until he does that. I am not satisfied. So I might be waiting a long time. Also, you have the, you see this, the Deputy CI Director actually worked for this guy. House committees looking into some of this stuff. They're loose going to get these people on the record for the propaganda they were part of. So we got that also the murder that still don't have any arrests, I believe, murder in San Francisco of that Silicon Valley founder, founder of Cash App, Bob Lee. Melissa in North Carolina. You've got some thoughts for us. What's going on, Melissa? Hey, Buck. No, I was just telling your callers. So, you know, my first thought was it's insulting to women that, you know, somebody can just put on a headband and a lily poulter dress and call themselves a woman and everybody says, hey, she's a woman. But then the other thing is the fact that, you know, this person is taking a job for actual biological woman. Correct. And, you know, we say that women have made such strides. We have International Women's Day and Women's Month, but yet it seems like we're going backwards. Now we have men that are taking jobs from women again because they're wearing a bathing suit and they call themselves a female or they put some earrings on and lipstick and call themselves a female. And if you say, no, they're not a female, they're a male wearing a dress or a bathing suit, then people look at you like you're crazy and, you know, act like you've just insulted them. And it's sad because if people wearing the bathing suits and wearing the lipstick have obvious mental illnesses or issues that need to be addressed, not cater to. Yeah. Yeah. I think I think I agree with everything she said. I was going to say, can I just cosign? I mean, I think she's completely correct. I mentioned I just want to give a give everyone a chance to hear it because this has gone very viral. You know, Matt Walsh did the movie What is a Woman, which is it is excellent. We had him on the show to talk about it. Here is his exchange at a college with a transgender EMT player. You said you're an EMT. Yes. Okay, if you're responding, you're responding to a health emergency, biological male, somebody with a penis is is having a medical emergency. And they say to you, I think I'm having a miscarriage. Would you would you check them to see if they're having a biscuit? Would you consider that a possibility for them? No, but that's because some people don't have body parts. That mean this is and you know, there was also and as part of his discussion, he pointed out, you know, if you if you find somebody who has lost a leg from either an accident or or illness or war or whatever it may be, it doesn't mean that it's untrue to say that human beings have two legs. Correct. And yet this so much of the argument they put forward here is it just runs in circles. There's no actual formation to the argument. It's emotion masquerading as an argument. VIP email, by the way, from Andrea, I find and this is her I'm reading her VIP email. I find it interesting. The only time the left celebrates white men is when they're pretending to be women. It is so true, right? The ultimate white privilege you can argue white male privilege. I said this about the Leah Thomas situation. You have a rich white guy who is a swimmer that is at the University of Pennsylvania. How much more privilege can you get than to decide, Hey, I'm tired of being a college male swimmer. I'm just going to become a woman swimmer and you're one of the greatest women of all time. Got a castle point out how how emotionally unhealthy do you have to be? You know, if I jumped in on a first graders dodge ball game and was wasting kids left and right, I wouldn't be saying, yeah, I'm amazing at dodgeball. I would know that there was something wrong with this mismatch. He thought it was fine to win the NCAA. Give me a break. That's why I also pointed out that kid who pretended that he was 14 years old in the Little League World series. Everybody lost their mind over lying about age. Gender's okay. It's Ryan C.
