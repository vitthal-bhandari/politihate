    "text": " The next headline of a plus-size Philadelphia drag queen, 25 years old, died of a heart attack during a performance at a gay bar. The medical examiner says that she was killed by obesity and diabetes. No, so at least the medical examiners can acknowledge truth. 25 years old. Her name was Valencia Prime and she died mid-performance, right? While doing what they do best. Hosting her own party dancing on stage, this could have been Lizzo. By the way, this is why I say her fans must hate her because they continue to lie to her and they continue to celebrate her and they continue to award her statues and pretend that what she is doing is a good thing for culture while she kills herself.

If you guys not know Demi Lovato, she is a singer, she is a performer, she's very talented, she's a wonderful voice. She actually began her career on Barney, so she's always been in the public eye from the time that she was a small child. I don't think there is a greater example of an artist today that has followed really the left discult, meaning that everything that they sell, she embraces, and then she then sells to her followers. I'm talking about body positivity. She talks about her struggles with her body, and now she kind of views people that are overweight as being brave, and she encourages them, and she applause them online. Demi Lovato, just going through her history with drugs and mental illness. In 2009, she tried cocaine at 17 years old while working for the Disney Channel. 2010 and 18 years old, she entered a treatment center for the first time to address her issues with eating and cell parm among other issues. In 2011, she left rehab, and she revealed that she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In 2013, she checked into a Los Angeles sober house. In 2018, she sought treatment again after a near fatal heroin and fentanyl overdose. In 2021, she announced that she was non-binary and that she wanted to be referred to as they and them and also during an interview on CBS Sunday morning. She said that she smokes a little weed, and she drinks moderately and referred to that as being a Californian sober. 2021 in her Peacock Docu series, she sang to a ghost after it supposedly revealed that it had experienced trauma that was caused by sexism. Yeah, I'm going to read that one again. In her 2001 Peacock Docu series, she sang to a ghost after the ghost supposedly revealed to her that it had experienced trauma that was caused by sexism. And then recently, she revealed that she re-adopted the pronouns she and her. Okay, so I want to talk about her because as I said, she is just evidence her life. And I do actually say this with true compassion in my heart because I see her entire life as one big cry for help. And she keeps holding on to all of these leftist positions. I guess hoping that they're going to help her if she embraces being non-binary, if she embraces being California sober, if she leans into, I don't know, looking into ghosts and having a series about trying to find ghosts in reality. What she wants to find is God. What she's looking for is spiritual direction. You know, Demi Lovato is so emblematic of everything that's wrong with Hollywood, of what happens when you celebrate yourself, right? When you lean into mental illness, talking about, oh, it's so brave to talk about your various mental illnesses. It's so brave to be, you know, body positive. It's an active bravery to change your pronouns and your bio and to identify as all of these different things ultimately because you're not happy with yourself. These people are miserable on the inside. This is why the Shiloh-L'A-Buff transformation, I hope, is something that Demi Lovato is paying attention to. I want Demi Lovato to get better. I actually, I feel such a sadness for her because everything that she is saying, this attention that she's looking for when she pretends that it's about sexism, it's about misogyny, she's gay, she's lesbian, she went through a period where she was dating a woman, and that's when she said she was non-binary. At the end of the day, she is a sad, sad soul that is looking for direction and she's not going to find it in Beverly Hills. She's not going to find it in Los Angeles. She's not going to find it from the paparazzi. She's going to find it when she begins living her life more conservatively, when she stops following these Hollywood trends, these demonic Hollywood trends. She recently gave a statement that this current tour is going to be her last. She posted this on a bunch of Instagram stories saying that she was, quote, so effing sick. I can't get out of bed. I can't do this anymore. This next tour will be my last. I love and thank you guys. End quote. I hope that her real friends reach out to her. I hope that her family surrounds her. I would hate to think that Demi's life is going to be somehow shortened because she can't find necessary direction that she needs. And I hope that people that are watching this story, aside from praying for her, she does need our prayers. Learn a lesson. Actually, take a second and examine the way that she has lived her life, why it is that money and attention and applause, fake applause and trophies like the one that Lizzo is getting. Don't actually fulfill you. All right, guys, that is all the time that we have for today. You know that I have some very exciting exclusive content that has been a little bit delayed. Sorry, we're working on the set, but I have told you guys on Instagram, it's going to be a shot in the dark, which is the most important work that I think I've ever done as a mother. I am just thrilled that Daily Wire Plus is going to pick this up. So they're basically going to get more of me. It's going to be an entire separate show, a second show, but it'll be available exclusively on Daily Wire Plus. We are T minus maybe two weeks away from that premiering. So be sure to click the link in the description and subscribe right now. And also be sure to come back tomorrow because there will be, of course, a brand new episode. See you then."
