He's involved with in Silicon Valley bank, but to his credit He's like look yeah, I got money there I got money all over the place a lot of people have been hit by this when you're talking about 200 billion dollars of deposits that that covers a broad swath of territory I mentioned to you the massive Swiss bank credit Swiss Which is pleading now with the Swiss central bank for support shares of credit Suisse have gone down 30% Also Moody's in the S&P jumping in with different cuts to the status Downgrades I should say to the status of bonds of some of these banks first Republic Bank for example now at junk status and the big four banks are in a difficult spot for right now not not a Parallist spot, but they're their stocks are a little bit down today Let's I don't overstate anything here, but the stocks are the people are worried obviously people are concerned and I think what you're really gonna have to look for is the rate hike Going up the Fed the Fed hiking rates the next time around if they do that I Think you got to assume we're heading into recession probably if they don't do that Well, then we're just gonna keep having inflation Continue to eat away your savings and make everything more expensive and there is no good option here and That actually makes sense and I think that's the part of this that's so hard This is the cause and effect portion of our monetary policy and our national financial reality That if you spend too much money you will create inflation and then if you spend too much money And try to bring inflation down by bringing interest rates up you will have a reduction in the money supply and economic activity and a likely recession They keep saying well if we do it the right way if we just do it just enough. It's gonna be perfect There are a lot of assumptions built into that and I think given that we just saw a Bank run and some bank failures that seemingly came out of nowhere. They didn't of course They were growing for a long time, but we certainly weren't hearing about it You got to be prepared for What do they say expect the unexpected in the financial world or rumsfeldian unknown unknowns Rumsfeld was quite a character back in his day very smart very impressive guy Rackward didn't turn out the way it was supposed to but the rumsfeld was an interesting fellow now I'd mentioned to you switching gears here I just want to keep I'm keeping an eye on the financial realities and I'm also reaching out. I mean I've got We see we got a couple of them We got a couple of MBAs in my family. We got a banker in my family I mean I got a lot of people that I can tap for their knowledge of how these systems work and and then all what I was graduating from college The two jobs that everybody went into at least out of my school. I went to Amherst Up in Massachusetts, which yes is one of these places that is woke and has completely lost its mind If it ever had a mind to lose even when I was there, but Amherst and many other schools Everybody went into investment banking or management consulting that was I went into the CIA different path but investment banking management consulting those are the two things that people wanted to do and I do think that a lot of that world has changed dramatically in the past 20 years Such that well anyway, I try to encourage people to do things that they at least would like to do You want to find that sweet spot for anyone who's listening who's Still figuring out what their career might be or if you got kids who are gonna be thinking about this soon You want to find something that you are both? Interested in not that you it's a job, right? It's not it's not you're not gonna pay to get a back rub There's gonna be work. There's gonna be frustration. There's gonna be time. There's gonna be a lot of stuff You have to give to it, but something you are interested in and that you can be compensated enough for your lifestyle choice That's what I try to tell people so you have to be you have to be willing to do it a lot And grow your skill set within it which requires interest Otherwise, you're just gonna burn out and lose your mind and be miserable and nobody wants that But you also want to make sure you know You know what what the upside of it could be financially now that does not everybody has to be a banker Investment banker try to be a millionaire obviously people are finding out maybe we have too many of those anyway But you know if you're if you're gonna be a You're gonna be a guidance counselor. You're not gonna make a million dollars a year Which is fine, but you just got to know these things when you go into it, right? You've got to understand What role you're taking anyway speaking of colleges? Wellesley college Wellesley College Hillary Clinton's Alma Monter I'm trying to think who else who else there's all these schools have famous people went didn't to matter Did Mattle and all bright go to Wellesley? I want to say that's maybe I'm just making that up I'm just going by memory here folks three hours alive ready. You got to come up with a lot of stuff on the fly but Wellesley College is In the midst of a very interesting debate It's a women's college Right very straightforward You could only go there if you're a woman. I went to college down the street from down the street roughly speaking a few maybe you know seven miles and 12 miles respectively or something away from Smith and Holyo colleges, which are also women's colleges. I believe they're called the seven sister schools, but That that may be I may be mixing some of them up So Wellesley Has a problem on its hands because women who make up the student body. Oh by the way, I'm right. Yeah, Madeline Albright Team did you already know that I then I nailed that one. I don't know why I second-guess myself when it comes to random trivia on the fly I'm pretty solid so Wellesley College has had a referendum. It is non-binding but students have called for the women's college to be open to all non-binary and transgender applicants including trans men So you are now going to have assuming the University or the college in this case allows this you're going to have biological males attending a women's college Now I I do wonder what the real What the rules and regulations for this are going to be But how how would they even judges they say it's if you have been there some verbiage in here That says if you live your life as a woman Then you qualify basically. Oh, sorry Consistently identify as a woman is the the term of art. I think they have used here but the the president Paul Johnson is getting Some pushback she says that Wellesley was founded on the then radical idea that educating women of all socioeconomic backgrounds leads to progress for everyone as a college and community We continue to challenge the norms and power structures That too often leave women and others have marginalized identities behind the students Entirely disagree. They are all freaking out and they are saying that we need to include trans men Right trans men trans Oh, no trans women. Sorry Trans women men who are now identifying as women, you know guys tell you If I were a woman and I am not and I do not identify as one If I were a woman, I would find this all so offensive Honestly, and I guess at some level for men the notion that a man that a trans man would be able to sit down across from me and give me a Lecture on manhood that I would listen to that I would I would want to hear her lived experience about being a man for I don't know six months three months whatever it is as Women have been subjected to as you've seen recently I mean there's this video that's circulating everywhere of Drew Barrymore who has a daytime TV show which I I didn't know it was possible to have a lower IQ show than the view but there is a Drew Barrymore daytime TV show and And she's kneeling and hugging the trans woman who went to the White House and Biden sat down with and and the trans woman who was Lecturing women on womanhood basically or saying you know, this is let me tell you all about my womanhood as a guy It just this every guy I every guy that I know without exception Would just think it was absurd to the point of they wouldn't it wouldn't even connect They wouldn't even pay attention if a transgender man a biological female sat down You know cutter hair short Warra we're like a you know a plaid shirt, you know, it's a little big and Started telling the guys about what it is to be meant Look if people want to dress however they want cut their hair They're what that's all fine. No problem with that of course But the notion that we're supposed to see the superficialities of style choice as Somehow indicative of the innate and immutable characteristic of one's gender What sex you are is crazy you can sit any woman in the world down across from a man and Doesn't matter what she identifies as the guy is gonna sit there and be like I'm not I'm not listening to well a normal man of you know reasonable Mind and testosterone levels would sit there and say I'm not going to listen to this but women are being told now that it's almost as though they have something to learn from the Transwomen who have been women for like a few minutes or a few months or whatever I just find it. I find it on behalf of women. I want to be offended. I guess I can't do that because I'm not a woman, but I would find it just so oh so someone Speaks in a high sort of a high voice grows their hair long. Maybe has Breast implants put in and puts a lot of makeup on their face and now they understand what it is to be a woman That's because they say so This is where we are. I would be fascinated to be in these wellesley classrooms where these trends male students are being in Or I think they're already being admitted. I can't even keep up. I think if you're Like non-cisgender Stuff is difficult. I know or he's speaking circles about it because it runs in circles the whole thing is absurd But yes, we are at the stage now where women's colleges are admitting men Under the idea that they're actually women and This is what is happening Whether it's official at wellesley yet or not or whether it's just cisgender non-binary or actually trans or whatever That is where we are. I bring this up Well for a lot of reasons, but it reminds me what we're talking about the last hour with vermont and the school system and competing against men and I would just say you know women having to compete against men They keep telling you that this isn't the plan and it absolutely is they're lying to you This is their agenda that we are reacting to they're the ones that have picked this fight So we are the ones that are gonna have to win it I Speaking of testosterone did you know that testosterone levels in the average male in this country have dropped about 50 percent in the last 50 years? That is not a good trend, but there's something you can do about it without taking prescription medication Check out chalk natural supplements chalks male vitality stack contains an herbal ingredient that has been proven to restore 20% of the decrease testosterone in three months time That's a noticeable difference in energy and stamina to learn more about the male vitality stack and other Salk supplements.

I want to open up lines to current or former military listening to this Right now because the pentagon is briefing as we're speaking to you On the russian jet Hitting and bringing down that us reaper drone And it has turned into general mark millie the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff And loyd austin the secretary of defense Just just talking about the blank check for you crayon. I mean we got to get them more more stuff faster more stuff faster That is all I ever hear from DC the pentagon the brass the white house There never it remember in the beginning there was uh, and this was the same by demonstration in the beginning There was hey, I don't know. We shouldn't you know, we shouldn't give them planes. No fly zone that can get messy. We but That was the only place that I could see so far there has been a line drawn Other than we're not going to just have us us military actively killing uh russian forces Open conflict declaration of war with russian. Yeah, okay. Everyone so far has agreed that we shouldn't do that But should we do this? I just feel like we we had 20 years of war in the middle east and south asia and we've had millions of Veterans go through those conflicts. I think I think it's something like three million americans Two to three million americans are in that range. I believe went down range in iraq afghanistan and other g watt hot spots you know global war on terror hot spots and We we couldn't you know, donald trump somehow kept us from starting or getting involved in any new wars for four years now we're here and we're Getting drawn deeper and deeper into the biggest conflict in europe since world war two a modern a modern war with militaries that Are you know losing large numbers of soldiers and there seems to be no end in sight? And right now in general milli is saying that russian troops are demoralized and on train Okay, you know, and i'm not I'm not saying that's untrue. You know, he has a lot more access and stuff than i It used to be more interesting when i talk about afghanistan I saw everything that the generals saw etc I mean I was it's a whole story about that I could maybe tell another time but I for a period of time I was seeing all the country level assessments everything at the top secret level and all this stuff and I gotta tell you I would just want to ask general milli right now. Okay. So are we saying that russia is going to lose? Because you're leading us to believe that russia is about to lose this thing It's just a matter of when and it's months away not years away If it is years away Be honest with the american people about that That's what I would want someone to push them on If your cell phone service is with Verizon T mobile or 18t There's a good chance you're spending far too much every month You can get the same quality of service with pure talk and say 50 or 60 dollars a month or more The average size family is saving over $900 a year when they switch from one of the big guys $900 save and still enjoying ultra-fast 5g service from pure talk Your talk is so sure you're gonna love their service They're backing it up with a 100% money back guarantee So you get a limited talk text plenty of data for 30 bucks a month Pure talk has been my cell phone company now for about a year more than that The only thing that i've noticed is the lower bill i get each month other than that everything else is better Oh, well, that's better too obviously another bonus knowing you're supporting a veteran owned company with an entirely us based customer service team dial pound 250 say clay and buck to say 50% off your first month That's pound 250 say clay and buck restrictions apply seaside for details We are being told right now by loyd austin the secretary defense. He just said it Moments ago is about the rules based international order Oh Okay, uh, I can tell you What I want to go and fight in ukraine to Protect the rules based international order. I don't think so what do we do about uh China just breaking its agreements with hong kong and violating the rules based international order by effectively, uh Consuming whatever freedoms hong kong had and uh and ending them Um, we knew very much There are a lot of things where we don't do very much because it's a big world out there And the pentagon is still going through this briefing and it's Here here's what we know we had a Uh, su 27 russian fighter jet That collided with an mq-9 reaper drone a us drone surveillance drone in international water over the black sea And the russians are saying it's our fault. We're saying it's their fault There's also reporting that there was a fuel dump So planes obviously can drop fuel midair if they want to get lighter or you know, whatever the pilots in the audience can fill in more on that and They say that they dumped fuel on the drone and that brought it down And the drone is down in the black sea and we are Trying to recover it right now because of the technology involved and obviously the us investment These drones cost many many millions of dollars Um, so there was this was an act of of aggression the russians had to know that this was ours And they decided to they decided to mess with our with our drone now the su 27 was able to land and The russian defense ministry by the way saying that The us drone was flying near the russian border and trutered in an area that the russians declared off limits scrambled fighters to intercept the drone Claim that it's not look, you know, this is where we get to the back and forth obviously I'm as team america as anybody's ever going to get and i'll say that and i'll fight it to fight on that issue until my my dying breath But you know, not everything the government tells us is entirely true So I do want to look and see what the possibilities are here You know, I don't know who blew up the russian pipeline It wasn't the russians folks. It wasn't the russians that much we know that was a while ago remember that one Um, unless the russians like to make themselves more poor for some reason when they have Basically their entire economy hinging on whether they can get enough fossil fuel to market Uh, so i'm just looking at this and i'm trying to come up with Where this is all supposed to go. I mean, what are we really going to do? You know, lindsey grammes out there saying that there should be accountability Okay, what does that look like? We've sanctioned russia globally. We are giving the russians opponents the Ukrainians All I mean basically whatever we can give them that will help them right now short of a no fly zone aircraft and uh, you know, I don't know probably some other advanced systems, but we're giving them a lot of stuff A lot of military material and they're killing a lot of russians with it A lot of russians are dying Uh from missiles artillery rounds bullets, etc that we are providing you crayon with So this notion that over the drone incident there's going to be accountability. I just hear i'm like, hmm I don't like empty rhetoric from people that are supposed to be above it and thinking more strategically What does if accountability means calling the ambassador and being very upset? Okay, sure we can do that. I'm sure we've done that But Is this supposed to be an indicator of something else another shift in policy? That's where I get concerned Uh, we've got a lot we got a lot of military that listens to this show, uh, obviously a lot of current and former military I want to bring in some of your voices on this one Uh, tim in harrisburg pennsylvania retired air force pilot tim. What are you what are you see going on here? No, i'm not a retired air force pilot. I'm retired air force Oh retired air force. Sorry. Go ahead. Sir. Yeah, I think we'll be in manipulated and Our usual response and people know if there's a crisis somewhere we want to jump in and help in some fashion or another But I think we're being manipulated. I think we're bleeding down our resources We never get paid back for for what we do. You know, there's no Uh, there's no recompense for it Uh, I think the problem is that the movers and shakers on an international level are Thinking strategically and we continue to react technically. It's like playing check And somebody else playing chess That's what I think I appreciate calling in tim. Thank you and thank you for your service Terrence is a former fighter pilot down in san rosa beach, florida the sunshine state. What's going on? Terrence Hey, good to talk to you. I do have to say the first time I talk or listen to you you were talking about the paris uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh climate, uh, uh, uh, uh, A court? Yeah, sure. Yeah that that night and I said, hey, this guy's not uh, this guy's pretty smart Because you were saying that's right. I wanted to say that night Anyway, um Dude or bringing down the drone. I guess it didn't shoot it down. We don't know that Uh, the fuel dump thing. I didn't know they had dump on and we had dump on our f4 But we didn't have dump on our f16 So, uh, how they brought it down is uh, to be Found out later if we ever find the thing in the uh, the uh, Can I just ask you about what what so you said there you flew an air airframe that did have fuel dumped What what's the what why do you use fuel dump? What's that for? Is it just if you got to get lighter? I mean, what's the circumstance you'd want to do that? uh, f4 had fuel dump and uh, uh, Uh, what would you would do is immediately after takeoff you could dump your internal or your wing fuel not your internal fuel And you would dump that to get lighter to land in the case of emergency same thing with airliners that flew, um Boeing 767s Boeing 777s and they uh, they had dump on it for the same reason You know, you're on fire immediately after takeoff you started Getting rid of the fuel I gotta assume right the the the russian su 27 Involved here far. I'm guessing it's you know, they're saying it was the aggressor here It's highly maneuverable the russian pilot must have known that this was a drone got close to it So they they brought it down. Is there a way they could bring it down? Uh, I mean, I like I guess the best way it has it. How do you think they brought it down? Because initially they said there was a collision. I mean could could the plane have clipped the wing I have to say that the fuel dump thing is as bogus because it evaporates So rapidly vaporize as soon as you dump And there would be no way that how would you measure how far to get in front of the thing and then start dumping in front of it Uh unless you had somebody on the wing telling you how to back up into this drone which would be Something unless it did a lot of times wouldn't be real safe So that drone was brought down some other way than being Fuel dumped in front of it Uh, so is it fair to say though that in a fighter plane airframe like the russian su 27 Any kind of intentional like You know back in the day of ship warfare If you could get uh back in the day of galley warfare for example or tri-reams If you could get your bow lined up against the Against the star bird or or stern of the other person right Um if you get your your front you could slice right through them and your boat would be fine There's a be but a plane you're not going to clip the wing of a of a drone intentionally right because you'd risk your own plane Yeah, right well you have there are there we're tipping Things that the british used to do with the uh the buzz bombs they tip them They come up and and put their wing underneath of it and tip it over Okay, flip over. Oh, yeah, and then we I flat I flew air defense in taiwan Um back in the uh the early 70s mid 70s And uh, we actually had a ramming procedure. It wasn't that anything that I was wanting to do uh, but Yeah, I can imagine why The ramp I mean so It's that that tipping procedure I mean something they must have done something here because it doesn't sound like They uh, they fired. I mean, I think we would know they fired a missile, right? So it sounds like they there was some other mechanical way they brought it down. Thank you for calling in Uh, it's fun to get a fighter. So you get a fighter pilot it calls in right away Actually, we had a we had a fighter pilot over here yesterday carries dad who was an f15 f 18 pardon me navel aviator F 18. I gotta get this stuff right Uh f 18 pilot. So that was uh, maybe I'll ask him next time I see him he might be over Uh by the end of the week. I'm gonna ask him. How could you how could you take out A reaper drone when you're in a fighter plane without shooting it. What would be the way you would do that Home movies might be a thing in the past at least in the traditional sense of someone in the family lugging around a video camera to every event Nowadays we rely on our phones to record everything But back in the day video cams ruled when was the last time you saw your old family movies Aren't there some memories you want to relive on those videotapes that you've got stored away Well, you can rely on our friends at legacy box to help bring new life to your old media By unlocking those trapped family memories and digitizing them legacy box has founded over 10 years ago to help families preserve their past Before it's too late and now they've helped over a million and a half families do just that A great company with 200 highly trained technicians that hand transfer every one of your tapes film more photos Returning them all to you along with brand new digital files legacy box is offering an amazing 50 off their regular prices right now go to legacy box dot com slash buck order today Take advantage of these low prices and send in your aging media when you're ready.

We have we have an actual drone pilot bruce In new mexico bruce talk to us Hey y'all. Um, yeah was the uh mq1 and q9 sme at the pentagorus sme being somebody bad expert for four years What can I tell you about the nq9 that will help? How could they have brought this thing? I mean your I hope you heard the conversation with the uh f4 pilot How could they have brought this thing down? Well, it's they're they're very fragile to tell you the truth and they're that bent that way Specifically to be light and be able to go airborne the mq9 Uh, I don't know which version they had but you know a full 24 hours worse Uh, if they're not carrying any ordinance on it Uh and just a bunch of gas normally we did in q9's around 18 hours in q2 on it's about 20 21 hours But they're light they're fragile and you could clip a wing and do some damage Um, you could get in front of it and and cause enough Perbulence to actually break lock with the satellites and send it into a s really It's possible and if if he was if they were just stupid and they clipped the prop with their radar dome Which he may have done It would have shattered the the uh fiberglass prop Do you do you think by the way that I'm gonna asking now for the uh, the man side of the Aerial equation and the expertise you can give us on this one Uh, do you think that the pentagon is planning to do? Massive training and then uh, or you know a training program and then deployment of American planes not man by us obviously by Ukrainian pilots But is that going to get introduced into this theater warfare? Do you think in the future? You know, that's that's a really good question. I think it would be rather silly Uh, if if we want to give them the hardware and let them do it Okay, fine. Uh, the other thing I wanted to say was a Lindsey Graham needs to check himself before he wrecks All of us that was a piece of fiberglass that we send up and One of the reasons we like it so much is because there's not a little pink butt sitting in the seat of that Yeah, it's a different. I mean we all can recognize it's a different thing to shoot Yeah, it's expensive, but uncle sam's got pretty deep pockets to bring a drone down Is a very different thing than shooting a pilot out of the sky and having his family given a folded flag Right. I mean we all rush in american. Anybody would understand that so I I don't know. I don't know why people listen to Lindsey Graham on this stuff. I mean he's a senator and He's been in the game a long time. Thank you for calling in bruce for new mex car. I appreciate it We got it. We got it. This is what I always love. I can sit here with this audience. It is amazing I can crowdsource particularly on firearms history anything military related I can crowdsource the most specific question imaginable and I'll get an answer. I could ask somebody Hey, if the third widget from the left on the rotor of a Of a black hawk helicopter has come a little bit loose. What can I use in my toolbox? I will have like a night stalker Mechanic calling in within within five minutes telling me exactly how to fix it's amazing what we can bring to bear on this show Um, anyway, uh, we've got call. I mean we got some emails and to I wanted to get to Uh, let's see this one This instance from andy And it goes to the trump Disantis Throwdown, which is it's underway folks. It's happening now, right? We didn't want to get ahead of ourselves But you know, there's there's friendly fire getting thrown around here. That's that's what's going on I clay and buck and we better I suppose if the donald made nice and acted a bit more civil toward disantis But don't hold your breath president trump for all his brilliance and common sense Though he showed terrible judgment with some of his picks the people he picked We're living through a very crass and vulgar age in america And who is the crass vulgarian with the common touch of course the man of the hour sent by the lord some say I personally am sitting on the 50 yard line on this though. I have voted for him twice And will again a third time though somewhat leery He leaves versei on the atlantic to give a rally to the trailer park in alabama to people that are holding on to being middle class Is this what politics is so? You know, he says don't is right in the war in ukraine Um, etc, etc. Thank you best andy look Ah You know people are gonna get this is gonna be a very passionate debate And people feel very strongly about i people reaching out to me on both sides and it's interesting because Every the the people that I know who want to san tis to win this primary Are all Overwhelmingly saying things like I voted for trump twice. I respect him so much. I like him so much the trump people Who now when I say trump people, although for trump obviously if he's a nominee any republicans should vote for trump if he's a nominee We're just talking about primaries right now, but people who have already said they're all in on trump They don't say to san tis is a clown. I don't like um, he's a no no they say he's a very good governor his time will come So it's really interesting because you're gonna see this huge fight but both sides respect the primary combatant that is the choice of the other side I feel like that's that's uncommon. I'm really seeing this a lot, you know the people that are the most Arden trump primary voters to be obviously it hasn't happened yet They all tell me they think the san tis has done an amazing job in florida and he's you know He's deserves a lot of credit and his day will come that's what that's what i'm hearing I mean not from absolutely everybody but 95 And all the de san tis people I know are saying trump is amazing He built this movement, but we think because of his age yada yada To be very interesting to see where this all plays out and where it goes and We're excited to be a part of that conversation with all of you. Thanks for hanging out with us. Talk to you tomorrow"
