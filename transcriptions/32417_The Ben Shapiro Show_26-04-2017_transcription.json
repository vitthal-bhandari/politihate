    "text": " On Saturday, leftists around the nation took to the streets to sound off about their new religion. Science! No, not testable hypotheses and well-constructed experiments. Science! You know, like gay rights and abortion and global redistributionism and dying polar bears and stuff. Leading the charge was eminent scientific revolutionary Bill My The Science Guy, a mechanical engineering degree holder who got famous as a children's television presenter. And I was a keynoter at the March for Science where he said, quote, We are marching today to remind people everywhere our lawmakers especially of the significance of science for our health and prosperity. What sort of science was nice standing up to defend? Budget increases for the EPA and the National Institutes of Health, of course. He explained how all of this was scientific and not political. He said somewhere along the way, there's developed this idea that if you believe something hard enough, it's as true as things discovered through the process of science. And I will say that's objectively wrong. Belief is in science. This is a good point. Unfortunately, Nye then followed up his widely praised appearance at the March for Science by unleashing a video that destroyed the internet from his news show Bill Nye saves the world. He trotted out crazy ex-girlfriend actress Rachel Bloom to sing a very special song. Those are nice words. She warbled and hears the dramatic read. My vagina has its own voice, not vocal cords, a metaphorical voice. Sometimes I do a voice for my vagina. Cos my sex junk is so, oh, oh, oh. Much more than either or or or. Power bottom or power top. Versatile love may have some butt stuff. It's evolution. Ain't nothing new. There's nothing taboo about a sex stew. This is real. This happened. If they're alive, I'll date them. Chanting or genitatum. I'm down for anything. Don't box in my box. Science! If these all seems rather unscientific to you, if you wonder why a talking vagina with obvious self-control problems is being trotted out by the self-proclaimed science guy, you're not alone. You're rational. You might even be using some scientific thinking. But this is demonstrative of the left's take on science. Science is actually just the name for anything left likes. Worried about the humanity of an unborn child, concerned that fetuses have their own blood types and their own DNA, stop it. You're quoting science, not science. Wondering how it is that a genetic male is actually a woman, you're worrying about science, not science. This is the dirty little secret of the left's sudden embrace of science. It's not science that they support, but religion. They support that which they believe but cannot prove and do not care about proving. Bill Nye isn't interested in a scientific debate about global warming. How much is occurring, the measurement techniques it issued, the sensitivity of the climate to carbon emissions, the range of factors that affect the climate. He wants you to accept his version of the truth. Not just that global warming is happening, but that massive government intervention is necessary in order to avert imminent global catastrophe. Such government solutions aren't verifiably scientific. They're speculative. But that speculation has cost, particularly to the most impoverished people on the planet who benefit disproportionately from cheap carbon-based fuels. Even if you accept the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimate that sea levels will rise by two feet over the course of the rest of the century and the temperature will rise about seven degrees Fahrenheit, there is reason to question, as Oren Cass points out, whether or not massive government intervention is necessary or even justifiable. But the left refuses to acknowledge such questions. It makes you a denier to disagree with the left's conclusions, just as it makes you a cruel person to wonder whether gun control will actually lower the American murder rate. Science, in other words, is just a baton for the left. A decade ago, the left declared President Bush anti-science for his restrictions on the use of new federally funded fetal stem cell lines. They claimed that Bush hated science, that fetal stem cells were the wave of the future, that Bush was a moral aetola in the words of Senator Tom Harkin. Democrats ran on the promise that if Bush were thrown out of office in 2004, they'd make Christopher Reeve walk again using fetal stem cells. But it turned out fetal stem cells were unnecessary to scientific research. Scientists came up with an embryo-free process to produce genetically matched stem cells. As Charles Krauthammer, no religious fundamentalist and a guy who, by the way, is paralyzed, wrote at the time, rarely has a president so vilified from moral stance than so thoroughly vindicated. Why? Precisely because he took a moral stance. In other words, Bush didn't rely on science to give him his values, nor should he have. Science is not capable of making value-laden decisions. There are plenty of obig ains who know better than the most pro-life conservative just how complex life is in the womb, yet they will perform abortions. Science has not dictated their behavior. The Nazis were famously pro-science, declaring that science itself mandated the killing of the unfit for the strengthening of the race. Their race is most supposedly scientific. That's why the march for science is such foolishness. If the march were simply focused on advocacy for increased EPA funding, that would be political, not scientific. If the marchers were demanding more funding for the NIH too, that too would be political, but with a stronger scientific component. But the march for science was actually a march for science, the leftist religion. And that leftist religion isn't interested in science in the slightest. It's simplistic and simple-minded virtue signaling. I'm Ben Shapiro. This is The Ben Shapiro Show. OK, I have much more to say about science, and we'll also give you the update on what's going on with Ann Coulter at Berkeley. We'll give you the update on the healthcare negotiations.

OK, so the Democrats continue to harp about science, and their new favorite science people are, obviously they love Caitlyn Jenner, because Caitlyn Jenner is an emissary for science, which is silly. But the other person who's the emissary for science is Bill Myda Science Guy, which just demonstrates the left, which claims that it's just terrible. We have a celebrity president. The person that they are trotting out as their lead spokesperson for science is a guy with a mechanical engineering degree from Cornell, right, in like 1979. That guy is the scientist who they think is the expert on all things scientific, and that means that Bill Myda is pushing his version of science. What does his version of science look like? Well, again, he has this idiotic show on Netflix called Bill My Saves the World, and as I said yesterday, spoiler alert, he doesn't. Here is a segment from that horrible show in which he says that three-year-olds should be able to choose their own gender. By three or four, most kids identify with a gender, and it doesn't always match the sex they were assigned at birth, and a person's gender identity may change over their lifetime. And culture is getting us new ways to express all of this. How you dress, how you act, talk, how you present yourself to the world. It should be up to you. Sure, this might make things confusing for those who insist everyone pick an M or an F. But people, we have to listen to the science. And the science says we're all on a spectrum. Okay, science does not say you're on a spectrum of sex. When they say gender, see, this is what the left likes to do, and it's really, really stupid. Okay? The left says that gender is a social construct. And what they mean by that is femininity and masculinity are social constructs. Here is the truth about that. There are certain aspects of masculinity that are certainly not a social construct. Higher levels of testosterone, average higher levels of violence by males than females. That is not a social construct. That is a biological reality. Okay? So that is not an aspect of gender that's more an aspect of sex. The left likes to conflate sex and genders. They separate these two things. They say sex is your biology. And then they say that gender is a social construct that says you need to be masculine or you need to be feminine. Now, not a lot of people that I know actually care whether you act masculine or whether you act feminine per se, but that's not choosing a gender. Okay? That's just whether you ask masculine or feminine. Then what the left does is they say your masculinity or femininity, we can now read back into your sex. So in other words, if you are a feminine man, right? If you're a man who is biologically male and you act feminine, maybe you're a woman. Okay? This is stupid and a scientific. There's no evidence for it at all. It is also evil to suggest that a three year old knows that they're going to choose a gender that is opposite of the one that they have. Okay? Three year olds don't know anything. I know because I have a three year old. Three year olds do not know anything. It is your job as an adult to teach them about things that are complex and make the complex simple in ways that they can understand. And if when they hit 15, they're still having problems, then we can have conversation about this. But this idea that three year olds are capable of choosing their gender is asinine. Anyone who has a three year old will tell you this. And it is cruel to a three year old to say to the three year old that you're going to be allowed to define your own essence of the world and you're going to be allowed to override your own biology. A three year old is not capable of doing that. And there is no science to support this. What he has is anecdotal evidence saying that people who are 20 say when I was three, I felt like a girl in a boy's body. Okay? That is not scientific evidence that there is some brain test we can run that determines you are actually a girl in a boy's body. There's no scientific evidence to that effect. The idea that he is saying this is purely anti-scientific. But again, it's a political agenda masquerading of science. I'm old enough to remember when Bill Nye was on to my television explaining that sex was a function of chromosomes. And that was actual science. And now he's saying sex is a function of whatever in your head and it can change over time. Your gender can change over time. And again, the left likes to play this word game where they say, well, we don't mean your sex can change over time. We mean your gender can change over time. And they say, well, what do you mean by that? And they say, well, it means you can be a woman. Okay, now you're talking about sex again. That's not the same thing. If you're going to separate out the two terms, you have to be very specific in how you use gender. If you mean that there can be a person who changes their behavior over time, bucking particular stereotypes about feminine and masculine, then I'm sure it's true because people do it every day. What is not true is that you can change your sex. And the left conflates the two after separating them out. They like to pretend that everything that is feminine is not linked to sex. And then they pretend that if you are masculine as a girl, that means that you must be actually secretly a man. Or you can choose to be a man, which is just as scientifically stupid. Three-year-olds should not choose their own gender. Parents who do this to their child are doing something evil to their children. Your goal in life is not to confuse your children. Your goal in life is to simplify things for your children. Again, three-year-olds are not capable of making these types of decision and damning a child to a lifetime of suffering is just cruel. The studies show that eight in 10 kids who at any point suffer from any sort of gender identity issues grow out of that by the time they hit their teenage years. And what he is saying is that we should tell all kids, 100 out of 100 kids, we should tell them all they can pick their sex. So now you're telling a bunch of three-year-olds, who are by nature dumb, that they can pick their sex. They can't. And it is a lie. And then beyond that lie, you're now confusing a 103-year-old. So let's take it statistically. Let's even pretend that Bill Nye was right. Let's pretend that it is biologically decided that you're a boy in a girl's body or some such nonsense, which is just not true. And again, there's no scientific evidence to suggest that you're a boy in a girl's body. In fact, even the people who say that brain scans show differences between transgender people and people who are not transgender, even those say that it is a transgender brain, but it does not mean that you have a woman's brain and a man's body. It just means that you have differences from the traditional male brain. That even that is really scanty evidence, but that's the furthest that good scientists will go. And to say anything different is just not scientific. But let's take this statistically and assume that the left is even correct. Okay, so the transgender suicide rate over the course of a lifetime is 40%. Less than one person per 100 is going to be transgender in the United States. It's just very, very rare. Okay. And it's getting more common now because it's become kind of trendy. And because if you're a teenager and you want attention, then you can do it. Or if you have doubts, then we have decided that we are going to promulgate those doubts into reality. So even if you're not just trying to do it for some nefarious reason, if you have doubts, we're now trying to reinforce those doubts as a society. But let's use the numbers on hand. So like say, one out of 100 kids has gender identity disorder or gender dysphoria. Okay. Now you're talking about that kid having a 40% lifetime suicide rate. There's no evidence that that is mitigated in any significant way by society's acceptance of transgenderism. Now you're saying that let's say that there are 100 kids who are told that they can pick their gender. And 10 of those kids are now confused, right? Not even 100. 10 of those kids are now confused. And let's say that normally, according to those statistics, virtually all of them would grow out of this confusion. And virtually all of them would grow out of this confusion. But now you're reinforcing the confusion. So now let's say those 10 all say, I'm the other sex. So now you've taken a situation in which one kid had a transgender identity issue and has a 40% lifetime suicide rate. And you're now extending that to 10 kids. And let's even say that this new process lowers that one kid's rate of suicide attempt. Let's say that it, of suicidality, let's say that it lowers it from 40% to 20%. Let's say it halves it. Okay. Now if you've increased the number of people who are engaging in this particular, in this particular problem, by three, if you have confused three more kids, then you now have four kids. Now let's not even take the 10. Let's say you now have four out of 100 who have a 20% suicide rate as opposed to one out of 100 who has a 40% suicide rate. You have not improved things. You've made things worse in terms of people who are suicidal, for example. Okay. This is just to take the statistical case. But again, there is no moral case for confusing your child. Sex differences are important. Reinforcing sex differences is important because if you don't want your child to suffer from tremendous cognitive dissonance, then the kid at least has to know about the standard. And then later they can choose whether or not they want to engage in the standard. But the fact is the standard is the standard and the standard is not entirely constructed by society. It wasn't like every society in the world came up with the idea that men were going to be soldiers and women were going to be mothers. Okay. There's a lot more to that than just society's deciding things. So this is all stupidity. But again, it's not science. It is politics. And Bill Minds did another one of these things. Again, this show is just so awful. I don't know how Netflix even green lit it, except there are a bunch of leftists. Bill and I ran a segment about sexuality of ice cream. Yes, really. Of course, enlightened and forward thinking. But not everyone sees it this way. But there are lots of flavors to sexuality. Like, why are we here, Vanilla? Damn. Oh, this again? Come on. Shrek's. Settle, everybody. Settle. Now, I've spoken to some of you about my theories on the nature of being ice cream. Which have no basis in science. It's the science of feelings. And as Vanilla, I feel that I am the most natural of the ice creams. And therefore, the rest of you should just go ahead and also be Vanilla. It's the one true flavor. No! That's that for a second. So obviously, the implication is here. There are a bunch of religious fanatics who want everybody to be straight. And if they're not straight, then we're going to force them to be straight. Okay, a couple of things that are worth noting here. The reality is that biologically speaking, it is more conducive to evolution and the species for people to be heterosexual. This does not mean that everybody has to be heterosexual. We should use the government to force people. God forbid to engage in sexual activity of some sort. But this idea that all sexual behavior is created equal. In terms of its benefit to the species is just not true. That's just not true. That is a feelings driven position. But again, they're going to push this idea. Again, I'm waiting to hear who out there is saying that everybody needs to be straight. I don't think that every like, there are not a lot of people out there saying everybody needs to be straight. There are people who are religious. I'm a religious person. I may think that it is sinful for people to engage in particular types of sexual congress. But that's my prerogative. You may think I'm wrong. Congratulations. It's a free country. You can be a strawberry delicious. Oh, Christ. But no one can make you stop being strawberry. Strawberry. You're strawberry. Hope be salted, Carl. I just think if you want to get right with the big ice cream in the sky, change your flavor by wishing to be vanilla. What if the big ice cream in the sky is chocolate? Last for me. Everyone should pretend to be vanilla until they no longer have the urge not to be vanilla. I did not urge to be pistagio. I am pistagio. Hey, mint chocolate chip. Sorry I'm late. How is busy being two awesome things at once? Cool. Ah, not cool. Pickle lane, butts dane. The zillow's trying to convert us all again. That's nuts. No offense nuts. Come on, but no one. Nobody wants just one flavor of ice cream. I do. Haven't you ever wanted to be an anneapolitan? I can't. I can't. Come on. It's natural. All natural cocoa. And strawberry fresh from the field. It's so creamy and delicious. Hey guys, can you come in the sky and help me? It's good. It's like giving up. Me, just the bowl. Okay, so in other words, everything is natural except for heterosexuality. Got it? That is the bottom line is that all religious people are secretly repressed people who want to have orgies with members of the same sex, bisexuals, transgender people. And if they could just taste all the other flavors of the rainbow, everything would be wonderful. I love this idea that biology does not dictate heterosexuality, but it dictates that you are supposed to have sex with everything that moves. Okay, there is no scientific basis for anything that is in this video. This idea, I guess the idea is that everybody's sexuality is on a spectrum. First of all, here's what the science actually says about this. What it says is that female sexuality is more malleable based on environment and genetics. Male sexuality is a lot more binary. Okay, this is what every study ever done on sexuality has said. Men tend to be either very gay or very straight, and women tend to, there is a spectrum of sexuality for women. Whatever, the bottom line is that when they say that basically straight people are secretly gay, but you can't say that a gay person is secretly straight or has tendencies in that direction. Amazing how all this works, but again, it's propaganda. It's not science, and it's not even good. I mean, it ends with ice cream having sex with each other or something. I'm just confused. Ice cream doesn't have, just on a scientific basis, folks. Ice cream does not have genitalia. Okay, and if it does, don't eat it because that's not ice cream. Okay, so before we move on, I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at macwellden.com.

Okay, meanwhile, in the non-Bill My News, and I know we just spent a lot of time on Bill My, but that's because I think that this is used as propaganda by the left. Again, the idea, there's also something else here that I think is worth noting on that idiotic ice cream video. The conflation of biology with morality is really stupid. The idea that we're all biologically built to have sex with everything, and therefore, it's good. And anybody who says that it's bad is wrong. Biology does not make things right. There are a lot of things that are biological that are not right. We all have a tendency to be promiscuous because I am a male. I have a biological drive to have sex with many women. I'm extraordinarily monogamous because I have a religious belief and a moral belief that it would be cruel to my wife to cheat on her, and it would be really bad to cheat on my wife. It is immoral to do that. We have that as a society. That's a good thing that we have that as a society, even if morality is bucking biology. To quote the old movie, The African Queen with Catherine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, nature is what we are put here to rise above. The idea that nature is supposed to dictate your behavior is really pureile and stupid, but it is also the basis of the left's political viewpoint. Okay, in other news, Donald Trump is still pushing for the wall to be built, but it is not happening. It appears that he is now caving on the wall with regard to the budget. The Republicans are also putting together a healthcare plan, but if you want to hear about all of that, you'll have to go over to dailywire.com right now and subscribe. $8 a month will get you a subscription to dailywire.com.

We always appreciate you leaving a review. This is the largest conservative podcast in the United States. Okay, moving on to the politics of the day. So on the healthcare stuff, basically there's a proposal that is now coming out from Republicans to replace the Obamacare regime with something different. And the Obamacare repeal that's being proposed is now being signed off on by the House Freedom Caucus. And the basic idea of it is that it's going to allow states to opt out of the federal regulations. So according to the Hill today, conservatives are starting to come on board because of a new amendment from Tom MacArthur and Mark Meadows that would allow states to apply for waivers to opt out of core Obamacare protection for people with pre-existing conditions, which conservatives say drives up premiums. So far, no moderates have moved from no to yes on the bill. And some centrists have said that MacArthur was not negotiating on their behalf. A lot of moderates are saying, no, no, no, we need to cram down these federal provisions because if we allow states to get rid of the pre-existing conditions on the buying of healthcare, then a lot of people will be thrown off their healthcare. And so it's, and then we will continue to provide federal subsidies, or maybe we won't continue to provide federal subsidies to Medicaid. Bottom line is that Paul Ryan says that the amendment helps us to get to consensus, but he didn't say how close Republicans are to an actual majority. Dave Bratt, a very conservative member of Congress, the guy who replaced our cancer, he says getting the prices and premiums down, that was the big deal. Club for Growth and Freedom Works have both said they would support the bill if the amendment were adopted. They'd urge for a full repeal of Obamacare, but they praise the amendment is a good compromise. So here's my opinion on the amendment. It's better than what was there before, which was basically leave and place all federal regulations about the restrictions on insurance companies, but there is a bit of a problem. So the amendment allows states to apply for a waiver from the community rating requirement, which prevents insurers from charging premiums based on customers' health. If that were appealed, insurance would be allowed to charge people with pre-existing conditioner conditions, much higher premiums due to their illnesses, putting coverage, quote unquote, out of reach for many, according to the Hill. The amendment also allows states to apply for a waiver for Obamacare's essential health benefits. So basically states can now get rid of the federal health regulations if they so choose. That is a step forward. There is one problem. Name the governor who is going to get rid of that provision now. What the governors are going to say is they're going to use the continued existence of Obamacare as an excuse to continue allowing Obamacare to go forward. They're going to say, listen, you know, if they're up to me, I'd get rid of all these restrictions. The prices would go down. It would all be great. But here's the problem. If we do that, then presumably a lot of our benefits are going to be cut under Medicaid, and we're not going to be able to cover all the people who are thrown off of their insurance who have pre-existing conditions. So the question is, who is actually going to opt out? See, there's a difference between an opt out and an opt in. States, the way the federal government is supposed to work is it's supposed to work as an opt in. If you want to create Obamacare in your state, you have that prerogative. Massachusetts did it. But it should not be that the government creates an overall scheme, and then you have the capacity to opt out. The difference being that now the goal of the politician is to throw responsibility on the federal government. Now they'll say, listen, yes, we're giving the ability to opt out. But the problem is that if we opted out, the federal government is also killing the Medicaid reimbursement rates that are giving us block grants now. And so that means that a bunch of people would be throwing off their health insurance, given the restrictions that are already on our ability to promulgate a free market health care system, we are just going to stick with the federal system. And if things go wrong, we'll blame the feds. In other words, you cannot have a federal health scheme that allows an opt out as opposed to a federal health scheme that's freedom based that allows an opt in. So think about it in different terms. Let's assume that, for example, there's a federal law on the books with regard to wearing seatbelts. And the federal government has connected a lot of state highway funds to states picking up these laws and using these laws. Now, state could theoretically say, listen, I don't want that seatbelt law. I think the seatbelt law is violation of personal freedom. You know, it's not going to kill the person in the other car. It's just going to kill you. There's no real reason for you to be involved in that as the federal government. But I don't want to lose the money. And so it would really be stupid for us to lose the money. And sorry, guys, but it's sort of important that we take the money. That's why this isn't enough. And but it is a step in the right direction. If this bill went forward, it would be a major step in the right direction. We'll see if it goes forward at the at the Senate level as well. Put to it what I support this bill. Yeah, I would support this bill as a step toward greater freedom. But if this is the final step, then I don't think that it's enough. I think in the end, Obamacare has to be killed outright. I think that it can't have federal funding. I think that you can't bribe states. You have to get rid of the entire bribery scenario because the minute the Democrat comes in, they're going to reinstate all the restrictions and kill the insurance companies. outright. And then there'll be calls for nationalization. So I think it's a step in the right direction. It is much better than what was being proposed several weeks ago. If this is what happens, this is not a triumph for Trump. It's a triumph for the House Freedom Caucus, which rejected a really crappy bill a month and a half ago and was ripped up and down by Trump. And now they're coming back with something better. Hopefully it goes forward because this is a much better version. Okay, as far as the Trump wall, Trump continues to maintain the wall is going to be built. But yesterday it came out that the budget he's requesting does not actually include the funding for the Trump wall. So here's Trump yesterday awkwardly saying, yeah, we're still going to build the wall. We're just not going to do it right now. The wall is going to get built, folks. Just in case anybody has any question, the wall is going to get built and the wall is going to stop drugs and it's going to stop a lot of people from coming in that shouldn't be here. And it's going to have a huge effect on human trafficking, which is a tremendous problem in this world, a problem that nobody talks about. But it's a problem that's probably worst at any time in the history of this world. Human trafficking, what's going on, the wall is going to get built and we're setting record numbers in terms of stopping people from coming in and stopping drugs from coming in. You see the numbers down 73, 74%. I will say Secretary Kelly, formerly General Kelly, is doing an incredible job. And I was just with him a little while ago and he said, we definitely, desperately need the wall. And we're going to have the wall built. I mean, I don't know what people are talking. I watch these shows and the pundits in the morning. I don't know what they're talking about. The wall gets built. 100%. Thank you very much. Okay. So is it really getting it built? Not with funding this go around. So this budget that he just caved on, I railed about this yesterday, the budget that he just caved on includes funding for Planned Parenthood, includes funding for the Orondale, includes funding for refugee resettlement, sanctuary cities, and now Obamacare subsidies. It has defunded the border walls, this budget that he just caved on. Also, just as a point of fact, no, the human trafficking problem is not worse than it has ever been at any time in the history of the planet. There used to be something called the International Slave Trade. So no on that. But this is the big problem. Okay. So Trump's budget director Mick Mulvaney, who used to be a very conservative member of Congress, now he's saying that he was saying this a couple of days ago that he wanted to trade funding for Obamacare for funding for the border wall. I don't understand why you have to trade anything. You have a majority in both houses of Congress. What the hell are you talking about? But here's Mick Mulvaney saying, let's fund Obamacare. And then maybe they'll give us some funding for our border wall. Is there in that negotiation, you go into it that you will walk away from the table if you don't get. Is it the wall? Well, let's let's let's look at it this way and why this is a critical juncture, I think, not only in this administration, but in Washington, DC. I've said before that the next four days will tell you a lot about the next four years. We finally boiled this negotiation down to something that we want very badly, that the Democrats really don't like. And that's the border wall. At the same time, there's something they want very badly that we don't like very much, which are these cost-sharing reductions of the Obamacare payments. Ordinarily, in a properly functioning Washington, DC, as in any business, this would be the basis upon which a negotiated resolution could be achieved. Question is, how much of our stuff do we have to get? How much are their stuff? Are they willing to take? And that's the way it should work. That's the way that we hope that it works. We'd offer them $1 of CSR payments for $1 of wall payments right now. That's the offer that we've given to our Democrat colleagues. That should form the fundamental understanding that gets us to a bipartisan agreement. If the Democrats come back to us and say, look, we can't do that, we can do this. That's a really, really good sign, not only in the short term and the long term. If they simply walk away and choose to not participate in the discussions, that's a bad sign, not only in the short term, but for the next... Okay, well, they are choosing to walk away because they have apparently all the leverage. Here's Chuck Schumer, the head of the Democratic Party in the Senate, talking about the wall. And he basically says, listen, we've got the upper hand. They're in the minority, guys. They're in the minority. And they're still dictating policy. Senator McConnell wanted me to negotiate the wall with President Trump. I said to him two things. First, it's not a negotiation, no wall. And second, I said only you can persuade him that he shouldn't do the wall because it'll cause a government shutdown. And I don't know if Senator McConnell played a role. If he did more power to him, if he didn't, I'm glad it worked. Out. Okay, so he's basically saying, we're not going to cave in any way, shape or form. If he's not going to stand up now, I don't think he's going to stand up three months from now, or six months from now, I don't see why he would. Rush Limbaugh is saying the same thing I'm saying, and Rush is a bigger fan of Trump than I am. Here's Rush saying it yesterday. It looks like from here, right here, right now, it looks like President Trump is caving on his demand for a measly $1 billion in the budget for his wall on the border with Mako. The Democrats are threatening a government shutdown. It's the same old, same old. And I was hoping that Trump would throw this shutdown thing right back in their face. And have everybody realized they're the ones engineering these shutdowns that nobody would notice anyway, unless a big hula balloon was made about it. The Democrats seem to have successfully used this stupid, silly threat of a government shutdown to get their way. What Trump is saying is if we need to get this done, then I'll delay the spending on the wall until September. And it's just a measly billion dollars. But the problem here is folks is one of politics. If this happens, if Trump does, and I use the word cave guardingly or guardedly, Trump, I'm sure, does not ever think he caves on anything. But outward appearances are what they are. Rush is being as careful as he can in saying this, but the bottom line is that Trump did cave on this pretty obviously he caved on this. And I see no reason why he wouldn't cave in the future on budget deals. If this is the most united his party's ever going to be. So the idea that he's going to suddenly turn around and be captain's strength on the border wall funding, don't see how that is going to happen. Okay, I also want to talk about a scandal that's breaking out at the White House. There are a couple things that are happening at the White House that are not so good. We'll talk about that in just a second. But first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Stamps.com. So we use Stamps.com here in the office because we don't want to deploy our forces down to the post office to wait in line to get those stamps and weigh all the letters and weigh all the packaging. Instead, we use Stamps.com. If you go to Stamps.com, enter Shapiro in the microphone search bar. You get a four week trial with postage and digital scale. So they'll send you the digital scale so you can weigh everything yourself. And then they will give you the postage for four weeks for free. If you go to Shapiro and go to Stamps.com, put Shapiro in that microphone search bar at the very top. It'll save you tons of time. You print it right onto the envelope or you can print it onto a piece of paper and tape it to the envelope. You can print it onto a sticker and use that to put it on the envelope. But it means that you no longer have to wait in line and then you know have to weigh all your postage and trek down to the post office and all of that. It saves you tons of time and time is money. So it saves you money as well. Stamps.com, go over there, check it out. Shapiro in the microphone search bar. Great service. We use them in the office all the time. Okay. So a couple of other issues that have cropped up for the Trump administration. One is that Ivanka Trump is apparently now founding a new charity called the Hillary Clinton Global Initiative. It's actually called like the Ivanka Trump Global Initiative or some such. And she's actually taking money from foreign governments for human rights, which sounds sort of familiar. This makes me rather uncomfortable. I don't think that the daughter of the president of the United States should be doing that, particularly not when she has security clearance and is sitting in his administration. It sets up exactly the same conflict of interest that the Clintons were facing. And if we're not hypocrites, we should be looking at that and saying this is not a great idea. Other things that are not great. Michael Flynn, former national security advisor, it's now coming out that he did not follow the law when it came to revealing that he had taken a trip to Russia and taken money from the Russian government. Apparently, Jason Chaffetz was asked whether Flynn followed the law and he gave this very awkward answer. Yeah. From what you've seen so far, do you believe that Michael Flynn broke the law from either not disclosing it. These payments on the security clearance are not getting permission for getting these foreign payments? Personally, I see no information or no data to support the notion that General Flynn complied with the law. And that is he was supposed to seek permission and receive permission from both the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Army prior to traveling to Russia to not only accept that payment but to engage in that activity. I see no evidence that he actually did that. You think, Congressman, that this could be punishable for up to five years in prison, you said? Yeah. I think it definitely that's why I cited the code. But that's going to be left up to others to decide. We just wanted to know what his exposure is. But clearly, I agree with the chairman. I mean, he was supposed to get permission and he was supposed to report and he didn't. Period. I mean, there's no evidence of it. We're not here to make the final determination. Right. What we're going to do jointly is send the letter to the to the department of the Army, the comptroller specifically, as well as the inspector general there at the Department of Defense. This isn't good stuff. And then as I mentioned yesterday, the White House has refused to turn over documents with regard to any connections between Flynn and the Russians and the Turks. And that's that's not good. Reporters were grilling Sean Spicer about this yesterday. Again, this all could have been prevented. Everyone knew that Flynn was not somebody who should have been a member of the administration. Trump appointed them over everybody's everybody's deep dissent. This could have been avoided pretty easily. Here, reporters grilling Sean Spicer about Flynn. Why is the White House apparently stonewalling the committee on oversight and government reform on its request for some documents that should be in the White House's possession on Mr. Flynn? I will correct you on that. The committee sent a form letter to several agencies, including the White House, asking to find those documents. The documents in question the Department of Defense possessed and sent over to him during the transition. The Trump transition has no custodial possession of any of these documents. I would again, but that's that Flynn filled out as part of the process to become the president's national security adviser. You know, because there's arms like relations. No, no, because there's two there's two issues. He had an SF86, which is the security clearance form that was filled out during the Obama administration. He had a re investigation in 2016. That was done under the last administration. And again, those are those are not documents that the White House would ever possess on any employee. But I also asked the question, does the White House believe that Lieutenant General Flynn might have broken the law when he filled out SF86? I don't that that would be a question for him and and an law enforcement agency, whether or not he filled I don't know what he filled out and what he did or did not do that all happened. He filled that form out prior to coming here and so it would be up to the committee and other authorities to look at that. Okay, but again, it's the White House saying that they're not going to turn over anything after January 20th. So all of this is not a good look for the administration. Trump should be focusing in on policy. He he should be being as cooperative as you can with this stuff. If Flynn made a mistake, Flynn should pay the price for it, not Trump. And it is a mistake for Trump to be misdirecting from policy toward, you know, stupidity like this or toward his his battles about trade. There's now there's now a story today. We'll talk about this tomorrow, probably. There's a story today that Trump is going to pull out an after in the next couple of days to be an idiotic move. It would drive up prices pretty dramatically on many of the basic goods and services that people enjoy here in the United States. But again, you know, this is the sort of swivel to his populist base was coming and the populist base wants more spending and wants more tariffs. None of that is great stuff. Okay, time for some things I like things I hate and then we'll do some Bible talks. So things I like we've been doing great composers, music that maybe you've heard, maybe you haven't, but a little bit less well known than sort of their most famous work. Today we're doing Mozart yesterday with Bach and then we debate open on Monday. So today we'll do a little bit of Mozart. So this is Mozart's flute and harp concerto and see the second movement. And it is a magnificent piece of music. It is one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written, but you know, not quite as famous as as a lot of his more famous works as operas and Inaclin and Bach music and stuff. So here's here is this the second movement of his flute and harp concerto and see. So I may have heard this piece. I'm going to play a little bit in movie Amadeus when he's going through some Mozart's sheet music. Great movie, one of my favorite movies, top five movie for me, is Amadeus. Great, great movie. If you haven't seen it, you definitely should. Great meditation on God and man and music and art. It's just fantastic. But this is a beautiful, beautiful piece. I made a mistake yesterday. I said the Mozart died at 39. Of course he died at 35, which is even more tragic obviously. Okay, other things that I like. So Donald Trump has been ripped up and down. President Trump's been ripped up and down as some sort of supposed anti-Semite. And some of that is because he was catering to the alt-right during the election cycle. But there was really no evidence that Trump was ever anti-Israel or personally an anti-Semite yesterday. He gave a statement on Israel in the Holocaust. That was really first rate. Here was Trump yesterday. The state of Israel is an eternal monument to the undying strength of the Jewish people. The fervent dream that burned in the hearts of the oppressed is now filled with the breath of life and the star of David waves atop a great nation, a risen from the desert. Those who deny the Holocaust are an accomplice to this horrible evil and will never be silent. We just won't. We will never, ever be silent in the face of evil again. The frog, Arden fans, hardest hit. There he is. Good for Trump for saying this. I wish he had said all of this a lot earlier during the campaign, but obviously I don't think that he didn't believe that or anything. Okay, time for some things that I hate. So we could have labeled that entire Bill Mysegment at the top of the show, things I hate. But here's another thing that I hate. So Nordstrom has decided they're going to put out these jeans. And these jeans are covered with fake mud. There's a picture of them. They're covered with fake mud. Barracuda straight leg jeans. There's fake mud all over them. $425 for fake mud. Now you may think that we are such a rich country that we actually have to have fake mud on our jeans. You can't just go out and take irregular crappy jeans and roll around in the mud and come up with this. Like when my jeans look like this when I was a kid, they went directly into the washing machine. Now you actually pay for the privilege. It is a demonstration though that when a country becomes really wealthy, the rich people are so ashamed of their wealth that they start trying to dress like the poor people. And this has been something happening in the United States for a long time. I think there was a cultural shift in the 1930s and 40s. Watch all the movies. All the poor people were trying to dress in suits. Everybody was trying to dress up. You're trying that the whole goal was to look like a rich person. You're supposed to dress nicer, not less nice. And then the 1960s wealth is seen as some sort of curse. What it's seen as something terrible. And now if you're really cool, you're going to wear jeans. And after super cool in the 1990s, you're going to wear torn jeans. Not just jeans that you have pay to have pre-torn. And you're going to wear shirts that are beat up deliberately, that have holes in them because it shows that you're really cool and with it. So now the idea is, I mean, they make fun of it in Zoolander with the derelict line. But this is the basic idea here. When a country aspires to looking like it's poor as citizens, that's not great for the country. And it is also a demonstration that some people who are really rich need to get out and work a little bit in the garden or something. Because the idea that it is, there's some sort of inherent romance to having mud on your jeans, I guarantee you, most of the people with mud on their jeans would be happier if they were not mud on their jeans. They'd be much happier being the kind of people who would afford $425 jeans with mud on them. So it's really kind of degrading, I think, for people who actually work for a living to see this sort of stuff being sold for $425. It's like fake poverty being sold to you so that you can look authentic. It's really stupid. Of course, Nordstrom does sell every so often really stupid things. Last year, they had an $85 rock in a leather pouch, seriously. It was an $85 rock in a leather pouch, apparently, it sold out. Okay, other things that are really stupid. So there's a Jefferson statue over at Columbia University and naturally, naturally, they are now trying to claim that this is the legacy of a man who is the epitome of white supremacy. It's also the legacy of a man who wrote the Declaration of Independence was the president of the United States and was one of the father's of American freedom. So there's that as well. This idea that only one part of his legacy matters, the fact that he was a slaveholder, everybody at the time, or at least a huge percentage of people in the United States at a time were pro-slavery or slaveholders themselves. Jefferson was honest enough to acknowledge the lie and the inherent lie in his own position and then make him a great man with regard to slavery. But that is the complexity of history. And one of the things that annoys me is this idea that we're going to remove monuments that could actually be the spurred to conversations about things like why is it that human beings thought it was okay to enslave other human beings at the same time they were fighting for freedom from an overarching nationalist government in Britain? Why? That would be a good question to ask instead. They've just decided that this thing has to come down. Apparently, one of the groups there, which is called the Mobilized African Diaspora, they put a Klansman hood over Jefferson's head, which is just disgusting. To pretend that he would have been a member of the Klan is ridiculous, or that Jefferson even would have held the same position that he held in 1860, that he held in 1780, is really insulting to Jefferson. They say that venerating Thomas Jefferson validates rape, sexual violence, and racism on the campus. Anybody who thinks that people are looking at the Statue of Thomas Jefferson and thinking to themselves, you know what? I'm going to go rape me some women is an idiot and should be called out as such. Okay, time for a little bit of Bible talk. Today's Bible talk, we are in the Jewish section. The Jews read a different portion of the Bible every week. This week's portion comes from the book of Leviticus, and Leviticus is filled with weird things that people who are modern don't understand. It has lots of stuff about sexual purity, and it has lots of stuff about weird skin diseases and stuff. So I wanted to read a little bit of this because I want to demonstrate what it is that matters here because it is weird. I mean, let's not pretend it's weird. This is from Leviticus chapter 13, right? It says, the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron saying, if a man has a seeth, a sappakat, or a baharat on the skin of his flesh, and it forms a lesion of taharat, and I'm using the Hebrew terms here because there's no English equivalent on the skin of his flesh, he shall be brought to Aaron the Cohen or to one of his sons at the Kohanam the priest, the priest shall look at the lesion on the skin of his flesh, and if Aaron the lesion has turned white and the appearance of the lesion is deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a lesion of taharat. When the Cohen sees this, he shall pronounce him unclean. If it is white baharat on the skin of his flesh and its appearance is not deeper than the skin, and its hair has not turned white, the Cohen shall quarantine the person with the lesion for seven days. So modern people look at this and they say, okay, this is a medical problem. Why is this in the Torah? Like, why is this in the Bible? Why is it important that God is talking about particular types of skin legions? Why can't God just say visit your dermatologist? Why is this necessary to be there? So Jonathan Hite has a wonderful book called The Righteous Mind. And what Jonathan Hite points out is that there are tons of things that we do in everyday life that we take for granted that are based on a human need for standards of purity. There's lots of stuff that you just won't do because you don't think that it is pure. So he uses as an example, uses this as an example in his book, if I remember correctly. There are certain cultures where people after their relatives die, they eat the bodies of their relatives. And it's not that there's necessarily a health problem involved. Is that moral or is it not moral? And what he found is that today's modern college students, many of them will say, well, it's not immoral because what's the big problem, the person's dead already? But most people will still say that's immoral. Why? Because the human being is built to believe in this idea of purity. So what he suggests is the idea of purity is basically an extension of our natural disdain for things that are unclean because the unclean can make us sick, the unclean can kill us. And so we have disdain for that. But here's the thing. What religion does and what Judaism does here, what the Bible attempts to do is it attempts to say things that are disgusting to you, things that you draw away from. The reason that you're drawing away from them is not just because they are inherently gross to you. You're not just drawing away from them because they're inherently gross. They're issues of morality. And by conflating the two, it's meant to make you a better human being. So in Jewish tradition, when it talks about, when it talks about Saharah, when it talks about and then Sarahah, rather, when it talks about this particular type of skin lesion, Jewish tradition suggests that it is linked to Loshan Harah, right? Meaning that if you speak badly about people, that the Torah is saying, if you speak badly about people, that you are more likely to get Sarahah, that this punishment was basically to get this sort of skin lesion, and they link it with a section of the Torah where Miriam speaks badly about Moses, she speaks badly to Moses, then she's hit with the skin lesion, and then Moses prays for her to be healed. The idea here is that by linking purity and morality, it's taking things out of the realm of the weird and cultic toward the idea that you are supposed to act morally, and that if you act morally, that you are less likely to have problems like this. Now, maybe that's true, and maybe that's not in real life. We've never seen Saharah, it's not a actually leprosy. People tend to translate as leprosy, it's not leprosy. But because of all of this, the linkage of purity and morality, it's an attempt to take the innate nature of man, which is to shun that, which is impure, and turn it into immoral questions that we can morally educate people off the basis of a psychological problem that they have with impurity. And that's actually a good thing, that's something that's good, because the way the human psychology works, we tend to react emotionally about things, and then we make up an excuse for it later. So what the Torah says is that the Torah says, yes, you're going to react emotionally to seeing somebody who has this sort of skin disease. But the way that we deal with that is we deal with that in a religious way to teach people that they should not act immorally, and then we say that what happens is that people are pronounced unclean and then they're pronounced clean, right? So they go away, they are quarantined for a certain amount of time, and then they come back. Even if the skin lesion is still there, right? It says that the hair has not turned white, the quarantined is the person with the lesion for seven days. After seven days, the person is declared clean. So this is also a way of re-accepting people who are considered impure, because we don't want to shun people just because they have some sort of skin disease. So that's the idea here, is that we as a Western culture, we've decided purity and impurity don't matter. That is fundamentally violative of human nature. It is better to acknowledge that purity matters to us. And then if we want to be moral, use those questions of purity to teach morality. And that's what the Bible attempts to do as opposed to just sort of making things weird and cultic and having untouchables and touchables as they have in certain cultures around the world. Okay, so we will be back here tomorrow. Tomorrow is time for the mailbag, and we will be discussing, we will be doing all of that. Plus, I'll give you all the details on the on the healthcare amendment that is now being proposed. The House Freedom Caucus has now come out and endorsed the new healthcare plan. We'll talk about all of that, but we'll have to save that for tomorrow. I'm Ben Shapiro, this is The Ben Shapiro Show."
