    "text": " Hey guys, I wanted to go in here and talk about something that's been bothered me for the past couple of days. And that is the Young Turks and Anna and Jenks transition to transphobe. For those of you who don't know, TYT is a new slash opinion network on YouTube that purports itself to be the home of progressives. And a couple months ago, one of their primary hosts, Anna Kesparian, tweeted that she took Umbridge with the terms birthing person or people with uterus. And there was a lot of backlash. People were, you know, including people from within their own company and their, you know, supposed friends, you know, tried to call them in and educate them. And they doubled and tripled down, got mad, blamed the trans rights activists, you know, actually were irrational. And now they are starting to definitely turn on the trans community. So it looks like progressives have drawn a line in the sand between those who are with them and against them. And for some reason, they have chosen that line in the sand to be the issue of trans rights. And if you're wondering what I'm talking about, well, I'm of course referring to the situation developing around the Young Turks. Now, if you follow news online, you're almost guaranteed to have heard of the Young Turks. They are the largest progressive digital network out there. They've been around for a long time. And when I say that they are progressive, I mean, not in every single sense of the word. They are progressive economically, financially, fiscally. I mean, they support people like AOC, Bernie Sanders, Medicare for all you name and not only that, but they're also socially progressive. I mean, they really are. You will not catch someone on TYT, misgendering someone or at least not intentionally. But you see, when it comes to the left, you can never be pure enough. And sadly, for people at the Young Turks, they've actually found themselves in the crosshairs of trans activists for failing to completely or enthusiastically enough toe the party line. You see, a lot of this started when Anna Kasparian, who was one of the main faces of the Young Turks, she went online and proclaimed that actually, as a woman, she doesn't really like being referred to as a birthing person or a menstruator. Yeah, she finds that, in fact, a little bit dehumanizing, which left his activist did not take kindly to. And not only that, but similarly, Anna also went on a stream and lamented the fact that some activists out there were actually suggesting the term bonus hole. Yeah, bonus hole to refer to women's vaginas as to supposedly, allegedly not offend trans women. I mean, there was a story out of the UK this week, blows my mind. There was an LGBTQ group in the UK who suggested that instead of referring to vaginas as vaginas, because it might be offensive to transgender men, you know, one of the potential replacements or substitutes could be bonus hole. Obviously, people like you and I understand that one of the left's main weapons in fighting the culture war is controlling language. So Anna here, coming out and saying, hang on, I actually don't support this attempt to manipulate language. Well, that essentially makes her an enemy of the state because she's fighting back against the control that they are so desperately trying to keep a hold of. And trust me, I'm well aware that to most people out there, to most normal people, all of this just sounds like varying levels of craziness. But hey, craziness is what the progressive side has to offer us today. And speaking of that, one of the reasons why the allegations of transphobia have really kicked off against the young Turks is because one of their former employees who identifies as trans, well, they are now basically blasting to you. I teach anyone who will listen saying that their former employers, yeah, they were super, super bigoted as the daily caller explains a former producer for the young Turks who is transgender said Tuesday, he left the show over the host alleged transphobia. Benny Corralo, a former producer for the network, released a video on his YouTube channel explaining his decision to part ways with the company. Corralo, a trans person who identifies as female said the young Turks host Anna Casparian and Jake Uger became unbearably transphobic in recent months. Corralo said the pair have pivoted into a right wing grift. And Corralo apparently also griped about the host showing apprehension to biological men participating in women's sports. Now, to be clear, not wanting to be referred to as a birthing person, that's a very reasonable position. Not wanting biological males to compete against biological females in sports. Again, another very reasonable position. I can't believe I'm actually defending the young Turks here and saying that they are in any way not extreme. But when it comes to a lot of these allegations, frankly, it seems like the extremists here are the trans activists and not TYT themselves. And we're going to be going into some more specific complaints from these trans activists against TYT buffers. I do want to say a big thank you to today's sponsor, Cozier. If you're anything like me and a hot sleeper, then hotter weather usually means goodbye to a good night's sleep. But that does not need to be the case thanks to Cozier. You see, Cozier's bedding is soft, luxurious, and temperature regulating. And so with it, I am sleeping better than I have in years. I mean, there's a good reason why Cozier's has thousands of five star reviews on their site, like this one from Halley. This is just amazing bedding. Halley says, honestly, the best sheets we have ever had absolutely a dream to slip into each night. Everyone deserves to splurge on these sheets. You'll have no regrets. My husband and I could not agree more. Anytime we are changing the bed, we are putting on Cozier's sheets because frankly, we're at the point where anything less just feels like sandpaper because those sheets are so soft. Cozier's sheets are made for 100% viscose from bamboo and are now available in seven colors for a limited time. Save up to 35% on Cozier's. And be sure to check out their ultra soft lounge where and plush bath towel collection too. But my husband and I just did an order. We ordered him a house coat and some of these towels.

Now, let's look at some of the other complaints that these clearly very sane, very rational trans activists have against TYT. You know, they are attacking trans athletes in sports all the time. And you know, a lot of people on Twitter were surprised by this and I'm not. You know, for a long time, they tried to talk the talk on being allies. But you could tell from watching that they never bothered to educate themselves or do their own research on the science of transitioning on the stories they were talking about. You know, they never had a full time trans host on the network. And that's the thing, like trans issues are in the news every single day in America. That's just not responsible journalism. Like, you know, you should have someone who knows what the talking about now based on what this individual is saying, apparently in the minds of these activists in order to actually be a good ally, you essentially as a progressive need to make yourself an expert in trans issues, including the science of transitioning. And oh, you're talking about trans rights or trans issues at all. Well, then you better actually hire a trans person full time to give the correct opinion, the proper party line, the entitlement of these people really knows no bounds. I mean, not only are there males who are demanding access to female spaces demanding we change our language in order to suit them, but now they're actually saying, yes, you must involve us in your businesses. You must involve us in your spare time because I'm guessing that's when you would take the initiative to research everything that's going on with them. And it's like, this is why this is such a polarizing topic is because a lot of people, even if they don't mind you being trans, they're like, yeah, you do you. They're not necessarily willing to change their entire lives just to please a bunch of strange looking strangers on the Internet is the nicest way I could think to put it. You know, I don't know if these are the actual beliefs. I think really what happened is it's their inflated egos. I think they could not handle not being seen as these cisgender, wonderful ally saviors and being called out by trans people. They're like, how dare you? You know, they've been on the show. They've been calling us idiots saying that we're selfish and holding back the LGBT community and trying to tell us the way that's right to protest or what's politically expedient. You know, they can't handle a minority standing up to them and being like, Hey, you're not actually supporting us. So I'm just going to quickly skip past the irony of this person saying that TYT have big egos and talk a little bit about what was referenced regarding the proper way to protest. So again, I'm not a fan of TYT. I probably disagree with them around 95% of the time. But one thing I actually thought was good was when they called out trans activists for being violent when it came specifically to Riley Gaines. And if you're not aware of the Riley Gaines situation, Riley Gaines was a collegiate athlete. She's a female athlete who has since spoken out about the issue of having to compete against biological males and just how unfair that is. And for her efforts, predictably, she was met with violence and harassment as well as threats. And in fact, things got so bad for Riley that at one point she was actually barricaded in a room while trying to give a talk at a college campus because this is where we are at in America. For their credit though, the young Turks, specifically Jankin Ana, they did call out that violence for being wrong. There was also a Q&A portion where there was disagreement. They exchanged their comments, their disagreement with one another. I think that's productive. But what happened outside of that room? What happened for the three hours following her talk? Not productive. I don't understand how anyone would think that this is going to win over hearts and minds in any way. Guys, chanting is one thing. That's not just like neutral. It's good. Chanting is good. Protest is good, right? But when somebody feels physically unsafe and you won't let her out, then you've lost the moral high ground. A totally reasonable take, right? I mean, at the bare minimum, we should all be an agreement that just because someone disagrees with you, that does not warrant literally kidnapping them. But you see, in these trans rights activist minds, the threats against them from the right wing, from people like Riley Gaines, who just want to swim against other women, it is so great that it actually justifies violence and extremism. Because in leftist minds, I guess, trans people are facing, oh, yeah, they're facing a genocide. That's the latest talking point. And I bring all of this up, not to necessarily defend the young Turks, because again, not necessarily a fan, but because I want to illustrate how extreme and how radical these activists are. They are so extreme that you can be the perfect progressive. In fact, one of the most outspoken progressive, you've done so much for the progressive movement, but unless you are willing to accept the trans agenda 100% no redlining, then they will still accuse you of being a bigot, of being transphobic. And of doing a right wing pivot, if you can believe it. And the thing I want to leave you all with, because I think it's kind of funny and sad, is a clip of this former employee, actually, actually saying that there's no way he slash she could be in a bubble, because actually someone he matched with on Tinder also agrees that TYT is transphobic. Gangstee convinced of this idea that I'm living in some sort of bubble. They've even said it on the air. People fighting for trans rights are all living in some sort of bubble. The problem with that is I have a lot of random trans people from a ton of different political perspectives that will reach out to me about like, hey, how are things doing at TYT? Or hey, you're really inspiring. You know, stuff like that. And I kept pressing. I was like, no, Jen, you don't understand. I matched with a random person on Tinder. And the first thing that they started talking to me about is how transphobic TYT has been lately. Well, that's just airtight logic. Am I right? I mean, I see no no flaws with that reasoning. In any case, though, that's basically all I have to say for now. And as always, if you guys enjoyed this video, please be sure to like, share, and subscribe. Until next time."
