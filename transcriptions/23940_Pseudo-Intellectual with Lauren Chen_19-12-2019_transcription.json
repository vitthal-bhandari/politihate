    "text": " Hey guys, welcome back to the show. My name is Lauren and this is Liam. Hello, hello. Thank you so much for tuning in. You may have noticed that we're not actually live this Wednesday and that is because when you're watching this, we will just be getting back from Dallas. So hopefully by the time this is airing, you would have seen either some collaborations with us and other shows or us on some different play shows, whatever it may be. So make sure you're following us on social media. All of my handles are at the Lauren Chen at the Liam Donovan, just to see what we're up to. So we have a fun show today. First off, we're going to be talking about how the Church of Sweden strangely enough had to remove a piece of artwork depicting a gay Adam and Eve, but not for the reasons you're even thinking. It's just, it's a strange situation happening over there. Next, we're going to be going into mixed weight couples and the challenges that they face. Apparently, mixed weight couples is a thing now. Well, I mean, to me, it's always a thing because our weights are very different. But that's, this is all at the level. Yeah, you guys are going to see. Then Lily Allen was not having a good time after the British election results. We're going to be, I guess, doing some salt mining with that. And finally, Taylor Swift, one woman of the decade or something similar, an award, and she took the opportunity to rail against the patriarchy. Interestingly enough, not the most relatable speech I've ever heard, but that's the show for today. Before we get into it, though, I do have a quick message from ExpressVPN. So we all know how a VPN protects your privacy and security online, right? You've, you've heard me talk about this enough by now. I hope you do. But did you know, and this will take your TV watching to a whole new level that you can actually use VPNs to unlock movies and shows that are only available in other countries. So over the weekend, I use ExpressVPN to binge watch Parks and Rec on American Netflix. You could also do things like check out Dr. Who, which is on the UK version of Netflix. It's super simple. You just fire up ExpressVPN, the app, change your location to the US, the UK, wherever the content is that you want to be watching and refresh, refresh Netflix. And that's it. So ExpressVPN does this by hiding your IP address and unless you control where you want sites to think you're located, you can choose from almost 100 different countries. So just think about all the Netflix libraries you'll be able to see. If you like anime, I personally don't, but everyone, you know, to each their own, you can actually use Express VPN to access Japanese Netflix and be spirited away. I hope you hope you enjoyed that. It's not just Netflix though. ExpressVPN works with any streaming service. Hulu, BBC, iPlayer, YouTube, you name it. There are hundreds of VPNs out there, but the reason I use ExpressVPN to watch shows is it's ridiculously fast. There's never any buffering or lag and you can stream an HD no problem. ExpressVPN is also compatible with all of your devices, phones, media, console, smart smart TVs, you name it. So if you visit my special link right now, ExpressVPN.com slash Lauren, you can get an extra three months of ExpressVPN for free. So support the show, expand your viewing capabilities, protect yourself at ExpressVPN.com slash Lauren. Okay, so church of Sweden. These are the same people just for everyone's reference that also I think at least one of their priests, or I'm not sure what their leadership structure is. I think it's a shaman. Essentially, right? Wouldn't be surprised. These are the same people where one of them declared that Greta Tunberg was the successor to Christ, which is not part of the Bible that I remember reading. Really? But I think I read something about that in Revelation. Yeah, maybe actually, you're probably not far from off. The latest headlines they're making is that they, there was an Adam and Eve artwork that was controversial already, it ended up getting taken down, but not because it was too woke, actually because it was not woke enough. And as confusing as that sounds, we have an article about it here. This is as our T reports, quote, after two weeks of deliberation, a church in Sweden decided that a newly acquired LGBT friendly painting was too problematic to serve as its altarpiece. It's depiction of Adam and Eve as two same sex couples was not the issue. Okay, so just to clarify, maybe we can throw up an image of the actual piece of art itself. This piece of work had Adam with a gay partner and Eve with a lesbian partner that brings up some questionable theological problems. We're going to get into that in just a second. Physical problems. Yeah. I mean, come on, how does the rest of humanity happen? Yeah, very confusing stuff. The article continues the St. Paul's Church in the southern city of Malmo, which if memory serves as also an especially diverse part of Sweden, I've heard of Malmo. Accepted the painting as its altarpiece on the first day of Advent two weeks ago, the artwork by Swedish photographer and artist Elizabeth Olsen Wallen was meant to symbolize inclusivity, not like God or Jesus or anything, just it's meant to symbolize. Literally the altar of inclusivity. Yeah, not exactly. God, goodness. It predictably generated a lot of buzz attracting both praise and controversy online. Praise for people that go to church, I'm sure. After analyzing the feedback, the church has decided to take down the painting and move it to a different location outside the altar room. Pastor Paris Fenson revealed on Wednesday. Hopefully in a dumpster. And no, it was not the reimagining of the biblical story about Adam and Eve as a tale of two nude same-sex couples in the Garden of Eden that pushed the church officials to move the painting. That part is completely uncontroversial, Fenson said the pastor, however, had an issue with the serpent that tempted Adam and Eve to try the forbidden fruit in the painting. It was depicted as a transgender person. The serpent traditionally symbolizes evil and turning it into a transgender person can mean that a transgender person is evil or is the devil's fence and explained the church of Sweden cannot stand by that. So there's like a lot to unpack here to clarify. This altar piece had Adam with a gay partner, Eve with a gay partner. That was hunky Dory. Church of Sweden saw no problem with that, but it was the fact that the serpent that tempted Eve in order to be more inclusive, the, I guess, the artist depicted the snake as a trans person. Yeah. Which, I mean, to be fair, I'd want nothing to do with a trans person serpent either. I get it. It's very bigoted of you. I know. Okay. So yeah, the Church of Sweden was like, no, this is not inclusive enough. We have to get rid of it. The Church of Sweden, I think it's safe to say has issues, right? Yeah. I mean, and we're entering the season of Advent and the article specifically states that this was meant to represent inclusivity. That is not the point of Christianity. If the Church of Sweden is going to at least nominally claim to be Christian, I think maybe it should kind of readjust where it's trying to put the focus on. I mean, I'm offended that they even use the term Church, but be honest. Right. Like there should be, it should be like a cult of Greta Tumburg or something like that. The pagan commune of Sweden, right? Something like that. But as kind of frustrating as this is, and we asked people if they wanted to hear about this, a lot of people were like, I don't even care about Sweden anymore. It's too far gone. But this is important to talk about because we're seeing more and more that even churches in Canada, the US, the UK, like the whole sort of social justice ideology is infesting Christian churches everywhere. And I think Catholics especially are dealing with this now with the Pope. And I think he's even saying that they might be adding like environmental sins or something like that to, I don't know how Catholicism works, but catechism, something like that. And it's, I think we're just seeing more and more churches are becoming of the world, right? We're using church to send in for all of the political and social issues of the day, where, you know, I'm not an expert, but I'm pretty sure Jesus said to not do that, right? To not just be of the world. And I think it is interesting how some of some of these people have managed to restructure Christianity so that aligns perfectly with like 20, 10s progressivism. And people like Pete Buttigieg are part of this. Very, very strange. Yeah. I mean, I don't think again, I think these people are Christian second or third or fourth or fifth, you know, and they're progressive first. And they are just doing their best to incorporate that into Christianity. Yeah. And I think it's important to ask like, so what is the goal for doing this for having gay Adam and gay Eve? Like, is it to further the gospel at all? You remember that thing that Christians used to be concerned about? Probably not, right? It's to pander to an LGBT love. And don't get me wrong, I think that Christianity is for everybody. The Bible is for everybody. That's kind of like the message. But it at the same time is not a you're perfect the way you are. Everyone holds hands kind of religion. Like Christianity does have rules of right and wrong. There are moral absolutes. And I feel like in the name of inclusivity and diversity, these churches have kind of formed it into something completely different. It's just like it's a it's a love yourself first. It's a whatever you feel right. You go ahead and do it type of religion. It's like, okay, if you actually read the Bible, though, Jesus doesn't really view those things too fondly. And never mind that. But as you mentioned, like there are Adam and Eve, right? In Christian tradition, were the forebears of the human race, right? And they had Cain and Abel. If Adam and Eve both have their same sex partners, I don't what's happening. Well, I guess they could educate us and tell us that even though they are of the same sex or I don't even understand it. I can't pretend to understand it anymore, but men can have kids too, Lauren. That's true. Right. So maybe Adam. Adam and Bob. Wait, hang on. No, maybe Adam. Identify it as a woman. Yeah. And so that Eve was still a lesbian, but just happened to be in a gay relationship with a trans woman who is a yeah. So Adam was Trisha Paytas. Yeah, exactly. So who knows? And as kind of like hilarious as it is to laugh at Sweden, I'm all for that. We saw a similar headline or at least similar themed headline not to long ago from a church in California. We have this from the Guardian as they report an activity installation depicting Mary Joseph and Jesus separated in cages has caused a stir in a Southern California city. A few hundred kilometers from the US border with Mexico. The installation shows Joseph and Mary in separate cages facing a cradle baby Jesus in a cage with Joseph's arms outstretched towards him. It was posted to Facebook by the Reverend Karen Restino, a woman Reverend, of course, of the Claremont United Methodist Church and has been shared more than 20,000 times. Okay. So we're going to get to the politics of this. But again, like biblically, Jesus was not a refugee, right? This is a very common talking point we've seen a little bit of revisionist history going on. Yeah, like they were going back for the census of the country was born. Yeah. So that's, that's not a refugee, right? You're going back because you have been called back. Jesus was not a refugee. Adam was not in a gay love affair. No, this is, this is not a thing. And again, with this, like what we're supposed to be kind of celebrating the birth of Christ in this Christmas season with this installation. Are you trying to do that? Or are you trying to make a political message? You're very clearly trying to make a political message, right? Which I think is very disrespectful to the season of Advent, not that you can do it, but trying to subvert the Christmas message and say, Hey, here's my political topic thing of the day. And you're also, you're completely twisting what actually happened in the Bible to do so. No, that that's not okay. If you are a Christian who goes to church, I would be very careful about the type of things that are being taught by your pastors. And I think these people, it's funny because they, they say, Oh, you know, but we as Christians, we need to carry out a message of like Christ's love and understanding to the world. Again, it's funny how that happens to align perfectly with progressivism because you, you never see people making these kind of loud, ostentatious declarations about Jesus specifically, which is very curious to me. And I don't know why all of their, I don't even want to call it proselytizing because it's not it's activism. That's masquerading as religious work. I don't know why you don't put this same sort of figure into talking about what Jesus actually said. And the funny thing is they're trying so hard to pander to this progressive audience. At the end of the day, they're never going to like, you're not going to make people convert to Christianity like this, even your diluted perverted version of it. They're still these progressives, the far left types, they're still never going to embrace absolutely any type of it. So it's like why, why pander to people who are going to hate you anyway. And I think that's very especially true with the Catholic church. Like of all the kind of concessions the pope has made, the Catholics are the first Christians that progressives are more than happy to throw under the bus. Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course. I mean, it seems to me that this religious outreach towards the progressive left is suicidal. Yeah, exactly. I mean, and I think some of them are even worse than that. They are bad faith. There are people that become pastors or I've seen people, women even try to become priests in order to subvert them. In fact, where I went to high school once, we actually had a someone who was training to be a priest come as a teacher. And ultimately, he got kicked out of the seminary, I guess it would be, because he was actually a gay man who was going to try to lobby the church to allow gay marriage or something along those lines. Yeah. And I think like, obviously, we should all be kind of engaged in and hope for the best of what path our church is going. But I think anytime we're advocating for any type of change, we need to ask ourselves, why are we doing this? Are we doing this to kind of better align ourselves with the vision of the church that's presented in the Bible? Or are we doing this to further our own desires, our own wants, our own political motivations? You know, the women in the church is this whole other conversation. If you guys aren't subscribed to Ally Stucky, you really need to. She has an amazing podcast episode about this. But it's like, are you saying this because you think it's what God wants and it'll help reach more people? Or are you doing this specifically? Because you want more power, you want to push your agenda, agenda, whatever it may be. I very much respect what these people as the latter. In any case, though, before we get to the next segment, I have another message from our lovely friends over at FreedomWorks and it's actually very topical. It's about socialism, which I think a lot of these churches would be all too happy to implement because did you know Jesus was a socialist? Yeah, I thought I heard that. Also, Jesus was a Marxist, something along those lines. Exactly. There's actually, this is going back on the subject, but there's a, I think a Netflix comedy special that is saying that Jesus is a gay man. Oh, that's right. That's coming out soon. All of those things, and yet they still won't like. It's funny. So no, socialism is a failed ideology that's failed everywhere it's been tried, but sadly socialism is growing in popularity with the Democrats. Bernie Sanders and AOC are self-described socialists and Elizabeth Warren is one too, even though she doesn't want to admit it. But have you ever wondered just how radical these presidential hopefuls and their policies really are? Well, thankfully, my friends over at FreedomWorks have answers to these questions. They've put together a socialist scorecard evaluating where these presidential candidates stand on the issues of the day. If you'd like to check it out, just text Lauren. That's my name, Lauren, to 52886. And you'll receive exclusive access to FreedomWorks socialist scorecard. At times it can seem like socialism is just a buzzword. The right throws around. I know I certainly feel like that too. No, not every single government program means we're going down the road of socialism, but it is important for each of us to critically examine the policies that are being put forward, examine and evaluate the candidates for ourselves. And FreedomWorks has spent a lot of time analyzing these specific policies of the people who are running against President Trump. I've looked it over personally. Trust me, it's really good. And if you would like to view it too, please text Lauren. Again, that's my name, Lauren, to 52886. And you'll receive exclusive access to FreedomWorks socialist scorecard right now. All right. So mixed weight couples, had you heard that term before? This is new to me. No, I mean, it is, I think a bad term, like I said, you know, I do weigh twice as much as you, but we're not a mixed weight couple. Maybe we are. Am I the fat one? You are a feeder. Hang on. To be fair. She is a feeder. I do like to feed him. But maybe they're like mixed BMI couples. Mixed BMI couples. Yeah, we're getting I don't like the BMI. But hey, yeah, we're getting very specific. But as I kind of keep up with all this fat acceptance positivity movement thing, and I had never even heard of this. So I was surprised. I think they're pretty easy bunch to keep up with to be fair. So TLC has a new show that's going to be premiering soon in January. And it's causing quite the stir the trailer for it, I guess, was released this week. It's called hot and heavy, which by the way, is a great title for what this is, but is part of why people are mad. Basically, it's a reality TV show that looks into mixed weight couples. If you don't know what those are, you're not alone. Again, one partner is heavier than the other is kind of, I guess, what they're going for. Here's part of the trailer that people so far are not keen on. This season on hot and heavy. My mom told me that it would be difficult to find love if I was heavy. I'm actually nervous. I always had this idea that like I didn't deserve love because of what I looked like. So for people who are on the audio only platforms, the important takeaway there and what we've just seen is that this show seems to only be focusing on women as the heavier ones in the couple, all the people we've met so far in the trailer are women. And when I say they're heavier, they're like, they are full on obese. This is not kind of, oh, you know, my girlfriend has some love handles. This is like, I think one of them, the scale said 330 pounds. And she was one of the smaller women that was touched upon. Yeah, I mean, honestly, if you if you are on the audio only platform, you can hear the narrator, like she is fat. You can hear the fat in the voice. I noticed that is a thing. Sometimes you can hear that. So I don't understand why that is. Well, the worst is because the weight is pressing down. Probably some constriction going down on the vocal chords there. But the worst is like when someone has a microphone and they're heavy and you could hear the mouth breathing. Yeah, yeah, like that infamous TED talk about that fat activist. Oh, yeah, she was breathing very heavily actually very sad. I think she died of a heart attack. Not surprising though. Yeah. Yeah. So some people just based on that have called this series exploitative, right? I don't think that's necessarily fair though. Like I do have stuff to say about this series, but I don't think just because someone's obese and you're filming them, you're necessarily exploiting them. I mean, I guess it's going to depend on how like their portrayed I don't want anyone to be made fun of. This is reality TV. Everything is everything is scripted too. It's like these people all agree to it and then they go and act out these scenes to some degree like, you know, you could hear people talking about it. They'll shoot a scene multiple times like, Oh, what's behind this door? I've already done the scene before, but I did a bad job the first time. No, and sometimes you can tell with reality TV shows like it'll it'll be the surprise thing, but you're getting like two different camera angles and one of the camera guys is already in the room and it's like, come on, come on. That doesn't happen naturally. Yeah. So the next part of the trailer, we meet their boyfriends, the skinnier guys who are dating these ladies. I think every girl hopes they're going to get a hunky husband. So I totally hit the jackpot. I absolutely love Kristen Sigh. That wouldn't mind if she was a little bit bigger. Adriana is the hottest woman I've ever seen in my life. You look so manly. How do I look? You look amazing. I love every inch of joy. There's a lot of inches to love. Again, for our podcast listeners and just so you know, we are on like every single podcast platform, iTunes, Spotify, Google Play, just throwing that out there. The way differences here in these couples, it's extreme, right? So like these women are obese and their boyfriends look like regular guys, just kind of like not even chubby guys, just fully like probably healthy guys. And first off, kind of an encouraging note, I think it does go to show that there's some someone for everyone out there, right? Like no matter what you look like, there's going to be someone out there who thinks you are beautiful, who thinks you are the bee's knees. So Absolutely. I mean, listen, if you're an incel or a femme cell, all you got to do is look at this video and take hope. Yeah, no, seriously, but even like, not just for like morbidly obese people, like I watch a lot of those kind of like medical, Marvel shows where it's like, oh, I was born with like a conjoined twin or like just of, yeah, issues, he knows what I'm talking about. Most of those people who are gone, those shows have significant others and they interview their significant others. So it's like, I assume to call a conjoined twin and like when she wanted to have intimate time with her partner, they had to do something weird. Yeah, so it's like if the conjoined twin can get a boyfriend, if the 400 pound woman can get a boyfriend, there is no reason why you can't get a boyfriend. So feel good about that. Yeah, and I mean, I don't mean to sound like mean here, but I think it's safe to say that if if those guys wanted to, they could get someone more conventionally attractive, right? Because those are they're not bad looking guys. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, I think that goes without saying my opinion, you can't get much lower on the totem than they picked. So well, I mean, but I think I mean, like they really do think these women are beautiful, right? And I kind of seems like it might be you fetish. No, that's not like a special thing. Like, I think she could be even bigger. It was like, Oh, it's a little bit of a maybe a Chevy chaser thing going on. Well, I've also heard things where men have done that to women and literally like put their health at risk and you killed them. So the point where some of these women are suing their feeder, you know, it's I don't I mean, I think this is like wholly degenerate behavior. Like even if even if they are attracted to the women, let's be honest, they're they're taking their their sexual pleasure and putting it above their significant other's health, yeah, which is disturbing to me greatly, especially if they do it when they're not day to day basis, you know, yeah. And I think like if these people are in love and they treat each other right and they want the same things in life, like why not? I'm not here to like crap on their relationships. But the last part of the trailer finishes off talking about some of the struggles that these couples face. And I think the the health component is definitely relevant to that conversation. If you want a child, you should have the gastric bypass surgery. I'm not down with surgeries. I love you. But you just want to keep me fat. The chips. You were like the first person to ever like point out my weight in front of people throughout high school. This guy was bullying me. You're gonna blame everything on me. I'm not a violent person. If I have to protect her, I will with pleasure. I'm gonna propose a joy. What about her weight issue? Did you get the inversion that they have any reservations about me? Because of my size. Sometimes I wonder if love is enough. I will say I do think it's kind of strange how controversial this is being painted. I mean, like it's it's just reality to be that it's trying to get you to watch. Yeah, but I think like I think it is fair to say that if my friend or a family member was dating someone who was like that much larger, like I again, if I think there are more important things than looks, but from a health perspective, like if you want kids, it's very concerning. Yeah, you're gonna want to choose a partner who's gonna be around for the long haul and is kind of capable of helping you in the day to day of running around with kids. Why are you looking at me like that? I'm not gonna feed you. It's not just no, I'm not gonna eat until I'm like 400 pounds either. Don't worry. We'll see. We all heard last week. We all heard last week about the pregnancy. Okay, so listen, everybody here is on the same page as me. Yeah, but also if you're someone who just enjoys being really active, like hiking, swimming, going places that are not accessible via those scooter things, it is something something to talk about. And so I mean, I guess we don't know what the dynamics is with those relationships, but I personally, I wouldn't mind dating someone over a wait. I think that I would probably say no to someone who's like morbidly obese, but I wouldn't look at a heavier guy and think like off limits, but I would hope that they would be, I guess, in the process of or interested in losing weight for their own health. Like I don't think I would feel comfortable if my partner was just like, yeah, I'm 400 pounds and this is just my life. This is how I am forever. Well, it's just a bad indication of many character traits, in my opinion. Yeah. You know, it's I think it's totally unacceptable to be almost overweight at all. You know, and I mean, a lot of us do get overweight from time to time and some of us are overweight for long periods of time. It's a very tough battle with our current society, just the kind of foods that we eat. Yeah. And it's even if like this, I'm not someone who's really ever been overweight, but I do have my own struggles with like eating healthy because sometimes I, it's not that I'm necessarily like overweight. I'll gain like a couple pounds, but I know just how I feel and from what I'm eating, I'm eating crap. And that's the body. Yeah, it's just that fuel for your body. And even if it's not affecting your weight, necessarily, it will affect your energy. I'll put a will affect things, many things in your body. So yeah, I mean, I just, I think eating healthy is it's important. Yeah, sure. It's not always easy to do, but also at the same time, if you really think about it when you want to eat those foods and you're like, yeah, just hit me with the cheesecake. I love cheesecake. Trust me, you're putting mouth pleasures above everything else that moment. Like literally, that's it. I don't like the phrase mouth pleasure. And you know what, that's good. Yeah. That's what I'm going to keep saying. It's like, I was that mouth pleasure treating you because at the end of the day, that that's what it is. It's all about like, literally, there's one sensation over health. Yeah, to gluttony. Yeah, it is that's fair. And I mean, this is about relationships, right? These people's relationships, not just their weight. And so I hope that they, I think it is nice. They found people that they love and they're happy with. I don't want them to break up or anything, but I will just say that I feel like when you're dating people, there's kind of like, you have an overall score that can be divided into categories, right? You have like your looks score, like your personality, humor, intelligence, like career ambitions. And it's like, you can be deficient in certain categories and still be an overall catch. Right. So like, I don't want to talk down to these women too much. Like, they might have like, be super funny, educated, great personalities, good career ambitions. They might be really good moms. At the same time, they're on a reality TV show. I don't know how much of those are. That's true. Yeah. But I will say that I have seen relationships where like, the other person is deficient in all categories. And that's just like, what are you doing? But anyway, the sea, this series doesn't premiere until January. So we'll see if people are still mad about it when it actually releases. And when it premieres, I feel like this might be like a good combination. Though they're smart to do this, we're talking about this, like a free ad for them, where it might be the perfect mix of like, I'm disgusted and outraged, but I want to watch it so I can be disgusted and outraged, which is essentially the basis for reality TV.

So definitely take advantage of that. So the UK election was this past week and there was an enormous win for the country's conservative party. And like I just want to say that it's really interesting. We were talking about this how the US 2016 huge unexpected conservative win. The first Brexit vote I think was a part of that Australia recently had an election and their conservative faction ended up being a lot more successful than people were assuming or in some cases hoping for the only like Anglo country where we've actually kind of seen the opposite happening is Canada. Stop. I know it's sad though, but it's that experience and how we've just suffered an election defeat I think is going to be useful insight in this story because I think we're handling it a lot more a lot better than the Allen currently is. Okay, so we're going to be talking about this election loss from the eyes of a crying celebrity because it's just funnier that way. Lily Allen, she's a singer. I'm not really familiar with her stuff. I just hear about her being in the news because of politics. Yeah, I remember some of her stuff back like when I was younger, like, you know, in the early 2000s. I remember some of her stuff, but I don't I haven't heard of her since. So but apparently she's still big in the UK. Yeah. All right. Well, I mean, I know she's a she's been in the news for before, for like crying over refugees in a good way. And she's been a huge supporter of the Labor Party previously. And we have a clip of this. She's actually she put out a video of herself crying on TikTok because the Labor Party Manifestos was, I guess, just so dang good. She was like moved to tears because of it. We have that clip. Guys, what's the label? It's the best. So pretty big labor supporter. I guess. Yeah. And we want to reiterate that that is literally called their manifesto. Yeah. Yeah. That's not me being like a jerk and trying to bad not them. They they literally released their platform and chose to call it their manifesto. Yeah. Now what I would like to see is some kind of video editing going on where they either put like the Unibommer Manifesto or some other manifesto in front of her, you know, from a messaging standpoint, if nothing else, like, especially if your party is constantly dealing with accusations of anti semitism and like being called literal communists, why would you be like, yeah, let's just put out a manifesto and actually I went on to their site, the Labor Party site. So I could read this manifesto and they wait, they describe it as quote, our manifesto is the most radical, hopeful people focus fully costed plan in modern times. Like, why would you describe your manifesto as radical? This is why you lost essentially is what I'm trying to say. It's an important piece. It's called my struggle. Yeah, it's just like goodness. Yeah. Why? Why would you do this? And I think it's just that whole mentality. I think a lot of a lot of ways they tried to cater to this far left activist class that is so popular online, but just not representative of the rest of the country. And I think it's kind of in a way what Democrats in the United States are doing right now. I hope it works out just as well for them as it did for the Labor Party. I'm also the Labor Party wanted a second referendum, which is something that is not popular. A lot of people are saying in a way, this election itself was a second referendum for Brexit and people kind of made their voices be heard. And right. Yeah. So in any case, as we saw with the Trump win and the conservative win in Australia, once this election news broke, left wingers, particularly Allen, were not happy. And here's what the Daily Mail had to say about it. They wrote quote, after the exit poll predicted Labor's worst performance at the ballot box since the 1930s, the 40 year old defiantly tweeted, still holding out for a labor majority. But as the party's red wall began to crumble, that's how you shouldn't have a red wall. That does not sound good at all. It became clear that the party was doomed. She began unloading a spool of anti conservative tweets. On Instagram this morning, she posted an image of a sad face emoji and wrote, some say it was Brexit, some say it was Jeremy, personally, and I know no one wants to hear it. I think that racism and misogyny run so, so deep in this country, and that Boris won because of his attitude toward those things and not in spite of them. The pop star who has been singing Labor's praises throughout the campaign earlier suggested conservative supporters voted for kids to die with no health care. She also implied their motives for switching behind the Tories were to have less brown people in the UK. Allen retweeted a post which read, vote for your kids to die with no health care and less brown people. But the joke is capitalism needs cheap foreign workers to exploit. So it will never reduce immigration. So jokes on you. Alright, so some salt there. It's tough. It's tough because you know that people like her have the same voting power as people that are reasonable. Yeah, that's always something that's difficult for me to wrap my head around. You know, I love democracy, but that is definitely a problem with the system. I like democracy. I think democracy, I mean, I view the democracy the same way the founding fathers did, right? It's majority rule. I think constitutional republic. Yeah, okay, well, what I mean, democracy, I just mean the ability to vote. Yeah, but I agree. I'm not talking about direct democracy. Yeah, and in my everyday life, I often regret that certain people have the same amount of control over government. It's crazy. And most often I have that thought when I'm driving. Yeah, definitely. You have many thoughts like that while you're driving. Alright, so they usually come from the hind brain as well. Here's the thing. Obviously, it's upsetting to lose an election, right? That you're so emotionally invested. And like I said, we just experienced that. Yeah, but that was disheartening. What you what you don't do is start calling everyone in your country a racist, a big get a massage. It's like, I hate the liberal party here. But I think a lot of the people who voted for them. Honestly, maybe they're voting because it's the status quo, it's the same, it's safe. You don't want too many changes. Maybe you personally like Trudeau. Maybe some of the, I guess the gimmes he was offering you were good. Maybe you're just not that if you're just a if you're in Quebec, you're just a loser, you voted for the Quebec party. The separatist party. They exploded this election. I was just like, please, get out of my country. And they want to. They're trying to get out of my country. Exactly. Get out of my country, please. They want to be super great. Go bankrupt within a few years. So yeah, I mean, like obviously you're not going to agree with the people who voted for the like the opposition party, but that doesn't mean you have to hate them. And I think that's what we saw. That's just there's so much vitriol and hatred. And it's frustrating to think that so many people like Lillie Allen, because this isn't just Lillie Allen, look at someone like like Boris Johnson, who like let's face it, by American standards is still a like a lefty. I mean, the UK is like is like Canada, like their conservative party is still pretty centrist, right? We're not talking far. Yeah, I mean, again, we're talking about like a whole, we're talking about a poor way of framing it. Yeah, left, right dichotomy is kind of, you know, but anyway, he's also the authoritarian scale would have you that I think is where a lot of Americans get their further right wing stuff. But he Jeremy or dang it, Boris Johnson is what I'm trying to say is not some like Mussolini figure. He's not even a Trump-esque figure. So to see them how they think of him that way, the labor party does as well. But the thing is, as we've noticed before, progressives, the way that they think of their, the conservative counterparts is very uncharitable. They assume the absolute worst. Yeah, it's a bad faith. The racist, yeah, there, you know, there's no other explanation for it. It's not like, you know, they don't they don't see the merits of their arguments in the slightest. And I think it's especially interesting to see someone like Lili Allen ranging at like, oh, you just hate brown people. It's like, well, there are actually real economic impacts and cultural impacts that people are feeling with this whole wave of immigration. Someone's things that I think someone like Lili Allen who probably lives in a very nice gated community, who obviously has job security, has like a pop star, doesn't have to worry about. So to look at, you know, the white working class people and say, you voted for less immigration because you want you hate brown people. I think that's very, very unfair. It's like, you're just absolutely, yes. But you know, someone that doesn't, a lower class person would be very well incentivized to not want lower income people coming to the country because they're going to compete for jobs that are already going to come scarce and be for housing. Yeah. I guess the labor rebuttal for that was like, I think they on their manifest. So they had like a guaranteed housing plan. Yeah. And Lili Allen's were something in the range of 15 million pounds, I think I saw. So I mean, she just can't relate to that. They're so far from reality. Same thing happens with the Hollywood elite here in America or down in America, I should say. Yeah, they're just, they, they function on these utopian ideals. Yeah, they, they're comfy and gated communities and they'll spit on you for trying to vote in your best interest. And again, I'm not even saying they need to agree with you on that. But to assume it's because of bigotry is just it's ridiculous. And actually, as soon as this election news broke, what we also saw was the independent published a piece on how to leave the UK after it was announced that that Johnson won. So like, we saw this with all the celebrities 2016 saying I'm moving to Canada. None of them did as far as I can tell. You know what, I really now I'm just having like this amazing dream where brand new one that we had articles like that about Canada. Yeah, how do they actually left? I mean, perfect. This is what I was joking about it on Twitter is like 80% a joke 20% serious. Like, are we becoming too polarized in our politics where we're not happy to where there's not going to be any political figure that's going to make most people happy, right? Because I think obviously there's room for some kind of disagreements. But I think we may be at a place now where it's like we're too, our beliefs are too different. And I mean, I'll be honest with you. And I think that, you know, we're giving our side the benefit of the doubt. But it seems like to me, most places, right wingers are far more likely to be willing to talk about these things than left wingers are. Yeah, that's my view, at least. I know that I'm biased because I happen to be in one of the camps. But that's my inclination. It seems like the left have no tolerance for anything else. And that's what's just your bias. We see this in the US, we're trying to talk about things like immigration, right? It's there's they're saying no, like no border wall, abolish ICE, these people are not willing to compromise. And I think ideally the whole idea of different states was the idea that people could have whatever politics they wanted within those states and they could move around wherever. But we see this growth of like federalism, where we no longer in the individual provinces or the individual states don't know what's happening in the UK. But we don't have that kind of freedom to determine how our own communities live anymore. There's this huge top down approach. So I mean, I was kind of joking that, all right, communist, you can go to Canada, red pill people, we get America moderates, you can hang out in the UK. I gave the libertarians Australia because there's like a lot of scary animals there and they have guns. So I think they've managed fine. And yeah, that was mostly a joke. But I am kind of worried that we were approaching a point where our political views are just so divergent because we're no longer kind of coalescing around what our neighbors believe because of online communities. For better or worse, like we're able to find like minded people everywhere around the world. So it's kind of like we're we're all sectioning off. It's funny to me personally seeing these celebrities spazz attacks, but it's concerning because there are so many people all over the different countries that are facing the same kind of political frustration. I don't think it's good for them. I don't think it's good for the country. Are they going to actually we've seen evidence of this? There are some people are already blaming Russian election interference on the conservative one. I don't know. Russia was that powerful. We've already lost. Yeah. You know, Putin's picking all the leaders of all the Western nations like at this point, like just roll up the Russian flag here in Canada. It's not the reality, the situation. It's obviously just yeah, I hope not. But I don't know if we're going to be seeing any kind of detente on this kind of rhetoric lately. We're going into 2020. So unfortunately, yes, it's going to get worse. Yeah. All right. So our final segment, we are talking about Miss Taylor Swift. And I want to say that I like Taylor Swift's music. I just want to I don't want to be too mean to Taylor Swift because I like her songs and some of the most rabid fans are Swifties. I remember I tweeted something about she made some vapid political comments about like, if you're a Democrat, let's all just go shopping. It was not good. And then like, there was like a horde of what I'm assuming are like 14 year old girls who were just not happy. And actually it was I was kind of laughing because I had some of my followers arguing with like Taylor Swift, GRL fan power of three, six, nine hard on like, dude, what are you doing? Like this is this is a child. You're just leaving. Listen, I got to give credit to the Lauren army for stepping up to the plate. Yeah, even against the most atrocious of ours. Yeah, guys, you guys are you have more patience than I do. Anyway, so she was just honored with a the billboard decade woman of the decade award. I don't know what that is, but it is apparently a big award, huge privilege. And she gave her acceptance speech. She she did not come off as the most relatable person here. She is giving her acceptance speech after being named woman of the decade. She's like one of the best selling artists of all time. She was very intent on playing the victim and kind of bashing patriarchy. It was very strange. And I think this is kind of like the final evolution of Taylor Swift for the longest time. She was one of the few pop stars where it's like, all right, you're not going to get political. Thank you. Right. Because we have that from everyone else. We don't need it from Taylor Swift. I get within the last year, though, it's the the opposite. She's like fully flipped. She's talking about glad and now patriarchy, Democrats, the election. It's yeah, this speech was I think the worst example we've seen so far. Here's a clip of it. I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you, whether you deserve to be there, whether you're male producer or co writer is the reason for your success or whether it was a savvy record label, it wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry. So she is up there accepting this huge award. And I thought it was strange that instead of kind of focusing on thanking all the people who have helped her and how great this she really chose to focus on her haters and like everything that's tried to keep her down. And it was, I guess a different approach than I would have taken. And to my male producers, I got here despite you. Yeah, exactly. Well, that's the thing. I would never say that Taylor Swift, despite all of her success hasn't faced struggles because I think it's unfair to say, oh, you're rich. You've had it easy. I don't know. But I do find it interesting that the things she mentions there, like, is that really specific to female? That's what I'm saying is you're looking at that through a lens of feminism, right? It seems like to me, I would think the same thing of Justin Bieber winning male record of the year. I think that, wow, this guy, you know, probably a manufactured celebrity. I think it's fair to say that about any celebrity, someone's going to have a, like, does this person really deserve to be there? How much of their own stuff they're responsible for? It doesn't seem like that's an exclusively, like female criticism to have so it's just only through the lens of feminism. Do you see the world that way? You know, only through the lens of feminism, do you watch that Star Wars episode and you say, I haven't seen a woman in the first 19 minutes, I was liking this until I realized that. Yeah, and it's just strange because there again, this is Taylor Swift we're talking about like she has reached levels of success that so many male people would love to reach and kind of instead of talking about struggles specifically as an artist, she's chosen to frame this all as this huge feminist struggle and it's like, I don't make fun of me for saying this but it reeks of white feminism, which is actually a thing of valid term here. Like you are a privileged person. I'm not saying again, you've had struggles absolutely but you're trying to like co-op this language of I'm oppressed because I'm a woman but it's like, honey, I don't know how genuine that's coming across. And she like, this was her speech was 15 minutes. I did listen to all of it. Felt a lot longer than 15 minutes but we have another clip here and again she just hammering this whole feminism. You know her speaking isn't very good I would say either. Well I think that's fair to say. She's a singer. Yeah, I would not expect it to and I strongly suspect that maybe this is just me hating women. She had help writing that speech. When Fearless did win Album of the Year at the Grammys and I did become the youngest solo artist to ever win the award. With that win came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before. All of a sudden people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had had co-writers in the room. This is just what happens to a woman in the music if she achieves success or power beyond people's comfort level. Okay so she's not a relatable figure. I think it's safe to say as after I was given this huge honor album, the youngest person ever by the way, people they were just coming for me. They were coming for me hard. Said my singing was pitchy. Mentioned that I had co-writers. It's because this is what happens when women succeed. Yeah I mean way to find like I mean there's an expression for that. Finding like the bad in like literally a mountain of gold. Yeah exactly. It's incredible because I would love it if criticisms of me were so minor. Yes for real like the stuff that we see on YouTube and it's like every day in the Christmas season we don't know award for album of the year or anything like that. And someone Europe said and again these are criticisms that are not exclusive to female singers. Like you're a singer and someone was wondering whether your singing was pitchy. Is it because you're a woman really or is it because that's literally your job and some people are going to be critical. Again with the co-writer thing that's one of the especially when it comes to pop music I think people are very critical of pop musicians. Yeah not writing their own stuff. It's a bit different I think when you go into like maybe like hip-hop or rock I think performers are more involved in the writing process than pop stars a lot of time. Again this is not because you're a woman I don't know how fully indoctrinated into the whole feminism thing you have to be to hear these things and just think because woman especially like you said if you've just received all of these accolades. Like you're trying to paint yourself as the underdog here in what world is Taylor Swift an underdog you're like the most universally acclaimed artists and kind of like most mainstream corporate figure that I could possibly think of. In the last 10 years I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked up for their bodies their romantic lives their fashion or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist. I really like his songs but I don't know what it is there's just something about him I don't like. No female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth streaming record and ticket sales and critical acclaim so why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast we have to work this hard we have to prove that we deserve this and we have to top our last achievements women in music on stage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast. This kind of reminds me of when Hillary Clinton was running or even we saw this with people like Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren people don't really like those women and they were saying that that sexism it's like maybe. No it doesn't remind me of this. People just don't like you because of you. Well when remember when Hillary Clinton said something about wars the hardest on women because they lose their brothers and fathers. Yeah that's what this is like to me. Yeah it's like women are dominating the industry. Women are dominating the industry but it's because we have to. Yeah it's not because actually society is actually completely accepting of you and they love your stuff. Yeah and I think like as if you're a pop artist I would imagine it's a much easier thing to be a female pop artist than a male pop artist because I'm just thinking of the pop stars that I enjoy they're pretty much entirely female. I don't think we see the same I mean I guess you have one direction but I think the whole boy band thing is kind of like an outlier to. You're talking around the guy not the guy to talk to a pop artist about but I you know yeah I think it's probably easy to be a female pop artist nowadays I'm sorry but that's the way it is. Well on that level of course I don't think artists as a general rule have it easy because it's it's hard. Yeah it's a competition but it's like yeah I mean let's let's say women aren't doing as well in terms of growth as artists it's because men don't like you. Oh now we're doing super well the most growth the most accolade is because we have to because society puts all of these expectations on us because we're women it's like what? And not only that but under this entire thing is this this like hidden thought that she has that this she's so much better than everybody else right because I have to work this hard I am this good in fact I am this good despite men and I would have gotten this award like the decade before I was born as well just by how good I am. Not a lot of I guess appreciation for I guess her her producers her co-writers and the people surrounding her. And you do know that controversy that one controversy around her music. Her masters but besides that I'm sure she's had many good experiences. Yeah and that's fair and that's kind of the next clip Taylor Swift if you're not following the latest Taylor Swift news there's some controversy surrounding her the rights to her old music. Yeah and the the way that the music industry works in regard to like records and labels their control of over song right it's very very convoluted. Taylor Swift has been a very vocal critic of the system which I think is fair. Right now she's in I guess like a feud over some people who've bought the rights to her old music and she wasn't given the same option of buying those rights to own her actual music. I'm not going to say anything about that specific situation because I don't really know much about it. But I think it is fair to say she's had some like struggles with that and I think a lot of musicians will say the system isn't good but she she brings up this specific situation in this speech and she does use it to kind of criticize how the industry functions as a whole but she also brings up and I quote like toxic patriarchy and it's like again you you have so much to talk about why put this unnecessary feminist lens on it I don't understand it. And let me just say that the definition of the toxic male privilege in our industry is people saying but he's always been nice to me when I'm raising valid concerns about artists and their rights to own their music. And of course he's nice to you if you're in this room you have something he needs. Yet the most amazing thing was to discover that it would be the women in our industry who would have my back and show me the most vocal support at one of the most difficult times and I will never ever forget it. Okay so there I guess she's addressing the idea that she has this problem with this one individual scooter Braun I think his name is she's kind of alleging that he never treated her right he was also trying to control her music other people are like oh but I've worked with him I've never had any problems. That's an example of toxic patriarchy right there the fact that other people have had differing experiences with someone you don't like. And again like I'm not even saying maybe she is right I don't know but yeah it's a complicated situation. Yeah it's just weird to put this gendered lens on it I don't understand where that's coming. Absolutely and just like none of this stuff could be said also if you're the opposite gender like I'll remember all the men for sticking up with for me. Yeah there's a lot of things going on here that are just I feel like what what's happened is that like she's going through this and it's very very hard to make Taylor Swift again seem like an underdog because she got her first record label or sorry record deal I think when she was 16 and again I'm not saying that she doesn't deserve it. She's a good musician in my eyes but it's like you're you're trying to paint yourself as this person who everyone's tried to destroy and stuff like that. It's like I don't know if that's right but I think by trying to say oh because I'm a woman that's that you know you can get more sympathy points like that it's just it's very strange and this is this huge honor I don't know why you would spend the entire time talking about the people who didn't believe in you or who said you couldn't sing that well instead of focusing on all of the millions of fans who do support you. I don't know it just seemed like a petty seemed petty. Petty selfish. Yeah. Definitely delusional in my opinion. I think so yeah like again like this is just this is not this is not relatable and I don't know what kind of cause this political switch to be flipped on for her. I think maybe this might all be this might all be false and you know and if it's not then it definitely seems to be like you know how feminists if this is the initial feminist reaction it's the white feminism the first step the next step is woke feminism. Yeah maybe she's gonna like the next Taylor Swift album is gonna be way more intersectional she's not just gonna talk about she's gonna talk about like the migrants and the LGBTQ plus actually she's already done that a little bit but yeah maybe she's gonna get more intersectional the next time around but I don't even know if it's gonna equate to more money because like before there were some activists online who are criticizing her for not speaking up like Taylor Swift has said nothing on the on the noon after revisions and it speaks volumes that's like what no one no one is waiting like no one is hearing Trump speak and saying I wonder what Taylor Swift is that's not a thing that's happening now that she is getting all this I've seen so much more criticism of her than I actually ever did before I don't think this even is a good way to sell music to like regular I really hope not you know I really do hope not yeah I mean I think most people are getting sick of hearing celebrities kind of virtue signal yeah but what is always just a point is when you see all these artists kind of unanimously being left as progressives it's definitely difficult to control the opinions of the youth that are growing up listening to that stuff right because it's all that they yeah they're gonna it is the culture there are I'm sure teenagers out there who are gonna listen to Taylor's speech Taylor Swift's speech and think yeah Taylor Swift has it has it bad she's very oppressed because she is a woman and not kind of realize the irony that she's like literally one of the most privileged people to have ever existed yeah and she also like grew up rich I think like her father as well and again like I'm not saying Taylor Swift shouldn't be rich she doesn't deserve that like I'm not a communist who thinks we should just eat eat her well that's fine but trying to simultaneously portray yourself as part of an oppressed class when you've achieved levels of fame and success that most people could never even dream of rings a little hollow to me I think that's pretty much all the time we have for today though so thank you guys so much for tuning in and by the way this is our last show live kind of show like this the hour-long segment of 2019 yes so we will not be back here until 2020 actually yes that's true well we'll be live yeah and we won't be live until 2020 but we hope to see you guys then until next time"
