    "text": " Hello and welcome to Histeria. I'm Erin Ryan. This week, Karen Deal, Dana Schwartz, and Tan Tran join me in studio to talk about the invisible work that women do, and why Charlotte's web is kind of bullshit. Plus, Alyssa Master Monaco calls in to discuss why likability is the least likable way to assess the women running for the 2020 Democratic nomination. And as always, the hills will die on. Hey everybody, thanks for tuning in. First, a little housekeeping. If you have a hill that you will die on, record a 30 second voice memo and send it to hysteria at crooked.com. You can also contact us at that email address if you'd otherwise like to get in touch. But remember that I'm not the only one who checks it. There are a few people who read the messages there. So send personalized love notes and hate mail elsewhere, please. Hi. You have a theme song, which I've told you about before. And now I associate it with you when I get texts from you, like just on my phone in my free time, I picture the theme song playing. So it's a shame you can't hear it on your end because it's very apropos. OK, so here's something that we were planning on talking about for a while. And I think we keep we keep putting it off for a combination of the fact that things keep happening that we have to talk about that are more urgent, like what was happening in Georgia, and now it's happening in other states. And also, this is such a, I don't know, I feel like the topic is a little bit of drudgery because we spend so much time thinking about it and being annoyed by it. And that's female candidate likeability. Like them. Love them. What do we do? Yeah. So likeability is a barometer, an invisible barometer by which people measure female candidates only on whether or not they can ever be elected to office or deserve love, I guess, likeability, loveability. And it's something that I've noticed people are paying more critical attention to this cycle around. But there's still kind of throwing around this kind of dog with a likeability crap when it comes to candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar. So, Alyssa, let's kind of break it down and talk about why this is such an irritating way to measure candidates and what about it is sexist. So let's start with what is the one's the first time that you saw likeability used as a barometer for a female candidate? So, you know, it's funny when we were talking about this, I really like I wanted to think about it because I didn't want to just default to something. And so I really like put myself in a dark room and was like, what was the first time? And I remembered and I'm guessing that most people like I think that I'm probably as young as it gets for someone who would remember this. But back when Geraldine Ferraro was going to debate George Bush in the vice presidential debate in 1984. So, I don't remember hearing it on the news, but I remembered my mom talking about it in that the night before the debate when all of the sort of, you know, pontificators and pundits were talking about what was going to happen. Vice President Bush's press secretary said that he thought that Ferraro's biggest thing to overcome would be seeming bitchy. Okay. And I was like, what's bitchy? You know, I was a little slow at eight. And I'm like, what's bitchy? And my mom was like, mean, someone who's mean. And I was like, well, shouldn't presidents be mean? And, you know, then fast forward to 2008 or 2007 when I am in the Obama campaign and person who was a man told me to be careful to not come off as bitchy. Because people wouldn't like me and then wouldn't want to work with me. And I remember then being taken back to the Geraldine Ferraro conversation. So my life is complete. It's full circle. I think it's all of the bitch dot. Right. Connecting all the bitch dots, I think is very important for the modern woman. Well, it's your first time. You know, it wasn't in the context of a physical candidate, but it was related to Hillary Clinton. I remember being a kid during the first Clinton term. And Hillary, obviously, being a person who had her own ambitions and her own political desires and wanting to be more hands on in the White House. And I remember her doing things. I don't remember the term like ability, but I remember her responding to people not liking her by trying to act like she just loved doing typical First Lady things. Like, do you remember the Bake Off, the First Lady cookie Bake Off? Oh my goodness. She and that about that. Hillary Clinton is the reason that there is a Bake Off between potential first spouses during election seasons because Hillary Clinton wanted to kind of show that she was just like a regular wife. And you know, it sort of made me think about when I was thinking about like ability, I'm reading this book called Down Girl, which is a feminist philosophy book on the misogyny. And it's really, I do not recommend it for a beat read. It is not light reading, but it's really interesting. And one of the things that they talk about in the book is that that whenever a woman deviates from what the patriarchy needs her to be, she's punished, basically, when she's not available to them or when she's not, when she's not, she doesn't defer to them. And so I think like ability is an expression of, and this is going to sound again, very like college freshmen. But I think that like ability describes the tension between what women are supposed to be and what these women are trying to be. And they're like, is that string between what she's supposed to be and what she's trying to be still intact? Is she enough of what we want a woman to be while trying to be what a woman is not supposed to be? And it's like this impossible bind that women are in when they want to run for office. And I think this cycle around, it's become kind of, I don't know, I found it more annoying than ever. And I don't know how you feel about it, but where do you stand? So I have to say one thing, because you know, like you and I talk a lot about nuance. And so there was something that popped front of mind when I was thinking about likability. And it was that when I was on the John Kerry for president campaign in 2003 and 2004, the biggest hurdle that he had to overcome was also likability. People were like, well, no, I don't want to have a beer with him. I want to have a beer with George Bush. And so I think that like, we all need to just reassess what the fuck we mean by likability and why it maybe matters or doesn't matter. But this time, I think that, you know, look, it's what is what does the thing the first thing I saw in this cycle, I think was that stupid article about like is Elizabeth Warren going to end up like Hillary Clinton? Like, what does that even mean? Right, they're totally different. What does that even mean? They are completely different people. And I think that that's kind of my problem with the whole like media addressing the issue of likability. Because what does it mean? Because Hillary and Elizabeth Warren are both very different people save the fact they have sort of blonde hair. Mm hmm. Yeah, I think that I think that's really that's really interesting. And I almost think that it's a it's a symptom of laziness and happiness. People who are going through this dance want there to be a predictable arc to it. They want there to be a narrative to it. And they they harken back to old narratives and old assessments and old ways that things turned out. So like, they want the story to be okay, who is the who's the Cinderella of this can of this campaign? Who's the bitch? Who's the this? And I think that they go back and fill things in in a way that's just like it's boring and it's hacky, but it's also destructive because in creating these narratives, they limit the imagination of the voter and they decide what a leader looks like and they decide what an upstart looks like and they decide what a woman who's gotten too big for her britches looks like. And I think that that's what likability is. It's like asking the question is an implicit decision that this woman has she's something about her doesn't you know what she's just a little woman, you know. Do you know what it is? It's kind of like this this field in particular. I feel like the media should just come out and be like, who's Andrea Zuckerman? Who's Kelly Taylor? Who's Donna Martin? And who's Brenda? Who's the evil brunette? Who's the smart and likable, but not sexy school paper editor? Right. And and also what's the winning combination? Right. Well, a lot of it is is people who don't ever interact with normal people trying to decide what normal people want to do. And they they've decided, I think like it's funny just being from a small town and being from the Midwest, seeing what people on the coasts think of the people where I grew up. It's like, that's interesting and totally wrong. It's like when a, it's like when a child who's never gone to work tries to play office, it's like, well, no, we don't send that many faxes, you know, like, you don't know what you're talking about. Well, also and to me, there is a chasm between relatability and likability. So like, to me, I give zero bucks if someone can drink a beer. Guess what? I can't digest beer. So that person does nothing for me to be able to be like, Oh my God, she can throw them back. You know what I'd like to do is put every single person running for president on a stage and ask them if they know what the price of fucking gallon of milk is. You know, like to me, that is what like I'd like to see someone be able to talk like real people talk. And guess what? Beer is not actually just code for real people talk. It's like, she's likable because she can sit down and watch a game and throw back beers with me. Well, neither is milk because I don't drink milk. Well, that's how about some bread. Okay, bread's fine. Bread and eggs. Bread and eggs. I think that's fair. But but that's the, you know, I don't care if someone's likable. And I wish that they would just stop thinking because they really don't. And this is where it is gendered other than my sort of, you know, John Kerry example, almost any elude, I like any illusion to someone being likable. It's always about a woman. And why? I don't think it's just I don't think it's necessarily just about a woman. I think in the Kerry example for just I think it's about mostly it's about who is more feminine. Like it's about drawing lines between who is more feminine and who's more masculine because John Kerry like wind surfing and doing rich guy stuff and probably having soft hands. Those are things that like Americans would find. I mean, does he? Yes. Okay. True. Thank you. I mean, they are. Yeah. He takes care of his hands. Right. Right. But I'm saying that that when we say likable, it's not I think it goes beyond just man and woman. It's like masculine feminine. It's like this person deserves to be the president because he's more manly than the other candidate who we're questioning the likability of. So the question John Kerry was to like feminize him a little bit, I think. I think that's you know, that's genius. I had never thought of it that way, but you are 100% right because George Bush was the guy's guy. Mm hmm. Yeah. And right now, Donald Trump is a sort of cancerous version of the guy's guy. And so everybody by default is going to be more feminine than him. Thank God because that is. Thank God. Yeah. Because we deserve to have somebody with more feminine qualities in a position of leadership because he's meant or too emotional to lead. How can regular people ignore the bullshit? And it is really, here's here's an example of something that kind of distracted me this week. There was some numbers came out about money that was raised by Mayor Pete versus Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris raised $12 million since launching her campaign. Mayor Pete has raised, I believe, $7 million. Both of them are impressive. But a lot of the punditry was celebrating Mayor Pete as somehow besting Kamala Harris. And the way that they talked about it seemed like, wait a second, 12 is bigger than seven. Why is Mayor Pete being celebrated and not Kamala? And why are they being pitted against each other? And it just seemed like on its face, the coverage of it seemed like a black woman's accomplishments were being painted as lesser than a white man's lesser accomplishments. But Alyssa, you had some nuance to add to that conversation because the way that it was expressed was really clumsy, but it actually got at something that wasn't totally off base. Correct. And so this is why we all just have to put a little antennae up when we're looking at things. And so my first takeaway when I saw this was like, well, yeah, Kamala announced she was actually running for president in January. She had 20,000 people at her launch event and her campaign said, you know, 36 hours after the event was over that she had raised $1.5 million. So think about that, like, critically, that was three months ago, she had already raised $1.5 million. She seemed like a formidable candidate, whereas Mayor Pete hasn't even announced he's running yet. His entire campaign had been putting the narrative around him that like Mayor Pete just wants to get on the debate stage. He just wants to clear the hurdle of the DNC, you know, the DNC, what are the qualifications, which was basically that he wanted to get 65,000 unique donors. So yeah, when his number came out, it was like, what the fuck? $7 million. Like his campaign did a very good, very, very good job of making the expectations so low and earnest that yes, $7 million. And the reason that as you compare it to Kamala, who if I'm correct is the only woman who's released her number yet, right? I believe so, yeah. Right. And the only person of color who has released her number is that she actually, people had very high expectations for her because she did so well out of the gate and $12 million is in fact a tremendous number. Like that was that was my thing is that like her campaign actually came out with very high expectations 90 days ago. And he's been running so like low to the ground and behind the scenes that like it makes sense that people were like, wow, that was great. But the way that people reported it, the reporters, I think were a bit ham-handed about the numbers and didn't talk about the fact. So if you're a normal American person and you're watching the news and reporters are like, wow, his numbers great, especially when you see Kamala only raised 12, like it's just it was not a thorough and intellectual discussion of what the numbers met. Well, there's a lot to read. There's a lot to ignore. And there's going to be a lot more to talk about as we plot toward 2020. Alyssa, Master Monaco. Let's plot. It's our cardio. Let's plot. We're going to plot. Love you. Talk to you next week. Bye. Bye. Stick around. There'll be more hysteria after the break. Welcome back to hysteria. I'm Erin Ryan joining me for the panel segment of the show this week. We have three wonderful women. We have Dana Schwartz, author of Choose Your Own Disaster, among other things. Dana, here's my question for everybody this week. Yeah. When somebody calls you, how do you pick up the phone? I have now a pat answer that I do force of habit. I just go, hi, this is Dana. Even if it's like seamless calling and I know it's seamless, I always just do hi, this is Dana. It's so weird because like I've never heard you say Dana in that tone of voice. Yeah. And the tone is locked in. It'll never. Dana. Yeah. It's a song. You can write it as sheet music. You really could. There's a certain like cadence and pacing to it. I do that every time. I did it like consciously. I was like, I need a way to pick up the phone. Yeah. Now I do it every time. Yeah. I pick it up by usually if I pick it up, I say, what's wrong? But yeah, my boyfriend's a phone caller person. So I'm used to it. So like when he calls, I'm like, hey, you know, like just normal conversation beginnings. But sometimes if someone's calling who's like a, it's like a person, I'm like, Hey, you know, that's good. It's like my awkward, like, why are you calling? Hey, you next we have actor comedian and red checkered shirt wearer, who always gets terrible nicknames for me. This is a great, great red checkered shirt. This is going to be our thing. I'm going to like kind of undercut your confidence. Yeah. You're razzing me. That's what this female podcast is. It's about bringing everybody down a few pegs. I just think everyone together to bring them down. Yeah. I think together at the bottom, because that way we're all flying equally high. Yeah. That's not happening outside this room. No, no, no, no. So Karen, how do you answer the phone when someone calls? Usually pretty skeptically. It's usually like, I'm usually like, hello. I'm usually like, I'm more, I'm like, I don't have like the subtext is whatever you want. I don't have that money. I don't have it. I don't have a debt collector. Hello. Who are you calling for? Who is this? Not on it. And third and totally not least, actor comedian, Tien Tre. Totally not least. I was going to say last and not least. And I said third and not least, as though every list only has three items in it. I'm really batting a thousand today. I've been talking too much this week. Tien, how do you answer the phone? I know myself and I'm very positive forward. So I usually answer like, hey, hello. Hi. What would you all three? You're like a puppy running to the door. You've been gone for five minutes. I can't wait to see you. So your subtext is like, oh, you call. Yes. Yes. I'm like, oh my God, someone thinking about me. Thank goodness. Well, that sounds like a very positive person to hear on the other end of the phone. So thank you for being the only positive person in this room. I'll try. You just got skepticism and like professional, like cold professionalism. Cold distant professionalism. Cold distant professionalism. Well, she goes up at the end. Yeah. That's like, Dana, it's like, it'll be the same every time I might offer you something. I mean, up speak, a little bit of up speak. Well, let's get on to the topic of today, which is the amount of emotional and garbage work that women have to do all the time, every day in all contexts. And by women's work, I don't mean like cleaning because, I mean, whatever, we're not talking about that today. I mean, sort of emotional labor that we always perform in the context of relationships and conversations. I'm also talking about the type of busy work that we are asked to perform in offices and in professional settings. And I wanted to talk about how that kind of drains us of energy that we could be using for better things. So first of all, I'm going to throw this question to the table. Have you all had a relationship with someone where you felt like you were taking on more work than your partner? Domestic work. No, because I'm terrible at that. And I'm very messy. And so I do feel like I've been with partners who are slightly neater and will take that on just because they don't want to live in squalor with me. But I apologize to everyone I've ever dated. But also, I have noticed that I think in terms of like the money and time you take for like basic grooming and appearance things, which is like the amount of things that I did fundamentally to look human and like acceptable was like so many hundreds more dollars and hours of time than whatever they did, where it's like, I don't think people always understand in a workplace what a woman has to do to look professional. I think that's a great point. And it sort of reminded me of that scene in season one of the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel when she goes to bed with her husband with her full makeup on and then waits until he's asleep and then like goes into the bathroom, takes it all off and then wakes up before him the next morning, puts on a full face of makeup, puts perfume on, and then pretends to be asleep before he wakes up so that he can think that that's how she always looks. And I think that a lot of it is a lot of the work that women do, I know it's heartbreaking. Oh my god, that's, it's heartbreaking. It's a heart breaking scene. Oh my god, straight people make it hard. But a lot of it, I was like, oh, the 50s. I mean, but a lot of it, even outside of the context of romantic relationships, a lot of work that women do is sort of like invisible. And sometimes you find yourself, I think women find themselves being accused of or not appreciated as someone that's doing that much work. Karen, have you had an experience where you felt like you've been carrying the brunt of the emotional workload? Yeah, I've definitely found myself in a situation where it's like, I was like, in the kitchen more and kind of doing the teasing out of what's wrong, but all of those relationships fail pretty, pretty spectacularly. So, you know, yeah, but I think the thing, it's interesting to be in a moment where you find it's almost like a frog in water. Like, and the water gets hotter and hotter. And it's like, so you don't start there. But then there's a certain point where you're like, wait, how did I get here? Like, why am I like in the kitchen for two hours doing a thing while someone else is on the sofa? What am I, my mother? Right. Yeah. And then you get to a point where you're finally boiling and you're like, I am not getting hummus for you. And like, why are you mad about hummus? Why are you mad about hummus? No, I'm not mad about hummus. I'm mad about the last six months. We're all on to it. Get to hummus. You know, it's, it's, and it's like, it becomes this like, blow up over something that seems really trivial, but actually isn't. But just to kind of zoom out into more like friendships and interactions that are professional, Tien, have you ever found that you have friendships where you are carrying mostly emotional workload? Yeah. I've had some like creative collaborations that I used to have with like cis straight men that I now no longer have because it reached a point where, you know, we would be, it was in the days of like post college and everyone was trying to, we were trying to do like indie sketch shows. So like, you needed to go reach out to a place and like book a theater and, and do tech and like schedule all of that. And all of that work without fail always fell to the women of the group. Like the men would never even think to be like, oh, I'll email the theater and try to set up a tech time. Like that would have been insane to them to do, for them to do. And so it was like, we were always doing that. The women of the group, there's three of us and we were always doing that. I hope they're listening. And yeah, and I know, and now I, like, I don't have that partnership anymore because we tried to work on something together, just the two of us. And it turned into like me constantly hounding him to meet for, and maybe this is just a bad, maybe it was just a bad collaborator, but constantly hounding him to like show up on time and like do these things. And I would have to like, instead of him taking the initiative to, you know, reach out to someone, find scheduling and audition people, like I would have to tell him to do that work. Right. And you know, it's interesting. I was listening to a Harvard Business Review podcast yesterday, which is insane. But they have a podcast called Women at Work. And there's a lot of, they have a lot of like academics coming and talk about issues like this. And one of the things they were talking about was what's called non-promotable work, which is work that doesn't really show in, it's not really related to the job you're supposed to be doing, and it's not going to get you a promotion. You know, it's the sort of thing like volunteering for a committee, bringing snacks to the meeting, making coffee for everybody. And there's actually been research that has found that women get asked to do non-promotable work, or expected to do non-promotable work, more than men and women of color, especially get asked more to do non-promotable work and to do work that's like busy work. And that, yeah, that doesn't lead to many like workplace outcomes. And it takes away energy from work that you're supposed to be doing. You know, I find it interesting in a larger conversation about feminism and sexism, when people are like, oh, but like, not all stereotypes are negative, but there's still this like really pervasive stereotype about women that women are like the competent put together one. Like think about like, yo, we're commercial women, where like, the man is like on the couch and he's watching football and he's a slob and doesn't know like what laundry detergent he is. And the wife is like, honey, use tie. They're like whatever. Like in a yogurt commercial. Yeah, it's amazing. I was like a yogurt commercial is my life goal. I look at those and I'm like, yeah, let's go get a Greek yogurt. But also definitely is that yo play where like the husband's like looking for dessert and she's on having you seen that one of you on the phone. He's like, I have banana cream pie and the husband's like, where? And he like doesn't know it is to yogurt. This is a husband who can't read or he's got yogurt blind. Yeah. It's a condition that that affects a lot, mostly men. Mostly men. About 2% of the male population actually has yogurt blindness. And it's not funny, Dana. It's not funny. They can't see yogurt in the fridge. They can't read the flavors if they can see it. It's it's it's serious. It's like, it's for you to bring it up is pretty insensitive. Yeah, really. And so let's hope there are no women. But it's like that stereotype that women that women are like competent in the ways that men aren't is still like weirdly and pervasive used against women. That's like, oh, of course, you'll be the ones who can like make the arrangements because I'm a dumb guy. I'm just too busy doing like running the whole company. Yeah. Well, I'm I'm so dumb that I can only run the whole company. Yeah. I can't make the coffee. Yeah. I can only I can only make trades on other people money. Like it doesn't make any sense. Right. That like women are smart enough to like be the only ones who know how to use the coffee machine, but not smart or capable enough to do meaningful work. I've had it where the my labor has been incredibly exploited. Like, you know, during a film project or something, it's like just there's an expectation. I think that I think that film can be incredibly exploitative, just generally, specifically film. And so it's like, but some of those companies were run by women. You know, so it's like anyone can be a dick. That's true. That's true. In this day and age, in this Me Too era, we can all be. Do you get flashbacks to like fourth grade group projects where like God bless like the type A girl who want an A and just like everyone around her not doing or is it am I projecting? No, no, no, no. I was that girl. I mean, just like, oh, just let me do it. Yeah, just like, just let me do it. That attitude went all the way into college. I remember I was on a my senior year, like Spanish oral exam. The teacher put me with a fucking football player. And he was just like not doing anything. And I was like, oh, just let me do it. And that was probably what he wanted to do. He was not a dumb guy. He was smart enough to get me to do all the work. Aaron, you know how to make the coffee. I'm too dumb to figure it out. You know how to make the coffee and espanol porphy. An espanol. That's an old Cosby joke that he talks about. Like, it's a very famous old bit that he does where he like he his wife asks him to make the breakfast for the kids. And he goes down and then he like makes this like, I don't remember what he did. I think he did ice cream. Oh, that's dairy. And he like he feeds them dessert, basically. So they're eating it and they're having such a good time. Then she comes down. She's like, what's going on? And then she sent him back up to bed, which is like exactly where he wanted to be in the first place. Like, like delivering in competency. It's a very funny bit. But it's like, but it's that idea. I feel like my dad will do that. You know, like, my cat, follow the recipe. I'm too dumb. No, it's just like, oh my god. No, you're not guys. You're not you're way less dumb than you're trying to trick us into the yeah, you are. I feel like group projects totally taught me definitely as like an overachieving young person, the wrong message, where it was like, if you wanted job done right to it yourself. Yeah. And then that can lead to a sort of burnout, right? If you're putting all your energy into these things that don't really produce results that are directly related to the work you're supposed to be doing, then you're not able to do your work as well. And that's something that I've I've found is is something I need to consider as I'm like, like loading my plate with more and more things. If I spend my time doing stupid emotional labor bullshit, I just can't do it. Like I can't I can't be involved with it at all. I have to just totally cut it off. And what's with this? I think another part of emotional labor is the fantasy is that it's also invisible. That that even compounds the idea that we're not getting credit where it's like the perfect woman, like the perfect like step for woman situations. Like she's perfectly groomed perfume and like her suit is everything's pressed. And like the suit is pressed perfectly and like breakfast is ready and coffee is made and like everything's done. There's like this facade that it was all just like done by visible elves and then it was easy. Yeah, right. So like part of it, it's really insidious that like you don't get credit for it because also part of the work you're doing is making it look like you didn't do anything. Right. That's an additional layer of work. I was just thinking it's like the Cinderella birds. Yeah. It's like all those birds and my rodents. It's the rodents. A lot of rodents. Would you let mice do your hair? I would. You know, if they were you know, about that mice fight. Yeah. If they were very good at it and like spiders, I don't give a fuck. You know, let's do your hand. That's a step too far. I are the good at it. If they're good at it. Yeah. Okay, fine. What about like Charlotte with that web, you know, you're right. You're right. And she's voiced by Julia Roberts in the new adaptation. Yeah. I spent talk about emotional labor. Charlotte. Oh my God. That story is a story of emotional labor. Right. This spider is she dies. She dies if she. She fucking dies for this pig. Yes. Little. She works every night to just have like a little fun message that picks up this male pigs confidence. Oh my God. So he doesn't die. So he does not get slaughtered. And then she's like, yo, I'm really tired. I just got to have these babies now. And die. That's the story. She does emotional labor for men has babies and dies. Yeah. She's smart enough to spend. We all that spider. Oh my God. We love the system. That story is really weird because why would even if the web says like, this is some pig, why would anyone still be impressed with the pig? Yeah. Like Jesus Christ, that spider can write. Because that's invisible work. That's an example of visible work being credited to a man. Yeah. We have just totally. Guys, we have to write this. I think like this is a book. Shout outs. This is a think piece. This is at very least an Insta story. I think I think okay. Yes. Insta story. Maybe. No, Erin, you don't get paid for Insta stories. Write this and submit it to a place that mother fucking pays you for your work. Oh, they could make a movie called like feminist retelling of children's stories that fucked us up. That would be one. She did do all the work, though. She did. She did the writing and nobody was ever like, what a dope guy. You know the state of all night. She would do it the third thing. It's a mixed-weenies piece that's like feminist retelling of childhood. Okay. Well, this has become a writer's room. I was thinking as we were talking about, a lot of this is very based on heteronormative and cis concepts of what women are. They sort of, those ideas haunt all of us, but I wonder how emotional labor plays out in the context of same-sex relationships between women. I'm in a really great relation. I love my girls. No, I'm in a great relationship now where it's been six years and we have a very, we're very good at talking to each other. We could, I could argue that we both do too much emotional labor for each other. Oh. Yeah. We're working on our emotions a lot, but in the past, I've had like partners and girlfriends who I have fallen into being, I think because like certain characteristics are tied to certain femininity and masculinity and like, I, maybe the more fem presenting one would take on some like more emotional labor in one particular relationship. And so I think it's like, it's, it's, it depends. It depends. Like I think those heteronormative standards still fall on us. And like, I know a lot of same-sex couples where the pattern of like one who's a bit more, like one who takes on more masculine traits is the one that's like, you know, not thinking about the party planning or the, the cooking or like making sure that everyone's comfortable hosting. Like you can tell, like those characteristics are still very real and gender roles are very pervasive. You know, it's so interesting. The same way I think that like my phone voice is just like an imitation of adults that I've heard. Like I do feel like sometimes people like play act at relationships that they see in media and it's sort of like, if the wife is the, you know, one cooking and cleaning and it's sort of like the sitcom housewife and the husband's always on the couch, like that's something that people subconsciously or consciously imitate. It's probably also how you grew up. What you saw and what was modeled in your home and then your reaction to it. You know, so if you grew, like I grew up where my mom did all the work and I was like, that's fucked up. I want to do that. So it's like a very conscious, that was a very conscious decision. I do have a friend who's a construction worker, like a really tall big dude. Wife works for Apple and they're like, so she's in San Francisco a lot of the time. So he has this like truck and then he has this baby and he's always like, he's always like going to the preschool to pick up the baby. He's always taking the kid to the doctor's office and he's telling me constantly there's so much curiosity around him. They're like, who is this guy? Somebody's babysitting. Yeah, exactly. A man with a child. Literally, like every day, like people are like, every day he shows up clean. So I guess it's fine. Like people are like, this kind of, yeah, people are, it's like, it's still, it's like almost an oddity. Yeah. He's like, such a present dad. That's such an interesting point that you bring up because I really hate when people describe dads watching their own children as babysitting. Yes. It's your child. When nobody is like, mom's babysitting the child now. I think that's another type of labor that women are expected to perform that men are just not expected to perform and that seeps into all these different areas of women's lives. Like professionally, women have difficult time advancing. Equal payday is a thing partly because women who have children experience economic consequences because they're expected to care for the children and they are the ones who ask for people at work to allow them to leave early. They're the ones that that responsibility falls on and dads don't experience a similar thing. And I just, I wonder, as like the years have passed, have you guys noticed this improving at all or does it seem like it's just the same? Like the Mr. Mom kind of trope. I feel lucky at my workplace entertainment weekly, we have a lot of women and multiple pregnant women now and one who just gave birth. So I feel like I'm in a noticeably good environment for women. And like, so that's something that I've clocked where I'm like, oh, this is good. That's great that I have now three women who are superior to me in the workplace who all are publicly young mothers and like talk about their children. And that's something that I hadn't experienced up until now. And I'm like, that's a good thing. I get to notice. Right. Well, it's such a, it's such an economic to choose to have children is such an economic decision as well as like a personal decision. Like, I'm, you know, working in a writer's room. I have like, I'll have like three intense months of work where I just can't miss any days. I can't call off. I just, I am owned by the show that has hired me. That's, that's it. And then I'll have like a few months off. And then I'll, so it's like for somebody like me who has like a schedule that's way more permissive than the average American woman and who has a lot more economic freedom and really good WGA insurance. It's like still a fucking hard decision. Like there's part of me that's like, okay, the age I'm at, I should start thinking about this. But it's so, I don't want to be like punished. You know, I don't want people to not want to hire me because it's like, well, she got pregnant the one time. She could do it again. You know, I mean, it's like, it's a dumb thing to be afraid of. But it is something that crosses my mind for sure. Yeah, I've had so many friends who have had this situation of going to work and being like, when do you tell? Like, when do you tell them that you're pregnant? And when will they start taking work away from you? Which is like, it shouldn't be that way. Like they should absolutely still be able to work as much as they want and like make the decisions on when they should stop. Whereas like, yeah, I'll have friends who really just are like, yeah, I'm not going to tell. I'm just going to try to go. I'm just going to show up and one day with a baby and try to get away with it. I'm just getting fat in this one area of my body. I love the way if you're growing a person inside of you, I think you should just be able to like chill for three years. And like get paid, like get paid the whole time you have the child. And it's like went after your body gets torn apart by that child. And then for like a year or two afterwards is like, you know, just relief, just fucking relief for continuing the human race. Yes. Am I the only one who thinks this way? I don't feel like this is an extreme perspective. And there's a lot of silence in this room. And I think I think it's a very, I think it's American society is depressingly far from being there. Like, I think we would all love for that to happen. But like, I'm just imagining if like a presidential candidate for 2020, we're like, I think people, I think we're going to let's get fucking Scandinavian guys like maternity leave for like a year. Yeah, it's we're one of three countries in the entire world that doesn't offer government sanction, paid maternity leave. Like, what the fuck? And that's bad for young families. That's bad for men and a young parents, just young parents in general, because of the if you don't, because this is another thing I was thinking about with emotional labor. It's like, if you have a community, like now American society is so individualistic, like you don't live close to your, I mean, maybe some people do still, but it's like, like I don't live close to my parents. Whereas like imagine if you live close to your parents and you have children, then it's like, you have free babysitters, you know what I mean? Who are like so excited to see your family. So if you live in an extended family situation, it's like then somebody can do the cooking, somebody can do the cleaning. It's like a little bit more of like, you can toss the baby around like a football, like that's what you do when you have, you know, an extended family situation. And then it's a little bit more of people were meant to live in communities, you know. So it's like, one of the things I think about sometimes with like immigrants, it's like, in India, it's a much bigger, it was like a much bigger extended family situation. So it's like, even if women did all the work or like when my mother moved to England, all the kids did all the work, it was still like three or four sisters, do you know what I mean? In a big situation. So the mom comes home, she doesn't do, my grandmother would come home. And it was like, she had teammate for her. She like, she took a nap or whatever. Then when my mom moved to Florida, it's just the three of us. It's just my dad, my mom, and me. And so she ends up doing like all of that labor herself because I guess I was very lazy. That's like, as I'm talking, I'm like, oh, realization. I am the one at fault. I am a monster. Okay. Cool. Well, that's a really great point, I think, that people used to live in bigger extended family situations in the US and in other parts of the world, people still do. And that gave me an idea. I think we need to make a tender for extended families. So just hear me out. I thought you were going back to commune on the lake. No, we're talking about your commune on the lake one time. It's women only commune on the lake, 100%. But I think for people in big cities, like there are plenty of people who are like empty nesters whose kids moved away, who don't really come back and hang out. And there are us who moved here who aren't anywhere near our family. So what we need is actually a really good idea. It's like a tender for like empty nesters who are like, I really want to have somebody over for Sunday dinner and you're like a tender for family for family. Family. Family. Tinder. Fender. Fender. That sounds that sounds like a really bad. Yeah. I bet if we were dictionary, we would find something that's when like someone fingers you and fucks up and I got fintered and I just read they missed all the holes and me to extension. Oh, God. Oh, God. This was so wholesome. I know that it became H.O.LE. some wholesome. Say fender. I won't. I won't. I will never say that word again. But I think like family. Tinder. Yes. Family. Tinder. Or we name TBD. Yes. Exactly. This is not like child care. But there is that thing where young people who like graduate from college who are like don't have a lot of income live in old like retirement homes and communities because the it's cheap and like there's all the facilities there and like old people need young energy to like keep it live and you know, lively and young people get to like live there like either free or super, super cheap. It's like a good like communal. Have you done that? No. I would do that. Well, I think like that brings up a really interesting point. Like I love old people. Elderly women and emotional labor is a really interesting topic too because elderly women grew up in a time where even more was expected of them and even and they were less allowed to express themselves in their own needs. And so I think it's interesting that there are these, you know, there are communities of people now who kind of don't have anybody to do things for. And I think that that is an important brings up an important point, which is that if you have an opportunity to like hang out with elderly women who are not related to you, do it because they're they're awesome and they're super fun. If you have a nursing home in your town, you can go talk to a volunteer coordinator and ask if there's somebody who like has, you know, can't really see anymore and want somebody to read to them. Like I used to work in a nursing home when I was in high school and they and college and they they're just the best. And that's like one way to sort of you can do emotional labor for somebody who is kind of already paid into the emotional labor bank. Pay it that investment. Yeah. Yeah. Emotional labor socialism. Right. Right. Exactly. And social security. It's going to run dry. There won't be enough for all of us totally. So what is something that we as women can do to interfere with the cycle of us performing emotional labor and re channeling our energy into something that's more worthwhile? What's something that and here's something that I will will say just I'll answer my own question. I think something that's really important is that if you are if you're somebody that's doing things a lot for somebody and you don't think that they know, just tell them, you know, I think that like keeping things secret and silent is just it's burdening you. It's bringing the temperature of the water up. So you the frog are getting closer and closer to boiling. I think the best thing that you can do is just be open about the fact that you're frustrated or you feel as though you're doing more than you should be doing. Whether or not that's at work, you can just take your boss aside and be like, look, you know, I volunteered for a lot of these committees or you've asked me to do this a lot. And I would just like maybe next time to have somebody else do it just because I've been doing it a lot. You know, there's I have a lot of important work. I would like to do that. So that's that's my advice. Yeah, I would say something similar, which is that like if you're if you think the illusion of it being invisible is part of the gift that you're giving, you can fix that. You don't need to hide the work. You don't need to like duck be a duck. We're stuck smooth on the surface and working really hard underneath. I think that's a fantasy that a lot of women want to play into. Ducks are fantasies. Swan. That's crazy. All right. What's a no, no, that's a great idea. Yeah, me busting today. No, I'm just like, I don't know. I realized I was like, I don't know that much about like duck and man. I mean, they are doing a ton of work. So like if that's part of the fantasy, you can dispel that and also just then like fight your instinct, where if I know a lot of women be included are perfectionists and like want, if they're like, Oh, well, the coffee hasn't been made yet or like some little task hasn't been done yet. You can just like fight that and have your internal temperature rise slightly and get used to it a little bit and be okay with things being imperfect and not doing that thing. Okay, Karen, how are you? You can be the one to play dumb. The idiot. That's the best. Be dumber. Try less hard or be like, what, what, what, I don't get it. And then somebody will just be like, well, I'll do it. Like you with cleaning. Yeah, you're this you're kind of doing it. Except I really don't play dumb. I just I don't have an eye here. Right. Right. But I'm saying you were saying you're very messy. Yeah, but it's like technically you could be not messy. Yeah, I think then it plays back into what I'm saying. It's like, I don't mind like I don't mind my clothes on the floor. Right. And so it's like, well, if you mind, like you can clean. Yes. So that's a little bit of exactly what I'm talking about. Like, well, yeah, yeah, I can't say I'm clothes blind. I can't. Yeah, I'm close one. I can't read that. All right, Tian, what do you think? I would say that if you can and you have the ability to surround yourself with people who appreciate that work and who also take on some of that work, yeah, then you can start to like spread out the emotional labor that is passed around. Like, I feel very lucky and blessed that like most of the folks that I've I now exclusively am friends with women and queer. Or those are the people that I hang out with the most. And I find that to be that like, it's the most nurturing and also satisfying less toxic relationship is because I'm surrounded by people who are thinking about that work as not being invisible. And we're like, very thankful for each other and showing appreciation. So if you can show yourself. And that can come in any relationship. Yeah. It's like, and I think you can improve upon that. And that was probably better advice than playing dumb. And that's another tip that I want to add in and piggyback on is like, then thank the people in your life for doing the labor. Because there's a lot of people doing labor that probably isn't being noticed. And Tian, all of us to be like, Hey, you did that. Thank you. Great job. Yeah. Yeah. I do want to say that I think that while men, boys and men are socialized to perform less emotional labor, I think that I've seen that there's a certain group of men. There's some men who really want to do better and that are trying. Like we get emails from male listeners all the time, like dads and people that are just like, Oh, it's cool. And it's like, you know, I think that that if you're a man and you're listening, you know, this isn't this isn't us like scolding you. This is us just being like, you can, you can be better, you know, and and notice the things that the women around you are doing and appreciate the things that the women around you are doing. And if you notice that there's something that can be done, then try, try doing it yourself and see how that feels. And actually might feel good to like do something for other people if that's not typically what you do. So unfortunately, that is all the time we have for this conversation. We have to take a break when we come back the hills that we will die on. And welcome back to more hysteria. We've reached the end of the show almost. This is the part where we take adamant stances on things that don't really matter. The hills will die on. Let's get started with a listener hill. Hi, hysteria. This is Sarah from San Antonio, Texas. The hill that I will die on is when you make a plan with someone and then they show up super early and text you and say, hey, I'm here as though you should also magically be there. If we say let's get seven and you show up at 6 30 and text me that you are there, I should not have to feel bad that I am not also there because we said seven. So show up on time or if you get there early read a fucking book or something. Yeah, that is my help. A lot of nods around the table for that one, Sarah. Everybody seemed pretty much on that hill. I'm the person who always shows up early. I'm just a pathologically early person to plan to usually. And I will say, usually I do have a book and I don't mind. I just want to let you know that in case you were like, oh, well, I don't want to be too early. I'll circle the block a few times. I'm just texting you to let you know. But no pressure. Don't worry. I do have a book. Oh, Dana, well, you and Sarah maybe would not be compatible with us as hangout pals. Okay, what's to go first this week? I'm not going to do it because mine's stupid. Mine is so stupid that I'm going to start because I can't I can't follow like any serious one. Mine is about a movie. The movie is the nightmare for Christmas. And my hill is that the couple Jack and Sally are terrible and people pretend it's a love story. And I just don't understand it fundamentally. Really confuses me and weirds me out. In case you're not familiar, the movie is about skeleton pumpkin king named Jack Skellington who wants to experience the joy of Christmas. Because he's a puppet one. The tape. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And he accidentally sees Christmas and is like, what is this joy? I want to experience it for myself. So he tries to culturally appropriate Christmas. And he tries to kidnap Santa and tries to become Santa. It's spectacularly goes up in flames. And the only person who saw that coming is like a Frankenstein woman named Sally, who's in love with him this whole time. He ignores her this whole time. And then after he's exploded and like literally bombed down by the government. I swear to God for it's a really weird movie for ruining Christmas. He is like, I shouldn't have done Christmas. You were right. Also, I love you. Also, we're a couple now and we're perfect together. And the last song is a love song. And I'm like, Jesus Christ. And like my and like hot topic team who love my chemical romance like also are like, yeah, Jack and Sally, like my love story, like couples like think it's cute. But like, no, he ignores her the entire time. She warns him that this Christmas is a bad idea. He like fully is like, yeah, yeah, whatever. They never have a conversation. She pines after him. And then finally at the end, he's like, yes, I love you. And so it's nice that like a weird quiet girl who it was in love with like the popular jock boy does get like the boy to love her. But they're a terrible couple. And nowhere in the movie do they like have a love story at all. And it's really weird to me that this love story exists. And I just whenever I see like like goth couples who are like into that, it makes me really uncomfortable. Not because you're got like be goth. That's great. I love my chemical romance. Just don't like Jack and Sally as a couple. I have my favorite thing about the Nightmare Before Christmas. I love that movie, even though I have to not think it's one of those movies you have to not think about it. It's aesthetically really like fun. Yeah. And the music is fun. And one of my favorite things to do around the holiday season is to talk like in the movie and look out to me. I'm grocery narrate my life in the Jacks' Killington voice. You guys are, you know, you're welcome for not doing that at all over Christmas this year because I do that a lot. I feel like I just got like I feel like the color has to like I've done the blood has I got really heated. I didn't expect to get so passionate. I mean, I would go one step further and just like all those all cartoons and all those films don't need love and yeah, they simply don't need them. They could just be friends. It makes it makes me so mad when like children's and then I don't typically I don't think Nightmare Before Christmas is a children's film, but it's like a younger film. And I just don't I don't think you need like I just watched Wreck It Ralph for the first time. Don't ask me why. Yeah, there is there is like a really bizarre forced one between Jack McBrayer's character and Jane Lynch's character. Weird. The tiny hammer guy and the tough lady and they just forced this romantic relationship between them and it's completely unnecessary. Yeah, so I like love people like love. Well, I will say the better I amers. I weirdly I really like the movie Corpse Bride another Tim Burton stop motion and that one has a love story, but it like makes sense like they're on equal footing. Yeah. So if you want a love story, go to Corpse Bride. No one does. Everyone goes to Nightmare Before Christmas. Corpse Bride. Not a love story. Good advice. I will be watching Corpse Bride. I will not be watching Corpse Bride. Watch Corpse Bride, you guys. Speaking of corpses, I'll go next. So I was I was walking around my neighborhood earlier this week and I crossed the street without looking and I almost got hit by a car and I looked and it was a smart car and my first thought was like that would have been humiliating. Like imagine if I just got like I'm just imagining my like wrecked body being like being just slammed by a smart car. A it would have been my fault for not looking. B it would have been like it would have humiliated this like poor smart car driver who's probably a good person just like trying to like have his little impact on the environment possible. And third like I'm imagining being in a fucking hospital with like tubes going into me and stuff and being like yeah smart car did this to me. How embarrassing. I hope that if I ever get hit by a car it is a giant truck and not a smart car. So your hell is you shouldn't get hit by a smart car? I just think it would be very embarrassing if you got hit by a smart car. That is my hill. That is my hill. I will literally I won't even die on it. Won't even be strong enough to kill me this hill. Well if you die on it we hope it wasn't biased for a car. Exactly. So that's my hell. I told you it was dumb. It was really dumb. Okay anyway. Tien do you want to go? Yeah. Okay yeah. I'll go. Since we were talking about couples the hill that I will die on is that I really dislike and don't I really hate when couples um Facebook post each other like put I really don't like when couples communicate via social media. Oh I hate it. In a very specific like I'll have one person who I think this is a personal pet peeve who their boyfriend will comment on one of my photos and they will only like the boyfriend's comment and ignore the. Which is funny. I know I'm like this is so weird. I don't want to be a part of this. This is some gross weird you're right it is some gross weird foreplay that I'm witness to on my post. I don't like it. I don't like when you should reply and be like don't put this on but don't put this on. Don't include this. Don't include this emotional labor on me. My favorite way to respond to like dumb ass social media posts is just the word unsubscribe. I should start doing that. There's like a back and forth in my Twitter mentions not between romantic people. If people are like having some pedantic argument I just respond to all I'm like unsubscribe. And then I mute the conversation. I mean it's I'm not going as far saying like if you if you're a significant other post something and you want to like post something cute underneath it that's fine. But don't have it play out on someone else's. Yeah social media presence. Yeah okay that's fair. All right Karen how about you? Well Dana you inspired me I was going to say and I didn't like Edward Scissorhands. Okay yeah I saw it as a child. I don't like that film. I don't like the film. I don't like Johnny Depp because of this movie. Yeah I don't like it. Wait you don't like Johnny Depp because of the movie. No I think this first. I've never liked Johnny Depp or. That's fair. I dated the other reasons. Yeah I mean there's other reasons now but like I was like hey he kind of won me back when he was that weird pirate man. But then it was like when he was like it's fun. It's fun. It's a fun movie. I saw I saw Edward Scissorhands when I was quite young and I don't think I was ready for it. And I had nightmares about it. And I was like and all I can remember to this day is like I was like why don't they just give this guy hands. He's got scissors for hands. Hinson Price died. I know I was so I can I can still remember being so incredibly stressed out. I was like the entire the entire thing I remember being like why can't they just need to give this guy hands and find this old man. And I was like thank god and then he died and I was like what is this? This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare. Well if it were Edward regular hands it wouldn't be a movie. Yeah Edward regular. What did you call what the fuck what is what is I don't know man. What come on man. How is that come it put scissors for hands. Yeah. It's insane. It's an it's insane. How did you sell that movie. Yeah. Why why. And then he'll have scissors for hands. I hate that film. It sounds like something that a person who had taken some mushrooms and wandered around Joshua tree came up with. They were like a movie about a guy with scissor hands because they were looking at the trees and it was like it looks like the trees and the scissors. Anyway that's that's how I think that movie he'd he'd probably fender you. Who would Edward says our hand good call back good good terrible call back. That's all the time we have for this week. Thank you Tien Dayna Karen and thanks to Melissa Master Monica for calling in to talk about like ability and there will be more in story for you next week."
