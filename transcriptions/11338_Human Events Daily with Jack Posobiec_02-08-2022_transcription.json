    "text": " Well, I had an interesting day yesterday in the park with John Stewart. I'll break it down and tell you everything that happened off camera. Also, we're going to talk about Pelosi's trip to Taiwan, the Speaker of the House, heading there for another insider trading deal, the semiconductor swindle. Don't fall for the hype. Follow the hay. But before we do all that, I have to tell you guys, Charlie Kirk's new book, The College Scam, How America's Universities Are Bankrupting and Bring Washing Away, The Future of America's Youth is now out. Go to collegescam.com to access your copy and all proceeds from book sales. Go to Turning Point USA. Well, ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard for today's edition of human events daily powered by Turning Point USA. I'm here in Phoenix, Arizona. Cover everything that is happening. But the news does not stop today is to August 2022. Anno Domini today's headlines. Closo and John Stewart reach a truce in support of the PAC Act. I'll tell you that. Everything that happened, I'll tell you my side of the story. Next, Speaker Pelosi's trip to Taiwan, the semiconductor swindle. Third, suspecting Justice Kavanaugh assassination attempt identifies as a trans woman and then finally a new Hulu film, Not Okay, given a trigger warning for quote, unlikable female protagonist. All this and we're headed human events daily. How do you want to be? No, let it off. Listen, what the PAC? We already went there. He said no, he does not want to meet. All of these. He does not want to meet. Let's do it. No, no, no, no. Because we've been suffered for 15 years. I could hear a. Get them in the face. Look at them in the face. You're a troll. I want to build that. You're not in good faith. I'm for the bill. You're not in good faith. So what's the problem? My question is, what's your question? What's John do here? Why is John? I'm not even against you guys. What are you doing? This is Jack Vesobic. I'm here with Tim Jensen at Brunsnall and. Hello. John Stewart is also here. John Stewart and I have decided to come to agreement. Have we not? Yes, sir. I lost my temper a little bit. I felt like I was being trolled and I realized that the important thing is just got to get this done for these guys and get them over the finish line to get the health care they need. We're at 98%. Let's get it over the last 2%. Is that fair? Fair. Shake on it. It's over 5, brother. Do it. So I spent a day in the park yesterday with John Stewart. Now everybody saw this. The media saw this. Reheem Kasam from National Pulse came by. And as we were filming the show yesterday, I heard that John Stewart was doing an event. Just a few blocks away from where our studio in DC is last night. I flew out here to Phoenix, but I wanted to go down and see what was going on because when it came to this bill and I understood that there were differences between what the GOP was saying, what Stewart was saying, what the other side was saying. And I looked at the CBO scores and I said, well, the CBO scores do line up with what Senator and Senator Toomey are saying. Not that I'm a huge fan of Senator Toomey or anything like that, even though he is my Senator. But I said, look, it does seem to me that this 400 billion discrepancy, whether it's discretionary mandatory, that is in the bill. And that's what the hold up is. And then, you know, of course, they're arguing about should have been passed, did it pass, et cetera. Look, what I said to them off camera. So John and I go back to the beginning. So John Stewart and I get into it when he first sees me. And he's, I know who you are. You're that right wing guy. You're like a, you're like a troll. You're bad faith. And then I was just trying to talk to him. And I posted on Telegram the full 15 minute video of the interaction just from my side of it. No, no edits, anything raw footage. You can go watch that and see for yourself. And you'd be the judge. You can be the judge of who was acting good faith, bad faith. So he says, he doesn't want to talk to me. Then he brings it in front of the cameras. And I know what's going to happen in front of the cameras. And I said, you know what? I'm going to do my job. We'll go. So we go up and he's, he's very animated to say the least. And he's, you know, he's putting on performance for the cameras, doing a show, doing his thing. But, but after that all ended, I didn't leave. I stayed there. I talked to veterans. I talked to families. Importantly, I talked to Tim Jensen, the guy who runs a grunt squad. And in talking to him, that's when John Stewart came back up to me and we were able to have a civilized conversation, couple of guys trying to do the right thing. And I said to him, I said, John, this thing is 98% done. The bill's almost over the finish line. Why not instead of us just blowing each other up and then blowing everybody up on all the media, egging people on? Why don't we actually sit down, get both sides to come to the table, figure out the right budget, you know, budgetary accounting to be able to get the votes that this thing needs to get it across the finish line and do the right thing for veterans. Because at the end of the day, it doesn't matter who gets more retweets. It doesn't matter who's trending. It doesn't matter. All that stuff doesn't matter. I say that as somebody who I'm a veteran myself, I don't talk about it every day and I like to play the veteran card every day. I am a veteran. I have friends. When I got back from Guantanamo, I remember there was a girl in my unit who would just come back from Afghanistan. She was working with the burn pits. Her fingernails started falling out. Her toenails started falling out. Clumps of her hair was falling out. We didn't know what it was at first. She later found out it was the burn pits. I have another friend who years later developed lung problems. He has trouble going in airplanes. He has trouble going up to high altitudes. That's something that's never going to change the rest of his life. This bill should be passed and ought to be passed. The Senate's going to be the Senate. We can't change the Senate, but what we can do is bring people together. That's the last video we got. It was me saying to him, will you work with me? Left, right, whatever. Just do the right thing for the vets and the people who were injured by this. Conservatives have had an incredible run at the Supreme Court this year. So many recent wins and we have to mention they didn't happen on their own. It took the support of companies like Patriot Mobile who have passionately fought on behalf of the unborn and your constitutional rights. Patriot Mobile is America's only Christian conservative mobile phone provider and they have been on the front lines fighting for our values. That's why Patriot Mobile is different from every other provider out there. Inflation has made it really hard on many Americans. Thankfully, Patriot Mobile has plans for almost any budget and they offer the same great nationwide coverage as all the major carriers. So you get the same service plus the knowledge that your money is going to accompany fighting for the sanctity of life, religious freedom and the Second Amendment. Go to patreonmail.com.com. POSO and use promo code POSO for free activation. If you are a veteran or first responder, please let them know because they have special discounts just for you. So join the movement and make the switch today. patreonmail.com.com. POSO the link is in the description. We repeatedly said that we oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side. We have said that we do not support Taiwan independence and we have said that we expect cross-strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means. The semiconductor swindle continues. Inside traders, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and her husband who just got caught in an insider training deal for semiconductors which are manufactured where? Where is it? Where are the highest capacity, highest quality, most high-end semiconductors in the entire world manufactured? If you answer that question, you will understand what's going on with Speaker Pelosi's trip to Taiwan and why this is happening. All the military theater, the saber rattling, everything that you are seeing, it's Kabuki theater. I know Kabuki is Japanese but go with me on this. It's Kabuki theater because what is happening here is that this is a pump and dump scheme her and her husband. They got caught so they had to dump the stock before this all played out. But it was about subsidies to Nvidia. It was about subsidies for semiconductors that Chippsack that was just passed. That's what this is done. If you don't understand that this is about her and her husband and her crooked family selling out our country and selling out, by the way, the people of Taiwan and the people of China at the same time because of course they're deep in bed with the CCP and CCP tied companies on other deals, then you're not paying attention. And that's what we do here in human events daily. This is not one of those cable networks where we're just breathlessly reporting, ah, and the fighters are in the air and Pelosi, and she's on the tarmac, and she's here, and she's there, and we're paying attention to all that. But this is signal, not noise. You may know where. You may have picked that up from the war room. Signal, not noise. Follow the money. It's about the hay, not the hype. Speaker Pelosi and her family. They're deliberately exacerbating tensions in Taiwan over this. And you heard, by the way, there was a protest of some people who don't want her there in Taiwan. It's not beneficial for the people of Taiwan for her to be doing this. It does them no good. Taiwan's an island, by the way. I don't know if anyone actually noticed that. It's on a map. I served in the Navy. I've actually gone through the Taiwan Strait on a U.S. Navy ship. But here's the deal. It's right next to China. It's right there. And so if you start exacerbating tensions, if you start going there and making noise and making trouble, what do you think the CCP is going to do? What do you think the People's Liberation Army is going to do? Now, I've said for a long time that I think that if any action were to be taken against Taiwan, it would be a military blockade, that it would essentially take the form of a blockade than an embargo, rather than try to bomb Taiwan and blow it up and set the entire island on fire, which of course they could do. They have all the material. They have all the missiles, et cetera. What's more likely, though, is that they would go for a blockade scenario because they want Taiwan to be assimilated into mainland China. Now that being said, Taiwan, once mainland China assimilated into Taiwan, you have to understand the history here that the Republic of China, which is the government of Taiwan, is the former government of all of China. They were the government that the CCP kicked out and then they fled to Taiwan. This is the remainder of the Communist Revolution, the Chinese Civil War, which ended in 1949, October 1st. So once you understand that, that that's where they're pushing. Now, from a realistic standpoint, do we think that the Republic of China has the ability to take down the CCP and take over all of them right now? Well, maybe not by themselves. But if you look at what's happening internally in China right now, if you look at the banking crisis, the Evergrande crisis that we've been talking about here for months, the fact that they've got to run on the banks. They've got all of these companies failing at the same time. They're using this for show as well. Why? Because they don't want to allow by Zhing. They don't want the people of China to be, to wake up and be wise to the fact that they're stealing all of their money, all of their labor, their slave labor that the CCP is using and put into their coffers, this ECP, of course, being the 1% of being land China. And now you can't even get your money back because everything's falling apart, because of the slowdown, because of zero-covid lockdowns and all this craziness. That's what's going on. Signal not noise. Is there anything that the president is doing to cool passions before the DAFs decision drops? You mean as it relates to the decision? So I wanted to be really clear. The Department of Justice, as it relates to Kavanaugh, has U.S. Marshals providing support to the Supreme Court Marshall and the president supports legislation to fund increased security for court and judges. And it has now been reported that the Marshals, our administration, assigned to help protect judges were instrumental in the person not accomplishing the horrible deed he set out to do. This is the threat that we saw against Kavanaugh. And so we have taken this very seriously. Like you said, we have condemned it. The president has, and we will continue to do so. Any intimidation or threats against judges is something that we take very seriously. Nicholas John Rosky. Nicholas John Rosky. Nicholas John Rosky. How many times have I told you to remember the name Nicholas John Rosky? There's a reason for that because the media doesn't want to talk about this name. The media doesn't want to bring this up, but that's okay because that gives us something to do. Well, Andy No over at the post-millennial is digging through the court records in Nicholas John Rosky, who is the accused suspect that was arrested. By the way, who turned himself in outside Justice Kavanaugh's house where he was planning to kill him with a Glock nine millimeter. He had zip ties in his backpack. He had duct tape. We don't even know to this point. We don't even know to this extent. Maybe we will. Hopefully we'll learn more in court what he planned to do to the Kavanaugh family. But the last time we checked in on Dear Nicholas Rosky, Dear Nicholas, we found out that we found out that he was a Redditor. And we were very much not surprised that a crazy Redditor was trying to kill the Supreme Court justice. The guy was actually Googling things like, if you remember, how to be stealthy, assassin skills and what is best place to stab a guy? Really, really high levels of research. He didn't even take time to study the blade. You know, you could at least study the blade, Nicholas. But no, no, you went for the gun like a coward. It's like, come on, man, do you even watch any anime? But apparently, apparently Nicholas Rosky was not his only name. He also went by Sophie on Reddit and is identified as MTF or male to female. In post he made under the username American Nick, Rosky introduced himself on Reddit with the feminine name Sophie and talked about gaming, watching television and requesting a female partner quote for cuddles. Discord messages between Rosky and another identified person who also revealed me after David uncovering his original plan to shoot shoot three justices to quote change the vote for for years to come. But what Andy has done here over on the court records is actually delved into this and we're getting more now because we've got the Reddit account. So let's go see what Nicholas John Rosky, AKA Sophie was asking about on Reddit and was more than just the cuddles apparently seeking a cuddle movie buddy. MTF college graduate looking for a woman to cuddle and watch movies with me preferably within five years of me, both younger and cooler. They're very few men I have comfortable with even platonic. So that is why I'm specifying I have an alt style working on developing it. Maybe you can help 420 friendly love deep conversations geeky slash introverted. I love movies and I'm sure we'll find something we both like wow just so unique someone who loves movies. I've never never met anybody. I've never met anybody who doesn't like movies by the way as a matter of fact if you ever ever actually met someone who's like movies long and you have to pay attention and those things suck. Actually that's not sure I actually do know somebody like that. And apparently he also played Valheim and Overwatch. So look here's the thing. This isn't about gamers this is about Redditors. Okay it's about Redditors. This is about the fact for me again I'm going to say this. Where was the FBI? Where were the Reddit moderators? Where was anybody actually looking into these posts? We're told that all of the posts and the censorship and everything is there to protect this. Well you didn't protect Supreme Court justice Kavanaugh and you certainly didn't protect his family and you certainly didn't protect anybody from this guy who was planning an attack on three justices and the only reason it stopped is because he called his sister and then he called in 9-1-1 and he turned himself in. I think that we should just straight up start cutting the funding, disband the FBI because it seems like all they do is conspire against the American people. This film contains an unlikeable female protagonist viewer discretion advised. Have you ever wanted to be noticed so badly? You didn't even care what it was for? Danny Sanders might actually be the worst person we've ever covered on the show acting like she was the victim. It turned a lot of people off to her. I was just gonna bleach the front bits but I'm really not trying to get mistaken for Danny Sanders. This is so f**ked up isn't it Kevin? White women. So the post-millennial's newest journalist Christina Buttons, go give her a follow, check other singing out post-millennial and Christina Buttons has written us a new story and what's the story it says, unlikeable female protagonist. Unlikeable female protagonist. This is a new warning label slapped on a film about white women after test screenings. And this is amazing because the direct, I thought this was just marketing. I thought this was like an in-story, in-plot reference or something. Somebody sent me the screenshot and I said, oh, that's, well, that's, I'm sure that's just like a joke. Like this, you know, it's a hundred percent true. And I'm looking at director Quinn Shepard's comment here and he said, if you portray flawed women or women who reflect societal flaws, you get notes like, I literally don't understand why you tell a story about this character. And so many viewers of this watching it on Hulu, Hulu, Chinese word Hulu means gored, by the way, we're asking why is this hat? Why is this being added? Why is this being added as a microaggression, as a trigger warning? And here's the thing. According to the regime propaganda standard guide, you are not allowed to portray women in film, television, or anything accurately. You're not allowed to portray them as people. All female characters must be a Mary Sue. Now, if you don't understand what a Mary Sue is, a Mary Sue is kind of like, kind of like a character who's just basically Ray Skywalker from the new Skywalk, the news of Disney Star Wars movies. And it's a horrible, you know, affronts to God and man. And in those films, she just has all the powers of Luke Skywalker can do everything, can defeat everybody, barely has to struggle for anything. Don't even really know who she is. We get a little bit of backstory at the very end where they just make up some stuff and tag on that she's the granddaughter of the emperor and all this and whatever, right? The idea is, is that it's a character who has no flaws and a character who can accomplish anything through the sheer might of girl power. That's the only way that women are allowed to be portrayed. And yet, if you notice, a lot of stuff, a lot of content has been coming out lately, like when you watch Woman in the Window, right? It's the unstable or the unreliable narrator. If you watch a movie like the new documentary that came out about Theranos, right, and Elizabeth Holmes. And you point out that actually it turns out crazy enough. I know this might be, I know, and this might be hard for people here. So here's my trigger warning on this. It's going to be a little truthful here. Turns out women are people too. And that means people in their totality, the good, the bad, the beautiful, the ugly, all of that. And believe me, when we're talking about the pro-abortion ones, there's a lot of ugly. But the idea is that we're actually going to show people accurately rather than show something that is a complete regime propaganda insanity. That's why they have to put trigger warnings like this anymore. That's, it's the same reason, by the way, that we can't openly talk about monkeypox, how it spread, and who are the ones most affected by it. And that's all the time we have here at CUNED Events Daily. Remember, as always, our promise, our oath, our solemn vow to you be good, be brief, be gone. Your homework for us, share this out with one just one of your away friends, and then leave us your five star review, Apple Spotify, wherever you get your podcasts. What did we talk about today? Myself and John Stewart, reaching a truce in support of the pack act, veterans, and the victims of the burn pits. Next, speaker Pelosi's trip to Taiwan, the semi-conductor, swindle, wag the Pelosi. Third, the suspect injustice Kavanaugh's assassination attempt identifies as a trans woman, and finally, the Hulu film Not Okay, given a trigger warning for unlikable female protagonist. A lot of stuff going on right now. I am here at the Turning Point headquarters. I've come out to report on everything that's going on. I'll be out there tonight. I'll be live. Charlie Kirk is doing an election night special, so I'm going to be on that breaking down all the analysis of everything that's happening. So make sure that you watch it. But before all that happens, we have to talk about today's history break. This is an important one. And as Navy officer, Navy veteran, this is something that's close to me. On this day, all the way back in 1945, the surviving crew of the USS Indianapolis were spotted by a US naval aviator. What was the USS Indianapolis? This was the ship that secretly on a covert mission delivered the first of two nuclear weapons to the US Air Force to be able to be dropped on the cities in in Japan. On the way back, that ship was hit by a Japanese submarine. It sunk 300 sailors were killed, but 900 sailors made it into the water. But because it was a covert operation, nobody knew where it was. 600 people died in that water. The sharks got them. Three and a half days. Remember our history. Ladies and gentlemen, as always, you have my permission to lay ashore."
