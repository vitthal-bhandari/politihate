This week's guest is Michael Arsenault. He's the author of I Can't Date Jesus, Love, Sex, Family, Race, and Other Reasons I Put My Faith in Beyonce. And this book is now a bestseller and it is hilarious. It is a lot about pop culture, a lot about Beyonce, a lot about his personal journey as a queer black man from Houston. And he may not seem like an obvious choice to be a guest on this show, although he has written about politics too. But as he and I discuss, you know, everything he mentions in that title has a political aspect to it. Jesus, Love, Sex, Family, Race, and Yes, Even Beyonce. Michael Arsenault, Coming Right Up. I'd like to welcome to the show the New York Times best-selling author Michael Arsenault. He is a Houston-bred Howard University educated writer, currently living in Harlem. Michael, welcome to the show. Thank you so much for having me. It's such an honor. I am thrilled to have you. Your book is hilarious. I think it will be a great follow-up to anyone who has read the book by last week's New York Times best-selling author Rick Wilson. You are a great counterpoint. Yes, I feel like I'm on Morning Joe. You should be on Morning Joe. If you were on Morning Joe, I would totally tune in. Not that I don't already watch. And it's called, the book is called I Can't Date Jesus, Love, Sex, Family, Race, and Other Reasons I've Put My Faith in Beyonce. I almost want to tell people before you do the excerpt that we've decided on, the book isn't extraordinarily political, but I really liked this one section because I think it actually speaks to the ways that the book is political, which is that it's about your life. I really appreciate you saying that because it's been hard. It was hard to sell this book. I think it's hard to sell this book because I've decided on how some particular wanted me to be overtly political because I do political writing, but I wanted my life to be a political statement in and of itself. So, actually, thank you for validating my position. I firmly believe that all of our lives are political, but I actually have some more questions about that particular intersection for you, but let's get on to the actual excerpt because I want people to hear why this is a New York Times bestseller. reference for anyone that is hashtag team menage. I don't care about white people like that. That's not to say I carry with me some pointed, irrational hostility towards white people. Granted, when I find instances of white folks engaging in some sort of racist stunt, I will look at black folks and other non-whites, let out an audible sigh, and maybe voice a comment such as white people. But no, I do not specifically abhor white people. I spread my hatred evenly the way God intended. I didn't fixate on white people in whiteness because it was well established that as a collective, they found no value in me. Nevertheless, I knew black people were of value. Despite not growing up wealthy, and despite being effectively segregated by way of that status, my mother made it clear that black people were not deficient. She took me to black doctors and dentists as a child, although she couldn't afford it. She did want to place me and my brother in a private school. It was the Ammani school, a private Christian school run by the Windsor Village Methodist Church, a hugely popular and predominantly black church. She was at about Catholic, but she still wanted us to be at a Christian private school run by black people. Yes, my mom told me about racism, not that it was hard to figure out as an early news junkie, but while it was made clear that I might face certain obstacles, I could overcome them because I'd already seen a wide variety of all the things black folks could achieve on their own. In hindsight, my mom was preparing me for the times when I would be around white people, and whiteness made certain that I would enter those spaces with a sense of pride. I've learned over time that success in this world has a lot to do with one's proximity to whiteness. People overall value mainstream publications more than they do black media. Part of that is rooted in folks knowing how difficult it is to be able to have your voice in mainstream outlets. Still, I want to be a success, and that entails placing myself in spaces different from those I'm accustomed to. The struggle with that though, is that I often am asked to lead with my otherness. I don't want to walk into a space pronouncing to be black or gay. I happen to be black, and I happen to be gay. These things inform my perspective, but I don't believe either requires a great announcement. Still, when you are one of a few, you're typically asked to speak from those places. Unfortunately, even when we are asked to write about ourselves, we are often asked to do so within even more rigid prisms. For instance, black out-outs and newer mainstream outlets run by younger editors will pretty much let me talk about whatever I want, however I want. Well, minus the one time a black male editor, younger than I, was warned me about using terms that phrase that he felt were too quote unquote, end group. Translation, stop sounding so black. He cared more about whiteness than I ever will, and I never wrote for him again, problem solved. In any event, with more traditional outlets, whenever commissioned to write about subject matter that's more personal, I was earned over time that the more path those is involved, the better it will be received. You know, because it's so hard to be po black me. Here are the topics mainstream outlets love for me to write about from the perspective of a gay black man, black homophobia, AIDS, and sexual racism. I don't mind confronting black homophobia and transphobia, but it's always been twofold for me. I will condemn any mythology that suggests black folks are more magically anti-gay or anti-trans than white people. As if black folks came over on a cruise ship clutching their Bibles while saying they couldn't wait to pick cotton and keep blue lavandros on the closet while also calling out black folks for trying to borrow white folks as a presser baton and use it on issues related to sexuality and gender. As for the AIDS, well, yeah, I get it, and I try to confront the harsh realities of an epidemic that lingers on and on. With respect to sexual racism, I tend to cringe and roll my eyes so fervently that I'm always surprised that at least one of my eyeballs doesn't roll out of its socket to escape the abuse. The reason why I roll my eyes is that I'm supposed to take Umbridge at the fact that I do not meet the sexual fantasies of a white man. Why? Because white men are the end all be all, don't you know? How could I not be so offended to the point that I must address the matter over and over and over again? Then place the topic in my back pocket and pull it back out on command. Hashtag all white dicks matter or whatever. So the reason why I wanted you to read that passage, I should say in some ways it's not representative because you know there's no Beyonce. Right. And she's all over the book in the best way possible. Beyonce, Janet Jackson, Nicki Minaj, all of the greats. But I think the reason I liked it so much is it speaks to a lot of who you are. And like you just said, part of it is also, it gets to those sort of the implicit political nature of just being a queer black man in the world today. Yes. And when I wrote that, it came from like this really a big place of frustration because while I'm very proud of the book and I'm really happy that it is reaching all types of people, there was a really big hesitance on anyone really wanting to take the chance because I didn't want to write about myself in the way that typically otherness is consumed, particularly as a queer black man. People expected me to write about white men not wanting to fuck me and I'm supposed to be so mad about that. But people wanted me to present my childhood which is indeed chaotic in this very specific way. Like you really want, it's like pathology porn. Like if I had wanted to do that book, it would have sold much sooner, would have got way more money upfront. But I think I would have hated myself because I feel like I would have been perpetuating an image of queer black men that I think needs to be changed. I think it's important to write about pathology. I think it's important to talk about sexual racism, but there is this expectation that I am supposed to care so much about what white people think of me and I don't and I will never cower to that, like go that position that I'm supposed to care that much because frankly that's just not how I'm moving. That's not as I just read, how I was raised to think. You know, it's funny, one of the parts of the book that I personally identified with was actually that idea of turning one's own personal history into a kind of pornography. Right. You write about, you referred to yourself as an essay hustler? Yes. I think that's an explanation of a free answer. And I assume you mean hustler in the sort of classic sense. Yes, I really regret not being a rapper or like being an escort in college but like some well-off Republican Senator Alabias. I should have done a thing. Oh, because then you went up here with your student loans, which are actually sort of part of being an essay hustler, right? Yes. Go, I'm sorry. No, go ahead. I mentioned in the book How and I kind of want to explore this more broadly like the next book How. You know, a lot of my decisions, particularly professionally, were kind of based on the fact that I had this significant amount of debt that was set up in a really bad way, never take a private loan. And so there were, I mean, first of all, I graduated when media was crumbling because of digital and then it was a great recession. So there weren't a lot of jobs to begin with and then in media, everything was like, the sky was falling. So all these people that were making this obscene amount of money were like out of a job. So I barely could do anything. So I still wanted to believe in the dream, but even when things got better, certain jobs I didn't take because frankly they just didn't pay enough for me to pay off the loan. So I constantly have to be trying to make money to pay them off. So I won't default. So I won't mess up my mom's credit. So I won't ruin things for other people. So I won't destroy my credit. It's, yes, again, I wish I were a rapper. Which would be a different way of turning pathology pornography perhaps, but this is a much more kind of abject way of doing it. And I won't pretend that I have the same kinds of structural issues that someone coming from your background does. But I very much see played out over and over again this problem where if you want to be in media, if you want to be a writer and you're someone who's not a straight white guy, what you get paid the most to do is to be pitiful. Yes. And in that same chapter, like I kind of have a very specific example. And unusually I'm Southern and shady, but I do mean with all due respect to the editor that I wrote about. It was just interesting being lectured by someone who did not know my experience and actually had the nerve to say that I was perpetuating stereotypes where actually owning the parts of my culture that are you like distinctly me, Southern Black country, like very Houston, Louisiana. But she didn't have any problem with messing up the headlines to say that I've never dated Black men. Like there's an entire subgenre of queer Black men, particularly in the last five years who write again and again and again about white men not wanting to have sex with them repeatedly. It is. And that's what they want of us because then that's in their minds intersectionality that you're technically including Black people in a conversation, but solely within the context of being a sexual object. Right. Right, right. Yeah, my life would be actually better if I had leaned into that, but again, I would be miserable. And yeah, go ahead, sorry. No, it's just one of the ways that like women and people of color are tasked with doing the emotional work for like a whole culture. Yes. And that don't get compensated for it, right? Not well, I mean, you can be rewarded for it, but at what cost? Yeah, that's actually the good point is like, you do this emotional labor and you may, you're rewarded materially, but even then not that much. But it's also at the cost of like just enacting the stereotypes that you're trying to get rid of. Yeah. Or at least giving more. I want to be sympathetic to those people, but you know. Okay, you're right. I'm being harsh too. I shouldn't be. Cause some of that writing is really great too, right? I agree. I wouldn't say harsh. I guess what, I want to be fair when I say this. I think for a lot of people that is genuinely their experience, but I also think most people can't afford the sacrifices to be in media, no matter your race or ethnicity. I will say even fewer black people or non white people can't afford those sacrifices. And of the very few black people that are in media, collectively, many of them come from a middle class, upper middle class background. To a right, I think well, I usually poke at front of the ideas that the middle class actually exists. At least someone that is not lower in poverty or like one check away. That is actually a very much a privilege, particularly if you are black in this country. So a lot of those people have at least come to fund over the time and I've been doing this for about a decade. They come from nice families. Their families had them in the mixed schools. And so in a lot of cases, they might have been the only black person there. So I understand for them why they carry that burden, but I also think there should be room for other experiences from black people and other marginalized voices that are not that narrative. Like I'm not pretending that I invented anything. It's very much a coming of age story, but I will say my perspective, I've never heard in this medium and talking about it in this way. And it shouldn't be that difficult for people like me to get in these spaces. Because even while, you know, it's great to be a New York Times best-selling author, you know, I'm not over the humps yet. And if not for people being supportive, if not for just kind of being aggressively like writing, I could be on my mom's couch as a New York Times best-selling author. It's like the systems here are not really built for folks like me. So it's just very challenging. So yeah, it's part of it is like those are people's experiences but the fact that those are all people that can really be in these positions to tell their story. It says a lot and I think most, like a lot of these editors, they don't think about it because they don't have to. Yeah, I guess the thing I'm trying to point out, and I think I was personally, you can, we can talk about whether there's too harsh or not. I just think it's fascinating to point out these two kind of systems that are working to create a very specific view of otherness in media, right? Like that even well-meaning white folks might not understand has been shaped for them. Yeah. And like the structural force of, you know, the turning your grief or your trauma into some kind of pornography and the structure of what kinds of people of color make it in media. Which as you point out, at least the experience that you're talking about is that it tends to be black people who kind of know how to talk to white people, it seems like. Yes, and that's a skill set that again, it's an exposure to white people. You learn over time in school. Like I didn't necessarily really have it per se. I just think, thankfully my mom just kind of raised me in a particular way. So, and kind of just being inquisitive, being smart and kind of consuming media a lot. It maybe taught me how to have those interactions and thankfully my mom, as I write, kind of instilled this sense of pride. So I didn't enter those situations thinking I was less than, but yeah, even that is a skill set like a lot of people don't have. And then, you know, a lot of journals I know who exist primarily in black media, who I don't think will ever kind of translate over because they don't know how to talk to white people or they don't really still have the access to get pulled in. And then a lot, in a lot of cases, even me, some of these mainstream outlets that I've written for, it's been because of black people who might be the one or two in those spaces who can pull me in. You just remind me of a point in my life where I had my whiteness very much shoved in my face in a good way. When I was talking to someone from Philadelphia, this is a couple years ago, about a youth program that he ran as a black person. And he was talking about how what he was doing was getting these young people jobs and offices over the summer. And I think I made some kind of joke about running copiers, right? Like the kind, the thing that you might, if you're a white person, you might start to typically imagine interns doing that's just got work or whatever. And the guy was like, well, these people, otherwise, they're not gonna see an office. Like, they don't, the kind of office culture, and he kind of explained to me, is like the office culture that white people take for granted, is just like you kind of grow up knowing how to operate around an office. That's a privilege. That is, and actually I hadn't thought of it literally since high school, but there was a program in my high school where I actually ended up working at a black law firm that used to represent Destiny's child, or at least two of them at Zubian, it's a tough on the side. But that actually taught me office culture, and if not for that co-op program, I don't think I would have learned it until I actually interned at Seatsman. So I wouldn't have had any real preparation. I hadn't thought of that until you just said it, but yeah, that's a good point about office culture.

You know, I want to let people know that one of the reasons that your book is a New York Times bestseller is, although the stuff about whiteness is the part that I find really fascinating. And I could talk to you about it forever. But whoa, there's a lot of sex too. Yes. Yes, there is a lot of sex. I'm talking about learning how to hold without the fear of God, but more seriously, it is about forging your identity through a real expression of sexuality and actually learning to enjoy pleasure because I call myself a recovering Catholic, no shade to practicing Catholics, but I think some of you will get it. And I had a really exposure to aid, so I just was very paranoid about sex for a really, really long time. And I am not denigrating at all the idea that's about sex. I think sex is pretty important. Yes. And I think that it's also political. And in a way, right? And you talk about in the book, after having this early exposure to AIDS being fatal, your uncle dying, you reach a point where you couldn't deny your, I'm quoting you to you now. I couldn't deny myself pleasure anymore. And I know specifically you're talking right there about sex, but I also know that you've said that this book is about unlearning every damaging thing I've seen and heard about my identity. And I think that pleasure is a really important part of taking back identity. I agree. And in a lot of ways, you know, queer people are more visible. In media overall, I mean, there are still many, many problems. But even particularly with the idea of two queer men being sexual on camera, that you still don't really see a lot of that. I mean, you still had a little bit on how to get away with murder, I believe. Like it was one very graphic scene, which was actually really bold. So I was saluting him, but I know that show was run by a gay man. So that makes sense, created by, excuse me. But even when looking like one on HBO, one of the criticisms, I mean, I thought the show was like perfectly fine. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't like a lot of sex. I mean, there was, there were moments there, but, and actually one criticism I got in some reviews, someone tagged me on on Twitter, was saying that the, the graphicness of my book or talking about sex would turn some readers off. Because I think a lot of times you still see, this is childish to say, but like they make it seem like it's icky, like two queer men actually being sex. Whereas you can still see queer women, or at least what are, what is defined as a track to women. They can be sexual on camera, but that's also still appeasing like a male, a straight male's like sexual appetite. Like whereas you don't, I'm not gonna get them off. So they're not gonna see people like me doing that. And I still think that's so interesting. Like you, they're not really many spaces for us to like, talk about sex again, but I'm not necessarily talking about AIDS, or necessarily being completely pornographic. I mean, I'm a bad thought as I mentioned in the book, but there's like a romanticism too. Some of the sex that you could tell that I'm like a, I wanna be like in love before I can bang it out. Am I being too graphic? Let me know. Oh, no, no, you can also curse if you want. Okay. You just said that, you know, filmmakers or creators wouldn't show people like you having sex because you don't do it for them. I think maybe one reason they don't do it is they're worried that you might. That's actually very true. Yeah, that's, you know, well they need to come home and let me be me. More people like me be on a camera, but I'm working on that too. So we'll see. I think it's Crooked Media's own Iron Madison that said, I think on this show, is something about how the dearth of same sex relationships and same sex sex, sex, sex, actual sex in movies and popular culture is when you think about it, actually really offensive in a way. It is. That it's treated so gingerly, you know? And I think he said something, I'm not gonna not say it as hilariously as he did, but something along the lines of like, what does it feel like for me to just have to watch straight people make out? Don't you think of my feelings? I was a cackle, I agree. Also, and there's actually not a lot of displays of like two black men or two Latinx men or like two Asian queer men like actually depicted together. You still don't even see that. A lot of times it's just literally like a black and white guy. I mentioned the book, it's changed a little bit, but initially in Harlem, when I first moved here, there were all of these prep ads, but none of them were with two black men. And don't get me wrong, like I write about Ryan Phillipi, that man is fun. He helped me realize I was gay. I will forever love him and his ass. He's still fun to me. I get it. However, if I'm in Harlem, I should not only see ads with like two white guys or like a white guy and a black guy. Like I should be able to see two black men, two Latinx men, I should be representative of the community. I understand the things are changing, but I should be able to see that, particularly in that area where like the HIV AIDS crisis is still so bad and poor, black and brown community is specifically, they don't reach out to us. So if you're trying to reach out to us, then you need to show us in all forms. I love miscegenation. It gave me Mariah Carey and Barack Obama. I get it, but we also need to see everything. There's a lot of frustrations, but yes, I just wouldn't elaborate on Ira's point. So you've covered, there's an interesting kind of politics in the book. There's a lot of hilarity in the book. There's a lot of sex in the book. And before we leave sex, I will say that I found my comfort level pushed. When you talked about how early on you realized you were gay, that the experience of childhood sexuality, of experiencing and expressing your sexuality as a child. You know what made me comfortable about finally saying that out loud because I kind of have worried if something was innately wrong with me? It was a Janet Jackson interview in the 1993 Rolling Stone, which I quote, but she just talked about being a late bloomer how she had these sexual feelings, even as a child. Granted, they were for Barry Manolo, different strokes. But when I read that, even as a kid, and then I just kind of, because again, I love Janet Jackson, so she's my first Beyonce, but well, that was nothing before Beyonce, but you get it. Yes. When I go back and read it, I got older. She's a prophet who prepared you. She's the prophet who prepared the way for Beyonce. Yes, yes, yes, yes, I love that. She mentioned that and I felt like heard, and she, even in that more recent interview in style, she said she didn't really feel sexual until her 30s. When she talked about it as a child, I felt like, oh my gosh, this is fun. I just, I don't remember ever not knowing about sex in terms of procreation, but I did have these feelings as a kid, and I used to think they were disturbing, and then when Janet read that, and as an adult when I was writing the book, I was like, do I wanna really put that in the book do I wanna own that, I thought? Yes, be more like Janet Jackson, so. Yeah, but that's interesting that it made you put your comfort zone, because with the recent death of Jimell Miles, I might be saying his name wrong, but the non-year old boy who knew he was gay, and he ended up committing suicide, I know a lot of people that knew early on that they liked, or that they were queer, but there's this weirdness about it. Yeah, I think the way our culture is currently situated, and maybe I should just talk about white culture since that I realize there's difference there, I feel like even us woke white people while we totally can get down with the idea that a child might experience themselves as trans, or might identify as gay, or lesbian, or whatever, the idea that that might be something connected to pleasure is hard. Yeah. You know, that idea that it might actually be something that has to do with the naughty bits? Right. You know, like ew, I think people, it kind of makes people feel squeamish, although that's exactly, of course it has to do with that. Yeah, that's uncomfortable in this with queer people kind of expressing it, because I mean, when I talk to my straight friends, they all play doctor, they all have these little crushes and urges, it wasn't, I mean, that's the same thing, but it's, and I'm not assigning that to you, but I think collectively they're still like that oddness, and I think that comes from the fact that you still don't really see us be like y'all all around. And so not having that kind of, excuse them on a bit. I think you're right, I think until we see, you know, same sex couples represented with the same kind of frankness that I always want to say opposite sex. Yeah. Whatever non-same sex couples are visible, I think it's probably gonna be that same, there's always squeamishness around childhood sexuality period, but even then like hippie-dippy types like myself, like who want to not have be squeamish, I think can find it, and probably just, you know, we will, until again, like you said, like that's why one of the reasons that we don't think about a lot, but one of the reasons why representation is important. I appreciate you asking me actually, because I feel like other people that I've talked about the book one or two or tiptoe it around it, but no one flat out acts about that. You didn't put it as me being a thought, like my friends do as a kid, but no, I actually appreciate you asking me, because I wanted to be particular, I felt I could tell they were uncomfortable, and they wanted to act, but then it's kind of skipped to something else. We went back to Jesus. I was like, all right, amen, and we're gonna go do that. But thank you, I actually appreciate you asking me. You know, we're gonna have to get to Jesus, and I think that Jesus is one of the reasons why people thought I should interview you, like you were recommended in addition to us connecting on Twitter. But there's so much more. There's so much more talk about that. I can't remember a lot in this book. And again, not just about sex. Maybe the segue here is actually between sort of sex and Jesus is your mom. Yes, mom. That sounded bad. No, it's perfectly fine. That actually explains her discomfort with the book, and me talking about it. So yes, it's a perfect segue. Well, I'm always fascinated by stories of how people kind of come to believe what they do and how they decide who they are. And I'm especially interested in cases like yours, where the person you've become wouldn't necessarily have been, it's not a straight line from how you were raised. No, it's true. If I didn't mean to put the pun there, but you know what I mean. It's a big detour. As she continues to remind me. Not straight, if you know, it's not straight, if you will. Yes. You were raised by parents who were pretty explicit in their intolerance of homosexuality. Yes. But you also give your mom a lot of credit for helping you become who you are today. A proud outspoken out, you know, hilarious person. Thank you. So, yeah, explain that. What's so interesting, I'm so much like my mom, but I think I'm my mom without inhibitions. And I say this with all the respect in the world because my parents are, they passed on. But I think I am in a lot of ways what if my mom hadn't been broken by her parents, who didn't necessarily intend to do that, but did. And I think if I had listened to my mom, the way she listened to her parents, I'd be a totally different person and I'd be incredibly unhappy. And to be blunt, I actually don't know how life might have gone. Because on the other side of my family, there are the many of the arsenal men have gone down difficult paths in turn to vices and things to kind of help them deal with certain stuff. And I know for a fact how easy that is because one thing I actually tried to do with my father as well was to be really fair to both of them, particularly about why my dad is the way that he is and why he's grappled with alcohol and the like. But my mom, it's still a dicey subject because I revere, I love my mom so much. She's the strongest person I know. I have such a profound respect for the role that faith has played in her life and continues to play. And I know in my heart of hearts, she thinks that she's saving my soul and she's loving me the best way that she can. And one thing that I kind of noticed in a lot of the narratives, particularly from queer people that usually kind of only get pushed out or like a wide range of acceptance or like a full acceptance and not really kind of dealing with that difficult middle, that weird greatness. And I didn't want to pretend that there would be any real resolution because frankly, I don't know. Like when I went home from the book tour, my mom did not go to the event. My aunt didn't remind me that my mom, even if she was completely supportive, she probably went anyway because she kind of chilled at home. But I went over the house and she didn't want to talk about it, but I knew I had to say something. And she just, it was literally like living out the chapter in real time. It was kind of like the stage play version of the chapter. I think, and I really, that's still a sense of subject. I just kind of wish she understood my position on faith better, but I also realized that if she were to challenge that aspect of her religion and assessing me, then she would then start to end up probably potentially questioning everything else. And for a lot of people, if you don't have your interpretation of faith, if you don't have like the faith as you know it, that's carried you to most of your life, then what do you have? So I think it's safe for her to stay in that space rather than really kind of check it the way I did. But yeah, I don't know. We'll see when, if I, when I get a boyfriend and want to bring him up, I'll update you. What was the any specific question in my phone? No, I, that was really fascinating, especially something I kind of keyed into what you're saying was you feel like you are the person your mom could have been if she hadn't listened to her parents. And I wonder if what you might be alluding to there is that the strength that you got from her and the confidence and the intelligence and the analytical nature and the curiosity, that was the stuff that you saw her doing. Yeah. Who she was, not what she said to you. Right. You know, and then, um, and even with, I will say, my mom has accomplished a whole lot. And what kind of what I mean by that is that I, I, she had even greater ambitions and they kind of were pushed out and then she had to get married and she had all these children and she was in the situation. So while, you know, I'm grateful to be, I'm obviously happy to be alive. I do wonder like, what have my mom been like if she hadn't been, I'm going to say burden, but if she hadn't had the kids or if she financially could have divorced my dad, what would her life look like? What if she kind of kind of, you know, I love my grandmother, but what if she did not listen to her about certain things that she said to herself? You know, my mom didn't, when it came down to it, you know, we didn't have the money for me to go out of state, but I was determined to do it anyway. And she helped. Um, I, you know, I know her heart of hearts. She kind of wishes I had become a corporate lawyer. Was Greek, fell into a vagina, had a bunch of children, got married, go to church, you know, because, you know, I'm one of the few that really got out of that, you know, the area and I chose to be a writer, which is not the most lucrative thing to do, at least not immediately. So, but she still has, you know, helped and however she could or just been encouraging. Even if she doesn't like what I'm doing, she's not discouraging. Um, now, I mean, she used to say some things, but she's always taking it back. She really has pushed me. I, yeah, I really wouldn't have got this book done without her. It's interesting that she won't read it, but I get it. Yes. She's never going to read it. Um, so we get a fair amount of email here having to do with fraught family relationships and kind of how to navigate them. And some of them have to do with parents wanting to do the right thing for their kids and raise their kids in wokeness. Right. Um, and I wonder if your story about your mom just really speaks to how important it is to live your values rather than to try and teach your children with words what to do. Cause it sounds like, is it? Is it? Cause it sort of sounds to me like what your mom told you explicitly was gayness is bad. You know, you might go to hell. Um, you're different, all those other things. But what she showed you on a day to day level with support and love. Right. Um, and I will, um, cause I actually haven't mentioned it cause it hadn't come, but I will say we had a, during the conversation about the book that I ended up bringing up, she did say, you know, it's not just that you're gay, you know, gay, like they're other relatives that are gay, um, I'm a place to out them, but they're gay, gay, gay people all around. It's just, it's like, it's, it's, it's, it's that weirdness. Like that's sometimes when I talk to religious people, particularly of a certain type, it's, it's the same thing. It's, it's very capsic actually. It's like, yeah, you're gay. It's not that big of a deal, but, and then she repeats something that actually shows that it is still a big deal to you. Um, but one thing about my mom that I do appreciate and everything about her, she's a true believer. Um, so I really do have a lot of respect there. A lot of people who pretend to be about like, fake, like I could, I could have certain criticism about, you know, certain things. And I'm sure she would have plenty for me. But overall, my mom really practices what she preaches. And to your point, she really does show me as much as she showed me more than she told me. Um, but again, I think with religion, there's a little hole there, but she's never going to let me kind of pull it out more of her because she just, she needs to believe what she believes because that keeps her where she's at. And as, as it's kind of, I don't say it selfish, but my mom has been through so much. But so if the face keeps her where she is and keeps her going, then I have to kind of just let her rock and she already told me I care too much about what she thinks anyway. And I love that she told you that I do too. Um, and it, and I also should say like it's not that it's not important what you say to your kids, obviously, one should be kind in all of that, but I just think it's really interesting. Like how much she gave you through her actions and through the way that she lived. Like that that's her, her legacy to you. Like she's one of the reasons why you're, why you're so outspoken, right? She's one of the reasons why you, why you have the strength that you do. She is. Um, it's such a, I can't wait to work this out with my personal faith for the train, but yes, she is. Um, and you know, my, my dad is interesting too, but it is a lot of my mom. Uh, I'm very much a mom was boy and I look just like her as a, that's, that is a lot of things. It's just, I'm just the very much the gay her. Yes. Um, and you know, I mentioned we get a lot of email because we solicited it, I should say, um, about family relationships and family dynamics. And reading in your book and, and noticing the grace with which you've kind of dealt with your, both your father and your mother and letting them have this gray area and, and not necessarily kumbaya, and it, and not necessarily you're dead to me, but just kind of letting the relationship be. I do think that narrative isn't really out there very much. And, and on this show in particular, I feel like we hear from a lot of, you know, well-meaning white people who just want to have a resolution about whatever it is in their lives. They want to know what to do about their racist uncle. Right. And I feel like maybe there's not an answer. That's, and thank you. Cause honestly that's, that, that's, I just honest, I don't think there's, there is going to be really much of an answer. It's always, it's going to be this awkwardness. Um, I think the plot twist is that I, and you mentioned the book, my dad actually has, probably has more progressive views about, uh, me being gay than she does, but, you know, sometimes you don't get the closure that you're seeking. You have to create your own. And, you know, I don't put on air that, you know, I would like to think that my mom will gradually change. Cause eventually, you know, I'm going to, you know, I, do you really have like a partner? What is that going to look like? Um, my, the rest of her family that I'm closest to, they're not going to walk away from me. If anything, they are decidedly, um, interested in me dating. Like it's her sister that I like inside. Are you seeing anybody? It's, it's code in New York. Don't get, I don't want you lonely. You're so handsome. Like you got to have somebody. So that's nice, but you know, with, um, yeah, that's the thing. A lot of people want closure. They want a resolution. They want you to tell them this is what you should do. Um, there's not one, there's not really one way to deal with this kind of thing. I think it literally is a case by case. If your uncle is racist, you might have to put your uncle in rice for a while, but in the situation of like this, where it's not a complete rejection, it's, you know, if I didn't think that the, if I didn't think that there was like still a really deep love and support there between my mom, then I frankly would have had to cut her off because I think ultimately that's which some of us have to do. Um, I would never want to get to that point. So this is where we are. Um, but yeah, I, and thank you for saying the grace thing. Cause one thing I wanted to do, I'll be honest, if the book had came out sooner when maybe our first was trying to shop it or something a while ago, it might have been more, it might have been angrier. I think it, everything happened the time it was supposed to, um, to God and beyond to be the glory, but I needed to heal and I needed to forgive them. And I also needed to kind of put myself more in their shoes and their positions and truly understand why they are the way that they are and how that impacted me and how I choose to kind of like move forward from that, however things go. Um, and I don't think, not, I don't, I don't want to assign anybody else's feelings to it. I would just say I'm really glad that everything happened on the way that it did because I think it, it made more sense to write my parents this way because a book is forever. So I'm really glad I had kind of reached a certain, as much pieces I could get, I'm glad I had reached that before I really kind of talked about them. Again, neither one of them will ever read it, but you know, my aunt's ever ate it. And they said I was respectful. Um, and so if I have the auntie coast, none of them okay. Um, we're going to have to wrap up, but I have to ask you one of the very first things I thought of to ask after I read the first chapter. You mentioned that you still pray. Yes. You're recovering Catholic. You're not an atheist. No, not an agnostic, but you definitely pray. When's the last time you prayed? Last night. Um, really? Yeah, I actually tend to pray every night before I go to sleep. I'm usually, I still get on my knees as I mentioned the book. Um, and that someone reminded me, because I actually talked to some young Catholics recently. Um, you know, the young if me, the jellicle, they, they liked this heathen, I guess because I'm nice about it, not mean about religion. Uh, for me, um, I will admit it's, it's a weird, like again, it's, I allow greatness. Um, I look around and I see the beauty of the world and I see the beauty in people and I think it comes from somewhere. I don't necessarily think it's just kind of white beard, male, god that I was taught to believe in, but I do think there's something bigger than us. And I do think that comes from someplace. And so when I pray, I try not to, you know, make some like a genie asking for wishes, but I do pray for the safety of my family and betterment, like event, my family and my friends. If there's something particularly going on, I just kind of put that out into the world. And, you know, I do say like that I pray that I'll be okay. Um, but it's, it's just my way of, you know, I don't necessarily do the prayers. I mean, I remember a lot of the prayers that I was taught, because I said them so many times for like at least almost 20 years. So you never forget them completely, but I tended to kind of like just talk and say a few things. And before I go to sleep, it's, as I mentioned, I mentioned the book, it's my way of keeping the line of communication open, but I do think there's something bigger. I think maybe with Tom that might come more defined, but I do. I think the Christian values that I think Jesus is a swell guy. He seemed amazing. I try to live by his verse virtues for the most part to be good to people, to be giving, to be con, to call out injustice to kind of live to those things. But yeah, I know it's, I know because I don't, I'm not agnostic, so I don't have like a defined God, but I believe in something. So I try to still speak to that spirit because I, you know, face, I think you can't completely go it alone. At least I can't. So that's my way. Yeah, well, hopefully also you'll find your bow. Yeah, you know, find me a man, Tony Braxton. Thank you. I appreciate all the question about sex and the law, I think, by the way. Those are my two main interests really in politics. So we covered a lot of things that I'm interested in. And I'm just glad to find someone else that's as interested them as I am. And that's it for the show. All the usual messages for the super fans apply. Please rate and review. Please support our sponsors and a little reminder. I am going to be at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin in September. I will be doing a panel about faith and justice and politics. So look that up. And then also I am part of the left right center live show tour of America, at least the two coasts. So if you're in New York, LA, or San Francisco, you can come to one of those live shows and I will be there on the stage. And you can see me roll my eyes at rich Lowry rather than just sense me rolling my eyes at rich Lowry, like I usually do. All that stuff is happening in September. I'm bad with numbers and bad with dates. You have a Google machine. Use it. And as always, please take care of yourselves."
