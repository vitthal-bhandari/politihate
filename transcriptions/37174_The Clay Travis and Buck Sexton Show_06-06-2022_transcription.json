    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast third hour of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show Starts now. Thanks everybody for joining in phone lines open 800-282-282 what a call and chat with us please do and We got a few things here. What is the the Biden administration? continuing to Have a rough day. It feels like every day is a rough day for the Biden administration Joe is apparently Very unhappy. This is the story that's being put out there now. It kind of strikes me that some of this may just be spin Joe Biden is is shocked shocked to find out that the American people think that he's doing a crappy job And that his approval ratings at this stage are actually below The approval ratings of his predecessor Donald Trump and keep in mind Joe Biden has effectively a corporate media apparatus that 95% of the people and 95% of the time is giving him a back rub and participation awards, you know just because no mean tweets or whatever Donald Trump had a media apparatus that completely lit whatever credibility They thought they had on fire that wasn't very much to begin with In order to create narratives of panic and fear at a time when the country was actually doing really well We're at peace no huge war in Europe didn't have the worst inflation in 40 years You think back what were the big scary things of the Trump years and it was? The fantasy of Russia collusion, which was essentially like, you know the boogeyman hiding under someone's better in the closet It didn't exist really but Democrats were terrified of it and They had to come up with things to make people think the country was in such bad shape when it was actually in great shape Biden's very upset now that people realize The emperor has no clothes this whole thing is kind of a joke. So what are they gonna do? We've been saying along they don't have a good narrative To share they don't have a good story to tell so there'll be a lot of focus on this January 6th, which this has been the most predictable thing in American politics I think for the last 18 months and They're gonna make this not just about January 6, but also about Trump as much as possible to try to make the midterms About Donald Trump here is a I mean I gotta say these former federal prosecutors who show up on places like MSNBC and CNN Have done more to damage the public's perception of federal prosecutors as serious and worthwhile people than anything else You could have ever conjured here is some former federal prosecutor Glenn Kirschner saying that the real target of the January 6th Investigations is you guessed it Donald Trump clearly I think Donald Trump is the ultimate target and it seems to me that what DOJ is now doing is Working its way up the criminal food chain Why is it that we now have the kind of flurry of activity? Could it be because the Department of Justice has gotten wind of Precisely what the American people are gonna see beginning on June 9 regarding the crime Donald Trump and his co-conspirators and people are gonna be screaming bloody murder Why haven't they been indicted it feels to me like all of a sudden DOJ is in full sprint Anticipating what we are all about to see the many this guy's delusional claim But yeah in a couple of days they're gonna have their January 6th prime time hearing is anyone gonna watch Nobody's gonna care and and and I don't mean that's because nobody cares about January 6th. I mean They've had 18 months that they have dragged out January 6th They're gonna put this on in prime time which feels like a desperate attempt for attention in The middle of what is going to be a busy summer graduation season People just have a lot of other things going on in their life now Super left-wing people who are still obsessed with Donald Trump are going to pay attention to this and there's going to be a desperate attempt to try to connect Donald Trump to the midterm elections And indeed buck one of the storylines that's out there is that Trump may decide to declare his 2024 campaign officially underway Maybe before we even get through the summer months now. There's a dispute There's articles written from a variety of different perspectives My advice on that would be for Trump to stay out of the fray Allow the midterms to happen and by out of the fray I mean announcing a presidential campaign I think going out and doing rallies and endorsing candidates that he believes make the most sense are Imminently reasonable, but I just don't think buck There's that many persuadable people out there who believe that this January 6th storyline is going to fundamentally Change anything and I would just say this with all of the leaks that have come out of that committee Do you expect me to believe that they've kept some grand unbelievable incredible and explosively revelatory details Not public yet I mean they've been leaking to the New York Times and the Washington Post and MSNBC and CNN the usual suspects About this investigation for over a year now every little detail text messages from media members They've tried to hold guys in contempt who haven't been willing to testify And I just don't buy into the fact that there's enough discipline on this committee that there's something that we haven't seen Now I think they'll try to address it sizzle it up try to you know sell it to all of the gullible and culpable and Particularly anti-Trump media out there, so I know that there will be an aggressive attempt made here But I just I don't think there's anything there. I think to use a phrase from the Obama administration This is now a nothing burger, right? Like people have moved on they care about inflation They care about the southern border. They care about to some extent the war going on in Ukraine and Russia right now They care about the murder rate that's certainly occurring in this country January 6th is like the 30th or 40th most important thing if that in the country right now I think they've created and by they I mean the Washington Post the New York Times MSNBC CNN Etc. I think they've just created an expectation among their most consistent hardcore viewers Which is completely synonymous with the Democrat base right the real left-wing Democrat base voter They believe that this hat this is important to them. They've been promised they will get these hearings and so And my in my mind at best They think with these hearings. They're speaking to 20% of the country I mean I think about 20% of you know the voting age population of this country that is far left Democrat is essentially Insane and unreachable like it doesn't matter what doesn't matter what we tell there's they're terrified of having kids Because of climate change did you see yeah as recline because he has the the superficial trappings of the intellectual people like oh he must be so smart saying that the most common question that he gets asked by people is Whether or not it's responsible for them to have children because of the carbon footprint and climate change I want to sit down I don't even know this guy never talked to him want to be like do you hang out with lunatics like do you hang out with people who are that Apparently yes, because that's the most common question he gets asked those people What do you think the crossover is between oh my gosh? I'm so scared about having kids because of the climate change impact that my out of out of seven billion people in the world my You're individual decision to have a kid. Yeah, it's gonna affect the climate and it's irresponsible the the core the crossover clay between Too scared to have kids because of climate change and thinks the January six hearings Which are gonna happen in like a couple of days or prime time? Important for the Savior saving of the Republic. I think it's a hundred percent. Yeah, it's an overlap It's like two different circles that are the same color that you can't even tell are different But this is just an easy question for everybody out there. We're effectively into the summer It's gonna be Thursday evening people like to start celebrating the weekend a little bit early Who is sitting and watching a prime time? congressional hearing Focused on something that happened 18 months ago for a guy that isn't even President right now and isn't announced to be running in 2024 yet It's so backwards looking in the same way that buck you and I have said hey elections really are for non incumbents a Referendum on the future, but if you're an incumbent then you should be held responsible for whatever's occurred on your watch My biggest concern about Trump is I think Trump will watch the hearings and I think he will enjoy them My concern with his campaign in 2024 is not the fact that he's a better candidate than Joe Biden He clearly is but that was the case in 2020 as well. It's that Trump running Let's Joe Biden or whoever the Democrat is that ends up as the standard bearer off the hook for how awful They've been in their job because we end up arguing about the 2020 election results as opposed to the concrete Election consequences which are what has happened with Joe Biden in office, right? So 2024 to me It wipes out everything January 6th everything 2020 It's all about who's got the better vision going forward and a referendum on Democrats having control of the government My concern is if if you allow yourself to get dragged back into the past that's a more fertile terrain for Democrats to fight on and I think that's what January 6th is all about because it's effectively an attempt We start Gavin Newsom do this when he tried to turn Larry Elder into Donald Trump That's the only campaign strategy that it seems Democrats have right now because this is definitely not gonna work the hey Economy is actually like, you know, it's really good guys. Just you don't know it He was talking about this positive jobs report which showed continued strong job growth 390,000 jobs No sign of recession moderating wage growth expanded labor force participation Which indicates some cooling of inflation pressures so for the moment the White House thinks this is a report in the right direction And an economy moving in the right direction CNN can try and spin all day on behalf of the regime But the people that are looking at a doubling of gas prices in the last 12 months are like not I don't think so I don't think I'm gonna fly and not only that I believe I'm correct that the new inflation data is coming out on Friday So you're telling me that on Thursday evening Democrats focus is going to be 18 months in the past on January 6th that they are going to be having a hearing that evening and The next morning early in that morning. We're gonna get the newest inflation data Whatever happens on Thursday Inflation is gonna be the story all day Friday because it's still news flash gonna be awful And I just tell you know everybody out there and I understand this sentiment so the Democrats are gonna do this whole It's about the sanctity of our elections and about the foundation of our republic and Yeah, obviously, you know, it was it people should not have Attack cops that day and you know, it was it was a not just not just a mistake It was a blunder because obviously as we see they've capitalized on the riot that day wasn't an insurrection Of course the one riot that Republicans were actually responsible for from an entire summer of riots Yeah, and it's not like the entire Republican party had been calling for endless riots for months and months as the Democrats did in the months leading up to this But I would just say it's it's amazing how much the Democrats soon understand after they tried a Soft coup against Trump with the Russia collusion lie for four straight years basically after they their primary Means of opposition to the Trump presidency was a concerted effort by the FBI the Democrat Party the intelligence community and the Democrat aligned corporate media to create this Russian collusion lie to get a special counsel to grind away at the Trump administration With that just heinous Political dirty trick they think that we want to sit around to be lectured about January 6 I got a few words to say to them in response, but I can't say them on radio Well, I just think it's gonna be particularly tone deaf because again Thursday night Oh my goodness. Look at how bad January 6th was Friday morning before most people are even at work the latest inflation data is gonna be out So whatever that storyline that they create on Thursday evening with their prime time January 6th hearing is going to Immediately disappear as everyone reacts to what's going on with inflation So there's just no it's just gonna make them feel and seem even more tone deaf than they actually are Which is saying something 21 years ago 911 2,977 people were killed in a terror attack on American soil tunnel the towers foundation has been supporting America's heroes and their families ever since When a first responder or military service member doesn't come home and young kids are left behind Tunnel the towers pays off their mortgage to lift the financial burden and bring their family stability for severely injured veterans and first responders Tunnel the towers builds mortgage-free smart homes Enabling our most severely injured heroes to live more independent lives and now through operation home-based tunnel the towers is gifting compact home to veterans Everywhere homeless veterans that is our nation's heroes people who put their lives on the line for our country and our communities They need your help help these heroes and their families join tunnel the towers on its mission to do good in their honor You can join buck and I and donate $11 a month at t2t.org. That's t the number two t Welcome back in clay Travis bucks X and show appreciate all of you hanging out with us We are rolling through the Monday edition of the program. I'm gonna be joined by no man only wolf here in a moment to discuss COVID and transgender related politics. I think you guys are going to enjoy that combination, but I wanted to mention we were discussing January 6th and the prime time hearing that's going to occur on Thursday the day before the most recent data on inflation in the month of May is going to be released and I think it's worth pointing out to That the Biden administration is under siege the likes of which we have not seen From the media all of a sudden buck last night I was reading Politico had an article and it builds on a CNN article And I think a Washington Post article as well all of which have had essentially the same theme Which is the Biden White House go figure is totally lost and doesn't know how to get its mojo back So to speak that morale is bad that everything they are touching is leading to disaster and that Joe Biden has been Furious inside of the West Wing both over what he feels like was a complete Failure when it came to the baby formula crisis and the fact that they didn't even tell him about it That's his claim and also that his poll numbers are now worse than Donald Trump's were at this point in the Trump presidency and Biden they say is Engaging in cursing fits throughout the White House furious at all times They don't really know what to do but the argument is and this is gonna not go well for them I think that Biden's solution is to get him out on the road more where he's talking to people And I got to be honest with you every time Joe Biden talks to anyone I think he makes more of a mess of things because he can barely put two sentences together off of a Teleprompter and so as we're now sitting five months out It's kind of an acknowledgement buck that there is no great solution for all of the issues that are bedeviling the Biden administration right now No, I mean, they're gonna try all this stuff We're gonna see the January 6 hearings and no one's even gonna remember them a day later Even of the people who watch it because we've already heard all this stuff. We've already seen they've been trying so hard to make this a thing that is On the minds of the American people constantly, but I do think They're gonna just get to batten down the hatches territory here where they know that the they know the hurricane is coming in this midterm election It's just gonna be a question of what's left standing of the Democrats afterwards and that's in terms of the the ferocity of the winds of change here That's gonna be on all of us to keep the focus on the failures because they're gonna keep telling you Oh, it's going to get better by the midterms were two years into this and whatever It's that we have but this is gonna get better clay. None actually that the people in charge know what they're doing I mean they've done a lot of stuff they wanted to do and the results are bad That's what we actually have with the Democrat Party and there were supposed to be all these times for Biden to reset and Get things back on track remember the state of the Union was gonna be that all of these different big speeches were going to be changing directions and trajectories of his of his Approval rates no, they're not working at all Biden is way underwater Let me tell you about American financing whether you're looking for your first next or forever home the lender you want on your side is American financing Believe me. I know they helped me with my very own mortgage last year their family owned They're known for having salary based mortgage consultants Which means you receive guidance throughout the home loan process and you're not getting pressure or anything like that because they don't work for a commission They work for you. That's really the key to having an offer that stands out the home buying market is starting to get a little less Competitive but you still need to have the right loan program and lender to help you win That's where American financing comes in they've been creating custom home loans for over 20 years So you can trust they're good at what they do want to learn more you should call American financing at 800 777-8109 that's 80777-8109 or visit American financing net Animales 1 8 2 3 3 4 and I'm a less consumer access dot I am buckshows still rolling on folks. Thanks for hanging with us Naomi wolf joins now She's a best-selling author and columnist her book the bodies of others the new authoritarians COVID-19 and the war against the human is that want to talk to her about that and some other things No, we thanks for being with us Thanks so much for having me I have said some pretty harsh things But I think true things about dr. Anthony Fauci Rochelle Walensky and so much of the public health apparatus in this country that not only pushed lockdowns and then extended them and vaccine mandates and extended them but to this day remains entirely Unrepentant and and even pretends at least to be proud of it I assume in your book because you call them authoritarians You see at some level what clay and I have seen all along here Which is that this was a moment of actual tyranny in this country? Yeah, I mean you're gonna love this book if you haven't if you haven't had a chance to to read it yet because I'm Completely aligned with what you just said and in fact, I think I explained to readers why They did these these things that were so damaging to our communities to our children And that turned out to have no medical value the data are in Lockdowns didn't do anything against COVID-19 States and countries that stayed open did just the same as states and countries that Locked their citizens down and closed commerce and by the same token other interventions like masks They barely make a difference But what they do effectively is lower our children's IQ points by 21 point according to a Brown University study due to the Restriction social interaction You know the closing of businesses didn't protect people from COVID but it in it allowed a massive Staff a massive transfer of wealth From the working class in the middle class to these oligarchs in a handful of major industries So a thousand percent it's not just a moment of tyranny. I would go further I think I make the case in the bodies of others that this was a that the pandemic the last two years of the pandemic were Excuse for a handful of bad actors notably the world economic forum some bad nonprofits like the building The Gates Foundation big tech companies to really wage war against the West against America in particular and Especially against our children and and to create a kind of the architect to kind of post humane world in which we are Serves and we basically need to ask their permission to engage in a human activity like commerce and assembly Naomi Buck and I've been talking a lot about the consequences of these decisions that were made the lockdown forcing kids to wear masks shutting down schools and how Catastrophically much of a failure they were a lot of them are at the feet of dr. Anthony Fauci Who has so far for the most part? appeared to escape almost all blame for any of this at least in the mainstream media Do you think that will change if the Republicans start to hold him accountable in front of the house and the Senate if they take Back the house in the Senate and what sort of consequential action should exist when our Unelected bureaucracy and our elected leaders get public policy decisions this wrong in your mind Yeah, I mean I Guess two things one is that I'd I'd encourage tempting to think All we have to do is elect another party and investigate these people And that'll take care of that, but I'm sorry to tell you that this is a bigger fight and part It's bigger than partisanship and what I mean is Absolutely, you know, I voted for the Biden administration. I'm embarrassed It was you know, I had no idea that they would turn out to be hostage to China and to oligarchs which they clearly are You know the the left is engaging in the bad behavior in our country But if you take a bigger picture at what's happening worldwide, it's a script that's met a national it transcends nation states It transcends political parties. We've got a Justin Trudeau a liberal You know shutting down democracy over the border in Canada and using Unidentifiable mercenaries to beat peacefully protesting truckers We've got the same Unidentifiable mercenaries are you know, are they police are they military impossible to tell in France? under Macron also a liberal, you know, these people were also beating peaceful protesters against the green path in In Britain and in Australia you've got conservative fears Boris Johnson until recently Scott Morrison You know reading the same script engaging the same lockdown the same abusive policy the same Distancing and you know war on middle-class businesses and sole proprietorships and you know individual landlords and so on It's it's a global coup and you know that my book makes the point that it's it's it's it's an alignment against humanity itself and really have to understand this So yes by all means, you know investigate Dr. Fauci investigate Rachelle Linsky actually I'm satisfied to tell you that Rachelle Linsky is just served with subpoena for grand jury investigations by colleagues of mine including Dr. Henry Ealy two state senators in Oregon Senator Lindticum and Dennis Lindticum and Senator Chris Kim Thatcher. You should definitely talk to them So they do need to face, you know, not only investigation. I mean they are they are criminals You know that the evidence is in But in addition to that you have to look at the bigger picture Which is that this is an effort by big tech by the world economic forum by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and China to basically We orient our entire world so that we are trapped and surveilled all the time So that you know as Klaus Schwab promised you'll own nothing and you'll be happy So, you know all these people all these landlords is one example all these landlords little landlords You know small business small owners of one property like you know I was a single mom for 12 years and I scrimped and saved and you know a lot of immigrants a lot of working people You know shave up and buy that one rental property. Well, Rochelle Lindske said with no authority You know no previously held authority that you couldn't evict your tenants for six months due to quote-unquote COVID Which was nonsense, right? And so who can afford to hold on with no income for six months? It's not the little people. It's not all those, you know first generation immigrants who worked so hard to buy that one little piece of property It's it's the institutional investors So there was one day in January when I saw all these you know landlords had to sell their properties at Fire sale prices and they got scooped up by BlackRock and now BlackRock owns nine percent of the residential housing stock And we're gonna train to a nation of renters as a result and that's just one example a hundred and ten thousand Restaurants and bars were forced to close down big due to the lockdown No medical reason at all right, but you know McDonald's and Target were allowed to stay open That that drove that market share into the hands of the big guys and if you read the bodies others you can see that You know tech company after tech company if you if they don't let your child be in an in-person school and Your child is you know chained to a computer then edgy tech You know distance learning which was a loser industry But you know the tech those were invested in it suddenly becomes a hundreds of million dollar You know plus up revenue same thing with meal kits You know who wants a meal kit who wants your food delivered in a box on your doorstep? You know if you can go to the supermarket talk to your butcher Dr. Baker meet your friend for coffee You will never want a meal kit but in tech investors invest in meal kits, but after lockdown, you know They're up, you know by hundreds of millions of dollars Amazon Google Microsoft by locking us into our homes forcing us to you know for professional classes You know have distance zoom calls and Microsoft team calls and Google Hangout calls They're up 20 to 30 percent Nintendo is up 20 to 30 percent You know if you don't let people gather in a church or synagogue and worship If you don't let people gather in person in a town hall or you know go to a bar or go bowling with your friends It drives everyone on to digital platforms where you can be your data is harvested and you can be tracked and surveilled And it's a giant boom protect companies So why would they ever go back to a world in which we get to have human assembly? It's it's bigger than just getting rid of the Democrats. I'm afraid to say nammy wolf the book the bodies of others the new Authoritarians covid-19 and the war against the human Naomi.

Freeze he had an Unbelievable hold on the box office obviously movies like predator, you know that they were more traditional action films I think we're underrating his role as a as dominant cultural force There's the greatest action here of all time. I mean I know there's some Stallone fans out there who are I was gonna say right now, but Schwarzenegger's number one. I don't I don't think I know that there's any real well So actually building on this is Tom Cruise the greatest actor of all time Well, let me just make my case is when when you consider 40 years worth of being Making movies all different types of movies that longevity in an era where almost the superstar actor has disappeared Is he the greatest actor? He's the most commercially successful actor of all time I think that if you just look at it from a box office perspective What and also his the amount that he carries in those movies, right? I mean he is the draw you can talk about some other major franchises, but it's like well, you know is I think that that Tom Cruise is the most commercially successful actor of all time in terms of his ability as a box office draw Although he he made I don't have anybody saw vanilla sky in the theaters and probably gonna upset some erudians now That is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life and I're in a theater I'm not a you can't include like what's on HBO three at 2 a.m. Like leprechaun five Which is a real thing that I watched once it was actually actually called leprechaun in the hood if you're wondering There's also leprechaun space first for leprechauns to follow the plot of I saw the first one which had Jennifer Aniston in it Because the leprechaun which I believe is played by Warwick Davis who was also the little person in the movie willow Which was kind of a sort of a lord of the ring style This is this is like a horror movie right for people who are not familiar with this Don't let your kids watch the leprechaun movies definitely inappropriate. It's like it's not a jolly happy No, he's a mean little leprechaun lucky charms leprechaun. He's a scary little leprechaun. It's still pretty scary Be honest with you anyway, it's not like one of those movies Vanilla sky came out in theaters and got a lot of fanfare and I thought that movie was I mean, what is the worst movie you've ever seen in a movie theater that that's a that's a big distinction because it can't be like You know, like I said cinema acts at 2 a.m. Although who knows what's going on there? Those are oftentimes works of art. Um, I will say Well for it also I think factors in on your age because when I was a kid My parents took me to go see the accidental tourist Which uh, I don't even know what that I they thought that it was something that that that may be my sister And I would like and I'm probably like 10 or 11 Punishment did you get kicked out of a little? No, I would have I yeah My mom is probably listening right now and My dad wouldn't let us leave because he was like I think your mom is probably liking it I don't even remember the plot, but it I remember thinking the two hours that we spent in the theater for that movie Felt like 28 hours, right? I don't remember as an adult walking out of a movie and saying that was so bad I can't even bother to finish it, but that's the one that comes to mind for me as a kid I went to see magnolia with my parents and it's the only movie That I actually walked out on oh, I liked magnolia. Oh Oh, that's Tom. That was Tom Cruise in that Was he wasn't that he was he has like it's made some really bad movies clay Oh magnolia. I thought was a pretty good movie Really when the frogs fell out of the sky you were you're into all this I don't remember all the details of it I just remember watching the movie and not thinking I think it was pretty well Well, this is all a long preamble to say top gun maverick is awesome and I highly highly recommend I saw on the iMac screen with kerry Uh, so, you know iMacs was just a little bigger a little loud watch that's I took my boys to go see it on iMacs too. Yeah the aerial scenes in those planes which you can tell it's not CGI which makes that's right difference in the world them the air the way they Film these planes was incredible and from act. I've actually heard and read interviews of pilots You know real pilots for other f-22s f-18s were saying they did an incredible job with that And they you know they brought in some of the nostalgia they stayed true to the original the screenplay was a nice continuation of it You know, I mean I can have my little things here or there I might have wanted a little bit different but overall A a plus movie watching experience in the theater really really enjoyed it and highly recommend anybody who hasn't seen it And it's you could totally watch that there was nothing that you couldn't you know, you're 13 year old right? It's basically like a pg 13. I don't even know what the rating is but you're 12 13 year olds could see that I mean everybody's every parent is different as we saw when we were talking about the ridiculous drag shows that were going on But I took my 7 11 and 14 year old boys and all three of them love I don't think what I mean is there's nothing that's not you know, no, there's nothing that's I mean There's violence obviously because you're in fighter jets. Yeah, but you're in planes. You don't see anything But yeah, it's not it's I I was fine. I didn't think hey, I can't believe I took my 7 11 and 14 I give it an a I give it an I mean look for a movie to watch in theaters I rarely go to theaters because I find so many people have no manners and they annoy me I I loved it. It was fantastic. Carrie took me as a little a little date night on friday. We had a lot of fun So I recommend to everybody out there. We're gonna have to we're gonna have to come back to this Did you see vanilla sky clay? I don't know I don't remember right here. I went and saw it in the theater I don't remember being awful. Let me say this by the way a lot of parents listen Top gun Way more appropriate for young kid audience. I thought then dr. Strange, which is the latest marvel movie So if you're trying to weigh what to take your kids to go see I thought dr. Strange was way worse In terms of kids and violence Play Travis and bucks exton on the front lines of truth"
