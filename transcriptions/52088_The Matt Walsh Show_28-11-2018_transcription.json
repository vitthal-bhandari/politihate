I never actually seen the show. I just assumed that's what it is But I mean, I just don't understand. How do you make that kind of money? Hosting a show that airs at 1 30 p.m. On a Tuesday. That's I just I don't understand But let me just say she makes a hundred and forty seven million dollars in a year Yet she has never given me even a million dollars She could give me a million dollars and and it would be like now She wouldn't even notice it and I have she has never once given me a million dollars Which I just find to be really rude You ever think about that with like really rich people think about Bill Gates has so much money That he could easily give me one hundred million He could give me a hundred million dollars and he would never even notice that it was gone yet Bill Gates has never Once given me one hundred million dollars if you can believe it. I know it just it seems I mean, it's it's extremely rude and this is why We need socialism. All right. I want to talk about something I This is why I don't want to talk about it. It's it's incredibly horrible, but And in fact when I first saw this story I was I was my plan was to not talk about it because it's so horrible makes me so angry that I don't even know if I can I don't know what kind of analysis I can really offer because it just it that's how angry It makes me but maybe you saw this headline on the daily wire yesterday Mom says six-year-old son is transgender dad disagrees now. He might lose his son So the story goes that Texas father is fighting for his son in court after Pushing back on his ex-wife's claim that their six-year-old is a transgender girl According to court documents the young boy only dresses as a girl when he's with his mother who has enrolled him in first grade as a female named Luna the father however condensed contends that his son consistently chooses to wear boys clothes violently refuses to wear girls clothes at my home quote unquote and identifies as a boy when he's with him The Federalist reports that the mother has accused the father of child abuse The mother is accusing the father of child abuse in their divorce proceedings for not affirming James as transgender And is looking to strip the dad of his parental rights She is also seeking to require him to pay for the child's visit to a transgender affirming therapist and transgender medical alterations Which may include hormonal sterilization starting at age eight The father has been legally barred from speaking to his child about sexuality and gender from a scientific or religious perspective and From dressing his son in boys clothes. He is legally barred from dressing his son in boys clothes He has to offer girls and boys outfits for the child to wear the boy consistently refuses to wear dresses according to the father The boy was diagnosed with gender dysphoria by a gender transition therapist a gender transition therapist Decided that the boy has gender dysphoria you wonder has this gender transition therapist ever met a child who They would not diagnose as gender dysphoric And By the way, the mother is a pediatrician According to the therapist notes the boy chose to identify as a girl when he was in sessions alone with his mother Alternatively, he chooses to identify as a boy when he is in sessions alone with his father The Federalist reports a dossier filed with the with the Dallas court says that under the skilled eyes of a therapist the child was presented two pieces of paper one with the word James One with the word Luna and asked to pick the name he preferred when the appointment only included his mother James selected Luna The name and gender he uses as mother's home and in his first grade classroom when the appointment was only with his father However, James pointed to the boy named James not the girl name Moreover, the father's collected testimony from friends and other people saying that the boy is just a normal boy who likes being a boy And it goes on from there I mean this poor kid Imagine how confused and scared this poor boy is I Mean does he even understand what's going on? Of course he doesn't He's being asked to choose between two alter egos. He's being given a choice between wearing dresses. I mean This kid has no clue what's going on is six years old. He just wants to be a kid Yet he's got his mother who is an evil evil woman. Let's be clear about that. This mother is an evil person Um in anyone who defends the mother or agrees with the mother is also an evil person So this is not I know we're supposed to be all into bipartisanship and you know We don't judge people for their beliefs and all beliefs are valid and kumbaya. Let's come together. No, no, no Um, if you hear stories like this and you think oh, yeah, well, that's right That's you know the mother's doing the right thing then you're just a bad person You're a demented evil person and I want nothing to do with you Honestly, I don't respect your beliefs. I don't respect your opinions You're completely wrong and I have no respect for you. I just don't This is so I told you that how angry this makes me how can it not make you angry? They're gonna chemically castrate this boy At the age of eight they're gonna start castrating him How can anyone read that and not be filled with anger for the sake of this child He is being physically Psychologically, emotionally abused mangled tortured destroyed all to fulfill the perverse insane Desires of the mother. This is this is easily one of the worst cases of child abuse I have ever read about in my life think of they are going to destroy this kid. They're ruining his life And his body they're they're ruining everything about him Um In a in a sane or a just society this mother would be in prison forever Lifetime sentence. That's what she deserves I I I draw no distinction Between this mother and any of the other any of the of of the other horrible child abusers That you might read about This is horrendously unimaginably evil Now There are three other thoughts that come to mind after after reading this Well more than more than that, but I have to control my I can't say everything I can't I can't tell you everything. I really think about this woman this mother this horrible disgusting monstrous woman because If I did well, I just I can't I can't say it all so I'm going to move past that but here's what comes to mind first of all What we're seeing here in real time. This is what makes it just so Terrifying just so demented and disturbing is we're seeing in real time how mental illness is being instilled implanted Into the mind of a child. He he is the mother is trying to force the child to be mentally ill um and And And he's resisting he doesn't want it, but how long can a child resist? He has no idea what's going on How long can a six-year-old withstand this? He's trying to resist, but at what point does this does does the child say fine? I've just got to wear the dress I guess mommy really thinks I need to wear dresses So I guess I should just wear the dress mommy really thinks that I'm a girl So I guess I'm a girl mommy really wants me to take this drug that's going to um, you know make me not a boy anymore. So I guess I just need to do it. I mean it sounds like the boy is is Still at the point of resisting but at a certain point, you know, no child can resist forever um At a certain point he's going to be when he's being manipulated and exploited like this Eventually it's going to sink in it would for any kid What we have here this is bay. I don't know if you've Munchausen syndrome by proxy. I don't know if you've ever heard of munchausen by by proxy syndrome. That's when a parent usually a mother Causes her own child to be sick And uh and either she can fabricate symptoms In some cases or she can actually make the child sick poison the kid uh You know not give him enough food so that he's malnourished uh Whatever the case may be very often in these cases the child is is made sick by the mother and the mother does this because Well, she does this number one because she's just a sick person herself, but her motivations, you know, she wants attention She wants to be seen as the white knight who's caring for a sick child So she makes her child sick or she just wants her child to need her and to be completely dependent on her So she makes the kid sick for that reason and that's basically what seems to be happening here This is a mental illness a maybe not a physical illness yet, although there are physical ramifications But this is a mental illness that is being caused in the child by the mother This is a perfectly normal healthy young boy A boy who just wants to be a boy wants to be a kid wants to enjoy his life have fun But the mother and the medical establishment remember this woman is a pediatrician And then there's a there a therapist involved as well. So the mother and the medical establishment They have plucked this kid out of his life and they have said no, no You have to be horribly confused about who you are We want you to have an identity crisis. So we will create one. No, sorry little boy. You're not allowed to have a normal life We're going to ruin your life Um because because it would make because that's the trendy thing You know, I'm the mother and and it's it's trendy to have a to have a transgender kid. So I'm going to make you be one You know what a child needs? A child needs clarity Instruction guidance and then he also needs at a certain point for adults to just get out of the way and let him be a kid So in other words a kid needs to be a kid within the safe and clarifying structure of a loving and attentive Um and caring family And this child does not have any of that thanks to the mother. He has the opposite of that He is getting the opposite of what he needs now Fast forward 15 years Imagine that the kid is 21 years old And if we had never heard this story before if there was no father there to fight for him Valiantly as this father is doing and by the way imagine, you know We're talking about how bad it is for the kid and obviously the the child is the is the number one victim in this situation but um Imagine being the father, you know imagine imagine this this this happening to your son your son being destroyed this way By these perverts and these maniacs And you're being legally prevented by the courts from stepping in and doing anything about it I mean, can you imagine can you imagine the courts telling you as a father That You know, you're not allowed to get your your son dressed in normal boy clothes. You have to provide dresses for him This is so insane. What's got Could anyone 15 years ago could anyone have imagined that this is where we would be even just 15 years ago This is how far we've fallen and just in just in just a decade decade and a half Nobody could have conceived of this 15 years ago And here we are Um So Just imagine fast forward another 15 years kids 21 years old If we had never heard of this story if there was no father there to fight for him If the mother were to succeed in having the child chemically castrated Literally physically forcing him to be a female to take on this female identity Then it's uh, it's 15 years later and he identifies as a woman quote unquote now the left would would take him And they would use him as another example and they would say look see some biological males just naturally Identify as women But there's nothing natural about this. We are seeing We're seeing how this process really plays out in real time Um And we are seeing how he is being shaped this way. He is molded This delusion is forced into his skull He's not being given a choice really and He didn't stand a chance So what we call when we see this this transgenderism we say oh, you know, it's just naturally arising None of this is natural Either this is a mental illness that just came up on its own somehow Uh as mental illnesses sometimes do Or I think Probably more often than that more commonly You've got some form of abuse that happens to a child at a young age And uh, and that's how they end up as transgender later in life Now it may not always be this kind of abuse where you've got a parent Forcing transgenderism on the child, but this kind of thing does happen I think it happens much more frequently now it certainly happens more frequently now Than it did um than it did in years past But you can also have other forms of abuse That caused the child to be confused about who he is ashamed of who he is naturally And then and then to go and seek other identities. So Uh, there's just this is this is not a natural process that takes place Second point, I think we should also be clear about something else This child is Being sexually abused And I think we should That's what we should call it We we should call this sexual abuse because that's what it is This is not just physical abuse emotional abuse. This is sexual abuse Uh, this is sexual abuse in a very literal way because his sexuality is being abused His sexuality is being perverted mutated destroyed his sexuality his natural sexuality is being taken from him So in the most in the most literal and direct kind of way I think we could call this sexual abuse and that is what we should call it Because it deserves the same kind of visceral anger and disgust That um that anyone feels and experiences when they hear about child sexual abuse This deserves to be put in that category and thought of in the same way And again, if we were a sane and just society it would deserve to be punished the same way Third point You know, I I have often said I've made the point many times that the transgender agenda conflicts with contradicts feminism um And I think that's that's still true, but in cases like this You see how actually the two go go go together they go hand in hand So you see how in some cases militant feminism and transgenderism Form a kind of dangerous and unholy alliance So it would seem that in this case this woman hates boys so much That she wants to turn her son into a girl And I think this is and this is this is something that even I have missed when I've been talking about this and I Well, and I say all the time. Why aren't feminists resisting this more? And um, I think this is one of the reasons That I've overlooked This is why so many feminists go along with the transgender thing because it's anti-male It's anti-boy Why do you think such a large percentage of transgenders are boys? That seems like a weird coincidence, doesn't it? What why is that? If this is just a naturally arising thing gender is fluid blah blah blah Then why is it that most of these then why is it happening to boys most of the time? um Why are the vast majority of them boys? Because this is a this is a we live in an anti-boy anti-male culture We live in a culture dominated by feminism and so That's what this is What the mother is really saying is I want a girl. I don't want a boy um And so I'm going to turn my son into a girl And I think that's what our culture does in a you know on a on a in a general sense That's what our culture is doing Our culture is saying well girls are better than boys. We would rather have girls than boys So we're going to take these boys and we're going to turn them into girls By whatever means necessary Up to and including chemical castration I mean one of these days a hundred years and from now 200 years from now uh 500 years from now Like archaeologists are going to go back Future archaeologists centuries in the future They're going to go back and they're going to you know dig up the the remains of our doomed civilization And they're going to find evidence of of these sorts of things and they're just going to Scratch their head. Do you realize we are living through things right now That archaeologists in the future are are going to are going to spend Are going to spend their entire careers debating and trying to figure out try to get to the bottom of Trying to figure out how this could have happened We are experiencing we are experiencing right now What will be in the future a mystery where people are going to debate how did how did this ever happen that they How is it that this that this ancient civilization ever became confused about what a man is and what a what a woman is Look at this strange weird custom that they would have where they would forcibly turn boys into girls Why do they do this? Were they worshiping some sort of deity and it's going to be a it's going to be they're going to be writing thesis papers And they're going to be you know Publishing papers and scientific journals debating this question And the thing is we're living through it right now and it's kind of a mystery even to us We don't even exactly know where this came from or why it's happening When when and why and where did we cross this kind of Rubicon where all of a sudden we became confused about these basic facts of life These basic biological facts It's really a horrible thing. So let's let's pray for this young man and for this for this father who is who is fighting heroically to save his son And uh, and let's let's let's hope that and pray that he succeeds All right, um I think that's oh actually one one of the thing I wanted to mention before we wrap up here Not nearly as important as The subject I was just discussing But I wanted to tell you I wanted to tell you what happened to me this morning Um, and this has just happened to me wait way too many times in my life And i'm tired of it And so it needs to be addressed Um here here here's what happened. I I pulled up to a four-way stop. Okay just happened this morning And I got to the stop probably uh probably a half a second before another car pulled up But the other car that pulled up they were on my right So if if we had arrived simultaneously at the four-way stop, they would have had the right of way But we were not simultaneously simultaneous Yet our arrivals were so close together that I thought he might not realize that I have the right of way So I very generously very magnanimously in an act of unimaginable kindness In order to avoid any confusion I yielded the right of way to him and I and I gave him the wave. I said, you know, I did this go ahead And I even nodded my head. Go ahead. That's what I did And I waved him on But this anarchist refused to go right because then what did he do and you've seen people then he waved me on and say he said no Go ahead. So i'm waving him. He's waving to me He's refusing my act of kindness So I I say, okay, so I switch my wave to this and I say, okay I switch my wave to a thank you and I said, okay, fine I'll go and then I started to go But then in a delayed reaction as I'm starting to go He decides at that moment to take me up on the offer that I've now rescinded And then he starts to go So then I stop and I wave him on and then he's delayed in every in every case He stops and waves me on and now we're just stopping and going and waving. We're looking at look like we're having seizures in the car So finally I took on took charge of the situation and I just plowed right through But it was a very traumatic and potentially dangerous moment and uh, it happens way too often at four-way stops and just in just in general in life So here's what we're going to do when I am dictator of the world There's going to be a new law And it will apply not only to four-way stops, but to all similar social situations And the law goes like this When somebody extends a minor act of courtesy towards you in order to facilitate a social interaction You must accept that courtesy You must say thank you and just accept it You may not decline the courtesy and deflect it back to the person who offered it to this isn't dodge ball This is not courtesy dodge ball where you're dodging it throwing it back to me. We're not doing that So you take the kindness you say thank you you move on with your with your life another example of this would be like if you're going through a door And you hold the door for someone but then they come in behind you and they hold it behind you and they say no after you Or even worse when it's a double door situation and you hold the left door for someone as they're coming in But then they go through the right door even though you're holding the left door Just leaving you standing a door standing holding the door for nobody looking like an idiot. So That is when I am dictator. That is that's not going to be allowed anymore Um, if you are caught the declining and active courtesy in that way you will face Execution and or a $50 Fine depending on how i'm feeling that day because that is how I will rule when i'm a dictator as any good dictator would All right, uh, just wanted to clarify that as we as we wrap up. Hope you guys have a great day. Thanks for watching. Thanks for listening. Godspeed You"
