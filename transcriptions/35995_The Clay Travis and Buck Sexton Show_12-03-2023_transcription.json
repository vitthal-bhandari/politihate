The Sunday hang with Clay and Buck podcast starts now. This is why I wish by the way somebody would just run for president. I wish there were a Republican candidate who would pick up this platform and run on it. That we need to spend more time in schools, not focused on critical race theory and demeaning and denigrating America and just giving people tools that they could actually use. One of my favorite stats out there. I'm going to keep beating the drum on this on the show because I'm hopeful that people are going to pick it up and run with it. Do you know that if you graduate from high school, if you get married and don't have any children before the age of 25, do you do those three things? Think about that. Those are three things that almost everybody out there can accomplish. Your poverty rate in America is virtually zero, no matter what your race, sex, religion, sexuality, none of that. None of these identity politics things where people constantly want to find victims. Do you know if you graduate from high school at something that every kid should be able to do graduate from high school? Don't have a kid before the age of 25 and get married. If you can accomplish those three things, your poverty rate in America is zero. That's pretty crazy. Isn't it? That we don't just spend more time telling kids in high school, hey, you know what? It's important to make good decisions and a lot of different choices in your life. But if you get three big ones right, graduate from high school, don't have a kid before 25 and get married. If you can manage to do all three of those things, which virtually everyone in America should be able to manage, you will have, can't guarantee you're going to be rich, but I can virtually guarantee you're not going to be poor. Doesn't seem like that high standard of, we're not saying people, hey, you got to go get a master's degree in engineering. You've got to go to school for till you're 42 years old and get triple PhDs. No, no, no, in reality, you just have to graduate from high school, which isn't that hard to do. Graduate from high school. Don't have a kid before 25 years old and get married. Your poverty rate's almost zero. That'd be a heck of a message, wouldn't it? Personal responsibility, individual work ethic, give kids very attainable goals. I'm not saying that should be the ceiling. Certainly, I want people to graduate from high school and go on to gain much more. But if you just focus on that and give people attainable goals, once they attain those goals, they can try to climb that ladder of success even more, but just give them those attainable goals to begin with. Focus on that. Hammer at home. Personal responsibility, individual work ethic, freedom, these are the tenets of American life that lead to success, no matter who you are or where you're born or what your mom or your daddy did. We don't hear enough about that from our political leaders. Sunday, hang with Clay and Buck. There's a professional surfer named Bethany Hamilton. And for some of you out there who may not remember all of her story, when she was 14 years old, she was attacked by a shark and lost her left arm. Despite that, she continued and turned herself into a professional surfer. And she came out over the weekend and aggressively attacked the idea of transgender male athletes who decide to identify as women being able to compete in surfing competitions, which is something that has been allowed. And she said, Buck, this concerns me as a professional athlete that's been competing in the World Surfer League events for the past 15 plus years. I think many of the girls currently on tour are not in support with this new rule. And they fear being ostracized if they speak out. And so she is pointing out, male body dominance in women's sports are occurring everywhere and says as a result, and Buck, I think this is significant because this is something that many people out there have argued, I personally won't be competing in or supporting the World Surfer League if this rule remains. And I think what you're seeing, Buck, is women, women's athletes are finally starting to speak out. And one thing we talked about this with Riley Gaines as it pertained to the Lee at Thomas swimming incident. One of the things that I heard most prominently, and I bet you've heard this too, is why didn't women just refuse to compete? Like what happens if when everybody dives in, they stay and stand on the blocks? And that's kind of a challenge because you still want to compete. But I think this is kind of a kind of a strong statement here. That's a difficult situation I could see for those female athletes because so you're going to give away your competition to this lunacy. I mean, I think that's, and also, imagine if you're, you know, if you're Riley Gaines, you and a handful of girls, women, decide you're not going to compete. But a bunch of others do. And so now all of a sudden it's like, well, you know, I got a silver medal. I'm happy because the best people in this race decided to sit it out on principal grounds. So you need total solidarity. And it's also very apparent that there's something nefarious behind so much of this because they, you know, the apparatus will take action against you as a woman who speaks out against this. They want there to be cost. Why should there be cost for saying that you don't want this? If it's really just about, is there an advantage? What's the science? You know, can we have an adult discussion about this? No, because there's obviously an advantage. We all know what the science says, and they just want obedience. They want anyone to. Yeah, but anyone who's ever competed in sports understands it more, I think, than people who don't compete in sports, because there's this idea out there because, hey, I'm woman, hear me roar that women, like, use the women's soccer team as an example. The US women's soccer team is the best women's team in the world. They got beaten by a 15 year old boys team in Dallas, Texas, five to two. These are 15 and under talented Dallas, Texas soccer, playing boys, boys, 15 year olds. The fastest woman in the world is Shaqari Richardson Buck. She lost wood blues every Texas state boys sprint championship. In other words, 16, 17, 18 year old boys in Texas are all faster than the fastest woman in the history of the world. I mean, Clay, even down here in South Florida, when I go to the gym, there are female fitness models in the gym. Yeah. And there are guys, I'm not saying I know too much about it, but the guys that go in there, they got a bit of a gut. It's been a little too much time indoors, but if you have a 200 pound, six foot tall guy, he's going to lift more weights than the fitness models than the females who are, you know, training four hours a day. He will bench press more than those women, you know, with almost no exception, like we all understand the science very clearly here. Well, that's our friend, Zuby, who we've had on before, you know, became the greatest women's lifting champion of all time to satirize the idea of men deciding to compete against women. And for everybody out there listening, what they've tried to argue is, oh, this isn't really a big deal. This is not becoming an issue. No, in the next five to 10 years, I really believe this. Your daughters and granddaughters, if this continues, are going to be competing against men all over the place. Every state, every school district is going to have this as an issue. And I give credit to Bethany Hamilton for speaking out as aggressively as she is about this story, because that's what it's going to take in order for things to actually change. I mean, I can't imagine getting my arm bitten off by a shark and then you back in the ocean. I would never get in the water again. Jug about bravery. If I ever got attacked by a shark in any way, much less had a serious injury, I would never get in the ocean again. I mean, I think I think if like a sea turtle nibbled on my feet, I'd be a little freak out, you know, so I can't imagine like I'm not an ocean guy. That's all I can tell you. I mean, the bravery of that by itself is I remember when that happened, and she said, oh, I'm going to go back. I love surfing. I was like, I, the fact she may be the most mentally tough athlete on the planet because when you're in the water like that, how would you not think about getting attacked again? I mean, do you ever freak out a little bit even when you're like a lake somewhere and you step on something weird? I mean, because, you know, we've all seen. I can't see the bottom.

My mental health meds were helping, but they led to uncontrolled movements called TD, Tardive Disconesia. It felt like my movements were in the spotlight. In Gresa, Valbenasine Capsules is a prescription medicine for adults with TD. It's the only TD treatment that's always one pill, one staly, and it's number one prescribed. And people taking in Gresa can stay on most mental health meds. In Gresa can cause depression, suicidal thoughts or actions in patients with Huntington's disease. Pay close attention to and call your doctor if you become depressed, have sudden changes in mood, behaviors, feelings or have thoughts of suicide. Don't take in Gresa if you're allergic to its ingredients. In Gresa may cause serious side effects including angioedema, potential heart rhythm problems and abnormal movements. Report fevers, stiff muscles or problems thinking as these may be life threatening. Sleepiness is the most common side effect. Now that treatment has reduced my TD movements, it's nice. People focus more on me. Ask your doctor about In Gresa or learn more at In Gresa.com. That's I-N-G-R-E-Z-Z-A.com. Sunday with Clay and Buck. I got a thesis for you. Every now and then I like to try it out thesis ideas. You guys can contemplate them, you can reject them, you can agree, you can modify. Thesis. The most, the single most important job of adulthood to a large extent is assessing risk. That is figuring out how to live your life knowing that there is danger involved. And certainly this is a huge part of being a parent, I believe, which ties in with adulthood. Knowing what is out there that is a danger to you and your family yet being able to go on about your life despite understanding those dangers. And to me, COVID has been a litmus test on this. Whether or not you were able to consider your own age and health factors and analyze your risk for COVID as a result on an individual basis and your larger family's results and everything else was to me a test of whether you could assess risk accurately or not. And Democrats failed it overwhelmingly. I was listening, I think we played a clip from Bill Maher pointing out that like 50% of Democrats believed that if they got COVID, they would go to the hospital. Yes. They didn't understand that you're probably going to get COVID and odds are you're probably going to be fine and get over it like you tend to get over a cold or you tend to get over the flu. Well, Axios has a poll up. And the headline is, what Americans say is the current greatest threat to US public health? Okay, what is the greatest threat to you and public health? And it gives you a lot of different topics that you can choose and but they divided it between Republicans and Democrats. And I read this and I said, okay, I'm fascinated by this. Republicans, 37% of them said that opioids and fentanyl, and I eventually learned how to pronounce it, fentanyl were the biggest risk to public health in the United States. It's a decent answer, right? Because you could theoretically be 100% healthy you use the wrong type of fentanyl. And the next thing you know, you're dead. I mean, that that is a very real fear. I mean, you look at the number of people age 20 to 50 who are dying. And and then you look at life expectancy lost as a result of that. And to think that fentanyl is a public health scourge on a scale, you know, in terms of substance abuse beyond anything we've seen is apparent and is very real. Okay, so that Democrat number two for Democrats by for Republicans, by the way, obesity. I mean, again, public health, if you are overweight, it is recognizable that you would have worse health outcome. Well, obesity is I think you would argue correct, you could argue correctly that on just a statistical basis, because if you put under obesity, the umbrella of things that are associated with obesity, heart disease, hypertension, type two diabetes, inflammation, by the way, of all kinds of internal inflammation, some people will will link a whole range of diseases. But most notably, heart disease, the biggest killer of Americans day to day and obesity, go hand in hand. So that's a very reasonable answer from people. So 63% of my math is right. Of people basically are saying 62% Hey, these are the things that we're most afraid of for Republicans. Democrats, number one, and there isn't a close second. Number one, biggest threat to public health, according to Democrats, gun or firearm access. And, and, and I think this is, I mean, such a window. And, and by the way, cancer is 9%. Cancer is 9% on this issue. I believe cancer kills around 600,000 people a year buck. So, and firearm, most people who die of firearms, unfortunately, over half is suicide. And so, this idea, I think feeds into, we hear all the time about Republicans believe things that aren't true. I actually think Democrats believe way more things that aren't true because of their infatuation with the media than Republicans do. Well, this is, this is a very clear example. And you started off talking about with COVID, they use, they use exaggerated fear and, and anxiety as a political tool around certain issues. So they have convinced people, for example, that lawful gun owners are somehow a threat to them. When you look at the data, concealed carry permit holders. And I think we're about to get a constitutional carry down here, for example, in the state of Florida, concealed carry permit holders, though, are not only more law abiding than the general population. They are more law abiding per capita than law enforcement, okay, which is a pretty crazy statistic, but it's one that is, is often cited. And, and when you look at the way that people are, are afraid of lawful gun owners, that's completely a creation of the media for political purposes. The overwhelming majority of crimes, violent crimes are committed are by people who are not supposed to have a gun in the first place or commit crimes, whether in the carrying of or the transport of that firearm, the straw purchase, all range of issues. But really what this is, is all an effort to create mass paranoia around lawful gun ownership so that they can push for confiscation. So they can push for what they call law abiding or a common sense gun regulation, claim more people have been you cited the statistic about suicide via gun, which more people die via suicide than than actually murder, I believe you're in and you're out with firearms. 30,000 people a year, according to the CDC die of falling. Now, generally that's older people, but more people die from a standard fall down the stairs off a roof, whatever the case made, if they're doing roofing, then die from guns every year. But do you think that if I told the average, you know, lib walking around a major US city that you are statistically in more danger of dying from a from a fall than from a gun, they would think that I'm crazy? Yes. No, they would. And I think it becomes such a huge part of how we see the world. And it was a window, COVID was, into really Democrats and all their allies, not being able to successfully analyze risk and live your life despite the fact that there is risk, right? Every single day that you walk outside, bad things can happen. 40,000 people a year buck on average roughly die in car accidents. Yet almost every single person that will listen to us today, unless you live in a big city like New York and just don't even own a car, will at some point during the course of today, get behind the wheel and go somewhere. Almost every single person listening to us. And that is because we have to understand that there comes a level of risk associated with life. And when I saw this list, the we don't talk enough about how many untrue things Democrats believe. One of the biggest is that police are killing thousands of minorities every year, right? I mean, this is a hard and fast belief by and large of Democrats. If you quiz them, how many unarmed black men are being killed by police every year? They think the answer is thousands. It's literally seven or eight and unarmed does not mean without risk, right? If you're choking someone to death, you're unarmed. If you are reaching for somebody's firearm, you are technically at that point, unarmed, but they don't have an ability to understand where the risk factors actually are. And for guns and access to firearms to be the number one fear of Democrats, I think is such an intriguing window into the world that they live in. But it's intentional. The media that pushes this stuff and makes people think these exaggerated sense of fear they have, for example, from gun violence is meant to bring about a political outcome, which is the only way to make us safe from the dramatically elevated fear we have of general gun violence is to make him in clay. I'm picking up an AR-15. I meant to do it yesterday. I'm actually going to do it a few days. I have to wait five days to pick up my gun. What is that? What is that all about? Like in what world is that making? It's just a noise me. I have to go in, fill out my little form for the FBI background check, I have to go in and do this little dance and then wait five days. It's just meant to antagonize people that believe in the Second Amendment. How about the difference between your experience in New York City and Miami, though? I mean, you couldn't even have a gun in New York City, basically. It was almost impossible, right? Yeah, it's completely that they make it so that it is as onerous, expensive, and it actually is even worse than just the expense and the time in a place like in New York City, specifically. New York State is a little bit better, but New York City, the laws are so... This has gone to the Supreme Court, so this isn't my perception. This is reality. The laws are so vague about lawful gun possession that you don't know if you are breaking the law and perhaps committing an accidental felony and they can't even tell you whether you are or not in New York City because they haven't figured it out because they want you to not know because they just don't want you to have a gun. It's virtually impossible. It is kind of fascinating just to consider that despite the fact that New York is having skyrocketing rates of crime. Sunday Sizzle with Clay & Buck. McLean, now we're just talking about how right now, all over the internet, a lot of consternation from the feminists out there, particularly about the latest in Leonardo DiCaprio's love life. So my understanding is Leonardo DiCaprio is 48 years old and he is now publicly dating a 19 year old. Is that right? I believe that's correct. He's closing in on the 30 year gap. Now Clay, let me just say, as a married man, I feel like a connection and having some compatibility goes beyond just the physical and attraction. But I do think it's interesting to hear different people's views on what the, because I think for a lot of women, I'm just going to say this, for any of the young ladies listening to the show right now, if you're in your mid 20s, I think a lot of those young ladies would be very well served to date guys in their early 30s. I think if you're in 26, 27 to be immature and not necessarily a great partner, men and men are trying to build a career so that then they can turn around and then build a family and women are on a different timeline. So I think 27 and 34, 26 and 32, stuff like that, I think that's kind of standard in New York, but 30 years of age gap is Leo's pushing it a little bit. So here's my theory on DiCaprio. I think that Leonardo DiCaprio decided a long time ago in order to be truly elite in his profession. And it's fair to say DiCaprio is an elite actor, right? I mean, maybe the greatest actor of his profession, of his generation. I don't think that's crazy when you look at the variety of his roles and how successful he's been. I think he decided that he needed absolutely nothing other than like a total casual, not serious relationship partner, I mean, for the rest of his life. And that's what he's done. He's never gotten married. To my knowledge, Bucky doesn't have any kids. He's 48 and he basically is dated, you know, 20 year old Victoria's Secret models. That's what he dates. 20 year old Victoria Secret models almost exclusively 21, 20, 22. But you know, Clay, us normal married guys, we get into our 40s. We want conversation. We want nap time. It's very different. I think DiCaprio wants what DiCaprio wants, which is 20 year old Victoria's Secret models. And I think he doesn't feel like he has to give it up. And the girls continue to date him. So I don't really have any issue with DiCaprio. I just wanted to keep making good movies. And maybe not talk about the blue hair that cat ladies online are very upset at Leo over this though. A lot of cat ladies. Judy was boring. Hello. Then Judy discovered jumbo casino.com.
