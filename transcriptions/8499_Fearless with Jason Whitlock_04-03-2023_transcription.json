    "text": " Welcome. Welcome to Fairless with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock your host. Happy Saturday. Hope you're enjoying the weekend. We got a little treat for you here on Saturdays as we like to do an abbreviated version of Fairless with Jason Whitlock. You know, we put together 90 minutes, two hours for you during the week. We just got a little treat for you over the weekend just to get you through the weekend. Delano Squires are going to join me on this special edition, the Saturday edition of Fairless. We're going to talk about all the pandering that's going on as it relates to the trans issue. We've got Hershey's candy bar pandering. We've got the Toronto Raptors apologizing for a video that says women have babies and they left out that, oh yeah, now men can have babies too. The Toronto Raptors pulled down the advertisement of the commercial that was in celebration of women's history month I think. And then finally Delano kind of pulled things together. He wrote a piece for Friday about Professor Mark Lamont Hill, the former CNN contributor, the, you know, podcaster kind of popular. He doubled down again via Twitter about that men can get pregnant or trans men can get pregnant. They're women too. And just kind of all ties together that all this trans craziness is rooted at the academic level that it's the academic class that is pushing this insanity that we're seeing everywhere. And so I want to play the clip of, I think we have the Hershey's commercial that's promoting this transgender woman or transgender candy bar. Let's watch the Hershey's commercial. My name is Paige Onstone. I'm the Executive Director of Wisdom to Act and we can create a world where everyone is able to live in public space as their honest, not authentic selves. See the women changing how we see the future at Hershey's Canada. Hershey's Canada. And what really baffles me about all of this is I just can't imagine the transgender community being more than 1% of the overall population, but they feel like 75% of the conversation. I just don't get it, but I guess it's because that's where our educational institutions have focused all of the attention. And so a candy bar, how does this whole transgender thing, you think that's going to help them sell more candy bars? Well, Jason, I'm really not sure why these companies are doing this. Maybe this was Hershey's way to signal silently that this candy bar has nuts for people who may have some sort of, I don't know, what's expecting that. Maybe that was the way of saying it without saying it, but honestly, there's a couple of things here. One, that's clear, and I wrote this for a piece a couple of weeks back. The revolution has been corporatized, and conservatives and even sort of reasonable, you know, center left liberals need to understand that the notion that tyranny can only come to the government is a very 1980s type of position. These corporations take on every sort of social justice movement. They power it with money, they slap their logos on it. Obviously every June is pride month, so you get queer beer and you get, you know, pride night at every stadium. And this is a way for the corporations to insulate themselves from the type of criticism that comes from, you know, traditional old school, you know, socialist, communist, Marxist, because Jason, as you know, even with the BLM stuff, the women who go find this organization say that they are a vile Marxist, but they have no problem taking the money from Warner Brothers, taking the money from politicians, taking, you know, money from, you know, the NBA and the NFL, or having their movement be supported by these large multinational corporations. So this is to your point, this is a way to pander to an extremely small part of the population. And the reason that it's safe to do so is because they understand that very few people, outside of people like us, are going to be willing to speak up in public to criticize what they're doing. They understand that the so-called trans community is the new protected class, and they know that they can appeal to this community and really appeal to people outside of that community by saying, look, we're good allies with very little chance that they're going to get a backlash, because they know the women are not going to say anything, that's clear, right? They know the women are not going to say anything. And they know that a good number of the men who don't agree with this, who hear the base in this dude's voice and understand, oh, that's a man, he could put the septum ring, he'd call his hair red, he could put on fake eyelashes, but that's a dude. But they know that most of the guys are not going to say anything because they're too scared. So it's very little downside for these companies. And I think that's one of the big reasons that they're pushing this particular ideology with so much force. So let's take the big tough NBA professional athletes, the Toronto Raptors put together a video pandering to women, and they might as well have all just come on and say, y'all, queen, y'all, queen, Stacy Abrams, you the bomb. But they didn't. Let's play the video. And I'm telling, when I first saw it, it just bops, like, what are they apologizing for? But let's play the video. Girls were on the world because they only won that camp. Great, they birthed everybody. All women are great because they're all queens. So literally, I just thought, I was like, okay, they're just pandering to women. Girls run the world and all women are queens and blah, blah, blah. It's stuff they really don't believe because as soon as the camera went off, trust me, they put some rap music on and it was bees and holes everywhere. But they had to apologize over, you know, basically saying women can have babies. That's what makes them special and queens and why they run the world. I don't understand why the athletes are playing along with this. So there's a couple things, Jason. When I saw that video, I said these guys must have gotten off the, not as fast bus. I don't want to call it slow bus, but this was not a particularly, you know, articulate explanation of why they're celebrating women's history month. But that being said, as born and just drives it was, I wasn't sure, and I tweeted this yesterday, I wasn't sure whether they were apologizing because the Raptors wants to be inclusive of quote unquote, you know, I guess these will be trans men, right? So females who identify as men, I don't know if they were trying to be inclusive of that community or if they're apologizing because the players were trying, were basically being reductive in terms of what women do and can accomplish, right? So obviously they wouldn't apologize if they said, you know, women are great. They can do anything men can do, but better they run teams. You know, we have a female vice president, so on so they want to apologize if they spoke to the role that women play in the workplace. But when they speak to the work, the role that women play in creation, then you have a problem. Because the left sees that as, as I said, reductive in terms of what women can do and can accomplish. But this is what I tweeted yesterday. The stadium at the Raptors playing their arena is guaranteed that it was built by men from the foundation to the roof, to the stands. All of it was built by men, if not exclusively, then certainly primarily. But every single person that fills that stadium was born of a woman. Now in our culture, people are going to have problems with both of those statements for different reasons, but both of them are true. But if I said that women built up some particular industry, everybody would say, oh, yes, oh, that's so great. Women are bosses and can run the world. But when you speak to biological reality, that women have the exclusive privilege of bringing forth life, now people start to get offended. And that's because, and I've said this often, the north star for feminism, it's true north. How it measures and calibrates its compass is by looking at whatever men are doing. Feminist hate being women, and they hate being women, I'll just say that. And it is an ideology meant to destroy sexism, but really what it destroys is femininity. And all of the things that women are exclusively capable of doing. And all of that, I want to circle it around to the column you wrote on Friday, all of it is emanating coming from the theoretical, the backbone, the foundation of this argument is all coming from academia, our leds smartest people in America, smartest people in the world. And they're really the dumbest. And Mark LeMann Hill, I think he's a professor at Temple, a former contributor at CNN. And all I can really think about is when the scripture, the scripture, were thinking themselves smart, correct, they've given over the reprobate minds, and they've made fools of themselves. You abandon God. But I was reading your piece and like, yeah, Delano, make sure you homeschool your kids, and don't let them go to college. Yeah, I mean, so what happened this week on Twitter is that, for a reason, the clip of Mark LeMann Hill talking with Candace Owens a few years ago started to go around, I guess it went viral or semi-viral. And she basically asked him a very simple question. Can I get pregnant? There it is. I know what it is. What does it depend on? I know trans men that can get pregnant. That means it's a woman. Only one sex. That's a particular argument. That's a good argument. It's proving my thing. There is a truth, a concrete truth. You have to be bored with a uterus to have a baby. Only women can get pregnant. That's part of disagreeing with it. That's part of disagreement. There's nothing to disagree with it. These are facts. So you can say that this person who is pregnant identifies as a man. That person was born a woman. I can tell you that every single time, because only women can have sex, because there are concrete truths about life. He doubled down on that. He did. And he's a college professor. And he tripled down on Twitter when he acknowledged, he said, oh, it looks like my heavily edited conversation with Candace Owens is going viral for some reason. And he said, yes, I believe what I believe that some men can get pregnant, that trans men can get pregnant. And the point of my column is that even though people like Duane Wade and Gabrielle Union are the most visible P of the five P's in the Afro-stocracy, the politicians, the pundits, the professors, the preachers, and the performers, the performers are the most visible, but the most dangerous are the professors. And they're dangerous because they give legitimacy to some of the most reckless and destructive ideas that emanate in our culture. And what I said in the piece is that if the notion that men could get pregnant started on the shop floor at the Jiffy Lou, nobody would take it seriously. If it started in the back room at a, you know, in the players lounge at a baseball game, no one would take it seriously. If it started, if it got started by some farm hand in Iowa, no one would take it seriously. But when someone says, I have a PhD from an Ivy League school, and I studied, you know, sociology and anthropology and all these other subjects that most people have never even heard of, what comes with them is an air of authority and legitimacy. And especially when you can point to, again, the fact that you graduated from Harvard or Yale or Penn or Morehouse or Howard, then people will say, oh, wow, this person must know what they're talking about. And particularly in our community where so many parents push their children, particularly their female children, their girls, on to higher education where for a long time, you know, the more educated black folk did occupy a particular space, right, the town to 10, that notion. We look to these people for guidance and they have completely led us astray. And people like, and I talked about Michael Monthill, Michael Eric Dyson, who dismisses the importance of fathers on MSNBC and begs white folk for reparations on Fox. I talk about your best friend, Brittany Cooper, who says that she's glad that the nuclear family has gone the way of the floppy disk. I talk about Greg Carr, a professor of Africana Studies at Howard University, who says that women leaving Texas for more civilized states to seek abortions are basically channeling the spirit of the Underground Railroad. And I talk about Carl Hart, a professor of pharmacology and psychology at Columbia University, a heroin user who in the midst of a record uptick in drug overdose deaths, writes an op-ed saying he uses heroin and he thinks other people should use heroin and hard drugs and narcotics are not that bad. And he had written one previously where he said he would rather his children interact with hard drugs than the police. This is the professoriate, the black intellectual class, the progressive black intellectual class today. And this is why these people are agents of intellectual destruction and moral compromise. I got to be careful, but I've got family members, that young family members that are doing very well academically, and I had a discussion with another family member because they were talking about, I think Harvard or Yale was recruiting one of my young relatives. And she goes to a Catholic high school and she's doing very well. And I said, I was like, hmm, so she's doing well at a Catholic high school, a religious academic institution. Why send her to one of these secular schools and have all the gods stripped out of her at one of these Ivy League schools? Why do that? Why not keep her, why not send her to a religious school? Great students, you know. Why are we going to send our kids off? Let's send them to the devil's playpens so they can learn all this crazy stuff when they're excelling at the high school level. You know, I want to be careful here, but you know, I had a nephew that I have a nephew that did very well at a prestigious Catholic high school. And you know, I would have voted to send him to a religious school in college. It's not what happened. It's a mistake. I really am to the point and your column was like the final nail in the coffin. I think I'm anti-college. I really am because I think I'm unless you're going off to some religious university that actually sticks to the doctor because many of them don't. I'm not four and you know, I saw, I think I thought you commented too this week. Someone was going after Matt Walsh's credentials because he's not, he doesn't have a college degree. And I was sitting here thinking how much smarter I think Matt Walsh is than all these people with all these degrees. And it just like man, college is really overrated. So a couple of things Jason. I am very close to where you are and it's a very big surprise for me for a number of reasons, right? Not just because I believe in the value education and I still do. For me, education is equal part scholarship and discipleship, right? It's academic mastery and moral formation. But at one point, I wanted to be a college professor and I had applied to I think three PhD programs right at the point where I met my wife. And it's funny. She said to me, well, we need to be married. If you want me to move with you to some other city and I said, okay, let me speed up my timeline. But I got rejected from all three. And that was probably the best thing that has ever happened to me in my life. One, because I realized I don't need a PhD to write a book or to influence the culture. Two, we already have a doctor's squad in the house because when I met my wife, she was finishing her PhD and she finished it at Hampton and I was glad to be there to support her and help over the dissertation and all that. But the biggest reason is because, as I said, a lot of these institutions and particularly any of the liberal arts majors, the social sciences, anything outside of the hard sciences, these institutions have become playgrounds for some serious mischief. And they are turning the minds of these kids inside out. And really what the education they get, it quips them to have enough surface level knowledge to justify why they want to up end reality. So, I'll say this happens on Twitter to me all the time. People say, oh well, well you don't know the difference between gender and sex. And I'll say, okay, well explain to me the concept of a female man or male woman. Or they'll say, well you're not following the advances of sociology and anthropology. And I just ask them for evidence and they can never bring that evidence. But what they have is they think that they're standing on some foundation of a higher truth. And what they're trying to do is play God. They think both that they have access to higher forms of knowledge and that they can create reality, ex nihilo, out of nothing. So if they say and they will, that a man can become pregnant, that you have to conform to their view, right? You have to submit to their higher knowledge and throw away everything that you've known since you were a child. So, if any of my kids wanted to go to any of these institutions, any of the Ivy Leagues to study any of these social sciences, right, in 10, 15 years, I wouldn't pay for it. And as God is my witness, particularly with my sons, my two sons, I would be overjoyed if my sons chose a path as tradesmen, as craftsmen, as carpenters, as electricians, as plumbers, men who can do things with their hands. And this does not mean that men who do that cannot be intelligent because many of them certainly among the wisest men that I know personally. But I would much rather than be able to say to a prospective wife, you want a house, I can build you a house than to say to a prospective wife, well, I'm not sure which one of us is going to have the baby, right? So, if it's not Hillsdale or Hanful of a small number of colleges, as you said, religious colleges, you know, sort of classical, classical colleges, I'm not interested in it. And especially, I'm not interested in them going 50, 60, 70,000 dollars into debt for them to come out with less wisdom and knowledge than their great grandparents had. So, yeah, this is a problem. It's a problem across the culture. It's an extremely significant problem in the black community. But I'll say this, and I'll say this in my piece because I'm trying to be more positive, Jason. I gave examples of professors who to me are operating in the tradition of sort of that classic black intellectual. I quoted from a book of essays I have that was published in 1902 of a number of blacks, you know, some classically trained in higher education, some not, all very intelligent, very wise, who understood theology, who understood that any type of racial uplift had to be rooted in morality. And two of the professors I talked about, one of them is at Hampton, she's launching the National Center on black family life. And she's working, she's going, they're going to be working with churches to equip churches, to counsel couples, to help them become better parents, to strengthen their marriages. And that's the type of thing that particularly HBCUs should be doing, but any institution should be doing. And then another professor who has done research on why black men get married, that type of scholarship is very rare. It's much easier to find professors who can talk about liberation through abortion than you can this type of work. The good news is that there is a remnant who still take their job seriously, who have an obligation to the broader community to use their intellectual gifts for the uplift of the masses. But as it relates to the people with the most prominent platforms, it's a lot of mischief, chaos and disorder. Thank you Delano. Have a very week. Thank you.
