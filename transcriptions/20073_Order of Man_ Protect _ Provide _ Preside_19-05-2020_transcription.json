    "text": " Reason seems to be in increasingly short supply, which is unfortunate considering some of the messes that we found ourselves in will only be solved through reasonable thought and ideas and people. Also unfortunate is that those who are the loudest seem to be the most unreasonable and only wish to perpetuate the problems that we have in modern society and culture. Today I'm joined by the one and only Dave Rubin, New York Times best-selling author of Don't Burn This Book, Thinking For Yourself and an Age of Unreason. What I like most about Dave and also this conversation is that he's willing to talk about the things that you're not supposed to talk about including the myth of the gender gap, why hate speech should be protected speech, why not everyone is a Nazi as perpetuated by what he calls the quote unquote lefties, and ultimately how to be reasonable in a world that seems to be anything but. Gentlemen, what is going on today? My name is Ryan Mikler and I am the host and the founder of this podcast and the Order of Man movement. I want to welcome you here. I want to welcome you back. Regardless of how long you've been listening to the podcast, this is the place to be. If you're a man and you want to improve yourself and your capabilities and get the knowledge and the information and the skill sets and everything that you might need to thrive and succeed as a man, then this is your outlet. Guys, before we get into it, I would just ask a very quick favor. If you've ever got any value from what we're doing here, please share this podcast specifically this episode because there's going to be some things that are controversial in this conversation. And I know that it's going to be challenging for a lot of people to hear what it is that we're going to be talking about, but it's good. These are the types of conversations, whether you agree or disagree that we need to start having because if we don't have these conversations, I think we're going to find ourselves in a worse spot than maybe we're going to be talking about. If you're in a worse spot than maybe we already have. So this is going to be an interesting one, but regardless, if you found value in this or any other conversation, then just leave a rating review, share it, send a text, whatever you can do to get the word out because this is a much needed message in society, that of reclaiming and restoring masculinity, of giving everything they need to make themselves stronger, wiser, more knowledgeable, more capable, and ultimately able to lead themselves, their families, their businesses. Well, that's what we're all about here. So we've got Dave Rubin on the podcast today. We've had Jocka Willink, Grant Cardone, Andy Fersilla, David Goggins, men. The lineup is phenomenal. When I think back about who we've interviewed over the past five years, I feel very blessed and fortunate to have interviewed the incredible men that I have. So we're going to get into the conversation here in just a minute. I do want to mention my friends and show sponsors, Origin. It's been several weeks since I talked about them. They've been pivoting. They've been adjusting, as have we all in this very uncertain and very strange time. They were making a lot of masks. I think that they must have made tens of thousands of masks over a span of three to four weeks. But they're pivoting it again. They're doing a lot of exercise equipment. So they've got plyo boxes. They've got this really cool thing called the Burden Bag, which is essentially, instead of a kettle bell, it's a kettle bag. It's this leather bag. It's very well constructed. You can open it up and fill it with lead shot or pennies or rocks or gravel or whatever. And then that way you can take it with you wherever you go. If you're traveling or moving around, you can take it with you and fill it with what you need. And I think it gets up to maybe 40 pounds or so. So they've got that. They're working on some different mace options. Very cool stuff. Just go check it out. And also, if you need any supplements, then check out their nutritional supplemental lineup, partnered up with the one and only Jocka Willink. They've got their discipline, their joint warfare, which is the thing that I take the most, especially as I can either confirm or deny that I've got back into Jiu Jitsu. But I will say the joint warfare is good for the aching, painful, swollen joints. Anyways, just go check it out. Origin main as in the state main origin main dot com and use the code order or DER at checkout. And you'll get a discount when you do. Alright guys, let me introduce you to Dave. If you don't already know who he is, I'm sure many of you are already familiar with him and probably have some preconceived notions, good or bad about who he is and what he stands for. I've been following him for some time now and I'm actually pretty fascinated with his journey from a left leaning progressive to a free thinking classical liberal. And I didn't really fully understand what it meant to be a classical liberal. So he actually explains that in the podcast and very fascinating. He's the host of the Ruben report. He's spent almost two years touring and opening for his friend and mentor Jordan Peterson. His background is actually in stand up comedy, but he's been extremely, extremely successful and become well known for his podcast. And again, he's interviewed guys like Jordan Peterson, Sam Harris, Ben Shapiro, Larry King, Dan Crenshaw, Adam Corolla, just so many more. So his lineup is amazing as well. Anyways, he's here to talk with us today about thinking freely and openly about some of our culture's most polarizing subjects. Enjoy. Dave, what's going on, man? Glad to connect. Looking forward to this conversation today. It's good to be with you. I am talking a lot these days, but just had a little water, had a little coffee before that focused. Ready to work. Perfect. Perfect. Any idea on how many interviews you've done over the past week or two? I have no idea, but it's been really, really crazy. I mean, look, I love what I do and I'm really proud of the book. So I'm psyched to be doing this and I actually love, it's been fun talking to some of my crew going on their podcast, you know, guys that I know. And then it's fun talking to people that I don't know that I'm meeting for the first time and chatting with all these people that there's other great interviewers out there. There's people that, you know, look at the world in different ways and all that kind of stuff, but my days have basically been sometimes starting at 4 a.m. going till about 8 p.m. pretty much nonstop talking the whole time. So it can get a little weird because, you know, every now and again, if you do with the long form, like we're doing right now, wait a minute, did I say that five minutes ago or was that five hours ago? Is that in this conversation or the last three that I had there? Yeah. So I'll try not to repeat myself too much like Joe Biden. I'll see what I can do here. Well, you get what you asked for, right? If you want to put yourself out in the public and you want to have a book that's that reaches a lot of people and that's profitable and makes an impact, then, you know, this is this is a great thing. And you know, this is this is the result, which, you know, you take it. That's it, man. And I'll tell you, when I was on tour with Peterson, which obviously is one of the things I write about in the book, he always said to me, Dave, if we're going to do this, we got to give it the everything we got. And I know it sounds kind of cliche, but like I really saw him do that. Like every event he never owned it in. He took every interview. He shook every hand. And he lived that for a year and a half. And by extension, I ended up living it for a year and a half. So I feel like I'm like well set up right now to be doing it. And yeah, I mean, it's, look, if nobody, if nobody was digging the book, then I wouldn't be doing a lot of these. But, you know, once you do something and if you're proud of it, it's like you want it out there. Yeah, definitely. Well, I did want to congratulate you on on reaching the New York Times best selling list. It's a book that is unfortunate that has to be shared in a way. You know, it's kind of interesting. It's like, it's a great book. It's a great conversation. It's just too bad we have to talk about it from this context. Yeah. Yes, I agree with you. It's kind of funny. It's like, we just found out actually two minutes ago that we're on the Times bestseller list now for the second week in a row, which is obviously, which is great. But in a weird way, thanks. You know, in a weird way, your question is right because it's like, you know, the stuff that I'm doling out in this book, whether you agree with me on every little political issue, I would say is almost irrelevant, the heart of the book and the heart of what I believe classical liberal principles are are common sense. I want you to use your brain. I want you to think about yourself and the world and the life that you want to live in the country that you want to live in and figure out how to maximize your happiness, find your purpose. And by extension, you'll do that for your family and your community and everything else. There's nothing controversial in here in a world that was saying. Now, the problem is that we live in a world that's off its kilter right now. And then you throw in coronavirus on top of that and we live in a world that's really sort of at a whack right now. So that's kind of the funny part. And you know, I titled it Don't Burn This Book. And I didn't expect them to be out there, you know, like 1941 Germany throwing it on fires. Obviously, I didn't expect that or I guess nothing's that obvious these days, but I didn't expect that. But what I did expect and what has happened is that, you know, we've got these like Reddit trolls and some of these underbelly of the Internet sites that are attacking Amazon reviews and online retailers. And in effect, that is a modern book burning because you burn a book. I mean, back in the day, why did the Nazis burn books? Well, they didn't want counter ideas to come out. They didn't want ideas that were either in many cases written by Jewish authors, but in more cases that were about freedom or about science, things that they didn't want to get out there. And in the modern sense, it's like, why would you assault Amazon reviews or attack online retailers? You would do it because you wanted to press people from seeing the actual content reading the actual ideas. So in many ways, they're proven the point of the book. It's a digital book burning or a modern book burning, but, you know, seems like it hasn't stopped anybody for reading it. Well, and I think in a lot of ways, it actually produces the opposite effect of what they intend, which is kind of funny because in a way, this is like, trollery of master levels here, right? It's like, don't burn this book, which is an invitation to burn the book, which actually helps gain some publicity for the book. So well, well played. Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to say I didn't think about all the options, you know, like we kind of played it out and we were like, all right, well, we'll see what they do with it. And we do know that one person has actually burned it in anger, at least. You know, a couple of people did it like to be funny, but it's all good. You know, I believe in these ideas, the things that I talk about in the book, I think are the very same principles that our founders set this country up with. You know, they wanted limited government and they wanted individual rights. We haven't always lived up to it in America, but we really have bent the arc of justice in that direction. And if you're a legal citizen of the United States right now, you're legal under the law. There's nothing stopping you from doing whatever you want to do, whether you're black, white, gay, straight, whatever it is, nobody cares. It doesn't mean we're all going to be equal. It's meaning that, you know, you might have some physical gifts that I don't have or some people are born rich, some people are born poor. That's all the magic of life. That's like the chance you got. But what America has done better than any country is say, hey, we're here, we're equal. You know, women couldn't vote at one time. Now they can vote. Black people were slaves. Then they couldn't vote. Then eventually they weren't slaves and could vote. Gay people couldn't get married. Whatever the issue is, we've always moved things towards more people. We live in a time right now where nobody's rights are impeded on because of their immutable characteristics. And that's a beautiful thing. And it's what the founders intended, even if they didn't get it perfect as men of their time. To me, it seems like a lot of people, I would say, more predominant on the left, and I think we're going to get into the distinction here, seemed to want to be remained trapped in the past. I'm not going to deny that there was more racism 50, 70, 80 years ago. I'm not going to deny that there was some less than honorable conditions in which we've engaged as a country generally. But like you said, we're moving forward and maybe it's not as fast as people would like. It's certainly not without collateral damage. But we are trying to correct the behavior. And I think generally we're moving in the right direction and we're doing the right things collectively. Yeah. Well, that's not just an idea what you're saying. I mean, the numbers bear it out. I lay out a lot of numbers in this book. And we are the least racist society probably in the history of the world. Our entire country, what does it say on the Statue of Liberty? They're pouring your huddled masses. We've brought in everybody from every corner of Earth. We throw them here. We don't give them anything. And then what happens in almost every case? Almost every case. They make a better life than they had when they were in the other's place, wherever it was. It doesn't matter where it was, whether it was Europe or Africa or anywhere else or Asia. It just doesn't matter. And then that life is significantly better in the next generation. The next generation usually has it better. This has happened for over 200 years in the United States. So the certain set of people who keep us in this endless were racist, were homophobic, were sexist. They're just using that so that they can figure out some sort of governmental control over you. That's it. Where do you, where do they want to go? I mean, they never leave, right? They always say they're going to leave, but they never leave. They never go to Sweden. They always point to Sweden as the place we should go. Sweden is a tiny, tiny, homogenous society that in the last 10 years, has some immigration and some migrants. And now we're having all sorts of problems. We have put the ingredients of the world into the stew of America. That was the idea, the melting pot. Come here, bring your traditions, bring your foods, your languages, all of these things, but fold it into America. Fold it into this idea. I love the phrase when Dennis Prager talks about that America is just an idea. It sounds sort of silly, but when you really think about it, the founders had an idea. And all that idea was, was could we free people? Could we free people from a king? Could people live freely and pursue happiness? I mean, that's a crazy statement to put in founding documents, but we've got them in ours and we have allowed people to do that. And I think there's too many people that think, oh, just because the world isn't exactly as they wish it could be, that this experiment is a failure. And this is the greatest freaking man-made experiment in the history of the world. Yeah, I think where it works best is when we learn and we're talking about immigration where individuals assimilate. And I think that's part of the problem that we're seeing now is that we're pitted against each other, whether it's through our own actions or incorporating the thoughts and tribalism ideas of other people, that everything's contentious as opposed to, hey, you have a new perspective, you have a different thought, you have a different life than I do, and maybe we could actually get together and I can learn some things from you and you can learn some things from me, and we're both better off. We're not enemies, we're actually common allies, shared interests. And I think generally that's how most Americans look at it, but it seems like there's a group of people up here that want to say, no, no, no, divide, you're not supposed to be getting together and getting along. Yeah, well, look, there's many reasons for this. I think social media, obviously, it was supposed to make us social, and in many ways it made us antisocial and it polarized us more. And then the sort of beauty and the danger of the Internet is it allowed so many voices in, which you know I'm a free speech guy, so I want as many voices in as possible, but then so many competing interests and competing thoughts and online mobs and burner accounts and trolls and all of these things have left us in a really odd spot at the moment where we're all kind of looking around and then you throw Corona in it, and we're all kind of looking around and going, well, what is America right now? What is freedom? What is, and by the way, we can talk about this at a much wider, through a wider lens than just America because people all over the world are thinking, you know, what's going on with the government that's telling me not to do that. What is the government that's telling me not to leave my house? Can we trust the government? Should I be more reliant on growing food for myself or being able to defend myself or a series of other things that I actually think are good things and important things to think about that? Maybe we were kind of lulled into not thinking about artificially for a long time, but I agree with your general premise there, which is most people, if you meet most people, and I mean, not just most like 51%, I mean like 90%. They don't care what color you are, and they don't care what religion you are, and they don't care what race you are. Many times we actually love meeting people. I know, I do. I love meeting people who are different than me that come from different places. I've had the honor of traveling the country, and when I was on tour with Jordan, we went all over the place. I went to all of these cities that I had never been to in the middle of the country particularly. I met all of these people who lived very different lives and came from very different places to me, and it was like, they just want to live free. They want to find some happiness. They want to be able to provide for themselves and their family. That's what most of us want. And yes, we do have to get away from this thing, and I do think we are getting away from it. I think the people that are the most polarized political right now, politically, are the most boring. If you're a lens, the way you look at the world is just through politics, man, you will be miserable. You will be endlessly miserable because politics is about power. It's endlessly going for power. That's why generally, I would say, libertarians and right-leaning people seem to be happier because their whole world view is not wrapped up in trying to get government power. Lefties tend to view government power as sort of the end-all, be-all of that people. And I think that that can only lead you to misery. I would liken this to Game of Thrones. It's like in Game of Thrones, everybody, what was the Game of Thrones? Well, the game was that we all want power and everyone's going to try to get it. However they can. Well, what happens in Game of Thrones? Everyone's dead at the end and the six guys who are alive, everyone they know is dead. And that sort of is what politics can leave you with. Just an endless scorched earth thing. So you have to have a world view that is far wider than that narrow view that is just politics. Why do some people get wrapped up in that? If we know that that's the side to consolidate power, to gain power so we can have this authority, then why is it that so many people seem to get wrapped up in it as not recognizing government overreach and power grabs, but they're genuinely after our best interest and they know better than we do individually for our communities and for our families? I think there's probably good people who get wrapped up in this and think that the government genuinely has our best interest at heart. So I think there's a couple reasons for this. I touch on this a little bit in chapter nine when I write about Find a Mentor and I talk more about Jordan Peterson. I mean, I think what partly has happened is if you look at people on the right, so if you're a libertarian, you're a conservative, you're an old school liberal, what does that mean? You basically believe in individual rights, so you want everyone to be treated the same by the law. And then you believe in the light touch of government and say libertarians believe in even less government than maybe classical liberals or conservatives, but that all can be battled out. And that's what having a political party is about. That's what having a political platform and conversation is about and all that. I think what has happened with the people that want power all the time, and this would sort of be the modern lefties, the progressive, is I don't know what they're using. I don't know what they're unifying principle is anymore other than government should do a lot of stuff. And I think the reason for that, and this is a strange place for me to argue from, is that they have no belief outside of themselves. People on the right generally believe in something. We can call it God, the founders called it God-given rights, meaning that there are rights that exist outside of you. There are empirical truths about freedom that exist outside of you, and we're going to create a government to protect those truths. That is a freaking beautiful, wickedly profound concept. On the left, they don't really believe in the Constitution or individual rights. They believe, oh, the government can do stuff, so we want it to do a lot of stuff. And if it doesn't do as much as I want it to do, I'll make it do more. That is a very different starting point. And I think that sort of leads to what I would say are a lot of good people. I mean, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. A lot of good people who see some sort of perceived injustice in the world, and then they think, oh, well, now I should take the power to either take from some and give to others, or to provide whatever programs I want because I am good, because they feel good. And that, I think, is why Shapiro's lying about, Ben Shapiro's lying about facts. Don't care about your feelings. I think it really took root. And I think that, broadly speaking, leftists generally are miserable because they've taken personal accountability out of their lives. That's the thing that gives you purpose more than anything else. That's the thing that gives you drive. It's your life, man. Go do whatever the hell you want to do with it. I'll make sure, and I'll fight to make sure that you're treated equally under the law. But once you want something special, or once you want to take from somebody else because that's what you feel like, well, now we've progressed to something else. So if you told me progressive meant we're progressing to equality, we're good. We're good to know. The second we trip over that line, now we're not good to go. And I think that that's what's happened. We progressed to equality. We got there, but they're not ready to give up the rain. Yeah, I thought a lot about the differences. And when I'm talking about ultra progressive, we're talking about leftists, and maybe we should kind of reverse here and go back and explain and define those terms. But when I look at it, I generally think that those individuals tend to be more pessimistic about human nature and the way that humans perform and show up versus your classical liberals, libertarians, conservatives tend to be more in my experience anecdotally anyways, is more optimistic about the human spirit and how good people can be and how hard they work and how much responsibility they're willing to shoulder. That to me seems like the biggest difference. I think that is a difference, and I think that's definitely connected to what I was laying out, having something to do with belief. And I don't even mean that necessarily in the metaphysical or mystical version of God, as much as just believing in something outside of yourself. Just believing that the world exists beyond what your thoughts are. It does not revolve around you. Bingo. And once you can really understand that, understand also, there's a reason that left these hate history. They always want to take down statues and all these things. The reason they want to do that is they think they can create the perfect world. What I always like in this too, if you're a Marvel guy, I mean, basically modern lefties have become Thanos. What happened in the Marvel movies, in the Avengers movies? Thanos saw a universe with limited resources and he said, you know what? I'm the good guy. I'm going to do what none of you will do, but what did he have to do? He had to wipe out half the life in the universe. That's not a great thing. But remember, after he did it, what's the first scene after he does it, you see him sit quietly and peacefully. He feels that he is done good. And in many ways, that is what modern leftism is. They want to wipe out racism, wipe out misogyny, wipe out homophobia. These are lofty goals. But what do you have to do and root to their utopia? Well, every time socialism and collectivism takes root, whether it's Nazism or anywhere else, you had to kill a lot of people. Because you can't make a perfect system. You know why? Because we're flawed. I can't build a perfect system. I'm flawed. I think people on the right broadly understand that. So their inkling is to say, okay, we can't build a perfect system. So let's try to make sure that the system never gets too big. On the left, the idea is, oh, the system's horrible. Let's give it more power. And that is just the biggest flaw in their thinking, I think. And I've been able to wake up some people to that. Because if you get into a conversation with a lefty, they'll complain about everything. They'll tell you how awful people are. They'll tell you how awful the government is, how awful politicians are. And then all you have to say to them is, hey, I'm with you on all that. So my solution is let's rein in their power source solution seems to be give them more money and give them more power. So there are ways to deprogram. Yeah, and you're obviously a well-spoken guy. You've seen both sides of this. And I think that gives you some credibility as well. It seems to me like when you're saying this, I hear the ends justify the means in a way versus, no, the ends are important, but the means are just as, if not more important, then the result that it produces. Well, that's why I always say democracy and freedom. It's messy. I think what the lefties sort of think is that you can create it and it'll be clean and it'll be right. And they'll have solved all our problems. They can tie it up in a bow, send it out, and we're good to go. And then that's that. I think what happens in a society that truly values freedom, that values you as the individual to make the choices for your life that you want to make, there's going to be some messy stuff in there. So like, you know, when I've taken the position that the baker should not have been forced to bake the cake for the gay wedding, if that was against his religious belief, well, a lot of people get angry at me about that, but then you can give them examples of things that they'll say, Oh, no, you wouldn't force them to do it. So it's like, if there was a painter who took commissions online and she had Holocaust survivor relatives, would you ever force her to paint Jews in a gas chamber? Of course not. Would you force a Muslim baker to bake a cake for a gay wedding? The lefties would freak out if you force them to do that. Right. So you have to put some of it back in their face and say, at the end, I'm not giving you a perfect system. Would I prefer that the baker just go ahead and bake the cake? Yeah, I'd prefer it. But what I prefer isn't dominion over that man's life. So what you have to say is, Hey, it's messy, but go ahead and get a cake elsewhere. And if you can't get it in your town, then you order it on Amazon. And if you can't do that, then move somewhere else or learn how to bake. That's right. What that does is protect freedom. But it is a little bit sloppy. It's not the perfect bow tie answer that they can take home to mom and say, Look what I did. I got an A. I think it comes down to a little bit of an oxymoron, which is a convenient principle. Maybe that we're only principled when it's convenient or it aligns with your viewpoint of the world. I mean, you talk a little bit about this when it comes to hate speech. It's like, what is hate speech? Like, yes, you know, there's, there's certain language and rhetoric that I don't agree with that I don't appreciate. But if I want people to be open to at least the thought that I can share what I believe, then I got to be open to what they believe, even if I don't like it or approve of it. Of course, look, I'm a free speech guy. So what does that mean? I mean, I lay this out in the book. You can say whatever you want with the very, very, very narrow limitations that the US government has given. And what are those narrow limitations? Well, you can't instigate violence against the person or group. So you can't say, Hey, you know, kill all those people. You can't do that or plot to kill people. And with that has other criminal stuff involved. And you can't yell fire in a crowded theater with the idea of creating a mob scene. You can't do that. And then beyond that, we have extremely strict laws around libel and slander that almost never get used because they're so strict. But beyond that, you know, when these people say, well, I'm for free speech, but Nazis aren't allowed to speak. It's like, well, you just, you're not. Well, you also call everybody a Nazi. So you're really not for free speech. And I'm sure you know this, but you know, there was the famous case of the KKK trying to march in Skokie, Illinois in 1971. They went intentionally to the place in America that had the most Holocaust survivors and the ACLU did the right thing. It defended their ability to speak. Now, had they been violent? Well, now we've got something else. Had they marched and said, now kill all these people. Now you have something else. But you have to protect odious beliefs. Otherwise, you're not really protecting anything. You're virtue signaling, but you're not really protecting anything. Right. Well, I do appreciate you letting me know and informing me that I am indeed not a Nazi, which is something that you make very clear in the club. People were very happy with that chapter. Yeah. Oh, I bet. I bet. I bet they're happy with every chapter. I bet everything. They agree with everything. There's no confrontation. You know, I'm sure just went over very, very well with everyone. Yeah. Well, I felt that I should write a chapter that would tell people that they are no, they are not a Nazi. And of course, I wrote it, you know, obviously somewhat tongue in cheek, but you know, this idea that just because someone disagrees with you, they're a Nazi, they're a bigot, they're a whole whole bit. Right. You know, the worst of the worst, you know, there's so many dangers there, but the real danger actually is not what you've done to that person. Now, in many cases, you've silenced that person. And, you know, I talk a lot about that in the political closet. But when you label all of your political opponents, these horrible things, it really is about what you're doing to yourself. And I did a video right after Trump got elected where I kept saying to the left, these guys, and I really felt I was still a lefty at this point. I kept saying, Hey, our guys, we got a stop call in Trump, Hitler, and everyone else Nazis because if we don't do that, what if Trump turns out to be okay? What if he's not, you know, putting people in camps? What if he scales back war? What if the economy is doing well, cuts regulation? A series of good things. Well, you can't suddenly be like, Oh, you know, that Hitler guy is pretty decent. Right. So what you do in effect is you put yourself in a corner. And I think that's why so many leftists right now are acting so bananas. Trump really saw that. He saw that their visceral reaction to him was so over the top that he can get lefties to take almost any position on any given thing. If Trump came out tomorrow and said he was for open borders, the left would be demanding we build a wall. And I think that is goes to what you're saying about you have to have principles when they're tough to have. Having principles when they're easy to have really doesn't mean anything. We all have that. That's easy. But you know, but the ACLU saying, Wow, we are going to defend the rights of self-proclaimed Nazis to express free speech. That takes that takes freaking balls and honor in a very in a very weird way and an uncomfortable way. And again, it goes to why freedom is messy. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's the boy who cried wolf too. You know, if everybody's a racist and then an actual racist comes along and you say racist, then everybody's like, Yeah, you said that about the last 10 people. So yeah, that guy's not a racist. That undermines your credibility and authority for whatever you're talking about. That is yes, you are 100% right. And that is actually what I'm if I was worried about one sort of growing unknown thing in America. Remove coronavirus for a second and all the stuff around that. That's what I'm worried about. They they in effect have shot their load. They called everybody bigots in races and they got nothing left to the point that when the real bigots come. Which by the way, they're not Trump supporters and they're not Donald Trump when the real bad guys come. We won't believe it anymore. They will have cried wolf so many times that the wolf is going to be eating all the sheep and many good people are just going like, No, it can't be can't be because everybody else that they call it not just so I am worried about that. I am definitely worried about that. Yeah. Yeah. That that is a very serious concern. You know, you use the word the term lefties. I think we ought to describe what that is because you're not talking about like you say classical classic liberalism or libertarianism. You're talking about lefties. So explain that for me. Yeah. So it's an important distinction to make because I've sort of stuck the flag in the ground and I'm trying to save liberalism. I don't know that I can save the word liberalism. I think I've woken up a lot of people to understand there's a difference between liberalism and leftism. Liberalism as I described before classical liberalism, which is really an idea of the 1700s enlightenment was the idea that if you're legal in a country, you are born free and thus a government is supposed to protect your rights. We've done that better than anywhere else in the United States and then the light touch a government, meaning we want competition to solve as much as possible. And then there's some added bonus stuff like, you know, use logic and reason and our human minds and respect and tolerance and that sort of stuff. How would that differ from libertarianism? Great. Great question. So I get this a lot and in effect. So when I say that usually a lot of people will say, well, you're a libertarian. Right. I don't mind being called a libertarian. I think a lot of these terms are starting to blend together. I would say the only real functional difference between a classical liberal and a libertarian is that libertarian classical liberals tend to believe in a little more government. So I actually do think the state can have some role in education. I don't think it should have a hegemonic role in education, but a lot of libertarians don't want the state to have any role in education. And also, if you were to take the sort of more extreme side of libertarianism, they're constantly looking to get the government out of absolutely everything. I actually really like those ideas. I think they're intellectually fun. I don't know if you know Michael Malice, but I think he's one of the great sort of uncapped libertarian thinkers that we have. So I think that stuff is all fun, but I do think it's sort of a necessary evil. I think society needs some basic guardrails that are the government. So that's what I would say the difference is. But if at the end of the day, we talked all day long and your takeaway was Dave, you're a libertarian. I don't mind. That's fine with me. The important distinction we should make is, all right, so how is liberalism different from leftism? Now, leftism. And when I talk about leftism, I'm talking about socialism. I'm talking about collectivism. The idea that groups should have rights, not individuals. I'm talking about that the state should be above you. I believe you should be above the state. This is a very authoritarian set of ideas that then when you throw in identity politics and grouping each other based on immutable characteristics and black people should think this and gay people should think this. This is a really dangerous set of ideas, which of course, who always sits at the bottom of that totem pole? It's the white Christian man. Which is patently absurd because guess what? Black people are allowed to have all sorts of thoughts. White Christian men are allowed to have all sorts of thoughts. And the only way you can ever find out is if you talk to each one of these people. The idea that people- Well, and everybody has issues too, right? I mean, and I'm not- Absolutely. Some are worse than others. Some are different. We all have things that we're dealing with or backgrounds that we've come from or certain characteristics or viewpoints that maybe hinder our ability to succeed. We all have baggage. Like it isn't exclusive to one group of people. No, of course. And the idea- I mean, collectivism on its face is racism and bigotry. So I could find a guy that probably looks a lot like you and sit him next to you. The idea that he would think the same things as you because he's white, he has a beard, he's wearing a hat, blah, blah, blah. That would be bigotry because bigotry is based in prejudice. And of course prejudice is too prejudged. So if I just looked at 10 white guys who all kind of look the same same age and everything else, and I was like, well, they're this. Well, that is prejudging. And by the way, that goes for every group. You're not going to believe this, but black people think all sorts of different things. Gay people think all sorts of different things. Surprise, surprise. Women even think all sorts of different things. It's just bananas, right? So socialism and collectivism and progressivism has morphed into this very weird authoritarian thing. And the reason it got conflated with liberalism is a really clever trick that they did. They saw the soft underbelly of liberalism. Liberals are open-minded. Liberals are tolerant. You may know the famous paradox of tolerance by Karl Popper that if you're so tolerant that you're tolerant of intolerance, well, the intolerant people are going to come in and take over. And in many ways, that is what has happened to liberals. That's why there are very few real liberals anymore. We have progressives, and then we have basically everybody else because I would say classical liberals, libertarians, we're all sort of on the same team at this point. We can argue about the specifics, but we all sort of are getting it together and we're getting along. And it's the progressives versus all of us because, I don't know if you're a Star Wars guy, but they basically executed Order 66 on the liberals. They went in to take out the liberals and they did it pretty well because they got in because liberals were like, yeah, we're nice and tolerant, so we're going to listen to you. And next thing you know, if you say that men and women have different biological attributes, you're a Nazi too. So that's how they took out the good liberal. That's interesting. So do you feel like the trend of the country is moving more towards leftism, extreme progressivism? Or do you feel like this is something that we're seeing in a pocket and we're going to be able to counter that sooner rather than later? It's a great question. Nobody likes being in the prediction game. I believe that the future of American politics, and you have to just mention that the coronavirus has everything completely out of control right now. Everything is the dice are up. Like we're in the middle of the dice right now. They're on the way down. We don't even know where the board is at. Right. Right. So putting aside Chrono, although I'm happy to talk about that related to all this as well, I think that the future of American politics, but not just American politics, I think that the future of Western politics, of free loving nations is center right. I don't think it's leftist. By the way, the Labour Party, which is in effect what our Democratic Party has just got demolished in the K election. The Australians had an election. The right one there. Most of the Eastern European nations are all moving right. Israel has had like four elections in the last five years, and it's all right leaning. They've demolished their lefty party. So I sense that's what's coming to America too. I think that basically is a good thing. If the center of America is center right, meaning it mostly is about individual rights, we're going to guard our extremes. So, you know, we're going to be respectful of religious people, but we are going to have a separation of church and state. We're going to battle about what all the specific issues are in the rest of it. That's a pretty healthy place, in my opinion, for a country of 350 million people. The danger would be if we went the other way and we came this leftist country because then it's like, all right, well, we're just going to take from whoever. We're going to demonize everybody. We're going to group everybody. And it's a toxic stew. Men, let me hit the pause button real quick on Dave and I's conversation. I want to introduce you to the Iron Council. I've been amazed over the past, I would say, two to three weeks with the growth that we've been experiencing over the past, well, that timeframe, two to three weeks. And I believe it's because men are beginning to see the value in banding with other men who have their back and want them to succeed. It's that resource is invaluable, whether it's in the Iron Council or anywhere else. But if you were to strip everything away from what the Iron Council is, that's what it's all about. It's a band of brothers who will support you, encourage you, hold you accountable. And if you're like most men, that just isn't something that you have in your life. And even if you do, what I've seen is that most of the conversations that men are having stay on the surface and never really get to the heart of what really matters and all that you're trying to accomplish as a family man, a business owner, and a leader in your community. So if you're ready to forge a powerful bond with other like-minded men who are successful and ultimately chart the path that will lead you to where you want to go, then I invite you to join us in the Iron Council at orderman.com slash Iron Council. Again, it's orderman.com slash Iron Council. You can do that after we finish up the show with Dave. Well, and it seems like once you start to go that way and you allow the government to consolidate some of that power, it becomes increasingly easy for the government to do, right? It's the longer that it goes on, the harder it is to control, to stop, to maintain, to reverse. So that's very much a good sort of metaphor or example of what we're dealing with right now with coronavirus. We did the guarantee, right? They told us, hey, guys, lock it down. We're going to lock it down two weeks, four weeks, six weeks. We're now eight weeks in. I'm here in California. It sounds like they just tacked on another three months. And in all of these states, well, the blue states, I should stay because the red states like Texas and Florida are opening up. Now, that doesn't mean that everything they're going to do is going to be perfect. Maybe they will see little spikes, but they're trying to take some chances for us to live freely. The idea that we're going to eradicate this thing or that no one will die or that no one will be sick or any of this stuff. Man, that is a crazy proposition. That is not what mature, honest people would be saying to each other. But when you hear some of these governors say, well, if one person dies, it's too many. That's crazy. People die. People get hit by cars. You could walk outside of your house and you get struck by lightning. Anything can happen. The idea that we can mitigate risk completely away is not possible. And there's the famous saying, those who would give up liberty for security deserve neither. Do you think it's, well, I should say to what degree do you think it's ignorance versus intellectual dishonesty? It's very hard to say because there's so many layers of this. It's like, do I think that most of this young students in college who have been indoctrinated with this stuff by their professors and by media and everything, I don't think they're ignorant. I think they've been confused and they've been handed easy answers and then you just swallow easy answers. That being said, I do think that there are leaders of these movements. There are many people in mainstream progressive politics and in mainstream media, you know, MSNBC, CNN, the rest of it, that are forcing really bad ideas down people's throats because they want to control people. I have no interest in controlling people. Whatever you do in your life, as long as you don't come on my property and do it and try to take my rights away, you can do whatever you want. And I really mean that. Like, that's the beauty of America. That is a beautiful, freaking thing. And they don't view the world that way. They view the American experiment as misguided or evil or something like that. I mean, if you were to watch any of the Democratic debates, none of these people are proud to be Americans. No, Bernie. Imagine if they never said words like freedom and liberty. They said constitution once. I remember the one time the one institution was said. It was when Kamala Harris said she was going to do an executive action to take away guns and Biden looks at her and says, well, it has to be constitutional because he's sort of, he's like the last vestige of an old school Democrat, right? And what do you call a Harris do? She looks at him and she laughed in his face. And she said, Joe, can't we just say yes, we can? And what I realized at that moment was, man, Joe, putting aside what your cognitive stuff is and everything else, you're in the wrong room, man. Because the future of this party doesn't care. When you say constitution, they think of that as toilet paper. They don't believe it is good. They don't believe this place is good. I believe this place is good. I believe that is a sacred document. I've got a giant American flag in my control room right there and we've got the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. I'm not just doing it for decorations. It's like, these are the things that freed us, man. And we got a pretty great in America. Yeah, I think if you believe at its fundamental level that it's good, then it's worth salvaging. It's worth fighting for. It's worth taking some risk and some chance. And if you believe at its fundamental level that it's evil and it's wrong and immoral, then of course, the natural response would be to wipe it off the face of the earth. And that is it. They're not proud. Imagine the Bernie crew, the AOC crew, imagine them going up and having to defend America. Like imagine if America was put on trial, right? Like some futuristic dystopian world. And the lawyers for America are Bernie Sanders and AOC. We're getting the electric chair, my friend. We're getting the pretty damn quick. But now, how about we do it the other way? Now we'll take Donald Trump and give me Rand Paul, libertarian. So you have Trump. He's more of a, you know, Trump's hard to totally pin down on what his political ethos is. It's sort of Trumpism. But let's take Trump and Rand Paul, who's the closest thing we have to a true libertarian in the Senate. And you guys could seriously defend America in the court of law. And the other guys would throw America under the bus in a second. You know, I know you talk about so many different things here. You talk about gender and you talk about hate speech and you talk about trans rights. I mean, you talk about everything that you know, you're not supposed to talk about, which is actually why I like the book because it's provocative and it gets you thinking about things that maybe you haven't considered before. You know, what are some of the paths forward, you know, is it trying to find some common ground? Is it trying to, for lack of a better term, convert people to a different perspective? Like, what is the path forward? So I think it sort of depends what your starting point is, right? So if when I wrote this book, the idea was I want, you know, there's a reason that it's this thick. It's about 240 pages. It's not huge. I've got 12 rules for life there. It's about 400 pages. It's dense. You got a right. You can, you know, when I read 12 rules and I love Jordan and I've talked to him a million times, it's like, I was able to read a couple pages and then I'd usually put it down and I'd be like, I'll come back and I'll ponder and really reflect on it. Yeah. And what I tried to do with this was can we, can I give people a book that they can read in a couple of days that gives them some of the tools to think for themselves and then hopefully, your neighbor doesn't have to buy it. Hand them the book or your friend or your brother or your cousin, whatever it is. Hand them the book and go, you know, there's some stuff in here and I guarantee you're going to agree with some of it and disagree with some of it. But there's some interesting things in here. And so when you talk about the path forward, it's like, well, what I would like to do is I want to help convert a lot of the confused lefties into people who love liberty. That would be a great thing. But what I also want to do is I want to take what I call the politically closeted, which I think is the largest political group that we've got right now, the most underserved political group, the amount, the group of people who are good, decent Americans, who I'm sure I have some differences with. But that are afraid to say what they think. And I want to show them that if they don't say what they think, we will lose this thing because there will be people out there who will gladly take away all their freedoms. So you better freakin stand up for it right now. You know, I tell the story in the book, but both of my grandfathers fought in World War II. One of them was a pilot and one of them was a mechanic. It's like, I haven't had to fight an award that we are here on the backs of great men, not because they were great in and of itself, but because they were people of their time who stood up and did what had to be done to fight for freedom. That's what I want people to understand in 2020. If you got this in your pocket, you're not oppressed. That's true. You're not oppressed. And by the way, you got some privilege. It's called American privilege. That's what you got. Well, you know, you talk about privilege. What's interesting, I can't remember who I was talking to just the other day about this. And I said, well, let's just assume for a minute that there is white, you know, male, straight, whatever privilege you want to say that I would fall into, right? But there isn't, by the way, but I'll go on your hypothetical journey. Let's just assume there is. What would you have me do? Like, okay. So therefore, what? What do you want me to do? Like, why wouldn't I take advantage of opportunities, whether I was born with a little bit more intellect than somebody or my mom loved me more than somebody else who didn't grow up in a household with with a loving parent? Like, what do you want me to do about that? It seems to me that you'd want people to take advantage of the opportunities that are presented and do good with those things. Well, if they were to answer you, honestly, if they were a lefty, they'd say bow forever. That's what they would say. Bow forever. You had your time. But none of us are guilty for our parents' sins or our ancestors' sins. Now, nobody in my family owns slaves. But even if someone did, I mean, even if someone did, I wouldn't be guilty because of that. You happen to be a white heterosexual male. Why should anyone hold that against you? Should it be harder for you to get a job because of that? And I think what the left does is they go, well, we want to help these people. But every time you say, I want to help these people, you actually want to punish someone else. But they don't want to think about that. They only want to think that help means help. And that's it. But I have no desire. No one's born with original sin. If a white Christian child is born today, I want him to have the exact same opportunity as the black Muslim child and vice versa, obviously. And the only way that can happen is if you give people equal rights, not if you try to rejigger society in some magical way because you'll always be punishing undeserved people. Yeah, the variable in the equation has to change. So if you're looking at a mathematical equation, if you want to come up with an equal answer, then the variables that go into that equation, they have to change, right? So it means that this value needs to go down, this value needs to go up, and that's what produces the same number at the end. It's the same thing here. It's like a variable has to change. Either the inputs change, which is what we're dealing with, right? You have a different experience, different culture, different beliefs, different thought processes and different experiences than I do, which means that naturally you and I will have a different outcome of our life. Sure. Well, we will and that's beautiful. That's a good thing. It's great. It's great. What a great country we live in. You know, I tell the story briefly in the book about my two best friends growing up. One was Greek, Harry. One was Italian, John. I'm Jewish. We used to. We lived all within three blocks of each other. They'd come to my house for Hanukkah. I did Greek Easter at Harry's house. I did Christmas at John's house. We bounced around. And what we realized over the years, they're still my two best friends to this day now, 40 years later. And what we've realized is, yeah, the foods were different in our houses, right? Like there was a lot of pasta in one. But the traditions, that stuff, it's all actually the same in that we all, our families cared about family. Our families all cared about education, hard work, all of these things. That's such a beautiful thing about America. Like an absolutely beautiful thing. But the idea that that should be our defining thing, that your ethnicity should be your defining thing or your religion or your gender or anything else, it's anti-American. And that's why it's so strange that the people who purport to be the anti-racists are the ones who are constantly injecting race in America. Right. And MLK Jr., what did he want? He didn't want his children to be judged by the color of their skin. Well, who's judging by the color of the skin these days? Is it the conservatives? Not that I see. Is it the libertarians? Definitely not. But who is? It's the progressives everywhere. Constantly. And this is an incredible flip of history. You know, it's interesting. It reminds me of this press conference that Trump had just a couple of days ago. And I assume she's Chinese based on her response. But she asked a question of Trump and he said, ask China. And she said, well, why would you ask me that? She was alluding to the fact that he was being racist. He's like, I'm not telling you, I'm just telling everybody. It seems to me that even her saying that would be more racist than what Trump's actual response was. Right. So then, of course, the media runs with it, that Trump's racist. As if him saying, ask China, he says that to anybody. That's not a new comment of his. He insults Brian Stelter and Jim Acosta, who are white heterosexual, I believe, men. He insults them all day long. He insults everybody. He's an equal opportunity offender. Like, everyone used to have comedians that would offend everybody. Don Rickles, you know, are great. And we gave him permission to do it. What Don Rickles did, and if any of your audience doesn't know Don Rickles, he was one of the great, great stand-ups we've ever had in America. And what he did, he'd go on stage and he'd talk about the Asians and the Jews and the blacks and the Greeks and the gays and the- And what that did was it allowed everyone in the room to realize, I'm part of this thing. I'm part of this great American tapestry. Nobody was left out. He made fun of absolutely everybody. He would have been canceled, obviously, today. The mob would have destroyed him. He passed away about two years ago. But he was a wickedly brilliant comic who did exactly what you're supposed to do in America to say, okay, we've got ten different groups. I'm going to make fun of nine of them. But that one group, they must be protected. Well, what you do is you otherwise that group at that point. And then you're the one that will create this odd prejudice around them or bigotry around them or everything else. We should be making fun of everybody. Hopefully you do it respectfully or with a bit of a sense of humor. But the idea that Trump looked at her and said China, because he's racist, which on top of everything, you know, China is not a race. It's a nationality. It's the race. But I know that that gets lost on a lot of people, but it's just patently absurd. Yeah, I wish we could go back to the days where we collectively as a society gave permission to comedians to talk about anything and everything. I just think that that would ease the tension a little bit because comedians, like yourself included with your background, say the things that most of us don't feel comfortable with, but we're thinking them in our heads. Well, that's the idea, right? Like an outlet. It's like a valve on a pressure cooker. It's like, you be the valve for me because I'm not willing to do it. So you do it. And now we've taken away that. So there's all sorts of pressure that we used to have outlets for to loosely quote Oscar Wilde. If you want to tell people the truth, you better be funny or they'll kill you. And that's what comics do. What did what did our greatest comics do? George Carlin was telling you something true. Mm. Telling you something that he believed through humor and brilliantly linguistic wit. What was Richard Pryor doing? What are the great comics? What is Dave Chappelle doing now? He's telling you something true and he's doing it while making you laugh. That's a beautiful thing. You know, it's funny when, so I did stand up for about 12 years in New York and then now I have other things going on. But I'll, if I have an off night when I was on tour with Jordan or I have a, I'm in a city, if there's a club, you know, we can, I can sell out a club easily now, which is great because I've succeeded in other ways. And I get up there and I really barely have a couple jokes, but I'm basically messing with the crowd the whole time and people show up and, you know, I've had black guys in MAGA hats and then I had this one guy who was a, he had a, he was a white guy with a shaved head. So he sort of looked like he could be a scary neo Nazi and I had them come up on stage with me and hug and people are going crazy and screaming. And the point of it is to show that we're all Americans. We can all get in a room and have two drinks while we used to be able to get in a room. I don't know if we'll. Yeah, not anymore. In LA, maybe not anymore. Under 10 people. Under 10 people and you got to be, you know, 50 yards away from each other. That's right. But, but the idea that we could all get in a room and have a collective experience in the best sense of collectiveness, of not because we're all this or that, but because we're all different and then we can figure out a way to laugh about the crap that's going on in all of our minds. That's a freaking beautiful thing. Yeah. You know, I, I once watched a Joe Rogan perform live and I watched him slaughter a couple of people. That are around the front of the stage and the majority of them were laughing and he was making fun of them and they took it lighthearted. It was fun. And then he got after this group of women. I think there was three of them and I can't remember what the joke was. I can't remember what he was saying. But I remember vividly how personally these women took what he was talking about and they actually left. But it was funny. I'm like, you know, it's not meant with like ill intent. It's, we're all here having a good time. We're having fun. I know it's hard maybe to be the butt of a joke, but I really think we shouldn't take ourselves so seriously. Of course we shouldn't. I'll tell you, can I curse? I can curse. Yeah, go ahead. We're on the internet. For sure. So I'm doing stand up about a year ago. I think I was in Oxnard, California and I'm shooting the shit with the crowd. I do a little. So I basically do stand up for an hour and then I do like a Q and A thing and I'm doing the Q and A. And this guy in the back, I can't really see him because the lights are very bright, but he yells out that he goes, Dave, I just got divorced and it's because of you. And I was like, well, what? And the crowd laughs and I go, well, what are you talking about? He says, well, I started waking up to politics and I wasn't a lefty anymore. And my wife was like a crazy lefty and you know, that we got divorced. And I was like, I pause and I was like, well, fuck her. And that's like the crowd went completely crazy. Of course. The guy, all of his friends, like, now, I don't know this woman. She could be a perfectly nice woman. I don't mean it to degrade her anything, but it's like, there was a funny moment in there of just like, dude, I'm on your side. You know, we're all this room. We're all there together. And by the way, when I toured with Jordan, I was basically doing stand up. So I would do about 15 minutes, get the crowd laugh. And then they'd listen to an hour and a half of Jordan. And you know, Jordan, this is fire and brimstone stuff. Oh, no doubt. This is serious stuff. I think over time, you know, he would tell me this. He would incorporate a little more humor because he could see how, you know, I was able to get the crowd to sort of have a certain emotion and he would like to play with that a little bit. But you need that. You need that because he would say to me, because there were a few shows that I missed on the tour if I had other engagement. And he would always email me after the show and say, Dave, I enjoy the show is much more when you're there. And the reason for that was if you do a fire and brimstone speech about fixing your life and there's no relief at the end. When those people walk out of that theater, it's like, yeah, you were handed something powerful and deep, but you also need to breathe. It's what you said. You need to let that open the gasket, let off some of that steam. So I was always very aware of that. I'm going to start this thing with humor. Jordan's going to plow through with truth and, you know, I would always tell him if we had a great show, I'd say Jordan, that felt thick. And what I always meant was it was like it was like walking through like molasses because it's tough. You got to walk him through the swamp on a, you know, I've been to other public speakers where it's like, they're not really saying anything. So it's just like walking through paper. Right. But then I would always be sure at the end when we do the Q and A, I want those people to end with a laugh. So I tried to make sure every show ended with a laugh and then it's like they can walk out there and they go, you know, I learned something, but I did laugh too. And that's pretty great. Yeah, it's hot. You know, it's really hard when you have a time like this where I do realize there's a lot of people who are having difficult circumstances. People are out of work and they're concerned and they're fearful. But I do believe that that part of the remedy anyways is let's lighten up, let's help each other out, let's have some fun to the degree that we can, let's support each other and, and, and not be so upset about things that, frankly, we just shouldn't be upset about. Look, and even if we should be upset about them, that that still isn't a reason to be perpetually upset about them. Right? Like you could be going through a seriously, you could be going through a seriously tough time right now. You know, I have no doubt that people are. I've tried to help some people in my personal life. You know, I'm doing pretty okay here. So I don't have anything to complain about, you know, beyond that I would like us to be freer, but I mean in my immediate life. But, you know, the idea that we shouldn't joke in the midst of this is like, that's, that's not what humans do. We need it, man. We need it. Yeah. You know, I remember my wife's grandfather's funeral and it was really like the first funeral that I, that I like really like vividly remember and like was cognizant and aware of. And I was really taken back at first because they were telling jokes about grandpa. And I was like, whoa, wait, like, just cool. Like I were, we're making fun of the deceased here. But it just, it wasn't, it was honoring, right? It was like remembering good times and having fun with it. And it was lighthearted. And it was honoring more than it was meant to be some sort of dishonor to him and what he meant in their lives. The beautiful thing. Beautiful thing. My concern, if I have a concern about this book and for you, my concern is that the only people will read this is the people who maybe don't actually necessarily need to read it. You know what I'm saying? Well, look, obviously most of the people who read the book are going to be right leaning, but those right leaning people, a lot of them are in that political closet. So if I'm able to give them enough of, you know, juice them up enough to start speaking their minds, then I've done something right. As for the, as for the lefties that should read the book, that's a bigger lift, right? Because, you know, they're just going to say all those terrible things about me and read, read the swarmed reviews and whatever. That's a tougher crowd to get into, but I'm working on it. But in terms of getting people on the right to be proud of who they are and stand up for what they believe in, I think that's where I can do the most good work at the moment. Yeah, I think there is a, it's the vocal minority, right? It really to me is the minority who's squawking, who's making the loudest noise. And if the majority of us would step up, and it's hard because, you know, you hear things and I believe this, you know, the majority of us are, have our heads down. We're working, we're leading our families, we're engaged in our communities. And so it's like, I don't want anything to do with that. But yeah, it's about time we start to step into this realm and open our mouths and become the vocal majority. Or don't and see what happens. Guess what? It will not end well, right? I mean, I just did a PragerU video two or three weeks ago called the bravery deficit. And one of the things I talk about is, I think a lot of good people think they can just, you know, duck their head, lower the cap. I'll make it through, I'll make it through. They'll take out everybody else, I'll make it through. No, no, that's not how it works. Frog in a pot. We all know the metaphor. Does not end well for the frog. Yeah. Well, Dave, I appreciate you joining us. I really enjoyed the book. I read a little bit of it. And this was kind of last notice getting together. So I listened to a lot of it, which I actually enjoyed hearing you read the words, which was really good as well. Yeah. So I want to ask you a couple of questions that we wind down. The first one I did let you know. What does it mean to be a man? Find purpose. That's it. Find purpose that, you know, when people talk about that we have a crisis of manhood or that, you know, young men are angry or lost or all of this stuff. It's because something happened related to purpose to, it doesn't, you have to find what your purpose is, something that gives you passion so that when you wake up in the morning, you've got something to do. You know, all I started doing was saying what I thought. And then as I started doing it, more and more people started listening and then I kept doing it more and then suddenly I had a book deal and I had a successful show. And now I don't have a free minute in my day. And that sort of thing is incredible because I wake up every day with purpose. I'm on a mission in life. I think that is what it means to be a man. Then hopefully once you do that, then the other things that you hopefully want, whether that's to be married and have kids and build a family and own property and all of those things, I think all of those things will come. But, you know, this is like a semi-jordan version of it, but like find that star, whatever that thing is somewhere in the world, you want something in this life. Find that thing, man, and start going to it and see what happens. And if you do that, I think you'll become a better man. And the reason I say that is I am not a perfect man, but I am a way better man right now than I've ever been. Yeah, that's awesome. It's very similar to what I believe about what we've been doing here is, you know, one day it was just, hey, here's a Facebook post about something I believe about what it means to be a dad. You know, the next day it's, here's what I think about what it means to be a husband and where I've fallen short. And then, you know, five years later, here we are having these kind of conversations. It's a very cool thing. You never know what it's going to take you. You put yourself out there and then, holy cow, other people go, whoa, I'm thinking something like that too. And then suddenly that spreads and that spreads and that spreads. And you have no idea what you could do to the world. You have no idea. Well, I know you're a busy man. I'll let you get to it. I'm sure you've got a lot of other interviews and things that got to get done. Where should I send the guys to connect with you? Obviously to pick up a copy of the book and all that stuff. Yeah, yeah. So they can go to don'tburnthisbook.com where they can get it on Amazon, Barnes & Nobles, anywhere else at RubenReport.com or all the other good stuff. Excellent. We'll sync it all up. I appreciate you, Dave. You're doing great work. I don't need to tell you that, but it has been impactful in my life and I'm anxious to share this with the people who listen. I enjoyed it. Make sure to tag me and we'll spread it around. Thanks, brother. Gentlemen, there you go. My conversation with the one and only Dave Rubin. I hope that you enjoyed it. It is my hope that you're walking away with some new information. And I'm not asking that you agree with everything. I just ask that you question what you think, that you challenge what you believe and ask if there's a new way of looking at information and circumstances and topics that are some of the most polarizing divisive conversations and subjects that we've been addressing over the past several years, not only in this podcast, but society in general. So I'd also encourage you to pick up a copy of Don't Burn This Book. Very, very fascinating read. Very quick read, efficiently read. It's good. It's got a great information. It talks about all of the things that most people are unwilling to or afraid of talking about, which is the kind of conversations I want to have here. And that's the beauty and the power of the podcast is that we can talk about anything that we want. Now, I'm sure I'll get a bunch of hate mail for having Dave on the podcast, but that's part of the deal. If you're going to have difficult conversations, then lots of people aren't going to agree and that's actually part of the fun. And it leads to better conclusions having these types of conversations. So anyways, pick up a copy of the book. Again, Don't Burn This Book. Connect with Dave on his socials. Connect with me. Let me know what you thought about the show. Good, bad, and different. And let's keep the conversation going. I've got an incredible lineup of men who will continue to join us. I've been swinging for the fences on podcast guests these days. So you're going to see some very fascinating men come up in the conversation. And if you have suggestions or introductions, then please feel free to reach out to me as well. Guys, on a parting note, just make sure you share the episode, share the show, leave a rating and review. Do your part. All right. I'm trying to put out great information for you. Trying to make this available. Trying to lift us all up and become this go-to resource for men. Your part in the equation is to share it. That's all. That's all I ask of you. Share it. Take two minutes. Leave a rating and review. Not a whole lot to ask. And it goes a long way in promoting what we're doing. All right, guys, we'll be back tomorrow for the Ask Me Anything with Mr. Kip Sorensen. But until then, go out there. Take action and become the man you are meant to be. Thank you for listening to the Order of Man podcast. You're ready to take charge of your life and be more of the man you were meant to be. We invite you to join the Order at OrderOfMan.com."
