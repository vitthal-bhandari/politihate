    "text": " Welcome to Pate of the World, I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. Ben, you're in London. Did you happen to catch the Jets game last night? Mercifully, I went to bed, very excited to wake up and see what had happened with the Aaron Rodgers era. The first thing I woke to was our text chain with Cody Keated being like, oh man, Rhodes, I hope we didn't see that. And I was like, oh no, what happened? And then of course I saw that two plays any towards Achilles. Yeah, for those who don't watch the NFL, Ben's beloved, New York Jets got arguably the best quarterback and not the best quarter. One of the best top three quarterbacks in football, no offense, Patrick Mahomes, and he tore his Achilles on the fourth play, fifth play, not ideal. So this is a very Jets situation. Very Jets situation. But it's good that you were in Woody Johnson's former Stompagrams, a Jets owner, Maga Chud. Yeah, it's better that he's not the ambassador here. I'd rather that than have healthier and writers have to say that. Yeah, that's true. Well, listen, Ben's sadness around sports society. We've got a great trip for you today. We just wrapped an interview with President Biden, Secretary of State, Tony Blinken. You'll hear him talk about Ukraine. I talk about a big speech Tony's given this week. Talk about sort of views in the global south of the G20 of the United States. We talk about a potential US, Saudi, Israel, normalization deal. So a lot of ground covered there. And then Ben and I are going to talk about the latest from Russia and Ukraine, Armenia and Azerbaijan. A bunch of interesting updates about China, the politics of presidential travel, some good news out of Mexico, the tragic earthquake in Morocco, and then an update on everyone's least favorite soccer asshole in Spain. And then two quick things before you get to the news. So we haven't asked for this in a while, but like if you guys like the show, if you enjoy it, please rate and review it in the old iTunes story. It really helps people find the show. It helps us grow. Share it with your friends. Maybe subscribe to the YouTube. Also, if you're a midwesterner, get your molart out because love it or leave it is coming to Chicago on September 21st and Madison on September 22nd. They got all kinds of great guests. Tickets are going fast. If you go to crooked.com slash events, you can buy them. Love it's also going to cities like Louisville, San Diego, San Jose, Washington, D.C. in New Orleans. Again, crooked.com slash events. Okay. So Russia, Ukraine. We asked Tony some of the big picture strategy questions later in the show, so stick around for that. But some updates that are new this week. The first is that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has arrived in Russia for talks with Vladimir Putin. Kim was reportedly accompanied by one of his goons in charge of munitions policies and then two other goons in charge of acquiring space satellites and nuclear-capable submarines. So no real secret here, Ben, about what the topics are of this meeting. Republicans are highlighting the fact that the U.S. has officially spent more than 100 billion on the war in Ukraine. So according to a Fox News exclusive, but this obviously comes as Biden is looking to get more funding out of Congress. In Russia, Putin was at an economic conference in Vladivostok. Tuesday, he gave a speech where he said the criminal case against Trump is an indication of the, quote, rottenness of the American political system. He praised Elon Musk and claimed that 270,000 Russians have voluntarily signed up for military service in the past six or seven months. So a couple of parts trolling, a couple of parts, military industrial complex trumpeting there, Ben. And then Russia also held some regional municipal elections recently, giant air quotes around elections there, by the way. In territory, they annexed from Ukraine. Big surprise, the pro-Putin Party won. ABC News reported that poll workers were going to voters' houses with, like, literally armed soldiers, detaining people who wouldn't vote. And then lastly, Ben, the merchant of death is getting into politics. Listeners might remember Viktor Boot. He's the Russian arms dealer who has returned to Russia in a prisoner swap for a WNBA player, Ritney Greiner. Boot is now standing in election in the town about 450 miles east of Moscow that was Vladimir Lenin's birthplace. So some sad news there, Ben. I think we both had hoped that Viktor Boot would make something of his life after getting out of prison, but instead he got involved in politics. So here we are. Yeah, no surprise there. These guys, other than progression, a lot of these guys have second lives. But obviously getting to some of the stuff with Tony, the Kim Jong Un stuff is really worrisome. I mean, the Russians have a lot that they can provide here in terms of long-range missile technology, satellite technology. So hopefully we'll have a read on exactly what happens. That may take intelligence and may not be something we know. That's a big question I have coming out of this is just like, are we going to have any sense of what the Russians might be doing in exchange for the same edition? The only other thing that really stands out to me, Tommy, beyond what we're getting to with Tony, is this Putin comment about Trump really echoing Trump's points, right? And then the comment clearly meant to appeal to Elon Musk's vanity. I think it's a little appetizer, if you will, for how much the Russians are probably going to want to get involved in our politics. It's existential for them. If Trump's elected, the US support for Ukraine ceases. I think we should anticipate that. So just think about what the stakes are for Vladimir Putin. And so I think we should all prepare ourselves. This has not been discussed much. Trump has kind of made people weary about talking about Russian interference. But this is an indication of what's to come. Yeah, it really is. And the conflict is binary for Putin. If Biden is around, there'll be much more support for Ukraine. If he's not, or really any of these Republicans come in, support for Ukraine will probably go away. You're right. And by the way, there's a trend of Russians convicted of crimes abroad coming back home and getting it to politics. It was the former KGB guy accused of murdering a Russian defector in the UK. He joined the Duma. There was Maria Butina about Russian gun rights activists that got swirled up in the NRA here in the US. And accused of being a spy. She also joined the Duma. So it's a proud legacy there for our friend Viktor Butte. Then a little good news about the ongoing dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan and the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. So Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan. But the area is ethnically Armenian. And for a long time was basically governed by pro-Armenian separatist groups. That situation on the ground changed in 2020 when Azerbaijan won back a bunch of territory in a war. And more recently, people have been quite concerned about Azerbaijan blockading the only road linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh because it was causing a humanitarian crisis. There are reports today that say Azerbaijan and Armenia have cut a deal to reopen that road, which is obviously a good thing for humanitarian reasons. But the geopolitics of the Russian invasion of Ukraine really flow into Armenia and Azerbaijan as well. Historically speaking, Armenia has been an ally of Russia. That seems to be changing maybe. On Monday, Armenia participated in a joint military exercise with the United States. And Armenia's first lady visited Ukraine recently to deliver aid. So I'm just curious, Ben. If you're Putin, would you be happy upgrading relations with North Korea while losing Armenia as an ally? Or does this feel like a shrinking world for him? Well, I think the reality is that there used to be these Russian peacekeepers who were charged with being in that region to help manage things like the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. And they were obviously pulled out because Russians need all the troops they can get. And the Russians weren't willing to lean on Azerbaijan or Turkey, which is very close Azerbaijan to help resolve what was really a humanitarian crisis and a warning of genocide by leading voices on these issues in the international community. I think it clearly shows a diminishing role for Russia in that part of the Caucasus, where Turkey might have more influence, right? Or Azerbaijan is reflecting its muscles more. I think a key lesson here is I have to think that this is no way resolved. There's a lot of threat to the people who are still very vulnerable in Nagorno-Karabakh. But if there has been incremental progress, it's because I think there's been greater attention on this. And I think the Armenian American community in this country has raised a lot of noise, but so increasingly, has there been diplomatic pressure, diplomatic attention on this? I think the lesson here is Russia is playing less of a role here. But to prevent that from backing from being filled by Azerbaijan, trying to swallow up this territory and the people in it, it's going to take a lot of diplomatic attention from a lot of countries, including the United States and Europe. Yeah, I think Tony actually was making some call to over the weekend about this, trying to help get it resolved too. Let's switch to China, because we were talking a lot about China and its economic challenges lately. If you want more detail of the last episode you did with Max when I was out, had a great overview. But I think one question we've asked ourselves, Ben, and we've asked some of our guests like her Campbell a couple of weeks ago is whether they think that China's economic problems make it more or less likely to invade Taiwan. President Biden gave us the clearest answer we've heard during his press conference in Vietnam. Let's listen. It's going to cause China to invade Taiwan. As a matter of fact, the opposite probably doesn't have the same capacity that it had before. So you know, interesting and much more direct and I guess reassuring then. More broadly though, the trajectory for US-China relations is pretty rocky. No official announcement was released, but there have been reports about directives to Chinese government employees and state-owned companies ordering them to use domestic phone brands instead of Apple products. This comes as the Chinese tech giant Huawei released its new phone that's supposed to be an iPhone competitor. The US has repeatedly warned about Huawei's connections to the Chinese military. Now this ban, you know, the potential ban of Chinese government officials from owning Apple phones could be like the tit for tat for the US banning TikTok, but it spooked the hell out of Wall Street. And people started to wonder if Apple could get caught in an economic war and the stock price dropped 6% I think of the day. And then finally, there was a report in the Times that was interesting worth reading, which is one that talked about how China is getting into the disinformation game even in deeper and used artificial intelligence programs to sell a narrative that the wildfires and Maui were started by a secret American weather weapon. Previously most of China's disinformation has focused on core issues like Taiwan. So this feels new and troubling. But Ben, what did you make of that Biden assessment at the top about the likelihood of a Taiwan invasion and then just sort of this broader trajectory in this economic war that's going? I mean, first of all, I have to say it's I don't think this much gained from commenting on like I look, I understand I'm always some of that depulsion is actually going to answer the question. That's usually a good, good thing. But in this case, well, at the end of the day, the only person who knows the answer to that question is Xi Jinping. I mean, their economy could be great or it could be bad. It's in what that guy's head is going to determine what happens here. And so I don't think it has impact in the real world per se. I just think we don't necessarily know because they do have a significant military capability and the current state of their economy unless it really falls off a cliff. I'm not sure it cripples our capacity to do something. I think that the the the Huawei piece, it feels like them hitting back at us for what have been really big export controls, you know, limits on technology going in. And that speaks to kind of the separation is taking place between the US and China and supply chains and particular technology, which is, you know, I think creates more vulnerabilities for them than us, but it does create vulnerabilities for us too. And I think it raises this question of how far does this escalation go in both directions, because if it goes all the way, you know, in terms of the tech space, well, that's a big deal for like an Apple and they make sure iPhones in China. So it's a reminder that there is risk for us. I think there's probably greater risk for for the Chinese in the score, though, and it may account for them being a little more aggressive in the disinformation space. They may see that this is a more existential conflict for them than just kind of a Taiwan issue. They're doing now kind of Russia style stuff for their creating divisions in the United States. And that that shows them kind of getting ready for a pretty long conflict. Yeah, the the the potential iPhone Dan on government employees did seem like a bit of a tit for TAT type response. I mean, certainly China could decide to fuck with Apple, fuck with their manufacturing and the crown jewel of the US economy. But I think that would have massive ramifications for any company in China. But then on this disinformation story in the New York Times, I just want to read one paragraph to you, which is it said, it's a quote, if China does engage in influence operations for the election next year, US intelligence officials have assessed in recent months, it's likely to try to diminish President Biden and raise the profile of former president Donald J. Trump. While that may seem counterintuitive to Americans who remember Mr. Trump's effort to blame Beijing for what he called the China virus, the intelligence officials have concluded that Chinese leaders prefer Mr. Trump. He's called for pulling Americans out of Japan, South Korea and other parts of Asia, while Mr. Biden has cut off China's access to the most advanced chips and the equipment made to produce them. Sounds right, but very interesting and kind of surprising to me that the intelligences would brief that. Yeah, but there's no question. I don't think this is a close call. You know, there's no way that Donald Trump cares about Taiwan. You know, he insulted Taiwan when he was asked about it, right? He said they stole the chips or something. This trade war was this kind of half-assed thing, trying to get the Chinese to buy soy beans, whereas the Biden administration is like literally choking off investment and tech inputs in the Chinese economy. And frankly, just Trump's embarrassing reality of Donald Trump, discredits democracy and opens up a huge space for China to kind of move forward with a parallel world order that eclipses what the United States is doing. All those alliances that the United States is trying to reinforce under Biden get on rocky waters if Trump is back. So I think this is not much of a question. I think it reminds us so. Like we just talked about Putin running to be involved in selection. Like Russia and China decide they really want Donald Trump back in there and they both have good reasons for that. We could be seeing things in this election that go beyond even what we saw in 2016. Yeah, it's going to be a nightmare. Also, Ben, I know you're in the UK. There have been these allegations recently that a researcher working in parliament on China policy was actually a foreign agent spying for China. It's led to a bit of a freak out. I think two men have been arrested both deny they were spying. But the government is making changes. The British government is making changes for the first time, making it illegal to be an undercover spy. And then I think creating sort of a version of America's Foreign Agent Registration Act. Xi Sunak said he raised this issue of this spy in parliament with Chinese officials in the G20. But interesting to watch them kind of go through this news cycle. Yeah, it's a massive story here, by the way. Like this is like a huge story broke when I was here. A lot of discussion about it. I saw our friend David Lamy. He was on it. Very alarmed by it. And I think it speaks to like a much more aggressive, you know, we've seen the Chinese government do this versions of this in places like Australia. We've seen them try to project influence into Canada. I think it just shows that they're getting very aggressive. And this is someone like, you know, this is basically the time of the equivalent of someone who's a Hill staff, like a junior congressional staffer with access to some secure information, right? I mean, this is not just a small piece of business. And this is the pattern that we were seeing. We had the arrests in the United States of people who worked on military facilities, you know, enlisted people in San Diego. So I just think, you know, this is a pattern where governments are going to have the Chinese aren't going to stop doing it because Rishi Sunac raised it with G20 officials. No, you're going to. This is going to have to be about defense more than warning the Chinese off of it. Yeah, getting a stern warning from Rishi Sunac. I'm not going to do that. Rishi Sunac. Yeah. It was for anybody. So Ben, speaking of China, President Biden just finished this five day swing to Asia. He went to the G20 in India. They pushed through some important developments and reforms to multinational development banks, like the World Bank. It's a big deal for these low and middle income countries and it helps the US counter China's investments through the Belt and Road Initiative. Biden also went to Hanoi where the US upgraded relations with Vietnam. Again, a big deal in its own right and a reminder to the Chinese that we're a Pacific power that we have alliances around them, et cetera. I will say that human rights groups were not entirely thrilled about the trip. They wanted to see Biden press Vietnam much harder on human rights issues. There were also some reports in the Wall Street Journal of the potential US Saudi deal to extract rare earth minerals from African countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo. That combo makes my skin crawl. But Ben, the big story out of this trip, of course, wasn't the substance as it never was for us on our foreign trips. It was about how Biden ended his press conference in Hanoi, maybe a little weirdly. He said I'm going to bed, which in my view is not a weird thing to say at 10.15 p.m. at night when the press conference ended. But it led to a question I have for you, which is, first of all, feel free to discuss any of the substantive stuff from the trip. But also second, it's clear that the Biden team thinks that one way to push back on concerns about his age is to talk about these foreign trips. Their first campaign ad is about Biden's trip to Ukraine. We both know how hard it is to get coverage of foreign trips back in the US to the extent you do. It's usually about some political news of the day and not what you're actually doing. What do you think about the political value of images and coverage of these foreign trips for Joe Biden? I think, look, first of all, there's nothing new here. We both dealt with this. We could go on and on about all the times that Obama's... We yelled at the press because they weren't covering substance because one time Obama bowed his head a tiny bit to the Japanese emperor in a five-day trip to Asia. It became about him bowing in the wrong way. President Obama used to get really annoyed and he'd take it out on his press staff. You and I probably both got some of that because he was pissed that they didn't cover the G20 communique or something because they were focused on some optics issue back home. This happens to everybody. This is not unique to Joe Biden, but I'm sympathetic to him. I think that however you can make it work for you, look, they're not going to cover the communique. There are some important things in the G20 communique. Financing for the World Bank is really important to make a lot of progress in development, but that's not the kind of stuff that people are going to talk about on cable television or even necessarily write about. Where you can break through is kind of iconic shots. You give a speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. You address a large crowd in foreign country. You take a train to Ukraine as President Biden did. I think one thing you have to consider is just going to the summit and giving a press conference is a way to guarantee that you won't get your message out because they don't care about the summit communique and they're going to use the press conference to ask you a bunch of questions that are probably unrelated to the things you want to talk about. I think the way to make it work and frankly, the ads that they've run show that when you're out there in an iconic position filling the role of the American presidency, that breaks through. Those images do break through back home because people want to be proud of their present. They want to see their present out there doing work and kind of inspiring people or standing up to dictators. That's the way to make the politics of foreign travel work. You're always going to be on defense at the summit press conference. Yeah, no. That's your press conference is never a great place to deliver your message. Speaking of iconic moments in presidential speeches, here's another quick clip. I couldn't imagine somebody like Osama bin Laden understanding the joy of Hanukkah. That's George W. Bush. We saw that on Twitter this morning and it made us laugh. It is funny though, we're in this giant debate about, oh, did Biden have a gaff? Is he too old? Is Trump too old? Like, hey, George W. Bush was pretty young and pretty fucking stupid and said crazy stuff all the time like Osama bin Laden not enjoying Hanukkah. So maybe we can recirculate some of those. Well, he might have a point though. I don't think bin Laden was that right. I mean, just straight, we're going to substance, not optics, right? I mean, I don't think bin Laden was in Hanukkah. Have you ever seen a mess? His loss, his loss. I never saw him light a man or I never, but that's one of the reasons why I didn't end well for him. Okay, let's turn to our hemisphere because there's some good news out of Mexico. We're the country's Supreme Court decriminalized abortion last week. Mexico's congressional chambers were ordered to remove any criminal penalties for abortion from Mexican law by the end of its current legislative session. This ruling lays the foundation for Mexico to begin providing abortion services and broad and access dramatically, but that doesn't mean abortion services will now be readily available. Basically, the federal public health system allowing abortion services to happen is very different than actually providing them. In the past, the health system has only been legally allowed to provide abortions in cases of rape or to preserve the mother's health. Mexico is also likely to get its first female president in its 2024 election. As the ruling marina party announced that Claudia Shinebaum will be its nominee, she'll be facing off against the opposition coalition's nominee. Also, Chitel G\u00e1vez, who's also a woman. They are both socially progressive. They support decriminalizing abortion rights. They're vying to succeed. President Andres Menwell Lopez-Obrador, he is required to step down next year per the law because he can't seek another term. He says he doesn't want any influence in politics going forward and will step away completely. He considered me very skeptical of that then. Ben, it's great to see Mexico taking these steps forward on gender equity, but it is also just very depressingly highlights the ways the US is backsliding constantly. Yeah, and first of all, congratulations, everybody who's worked for this for a long time in Mexico. The reality is, yeah, deeply Catholic country in Mexico. I mean, obviously not everybody, but deeply established Catholic church. Taking the opposite direction in the United States, going to have a female president before we do. They're leaning on this and I wish we would move it in similar direction here. I share your skepticism. I think almost party will be favored and I think it will continue to be quite powerful. But it doesn't diminish the importance of if they do break that gloss ceiling and certainly doesn't diminish the importance of the breakthroughs on an abortion rights. Yeah. One story that's just worth flagging for folks in New York Times did a long piece on this decades old mystery of what happened to 43 college students who went missing in 2014. It turns out they were shot at by police. The cops then handed them over to drug cartels who murdered them on their behalf. But the broader story is about the depth of corruption and inclusion between Mexican officials, the military, the police, lawmakers and drug cartels. So it's very, very worth your time and worth reading because it is appalling and sort of what we're dealing with in terms of the cartels down in Mexico, where all the Republicans want to invade now, I guess, or bomb them in some form or fashion. Yeah, that's where we're going. That's where we're at. It's a couple more things here. So I was off last week because I was in Morocco at a friend's wedding. Marrakesh is an insane choice for a venue for an LA based friend group destination wedding. But once we got there, it was very clear why my buddy Josh wanted to get married in Marrakesh. It's a beautiful city. We explored it. We went out to the desert. That's not incredible people. It's just like a life changing experience. It was because of that experience, it was extra heartbreaking to see the earthquake in the reports now today of like 2,900 deaths from this earthquake last Friday. Marrakesh is a very old city. The sort of inner walls are from the 12th century. A lot of those walls came down. We're one of the biggest mosque, iconic mosque in the city. What was damaged, this situation in the death toll is far, far worse in rural areas where a lot of the homes are just the clay and mud and bricks and people are crushed and there's been no effort to help them yet. I mean, the government response has been slow and insufficient and this will be a very long painful recovery. So basically just wanted to raise it to say, you know, if you're considering charitable donations, this is a great place to help out. Consider Morocco, especially charities that are run by Marrakesh. If you're on Twitter, check out at foodbank, M-A-R-O-C. That's at foodbank, M-A-R-O-C. That's a handle for a local food bank that some folks told us about when the wedding party was trying to figure out how to help out. USAID has great options listed on their website. We'll put that in the show notes. I donated an organization called Give to Wreckly, which is an international organization, but I think what's great about them is they just give people cash, which is usually what you need in a situation like this. So there's a lot of really horrible things happening right now. I was just reading Ben about how there's 2,000 people reportedly dead and 10,000 missing after flooding in Libya. So there's a massive need everywhere. So I just wanted to flag both. Yeah. No, and I think the local charity's point is well taken. And so is this cash point. I mean, oftentimes the international community is trying to figure out the needs and what is needed. And it's hard to move certain resources down there, but a lot of the time people need this cash and they can make decisions for themselves. And if they're desperate, they're going to spend it on what they need. Or that's shelter, food, whatever. So people should definitely look for ways to provide support. Yeah. A quick update on soccer in Spain. A couple of weeks back, we talked about Luis Rujales, the head of the Spanish Soccer Federation. He's the guy who kissed a player named Jenny Hermoso on the lips after her team won the Women's World Cup. That kiss was not welcomed. It was not consensual. It set up this firestorm of criticism. A lot of people were calling on him to leave, including many of the players, elected officials in Spain, but he dug in his heels for a while. The good news as of this recording is that after weeks of pressure, Rujales finally resigned. This was far from his first scandal. He was accused of hosting orgies with Soccer Federation money. By the way, his uncle was the one who made those accusations. So this was not some crazy source. But then so obviously good news. It is worth hearing a quick clip from Rujales from Pierce Morgan's show of all places where he went to sort of announce his retirement. About Maricine Nation, yes, I'm going to do. I'm going to result. Yeah, I'm going to, yes, because I cannot continue my work. What was the final moment for you? Was it talking to your family, your dad perhaps? Yeah, my father, my daughters, I spoke with them. They know it's not a question about me and some friends, very close to me. And they say to me, Luis, now, you have to focus in your dignity and to continue your life. Because if you know probably you are going to that much people you love on the sport you love. Didn't hear a lot of apologizing there, but it didn't. He sounds a little bit like you might think he's a victim, but I guess it's good that he's gone. Yeah, auditioning for like a very low listenership podcast where he can vent against a real mind virus and things like that. Goodman, Zach, I've chastened by the women of Spain, particularly the women on the soccer gym. So there is occasionally justice in this world. Yeah, he'll definitely launch a soccer show on X that Elon will say has like a trillion views. A couple of dumb things before we get to Tony's interview. So a Florida man, of course, was arrested after trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a vessel that is basically a floating hamster wheel. So he would run in this thing and it would turn and that would propel him east, I guess. A 44 year old Reza Balucci was intercepted 70 miles off the coast of Georgia, the state of Georgia. According to BBC News, he has tried to make journeys like this three times before. Every time he gets intercepted and picked up by the Coast Guard. This guy was so pissed. He got picked up this time that he refused to get out of his hamster wheel for three days. And at one point, he even claimed there was a bomb on board. And in 2021, he tried to drive a similar hamster wheel from Florida to New York via the ocean. He said it was for charity, but he ended up 30 miles south of where he started. So apparently he's not very good at driving this thing. It seems like a good thing that the Coast Guard keeps rescuing this guy from himself. But I do wonder at some point when they're going to be like, okay, buddy, like go with God, see you in London or never. Yeah, or like a very large like, you know, sea creature comes up and mistakes and for a hamster, right? Yeah, they'd be probably pretty tasty. Yeah, probably look pretty tasty out there. Speaking of tragedies, Ben, residents of a small Portuguese village woke up this weekend to a river of nearly 600,000 gallons of wine flowing down their streets after two tanks at a local distillery burst. Nobody was hurt. Local firefighters were able to prevent the wine from flowing into a river at a lake and sort of messing up the local ecosystem there. It turns out a bunch of European countries are trying to figure out how to manage a big wine surplus. I've heard there's a lack of demand in France, Spain, and Italy. This wine in particular that got spilled in Portugal was going to be distilled into other products and owners are going to drink it necessarily. This is all from a great report in the Washington Post. But Ben, you're in Europe now. Yeah. Do you think you should do your part? Yeah, I was actually kind of calculating my head how long it is to get to Portugal. I'm actually going to be in France tomorrow. So I'm going to try to make a dent on this. If anybody wants to ship some of that wine over to the Kruger Media HQ, we'd also be willing to help you take that off your hands. We will drink it before we do our part. For international cooperation. Yeah. Whatever it takes to help out the people of Portugal in 2020, a 97,000 gallon winery tank burst open in Sonoma and flooded the Russian River Valley. So it seems like this is an ongoing issue. I guess that's enough wine stats for you guys. We're going to take a quick break and we come back. You'll hear our interview with Secretary of State, Tony Blinken. So stick around for that. Today we are thrilled to have the US Secretary of State, our friend, Tony Blinken, on the show. He is fresh off visits to Ukraine. Fresh off visits to India. It's a trip out fresh. India for the G20, Vietnam. Tony, great to see you. Tommy. Great to be with you. Thanks for having me. So Tony, I wanted to kick this off. I know the day this airs, there'll be a speech that you're giving. And I know it's been part intended to kind of step back and give a broader look at the Biden administration's foreign policy. But the way I wanted to ask this question is essentially even people following us closely. They see the war in Ukraine. They see a lot of hot spots that flare up that you have to rush to and deal with. Even people that listen to this podcast follow things pretty closely are probably having trouble trying to make sense of what is this moment that we're in. And you've been in multiple administrations, a Clinton administration after the end of the Cold War, the Obama administration after the financial crisis. This is obviously a different kind of moment. What would you say to people who are trying to make sense of this? What is the moment that we're in geopolitically? And how is your job different today than it would have been in the Obama administration and the Clinton administration? So Ben, I think as we're looking at it, we really see this moment as an inflection point, by which I mean this. We've all been living through, working through what was called the post-Cold War era. And as we see it, that era has come to an end. And there's an intense competition on to shape what comes next. And we're seeing that in a couple of ways. We're seeing that with this renewed, but also in many ways new, great power rivalry and competition. We're also seeing it though, with a whole host of profound transnational challenges that are putting new and extraordinary demands on governments and international organizations, much more so than ever before. Whether it's climate, whether it's mass migration, whether it's the food insecurity that we're seeing, energy challenges, emerging technologies. And for a variety of reasons, we've come to a moment where so many of the benefits that we thought would accrue from the end of the Cold War, benefits which in many ways we saw, but not to the extent and not with the durability that we hoped, we're seeing that in many ways being questioned and come to an end. And we are engaged heavily in how we shape the next period of time in a way that reflects what we want to achieve, which is, broadly speaking, a world that's free, that's open, that's secure, that's prosperous, that's connected. And the importance of an inflection point moment, and I'll stop with that, is that almost by definition, you get to one of those moments and they come around every six or seven generations. The decisions that we make now, the way we organize ourselves at home, the way we organize ourselves in the world, are likely to shape what things look like, not just for the next few years, but for the next decades. We believe we're at that kind of moment. Tony, one of the big inbox issues for you guys lately has been Ukraine. You just got back from your third trip, I believe, since the war started. It's been raging for a year and a half. The US has provided an enormous amount of assistance to Ukraine. I think I read today that the number has topped $100 billion. Ben and I watched the Republican primary foreign policy debates very closely. And the arguments are generally against US support for Ukraine and they're very simple and they're very clear. It's like we should be spending that money here, we should be securing our border here. The risk of escalation with Russia is constant if not growing. I even hear supporters of the US, the war effort in Ukraine saying, our message is more complicated. We don't know what success looks like. We don't know what the endgame is. We're worried about the counter-offensive, maybe stalling or struggling. We're worried about there not being public peace talks. I was just wondering if you could help the listeners understand what our core objectives are in Ukraine and what success looks like so they can try to figure out what an endgame might be. Yeah. So, Tommy, I think first it's important to step back and look at the stakes of Ukraine for us. Indeed, for folks around the world. Look, first, I think most Americans just inherently don't like to see one big country bully another. It's something that we generally object to and where we can want to do something about. So when we see the brutalization of Ukraine by Russia, when we see what's being done on a daily basis, to bomb not only its cities, but to bomb its people, its infrastructure, when we see some of the atrocities that have been committed by Russian forces in Ukraine, that's something that gets people rightly concerned and upset. But fundamentally, there's something even larger at stake, which is this is not only an aggression against Ukraine. It's an aggression against some very basic principles that we labored long and hard to try to establish after two world wars to try to ensure that it would be less likely that we'd have another world war and certainly less likely that we'd have conflict and that we'd have a greater chance at building peace and stability. A lot of this is enshrined in the United Nations charter and other places. And it basically says one country doesn't have the right to go in, change the borders with another by force, try to take it over, try to do what Russia did, which was to erase Ukraine's identity, erase it from the maps of Sumit into Russia. Because if we allow that to go on check, if we allow that to go forward with the United Nations, then it opens a Pandora's box. It's open season. Every would be aggressor around the world will say, well, if Russia can get away with it, so can we. And Russia itself, the idea that it would stop at simply trying to take over Ukraine, it would stop there, I think, is very misguided. So not doing something about this is a recipe for a world of conflict that we know from history draws the United States in in ways that cost a lot more, toil and treasure and blood than we're seeing now. So I think that's the big piece that's so important. The other big piece is this. This is not just the United States standing with and standing up for Ukraine. It's dozens of countries around the world. And we've built different coalitions to deal with different aspects of this, the military piece, the economic and reconstruction piece, the energy piece, the humanitarian piece. And you're seeing countries from around the world coming in and standing with Ukraine. The ultimate objective, it really, Tommy, is twofold. First of course is to deny Russia any kind of strategic success in Ukraine, because if we don't, then as I said, it's open invitation for aggressors everywhere. And already, it's really important to note that Russia has failed in what it was trying to accomplish, because its goal, as I said, was to erase Ukraine from the map, to end its identity as an independent country, to subsume it into Russia. That's already failed. Where exactly the settles, exactly where the lines are drawn, that's fundamentally up to the Ukrainians. And we want to stand with them to maximize their ability to take back the remaining territory that Russia sees. Russia still controls about 17% of Ukraine. But not only that, to ensure that Ukraine not only survives, but also thrives. And that gets into supporting it economically and supporting its democratic emergence. But the objective is to make sure that Ukraine can stand on its own feet. This is not a recipe for some kind of indefinite support by the entire world. To keep Ukraine going, it's getting Ukraine to a point where militarily, economically, democratically, it can stand strongly on its own. It seems clear that Putin is struggling to get the resources necessary to conduct this war. He is reportedly meeting with Kim Jong-un today in Russia. A lot of analysts are looking at this meeting and saying this is significant and worrisome evolution of the Russia-North Korea relationship, because North Korea finally has something that Putin actually wants, in this case, artillery shells. He can use that as leverage to extract something that might worry us a lot, like military technology to launch missiles, spy satellites, nuclear technologies. It's notable that Kim is accompanied by two aides that I believe manage the satellite program and manage their acquisition of nuclear-capable submarines. For example, how worried are you about this deepening partnership between Russia and North Korea and the potential for North Korea to get these more modern weapons or nuclear infrastructure? Well, I think this says two things to us first. It says that Russia is increasingly desperate. Because of the effectiveness of the Ukrainians in pushing them back, desperate because the sanctions and export controls that so many countries have imposed on Russia are denying it the technology that it needs to replace and even modernize its military and its weaponry. So it's looking wherever it can. And of course, right now it's looking primarily to North Korea and to Iran. On one level, that's kind of a Star Wars bar scene of countries. So I think it does speak to Russia's desperation. On the other hand, it's also true that we don't want to see Russia be in a position where it can strengthen the capabilities that's bringing to dealing with the aggression on Ukraine. And we also don't want to see North Korea benefiting from whatever technologies it might get from Russia. And same with Iran, where there's also a two-way street relationship that's developing. We're working with other countries. We're taking our own actions to try to disrupt as much of that as we possibly can. Of course, the relationship between Russia and North Korea that's moving forward now is in violation of numerous UN Security Council resolutions. We're looking to make sure that we, as necessary, can impose costs and consequences. But I also think it's having the effect of further isolating these countries from the rest of the world. So one question following on both this inflection point you mentioned and Ukraine, you were recently in India for the G20. And it was interesting because that came shortly after for India the BRIC summit that got a lot of attention in South Africa. And so we've seen kind of India comfortable with the BRIC summit, comfortable in Washington and the state visit. But I want to ask more generally about the global South and countries like India and countries and places like Southeast Asia and Africa that have been much more reticent to kind of embrace the Ukrainian side of this war in the same way that say our European allies have. Is there a risk? Because it feels like here in the United States and in Europe and in some of our Asian allies, okay, Ukraine war isn't an inflection point. Ukraine war itself is kind of representative of the inflection point that you talk about. But it does feel like almost a couple years into this war that's not a view that is shared in the global South. And that if anything, there might even be a risk that our focus on Ukraine is not where their heads are at. They're thinking about climate change or they're thinking about development or they're thinking about emerging technologies. How do you balance this risk between wanting to get a statement at the G20 expressing support for Ukraine versus maybe not meeting these countries where they are and which they're like, you know what, I don't like the fact there's this war, but I don't really want to get involved in it. And why aren't you talking to us about what we care about? What would you say to that kind of line of critique that we hear a lot from some elements of the global South? Sure. Ben, I think two things. First, if you look at what we've been able to do over the last year and a half with regard to the rest of the world and Russia's aggression against Ukraine, on multiple occasions, we've had more than 140 countries at the United Nations clearly stand up for territorial integrity, independence, sovereignty, and against the Russian aggression. That includes many most of the countries in the so-called global South because I think they understand that the principles I was talking about earlier are principles that matter to them too. And so again, we've seen them stand up. So, I think that we've been able to do this very well, and I think that we've been able to do this very well, and I think that we've been able to do this very well. And so, I think that we've been able to do this very well. And so, I think that we've been able to do this very well. And so, I think that we've been able to do this very well. And so, I think that we've been able to do this very well. And so, I think that we've been able to do this very well. And so, I think that we've been able to do this very well. In terms of different social studies, of countries, different sizes, different shapes of coalitions to address specific problems. That's one piece, but the other piece is exactly what you said. We have to, and we are, demonstrating that we're focused on the issues that matter most to them, and that we are the answer to many of the problems that they're facing. And Russia, in this particular case, is a big part of the problem, security, to take one example. A combination of over the last few years of climate change, of COVID and of conflict, and particularly now the Russian aggression against Ukraine, has a devastating consequences for countries particularly in the global South when it comes to food insecurity. The bread basket of the world, Ukraine, Russia preventing Ukraine from exporting its grain and its wheat, an initiative by the United Nations to allow that to happen, the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which when it was in effect, allowed 30 million tons of grain to get out of Ukraine, the equivalent of 18 billion loaves of bread. The Russians recently tore that up. Who does that hurt the most? The very countries in the developing world that desperately needed, even countries that weren't direct recipients of Ukrainian grain, are affected by the fact that prices go up when grain is kept off the market. We've put together a coalition of countries around the world to deal effectively with food insecurity, both emergency assistance, where we're the number one provider around the world, as well as long-term support to help these countries build their sustainable productive capacity so that they're not the prisoners of a country like Russia weaponizing food. I can go across the board on the things that countries are actually looking for and want. Infrastructure, a huge demand for infrastructure around the world. Well, thanks to what President Biden's done, starting with the G7 and now expanded to the G20, we have a very significant program of infrastructure investment that is bringing countries together to catalyze private sector investment to respond to these needs, but to do it as a race to the top, not a race to the bottom that these countries have experienced when they've had other significant supporters of infrastructure do it in a way that builds to shoddy standards that doesn't pay attention to the environment or the rights and needs of workers and that puts a huge amount of debt on countries that they can't afford. We're in the process of reforming the international financial system so that countries have greater access to capital, so that they have ways of getting debt relief that they can make more manageable the needs that they have. And of course, working to make sure we have a security council, the United Nations, that's better reflective of the world of today, not the world that existed when the security council was formed. So in these and so many other ways, we've been demonstrating that, yes, we're focused on the agenda that most countries around the world want us to focus on. And in this moment, a country like Russia is the main disrupter of that agenda. And is one more thing on this. Are you, you know, it's interesting that the G20 just happened before that the BRIC summit, you know, we've obviously had a G7 which you guys have referred to. I think it's a good bumper sticker, you know, the steering committee of the free world. But we're also, you know, the UN meetings are coming up. And it, you know, these are my words, not yours. It feels like the UN is far less capable of being a place of collective action. I mean, for the obvious reason that, you know, Russia is not going to let anything get to the security council and anything that we care about, for instance. Is Sarah Worry that, that yes, you're, you're building these coalitions and good strong coalitions of like-minded countries on different issues, like you said, the variable geometry, which I did not do well in geometry school. But, but I get you mean, you know, you have quads and orientations in the Asia, you've had the tri-lat with Korea and Japan, Kim David, G7, but you know, then China's building its own blocks, you know, you worried a bit that that part of what's happening is the world sorting out into kind of competing blocks. And rather than having that system, the coordinates, collective action, that there's a system being built that is really, you know, an us versus them system, even though that's not the intention in the United States that that may be the effect of what's happening in this, at this moment. Look, there's no doubt that the international system, the UN system is challenged in many ways, but that's not a reason to give up on it. It's a question, it's actually a reason to double down lean in and seek to make it more effective. And again, more reflective of the world as you might put it as it is, not as it, as it once was. Good book plug there, Tony. Yeah, I try to appreciate that. Yeah, you can't hear that. It's super steep. Right, thank you. But, and that's not purely out of altruism, it's because it's in our interest to do it. The fact of the matter is virtually none of the problems that we have to face around the world and that are having an effect on the lives of our fellow citizens are problems that we can effectively address alone as strong and powerful as we are. We benefit profoundly from having these alliances, these partnerships, these coalitions, and an effective international system that can pick up some of the burden because if not, then either we're going to be stuck doing it alone at much greater cost or no one does it, and then you're going to have a vacuum that is just filled by bad things before it's filled with good things. So we have an interest in making sure that the UN can operate effectively through its programs. For example, on food security, on maternal health, on climate, you name it. And to some extent, even if you have relative paralysis at the Security Council for the reasons you said, that doesn't mean that these different programs aren't functioning and having a positive impact. Again, in ways that if they weren't around, we'd have to pick up the slack. So we're working on that. Look, I'd like to see a Security Council that functions, but that is very challenging at a time when you have the antagonisms that we have with Russia and the competition that we have with China. But we're also seeing this, Ben, and this is what I'm finding as I travel around the world. There's a demand signal from countries around the world that we, the United States, lead responsibly. And that means dealing with what you were talking about a few minutes ago, which is focusing on the things that matter to them, and also trying to find ways to move forward and try to make the UN and other international institutions more effective. And if and as we do that, or at least as we're seeing and caught trying, that actually benefits us in our leadership around the world. Tony, last question for you. Thank you again for your time. There have been a bunch of news reports that a possible US broker normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Now, I know you wouldn't ever comment on a deal that's not finalized, nor would you get ahead of President Biden if a deal wasn't announced. But I was hoping you might help us understand why the administration thinks now is the moment where it might be advantageous to cut a deal with the Saudis and the Israelis. Because in Israel, there have been months of protests over changes to the judiciary. People like Ahed Barak said that these changes could turn Israel into, quote, de facto dictatorship, where there's questions about the future of Israel's democracy over in Saudi Arabia. It obviously, of course, already is a dictatorship. The crown prince has an ever worsening human rights record. The most recent iteration of that was reports that border guards were shooting at Ethiopian migrants as part of a policy. MBS has a tendency to undercut US interests. I mean, cards on the table, obviously, in case it's not obvious already, I'm not a big fan of BB or MBS. But I'm wondering sort of like, why help these two leaders out now? It seems like a big political win for two folks who fight against President Biden's political wins on a regular basis. Well, first, Tommy, this this and most things that we do are not about individual leaders or individual governments. They're about the substance of the issue. And whether we can, in in whatever we're doing, advance a world that's a little bit more peaceful, a little bit more prosperous, a little bit more full of opportunity. And there's no question in my mind that if we could help achieve normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, it would move the world in that direction. We've had extraordinary turmoil in that part of the world going back to at least 1979, decades of turmoil. Moving away from that, having more moderating and integrating dynamics, carry things forward, I think would be a profound change and a profound change for the good and a change that would, again, not be tied any specific government, but to the fundamental interests of the countries involved. Now, this is really hard to do. And there's a lot that goes into it. And unclear whether whether we get there. But there's no doubt in my mind that if we if we could, it would be good for us, good for the countries in question, good for the region. And indeed, good for the world beyond. If you have the leading Muslim country in the world, Islamic country in the world, making a piece of Israel, that's going to have benefits that travel well beyond the region. Now, one very important piece to this, normalization, any of the efforts that are going on to improve relations between Israel and its neighbors, are not cannot be a substitute for Israel and the Palestinians, resolving their differences and having a much better future for Palestinians. And in our judgment, of course, that must needs to involve a two state solution. So it's also clear from what we hear from the Saudis that if this process is to move forward, the Palestinian peace is going to be very important too. Yeah, I mean, that is the big question, right? Because the previous Abraham Accord normalization deals have said to the Palestinians, you know, kind of you get breadcrumbs, if not, and if nothing at all. Now I was just in Morocco, where I was I was recalling how Jared Kushner handed over control of an entire disputed region to the Moroccan government as part of the Abraham Accord deals. And I was just, you know, trying to figure out to what extent a normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel is viewed as something that would aid a Middle East peace process or efforts to get a Palestinian state that it seemed to be, you know, been an ice for a while. Well, look, that's clearly something that's important to the Saudis in doing any kind of doing any kind of deal would be important to us too. But I think every country involved, if this is to move forward, will clearly find significant, tangible benefit in it in the in the near term. But again, this is even more about putting in place a foundation for a much different future, one that is more peaceful, that is more secure, that is more prosperous, in moderating so many of these different problems and passions that have led to turmoil over the last decades. And through the process of integration, that is going to deliver much more tangible benefits to people in all of these countries and throughout the region. That's the goal. Now, again, whether we can, whether we can get there, the jury's out because the practical substance of this is challenging. It's it's hard. But we're working on it. And I think the labor is well worth the fruit that could be produced. Excellent. Well, listen, Tony, thank you so much for doing the show. And thanks for all the hard work and I kind of hope you get some sleep. Yeah, thanks for everything you're doing. As always, we're working hard. Thanks for having me on. Thanks again to Tony for doing the show. Ben, thanks for staying up late. I hope the jet lag doesn't punch you too hard. Yeah, no, I'm sorry a little slow.

He speaks French impeccably with that hair, you know, hardworking man. Worldly, if I was out to dinner, that's the man I'd want picking the one off the list, you know. Oh, yeah. I wouldn't even look at this song. Yeah, just say Tony. Yeah, Tony, what's up? Your call or my whole fucking meal. Yeah. Doing perfect French. All right, buddy. See you soon. I'll see you guys.
