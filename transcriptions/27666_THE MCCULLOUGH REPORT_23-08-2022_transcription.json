    "text": " Hard hitting medical truth, cutting through conflict and confusion to the understanding you're searching for. Join Dr. Peter McCullough, world-renowned medical expert and practicing physician for this edition of the McCullough Report. Your life may depend on it. Let's get real, let's get loud. An America Loud Talk Radio, this is a McCullough Report. And I'm Dr. Peter McCullough. We've had a very busy week of developments in the COVID-19 crisis. A bombshell paper was published by Manzugian and colleagues from Bangkok, Thailand, but a very high quality in the first prospective cohort study to be done seeking baseline data and then the intentional detection of myocarditis, you're going to be blown away with the results. In addition, the CDC came out with new relaxed guidance for COVID-19, which has been a long awaited catch-up to what's been gone on with clinical practice. And I think ought to be a strong signal to every employer or entity that is still mandating the COVID-19 vaccines. I think the implications are in the CDC guidance that nothing is different if one's taken a vaccine or not. And then therefore, COVID-19 vaccination, discrimination or any policy regarding it in the workplace at this point in time should not be into effect. I had a wonderful wide-ranging interview with Ms. Kim Iverson. It's been the first time I've been on her show. It was so good and well done. I thought I'd play it for you in this first segment of the McCallery Report. It is now well established that the mRNA vaccines cause heart inflammation, particularly amongst teen boys. The question is at what rate? When health officials admitted the COVID vaccines were the cause of the inflammation, they said it was extremely rare. One in hundreds of thousands. That number was then modified down to one in 50,000, then one in 20,000. Now the CDC claims it's about 1 in 12,000. But that's based on cases that are actually reported. In places with better, more robust reporting systems like in Hong Kong, the reported rate is closer to 1 in 2500. Now a new preprint from researchers in Thailand show the rate might be much, much lower. The study looked at 301 teens between the ages of 13 and 18, studied their hearts before vaccination and after vaccination using echocardiograms, electrocardiograms and other measurements and found that three teens in the group developed myocarditis or pericarditis and an additional four developed subclinical myocarditis. That's seven out of 301. Joining us now to discuss is Dr. Peter McCullough. He is an internist, cardiologist, and epidemiologist. He's been on the forefront of the pandemic, bringing us a much needed critique of the response and a healthy dose of skepticism, much of which has turned out to be accurate. Dr. McCullough, welcome to the show. Thanks for being here. Thanks for having me. So walk us through this preprint that's coming out of time. This seems to be a seven out of 301. That rate is 1 in 43 developing some sort of myocarditis, pericarditis or subclinical. That is massive. One of the first questions I had is how come Harvard didn't do this study or the Mayo Clinic or Duke? In the biological licensing agreement, the BLA that was issued to Pfizer and then one that was issued to Moderna by the FDA, they said you have to do studies before and after in children because we have to know the baseline. You have to tell us how many people are really developing heart damage. It's been more than a year and no institution in the United States attempted to answer that. We've been relying on spontaneous reporting, which is likely a gross underestimate. So this paper by Mansugian and colleagues from Ho Chi Minh City. Oh, was this time under Bangkok? Yeah, sorry. This is Bangkok. Okay. So this paper by Mansugian and colleagues from Bangkok did the right thing and they use state of the art technology. They use the Roche high sensitivity troponin T assay, the blood test we use in the United States. They used GE high quality ultrasoner, echo, electric cardiograms and those who had every malistia. They didn't cardiac MRI. So they did it every bit as good as we've done in the United States. And we were stunned to find that in this sample where they lost very few to follow up, as you reported, that seven had sustained heart damage. I'm a cardiologist and I know these data very well. Two actually were hospitalized and they were hospitalized for about four to five days for observation. This was not a casual thing. 29% had cardiovascular symptoms without damage, including the heart racing palpitations and chest pain. The FDA asked the companies for data that's cohort. This is called a prospective cohort study. And here it is. We have to wait from Bangkok, Thailand to get the answer and it's not good. So explain to us. So four of them had subclinical myocarditis. What is that in compared? What is that in relation to like actual myocarditis or pericarditis? And would a person know they have that? Well, that's it. Subclinical means they don't know they have it. This is very important. Remember whether or not they had symptoms, they all had baseline ECG's, cardiac troponin and echocardiography. And then the MRI was additional if they had abnormalities. This subclinical is very, very important. That means American children who are getting the vaccine, some of them have no symptoms yet they're sustaining heart damage. And what would be the, I mean, what does that mean? What are the symptoms or are they, I guess, the long term problems or complications that you would have if you were diagnosed with something like this? Because the vaccines are brand new, we don't have any assurances on long term safety. So we have to rely on other types of situations. Myocarditis is very rare. Before COVID-19 vaccination, it could happen. The background rate with parval virus or kaxaki virus is about four cases per million per year. And that was established in a paper by a Rolio and colleagues from Finland. Our initial CDC estimates, again, because they didn't know the cohort, they estimated 62 cases per million. And then a case, a series was published by Sharfin colleagues from Kaiser Permanente. And they had the number up to 500 plus cases per million. And then you gave the other statistics. Now it looks like maybe in 100 children in a typical school, there's going to be children who are damaged. The prognosis here or the implications are unknown. But I can tell you as a cardiologist, heart damage causes scarring. And when there's a scar, that's a setup for an abnormal heart rhythm. And that abnormal heart rhythm can lead to a cardiac arrest. Today, a paper was just published by Flavio Cadda Gianni from Brazil. And he demonstrated that the reason why myocarditis is so important in children is that when there's superimposed adrenaline and norett adrenaline in exercise, it is the trigger for cardiac arrest. And it may explain why we've seen scores of athletes die on the field or die during training or other events because it's subclinical myocarditis and then superimposed adrenaline surge. So subclinical myocarditis would be just as risky as actual or maybe not as. But if somebody's diagnosed with subclinical, because we're hearing this all that we've been hearing this throughout when we found out that the vaccines were causing myocarditis, of course, the response from a lot of people would be, well, it's minor. It resolves itself over the next few months. Or if it's subclinical, then it's really truly minor. How minor is it? I mean, and you're saying it causes scarring, so can it really truly resolve? Well, I can tell you a different mechanism for heart damage will be a heart attack and an adult. So if an adult had a heart attack with this types of EKG changes and elevations and chaponin, they'd be rushed to the cardiac catheterization laboratory and have angiography and stenting. So I can tell you as a cardiologist, we take this degree of heart damage seriously. There is no heart damage that's mild or inconsequential. And there are papers now by Jenna Shower showing it doesn't go away. And she has data in children now with serial cardiac MRIs that's not encouraging. As a cardiologist in clinical practice, I have some young people now that have sustained heart damage after vaccination and it's now more than a year. And what's interesting is so many other countries are banning vaccines, certain vaccines for younger people. We've seen throughout Europe, Moderna being banned for groups anywhere ranging depending on the country under 30 or under 18 or particularly to boys. Now Denmark has completely said under the age of 18, you won't be able to get vaccinated anymore. That's it. We're done with you guys. Unless you're in a very specific category and the doctor writes you a note saying you must get the vaccine because you're so sick, you know, you're so immunocompromised. Other than that, they're not offering it yet. You know, we're not seeing that. We're not, we're not seeing it. We're still, they're still talking about mandating it for college students in the country. You know, how, even with knowing all of this is willful blindness, they're willfully blind to cardiac damage and potentially death and Americans taking the vaccine. Our CDC told us in February that 75% of children had already had COVID. Now, among other populations, those in high school and college, it may be nearly everyone has had COVID-19. And a paper by Keem Italia and colleagues, it's been demonstrated that once someone's had any strain of COVID, they have 97% protection against any serious outcome in the future. And that's even in the oldest and sickest adults. So I can tell you as a doctor in children, the COVID-19 vaccines are not medically necessary. They're not clinically indicated. The randomized trials show no clinical benefit. It's never been demonstrated a reduction in spread. Some people think that adults are using the children as human shields to try to protect the adults. That hasn't been demonstrated scientifically. It's really a die about it by a goal thought. And now on top of that, there are two real world studies by Dora Boila and Fleming Dutra in JAMA demonstrating even when children are vaccinated, it's a complete waste of time. The vaccine efficacy is far less than 50% and there's no differential in important clinical outcomes. So I think Denmark's got it right. They should withdraw all vaccination for young people. And just to kind of wrap up this particular segment before we move on to the CDC and their new guidelines. Okay, so if you see a youth teenager that ends up developing myocarditis, what does their future hold? I mean, it might worry for these young men because this is particularly affecting teenage boys. We know that men when they hit middle age are at higher risk of heart attacks. So does this put them at an increased possibility of having a heart attack later in life? Do we even know? The two major risks of having myocarditis and any severity of myocarditis are the development of heart failure later on and actually having a cardiac arrest. And in other forms of a cardiac muscle disease, when more than 15% of the heart is damaged, we actually put in an ICD to prevent sudden cardiac death. So what does it mean for a child? In a paper by Tracy Hogue from UC Davis, well more than 85% of children are hospitalized. So the kids are out of school because they're in the hospital with myocarditis. Our CDC VAIR system has thousands and thousands of American kids who have been hospitalized with myocarditis. Thousands. And after the hospitalization is survived, if there is reduction in heart pumping function, then we need to use heart failure medications to actually try to prevent the development of heart failure. And I had to do that in my practice. We treat the inflammation with anti-inflammatory medications, non-steroidal agents, sometimes steroids, and then cultucine. And then there's a lot of testing. The children have to go through seroecocardiography and MRI. They can't play in sports. We know that there's been some important athletes, Fabian Shrump from Europe, a wonderful marathoner. She announced she has myocarditis and actually had to stop running. Her career has been put on hold, so athletes' careers have to be put on hold. And then they have to be monitored carefully over time. And we're on pins and needles that in fact they may develop heart failure, have a cardiac arrest. I'm concerned that so many high-level athletes who compete at such a high level and have high-dollar contracts, they actually may not mention any heart pain. They may not mention any discomfort and try to play through this. And we have seen now over 1,000 European athletes with cardiac arrest on the field in Europe, typically soccer, rugby, or other sports where they've strictly mandated the vaccines. Wow. All right, let's talk about the CDC guidelines. So they announced, you know, they saw this all over the breaking news. The CDC updates their guidelines. And I was thinking they were going to finally drop the vaccine mandates for people coming into the United States. I was thinking, oh, okay, they're going to let Novak Djokovic play. The US opened, right? They're going to open up the borders for unvaccinated Europeans. Unvaccinated Americans could go to Europe. Unvaccinated Europeans cannot come to America. But no, that's not what the guideline was. They announced and on their website they have CDC, Streamlines COVID-19 guidance to help the public better protect themselves and understand their risk. So tell us what did they change today? The CDC actually did what I consider kind of a cleanup of some legacy recommendations that they had in the past that basically no one was following. They had some recommendations that if you were exposed to somebody with COVID at work, you were supposed to go home and quarantine yourself. Well, I can tell you, people haven't done that for months, if not over a year. People got sick at work. They go home. The other workers stay there. People weren't quarantining based on contact, but the CDC got that out of there. The CDC did something else that we had already started doing clinical practice is that they standardized the quarantine period for five days. Now they originally had it for five days for tests positive but no symptoms. We were applying it for those who were sick. And the CDC, I think, very practically says, listen, a five-day period is reasonable. If there's no fever after that, you can just simply come back to work and don't worry about it. I think the most important thing that the CDC said was actually something that is going to hopefully stop some activities. The CDC finally came out. Previously they had been neutral or mentioned a few applications, but here they came out and they said, stop asymptomatic testing. This is important. Stop it. There are still people at work who are tortured by getting a nasal test once a week, even if they don't have symptoms. There still are people trying to take plane trips to Hawaii or elsewhere where some airlines make them take a test. It's got to stop. Asymptomatic testing was never cleared by the US FDA. The WHO said stop doing it in June 25th of 2021. Now more than a year later, finally, the CDC comes around and says, stop asymptomatic testing. People with papers have been published. Asymptomatic testing has had yield of less than 1%, and when the test is positive, it's most likely to be false positive. All these people traveling who have had to take tests, all they have done is basically screwed up their travel itinerary and put their trips at risk and wasted a lot of people's time and money. I think CDC ought to issue an apology for allowing that to go on for so long. I doubt that's going to happen. It does sound like from these new updated guidelines, and I just find it funny that they say to better protect themselves and understand their risks. When really what they were doing, they were just saying, okay, we reverse. We reverse everything. We're not, don't test anymore. You don't need a quarantine unless you're the one who actually has COVID. If you got COVID, you only stay home for five days. That sounds more to me like we're learning to live with it, which is something they should have done probably early on. We've got to figure out a way to live with this virus in a way that protects the most vulnerable and allows the rest of the population to go about their lives. It sounds like they're finally coming around with that recommendation. I would agree with that, but to be fair to the CDC, the virus has mutated. It's become a far more mild syndrome. Most people have already been through it, so second infections are very mild. It's a much shorter syndrome clinically. I've managed patients all the way through the illness, and I've had patients in the Delta way, for instance, actually be sick for more than a month, truly be sick. Now with the Omicron brand, I've had people actually completely get better in under three days. It's a totally different syndrome. We've learned how to treat it, so they get better in under three days with combination early therapy. I think most important, we've gone from a mindset of COVID-0, getting to zero cases, just as you've said to what I call COVID-inevitable. It's inevitable. We're all going to get it. It's just like the Spanish flu. It's going to sweep through the country, and let's hope we're on the back end of this. That was Kim Iverson on the Kim Iverson show. I joined her. I'll tell you, she's a terrific journalist. Most of the time I've been on with her, and so I'd encourage you to check out her station. She's really seeking the truth. Wonderful wide-ranging interview. I think that gets you up to date on a lot of the developments that's happened this week.

In our pursuit of understanding in depth, SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 syndrome, I've brought to our American audience and our worldwide audience, experts from all over the world. Today's interview is no different. But for the first time I'm asking to appear on the show, Dr. Jean-Francois L\u00e9gard. Dr. L\u00e9gard is a PhD, received his PhD in cellular and molecular physiology. He's had extensive training in the US, in Canada, both in chronic diseases and he really has moved into acute disease, specifically SARS-CoV-2, and the genetic code for the COVID-19 vaccines, that code for the spike protein. And he's generated a tremendous amount of scholarship regarding the spike protein. So I really want to focus this interview on the spike protein and welcome Jean-Francois. In fact, I can call him Jeff, which is great. Welcome to the show, Jeff. Yes, thank you. Well, let's start off on this. Why don't you explain to the audience how you got interested in this and what's the lead up to your scholarship on the spike protein? In fact, I have been working since 20 years in nutrition and health. And I have a formation of chemistry and biochemistry. And I'm specializing in oxidative stress and inflammation reaction. So I'm also interested in virus and this kind of disease. But very quickly, I've seen that the COVID was an inflammatory disease. I think the virus is only the start of the reaction, but it's not the virus that kills the virus make a disorder in immunity. And after it triggers inflammation, and at the end, it's inflammation that kills. So I thought that it was interesting to work on this because it's not really viral and antiviral things, which are important. But it's really to regulate the immunity and inflammation, which is very, very, very key in for curing COVID and also in the vaccine problems. And I think it's about immuno inflammation. So that's why I get interested and started to work like many people to protect my family. And because I'm a scientist, I went interested. And after I go more deeply in this and since two years. So do you think there's been an excessive amount of attention on the virus itself and not enough to attention on inflammation? Exactly. And mainly also many people have been talking by a biologist and not enough cardiologist or specialist of immunity inflammation, et cetera. And also more than this, all the therapies are like from this, if you're anything, are only the only target the anti-viral aspect. And you cannot really stop the development of the virus because it's very special, especially for some genetic things. For example, the pharynciac, it's very hard because he has a quick development in the body once he is inside. And after it's more important to block the regulating immunity and to block inflammation. So I think we are wrong. For many people are wrong about the therapies because many things like molecular video, box fan, all the therapies are only focused on anti-viral. And they should be much more on block inflammation. And I think we can do it better than the excitement, for example. So the people, the researchers are not focused enough on the inflammatory pathways, which are more important than only breaking the replication of the virus, which is very complicated. So Jeff, you probably recently saw, you know, I know you're over in Marseille, but it had to be obvious that our NIH national allergy and immunology infectious disease, branch director Anthony Fauci, and President Biden both contracted COVID after taking, you know, for COVID-19 vaccine injections. And they were both treated with pex-loved monotherapy, pex-loved, in the United States is a combination of neurmetralvir, a novel combo, chemis like three inhibitor and ritonovir, just an older protease inhibitor. But there was no mention of any treatment for inflammation or coagulation. And I think as everybody may know, they basically suffered rebound. We ended up having a prolonged illness, and they were more infectious for a longer period of time. What's your commentary on that? I've seen a lot about the MDGV, our product, the molecular area, et cetera. But on pex-loved, I'm not happy here about this. But after a while, I really are kind of getting less interest in the antiviral things. I mean, interested in the fact that this vaccine doesn't work, and I've seen that many people who have taken two or three vaccine shots, even the booster, they are not protected. And even sometimes even worse with the anti-volley dependent enhancement, which can happen because we have some variants which are very different from the SARS-CoV-2 from the beginning. So we are doing with the vaccine some antibodies which are not stealing the virus, which are helping the virus to divide in the body. So Jeff, there was a paper by Keem and colleagues that described with the respiratory illness infection at least 15 different epitopes or 15 different proteins that elicit antibody response. There's probably many, many more, but including the spike protein at multiple locations, the nucleocaps, the envelope protein, et cetera. With your knowledge, what is it about SARS-CoV-2 infection that's so inflammatory? That's just so unusual compared to other viral infections. I think there are several inflammatory pathway which are not enough discussed, and they are very important. And the fact is that everything is linked to the receptor of the virus, ACE2, and the glutensin coratina. So the protein which is the entry of the virus is very important for the body because it has very positive importance in normal egg. So when it's blocked by the virus, it's blocked this all this positive effect. And so it implicates many inflammatory diseases. It's really okay protein. It's not, I mean, I would say we are unlucky or, I could say worse, it's a very bad target for the body. And it implies the virus, it started the virus inflammatory pathway, which one of the first is the brain androgen-syn pathway, which is then becoming very inflammatory because ACE2 is very good. And this is in balance with another protein which is ACE. And when they are not balanced, then we are, we get, we got a lot of inflammation. And also it activates some other case inflammatory pathway, which I call bradiculin pathway. It can go, it can go so easily in the details. But the bradiculin pathway and also the complement pathway, which are activated by the reaction of the virus with this receptor are really cally. And so they have like three or four inflammatory pathways, which are implicated by the link between the virus and the receptor of the virus. And the problem is that the vaccine, the spike protein of the vaccine is also vibrated in the blood. It's also free after very quickly in the body and in many organs, in the country of what say the fire and Moderna. So it's like the vaccine is like a concentrated COVID, which is going everywhere in the body and reacting with this ACE2 receptor, which are everywhere in many fluids, in every organs, even in the brain. And you can pass the barrier between the vessel in the brain and all the brain. So that's a brain. The vaccine are like concentrated COVID, which can make inflammation all over the body with this pathway, which are called lectin complement pathway, the bradiculin pathway, the venin and your tensing pathway. Because it's weird that this virus reacts on so important receptor. And after there could be a discussion about the origin of the virus, is it natural? Many papers show that some of these virus have been directed to this receptor. And anyway, that makes it very inflammatory. And everybody should focus more on inflammation. That's blocking the replication of the virus, which is very complicated, even if I'm like over, like defending the either medicines, some other antiviral. But you feel only try to get antiviral. You don't cure COVID. You need to be antiviral a bit, but you need to be anti-inflammatory and specific. So it's the targeting of the receptor bonding domain of the S1 segment of the spike protein for the ACE2 receptor. That in your mind is really the key thing. It's a tip off for inflammation, but also as you implied, the ACE2 receptor, in a sense, is a good guy. That that's actually a pretty favorable protein. And the interaction there is damaging to ACE2, right? So when the receptor bonding domain locks in with ACE2, it's either deactivating or even potentially scheduling the protein for destruction. Is that right? Yeah, ACE2 at the end is good because it's, once again, it's balanced with another enzyme ACE, which produces angiotensin2, which is inflammatory. And it has to be balanced by ACE2. So at the beginning, many people was thinking that we have to, it's good that if we have a low ACE2 because it's the receptor of the virus, but at the end, ACE2 has to be regulated and has to be upregulated also because it's very important to fight inflammation. And as I said, anyway, the virus inside, when it's in the body, it's very hard to block the replication, but you can block the inflammation. And I forgot something at the beginning on the vaccine, where we're just discussing about the efficacy and et cetera. And one of the main problems of the vaccine is on efficacy is that to be efficient and to protect the lungs and the upper airways, you have to make some immunoglobulin A and secretary immunoglobulin A, that's immune, immunoglobulin A, which are done by the upper airways, by the lungs, et cetera, because they are the one that can really protect your lungs. And with this vaccine, you especially those from IgJ, some immunoglobulin J, which are circulating in the blood, but they are not enough protecting the lungs and the target. So we make some immunoglobulin with the vaccine, but they are not useful because what is useful is called secretary immunoglobulin A, which are immunoglobulin A, that would be done by the, at the, at the level of the, of the cells of the lung, et cetera. And actually, I don't see that the research on, on source and coronary use that, now research was able to make a good vaccine since 20 years. So we were the research and I guess, poison and Moderna were aware that this vaccine wouldn't work. So we can discuss about the toxicity, but also on the efficacy, we kind of knew that we, if we were honest, that we didn't have a lot of blood that it works. So that's for me, I'll be preemosy. You know, Jeff, I recently talked to an academic dentist. Let me know that, you know, there are some other interesting vaccine ideas, including actually using relatively benign nasopharyngeal bacteria, but, but manipulating the bacteria so they express the spike protein. But you know, the spike protein can't do anything and the bacteria basically aren't able to replicate they die. But it's a way of exposing the nasopharynx directly with spike protein through a nasal mist. And I've always thought that, that I've interviewed on the show, Hamid Merchant, who's a vaccine developer in the UK. And he said, listen, if they would have went with some type of antigenic exposure in the nasopharynx, that would have had half a chance of inducing IgA and T cells and natural killer cells in the nasal pharyngeal mucosa. Whereas an intradermal injection, it's hopeless in terms of... Yeah, I'm only too much too late. It's staying there and after it's going to break, it's useless. But also on your point, I understood that I had even the professor Del Freisie talking about here. About this here is the responsible of the scientific conceal, I mean, advice of the president here. And he has talked about this. It's like a good idea because it's closer on the respiratory hair ways and on the lungs. But in the facts, it's never really worked. And so I have friends which are better than me in immunity. And they say it's never really worked. They have tried for the fluke and it didn't work. So it's like a good idea because it's better than in the muscle to make an erythol in the nose, for example. But it didn't really work. And also you can also think that the big problem of the toxicity of the spike proteins in the nose where there are a lot also that the vessel are not far away from the nose mucoses. You can also see some some toxicity of the spike which goes towards the brain. Already in the muscle, we see that the RNA and the spike travel everywhere in the body until also the brain. It's written in a modern and in the agency of the medical, the medical agents in Europe, they are written also this that we find some RNA and spike in the blood in the brain. So it's already bad like this. So if you put it in the note, you can also some nervous reaction which would not be good. So the problem is that this spike protein is so inflammatory that you have to take very to take care about where you put it. And when we see the damage that it makes when you put it in the muscle, I think in the brain, I am in the in by the nose. We could also maybe some meteor toxic issues. So it's maybe a good idea, but it doesn't work so much. My friend of immunity at Komek and there is a brand of toxicity also in the nose in the airway. So you should send directly spike there. So Jeff and everyone. The whole realization that spike protein has been found in the human brain after vaccination. Okay. My boma and colleagues have found spike protein in the human heart after vaccination. In fact, it's found everywhere in the body. What are the implications here based on what you know? How can the spike protein in the brain ever be benign or in the heart ever be benign? Everything we know about the spike protein, it seems like it's very pro inflammatory to tracking inflammation, but it's the spike protein itself doing damage as it seeks the ACE2 receptor. Yeah, I think it's through the link with AC2 receptor that's in use all the inflammation pathway I've said. But in the brain, for example, it's very preoccupating because it's passing the muscle in my toe and cephalic membrane that's been between the blood and the vessel and the whole brain. It has been found, some spike had been found for COVID people and for vaccine people in all the region of the brain, including the epithelial mucle, the apophies, which are linked to many, many, many things in the body. So and I think we have seen some kind of people having some close to cross-reled Jacob disease. And we think that it's like a global inflammation in the brain, which are not cross-reled Jacob necessarily, but we like a big inflammation in the brain that make at least some nervous program and at worst, even like coma or things which look like to cross-reled Jacob. And in the art, also, it's very bad because we see we are in the myocarditis, the thrombosis, the stroke, everything are linked to this inflammation. In the point that is AC2 receptor, they are present in all the body in Krakwasi, all the organs, all the fluids. So that's why, depending on your genetic of your personal default, we are nobody's perfect. So it will attack an organ another depending on your default and for sure, it's not everybody which is ill because of COVID or because of the vaccine, we have all different sensibility. But I think for everybody, it's doing inflammation. So that's why sometimes we are treated of compilities. So we are saying that vaccine are not good, but we have never said that COVID is a little flu or something. We are trying to cure COVID since the beginning. We are interested also in long COVID. I think when people are not treated by whatever treatment I'm making now, as it's for me, it's a trap. I think you have more chance after the long COVID because you let this inflammation go in the body. And as we see the works of Dr. Mallon and our teams contrary to what said Moderna, the mRNA and especially the spike can be found two months after the vaccine shots and also with COVID that remains. So if you make, for example, vaccine several shots, then you don't have like an acute inflammation, you get chronic inflammation if you don't cure COVID or if you do some several shots without taking care of following your inflammation. I don't know, CRP etc. You have to check your inflammation level because it can be chronic. And I think it's this chronicity that's made all the disease we see for long COVID and also for vaccination. So far we've been talking about either messenger RNA vaccines or adenoviral DNA vaccines where there's just no control over uptake of the genetic material, how much spike protein is made, where it's made, and for what duration of time is made. Let's switch gears and talk about Novavax and Corbavax vaccines, which are the antigen-based vaccines, where at least the amount of spike protein, the quantity is known. What's your viewpoint there? Do they have that they pose the same mechanistic risks as a genetic vaccines? For me, I'd begin for two years because the problem of the mRNA vaccine and the vaccine is that they are doing the spike protein in an uncontrolled manner everywhere and this is a problem. And also with the doses of modern average, three times the doses of Pfizer, you see sometimes more problem. And so it's a really uncontrolled country, what they say that it would be very nice and only on the extent of some cells. In fact, there are some spike protein which can be found in the circulation. It's not controlled as they said. But so I think like you and my people, I think that the saturated vaccine will control those of vaccine, which would be better because at least we know that those like common vaccine, we put the activated vaccine and you know the dose of it's really less spike which is sent or produced in the body. But I've seen there are also some problems. I'm not really deeply this. But anyway, I think that spike is very toxic. So it's something which shouldn't be sent in the body. And it has been a bit shown that even if we think it's deactivated in this vaccine, like it's seen that it can maybe react also with AC tube. And I think regarding the efficacy, which is very low, like I said, because it doesn't make some immunoglobine A. And the fact that a spike is soaked inflammatory. I don't see really severe interest. But I mean potentially I think that this vaccine may be less toxic than mRNA vaccine. But I think we don't know enough now. And definitely I don't know enough now from this. I would prefer this vaccine to the mRNA vaccine, which I think we need 20 years more to be already on the mRNA technology. And also you cannot produce any control of this spike protein, which is known to be toxic since 20 years. I mean, it's really known. So I'm surprised that we have tried this on the whole humanity with a protein, which is very known to be so inflammatory and to act on a receptor once again, AC tube, which is linked to a rainy angiotensin system that drives the inflammation in the body, but also regulates the tension and I mean, yeah, the pressure in the blood. So so many important targets that I am amazed that we have the weight, we send some spike protein and voluntary in the body. What is it about the spike protein that causes a coagulation to the extent it does? No, on the spike protein, I think there was a lot of change in which time we don't know if it's natural or will have a rotary. But the first thing before this, I wanted to say that it's a in comparison to the first spike protein, it has evolved. And there's something which is called the furin sites, which make which has been changed and which make this this task of unique in the 3000 SaaS curve we know, and which make it very, very replicable. So it's very hard when one is a body to to rub the replication. It's something very important. Then on the calculation, I think so information spike is very inflammatory, but especially on coagulation is the S, the spikes and the end protein or so which bind the the area name, they are activating a system which is called a mass per mass protein. And this there is like a complex which goes directly on which recognize the virus. And it's called it's called mass to mass to and mass one and activated what is called the complement pathway. It's you know, inflammatory pathway, which which ultimately lead to a coagulation and activation of thrombin and it's very known and documented that the the lectin so complement the lectin complement pathway, which which is used by the disruption of this mass complex which goes directly recognize the S and the end protein, activate some process that lead to coagulation. So there is both inflammation and coagulation which are induced by S and N protein. It's like a inflammatory and coagulary bone. So, so Jeff, I want to ask you in the last few minutes, we're awaiting the release of the new vaccines this fall that will be considered multivalent vaccine. So there'll be some genetic code for the original wild type spike protein and then some for you know, in the Omicron variant spike protein. These were approved and will be approved just by the basis of antibodies. So it raises the issue of our antibodies and adequate surrogate to ensure any type of clinical efficacy. But first we if we if understand so the new vaccine we will they will mix the first S called V2 origin and also the the Omicron variant that's it. And I think the same there is a simple and that it's not going to make the good immunoglobulin A secretary which are made by the other areas. But we could think it's interesting because the if you put a bit of Omicron, then we are you are closer of the of the actual colleague. So you are you have less chance to make what is called antibody dependent inencement, which are antibodies that recognize the virus, but they are not not really utilizing the virus. They are helping the virus to divide because they are not efficient, they got there are two distance from the actual virus. So we only crump. We only crump vaccine maybe it could be better than the original 2020 vaccine on the paper. So but since we don't do the IGA secretary, which I important and once again, I think it's by your vision, you don't better than me. I think it's rarely done or it's never been done to to to make some vaccine of different kind like this and to accept this so quickly. We are doing some tests the problems that we are going so fast all the time. We are just trying and after we sent it on 1000, I mean, millions of people. I would like to talk about the pregnant women, which are been tested normally you test on pregnant women 10 years after the vaccine is bonk and then we are we are making some experiments on the on the pregnant women. So all these things should have been straight before in research and not trying like this on a million of people. So I am so I have some problem about the efficacy and the toxicity of this because I think we don't have any distance. Well, you know, you make a great point. We've had a ton of SARS-CoV-2 infections. There's been plenty of opportunities for more randomized trials. There haven't been a single randomized trial with hospitalization and death as a primary endpoint, not even a signal that is secondary or tertiary endpoints. We're going to have to leave it here because we're coming towards the end of the interview. We've been talking with Jia for a while, like guard from Marseille, France. He's a PhD, a cellular immunologist, a molecular biologist. Jeff, do you have any final words for our audience? I don't know if there are so many things to stick. I think it's I'm really what I think is based on science and I've worked on hundreds of hours with friends on this and I would have liked that a good vaccine which would not be toxic would have been done. It could have been a tool, but I think it's very it's not working. So anyway, people want to use it. It's okay, but I don't like the idea that it's becoming mandatory and because we know we see that it doesn't rub the APDME clearly. I think the solution is really we have to go back to the therapies and I think the doctors on the field, they know that the Alleto machine is working either making it working and the next time it's only working and there's other things which are working. Once again, it's not only because they are antiviral, it's because they are anti inflammatory and the exhibit is a good thing, but I think we should all focus the researcher on blocking the special pathways or induced by the by the S-proteins to cure COVID to cure the long COVID and even to cure the effects that we see on the vaccine because it's the same pathway that are activated. So with the same thing and we have also some good ideas on this. It's all the same process, which is concentrated in the vaccine. So we have to target the inflammation more than the antiviral activity, I think. Well, wow, that's been a great summary. Jean, for us, Juan LeGard. Thank you so much for joining us on the McCullough Report. Yeah, thanks a lot. Let's get real. Let's get loud. On America, I'll talk radio. This is a McCullough Report."
