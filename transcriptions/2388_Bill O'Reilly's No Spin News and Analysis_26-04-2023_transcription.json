Welcome to the No Spin News Tuesday, April 25, 2023. Stand up for your country. So very early this morning, the Biden administration put out a video of the president announcing he will run again in 2024. The Jewish people have a phrase, Oi vei. And I say that with humor, but this is kind of an unusual problem that we have. The Democratic Party doesn't really want President Biden to run according to polls. Most Democrats say they don't have somebody else, but there isn't anybody else. So at this point in history, and I still believe that Joe Biden will not run. So I think things are going to get worse for his mental health and for the country in the next six months, but I could be wrong. Couple that with the most, I don't know, flamboyant television news operation in the country, Fox News, also in a dubious position because of the Tucker Carlson situation will get to that. But first, the talking points memo Joe Biden's America. It was surprising to me that after he was elected in 2020, and more than 80 million Americans voted for him, but really most of those votes were against Donald Trump. But it surprised me that from the jump, Mr. Biden was an enthusiastic supporter of the progressive movement. I mean, the far left. And we have documented that Southern border, unfettered abortion, on and on and on and on. There isn't any progressive tenant, not one that Mr. Biden opposes. That has led to a new America. So first I'm going to run you Mr. Biden's announcement part of it, and then we'll run down 10 things that have changed drastically, culturally, for all of us in this country. Roll the soundbite, please. This is not a time to be complacent. That's why I'm running for reelection. Because I know America. I know we're good and decent people. I know we're still a country that believes in honesty and respect and treating each other with dignity. Okay, standard issue, nothing unusual about that. Usually the old presidents make announcements in person. Not on videotape. So culturally, here's what's going on. If President Biden is reelected, we can expect more of the same. We're not going to change. And he'll be 86 years old when his terms end in 2028, 86. Now first of all, I want you to consider the 10 things that I'm putting forth to you and how even six years ago, this could not have happened in this country. That's how quickly things are changing. The first is the transgender athlete controversy. Okay? So there's a new NPR poll out. It's a liberal organization. Ask a question, do you support or oppose the following, allowing transgender female student athletes to compete on women's and girls' war teams? Support 24 oppose 63. I mean, that is a colossal repudiation of having trans men compete with biological women. It's stunning. All right? 63 to 24. Yet, Joe Biden, okay with it, I'm not quite figuring that out. If I have a daughter and she has to compete against a biological man who's changed his gender into a her, well that person is going to be stronger. Is that fair? No, it's not. Then there's the Trans Advertising on Television and some teachers promoting alternative lifestyles in schools. We all know what that controversy is. Three states have now restricted schools from teaching about gender, South Dakota, Alabama, and Florida and more to come. Okay? So this was a big, big issue in Florida. They called it the don't say gay, but it wasn't really that. It was about parents saying, look, we don't want our young children to be subjected to a teacher whose views may be different than our views about social and gender issues. Okay. Then we get into the 1619 project. Remember that? So New York Times championed this and it basically says that America was built on slavery. The whole country was built on it and therefore the United States owes African Americans because of that. Well, my upcoming book Killing the Witches will absolutely obliterate that theory because we started the Mayflower and you'll see what happened historically. Everything's backed up. So the 1619 project is really propaganda. It's a political play. But what it does is it sets up permanent grievance in the African American community because it's taught in many schools. And the black kids hear it and they go, hey, you owe me reparations. You owe me whatever. Equity on and on and on. This is a permanent grievance play. Have we heard anything from Biden about this? No. He wants to all come together, but this is about as polarizing an issue as possible. Okay. So then we have non-punishment of criminals. So I had to do this. It's hard to get these stats, but I'm going to give you just one so you understand before COVID 2019. Okay. And then 2022 after COVID, 2022, the murder rate, I'm sorry, the this is after COVID, starting after COVID, murder rate is up 30% in the country, the murder rate. Up 30%. So we are becoming a more violent. Now the left says it because of guns, but somebody's firing those guns. And in the big cities, criminals are not being punished the way they used to be. And almost all crime is up. I mean, if you don't believe me, ask Gavin Newsom, the uber liberal mayor, Governor of California, who just moved the National Guard into San Francisco to restore order and cut down on the drug dealing. Okay. So it's happened. Where is your Biden on that? No, we don't hear a thing. Then we go to academia. On many colleges, you cannot bring in a speaker like me or anybody that goes against the progressive orthodoxy because students don't feel safe. So they only get one point of view. Everybody knows that. And then you have the admissions where skin color and ethnicity is now at the top of the list. I mean, some of the stats are amazing. So standardized testing thrown out in many places and it's like, okay, we're going to take that group, this group in college admissions. Then we have the wealth tax, which is seizure of private property. And again, Biden is okay with all of the things that I've mentioned and he's okay with the wealth tax. The wealth tax basically taxes what you have, not what you sell for income. It's what you have. So the tax man will come in and assess your car value, your house value, property value, your jewels, your collectibles. And then every year in Massachusetts, you pay 4% on that. That's the only state that's passed it. But Oregon, Washington, New York, Hawaii, Connecticut, California, Illinois and Maryland are introducing wealth taxes. Bives, okay? Pay your fair share. But that's confiscation of private property. Government can't confiscate 4% of your private property. It will be ruled unconstitutional. I know it will be. It gives a constitution, gives the power to the federal government to tax income. Money that's coming into you. Not possessions. Okay. That's socialism. Then the entertainment industry, I can't tell you how the movie television publishing industries have collapsed because the projects that they are developing are almost 100% woke. The only exception on television is blue bloods, the CBS program that I know of. Everything else is woke. And the traditional audience is going, we don't want it. When was the last time you went to a movie theater? I was a big movie fan. The last time I went to a movie theater was the James Bond movie, the last one, which was so horrible because it was all woke. And my late friend Sean Connery, I mean, I can't even imagine what he would have said had he been here. Then the acceptance of degrading public behavior, this is colossal if you live in a big or mid-sized city. So now people defecate, urinate on the streets, consume narcotics on the streets with children, being able to see all of this. This is degrading behavior, which used to be punished. If you did it on the street, you were punished. Now you're not. And this is a huge problem in every urban center. And it's the kids that gives us a no, what's that needle? And San Francisco is again the show place for this, but it's happening everywhere. It's absolutely unbelievable. Then you have the final is a tax on the Catholic church. And this is an underreported story that me and I didn't want anything to do with since the decision to give abortion law back to the states, there have been at least 147 attacks on Catholic churches across the country. 147. Do you hear about that? Now if a synagogue is attacked, everybody hears about it. Mosque? Everybody hears about it. Catholic church? They even defaced St. Patrick's Cathedral, the largest church in New York City and the most prominent Catholic church in the nation. They caught the defacers who was spray-framing F.U. on the cathedral on videotape. They arrested, the police arrested them. No charges. Alvin Bragg. No charges. The damage I talked to the cardel was about $30,000, $40,000. No charges. Hadem, guys were on tape doing it. No. So this is the progressive world. And if you can show me one of these that I've just given you, just one, where Joe Biden said, you know, maybe that's not right. Maybe we shouldn't be doing that or we should take action to stop that. Nothing. She, Putin, Mullah's in Iran, danger. And they're going to test us soon. But this cultural stuff, this affects us every day, every hour of every day. And the children and grandchildren. And that's the memo. President schedule today, 1230 discusses how investing in America is good. All right? That's nice. Seven o'clock he meets with South Korean president, Yoon, and the first lady, Ms. Kim. And they go to the Korean War Memorial. And that's good. South Korea is a good ally of ours.

Let's go to the media ferocious reaction to the Tucker Carlson story. Six years ago when I left Fox News there was ferocious reaction to that. I lived through it. And that's why we started the no spin news that you're watching now or listening to our on a radio. A hundred affiliates pick us up every day. And Carson, you know, he had a lot of fans and a lot of people who hate his guts. Most of those people work in the corporate media. Roll the tape. Word has just come down that Fox News media and Tucker Carlson have agreed to part ways. Thank you for your service. We're going to have to apply our contributor. Wave. You know, we'll talk more about it tomorrow because but we wanted to make sure that we let you know what was going on. Well, can I ask the audience if they'll help me do something? Come on folks. How to say hi to the panel. This isn't about ideology here. This isn't about left or right or taxes. The man was consistently saying that black people don't deserve to be here. He had no use for African Americans or Jewish people or Hispanic people or anything else like that unless he was platforming their bigotry like he did with Kanye West when he was talking about Nicki Minaj and anti-vax. the only used people who were not white in order to promote bigotry. Tucker Carlson is out at Fox News. Couldn't have happened to a better guy. Um. What I will say though is. While I'm very glad that the person that is arguably responsible for the. Some of the largest driving some of the most amounts of death threats and violent threats, not just to my office, but to plenty of people across the country. I might point out that Tucker Carlson had a move out of Washington, DC because people were coming to his home and disturbing him and his family in a violent way. Remember that? Maybe somebody want to remind Congresswoman on cost of quotas about that. Celebrity react very muted. I'm surprised. Most of the left wing bomb throwers like George Clooney, people like that silent. Rob Reiner, Liz Cheney, Stephen King, Behar, of course, Chrissy Teigen, Megan McCain. They all said bad things about Tucker Carlson. Now I have said I've been on a lot of shows. Some of you might have seen me on News Nation last night. I'll be on News Nation again tonight with Dan Abrams talking about the business side of this, which we're going to talk about with our various student guests in a moment. And you know, basically people are going to want to know the inside story and I know it. I know what happened there and I gave it to yesterday. If you missed it and your premium and cost of your members, you can access it anytime and get a free transcript of it. Okay, there's a business decision made to remove Tucker Carlson from his APM slot. So cable companies make money in two ways. The system that you pay every month, Comcast or Fios or any of those big, they pay Fox News a fee to carry the network. And it's a big fee. So in the beginning, when I started the network along with Roger Ailes and a bunch of other very talented people, we got no money because we're new. And then it built up to the highest fee of any cable news operation by far. So that money is the centerpiece of their profit center and then they get advertising. Now, Mr. Carlson didn't have much lucrative advertising because of the left wing boycott against him. All right, so Mercedes and these people, you know, they just buckle. So his program wasn't the big profit center, Carlson. Nevertheless, a lot of SNC viewers, if you believe my mail, and I'll read it at the end of the program, are very angry. And there's no doubt that Fox News today is a lot different than when I left it six years ago. There's no question about that. So joining us now from New York City is Dr. Elisa George. She's a sociopressor of economics from Hunter College. So there's a lot of things I want to ask you about. The corporate media, which influences politics and elections and cultural things, as I was just pointing out, the corporate media isn't really driven by ideology, even though most of its left. It's driven by profits. Would you agree with that? I would. Okay. So it's definitely driven by profits over the long run. Right. So profits are sacrosanct. And if the company believes that an individual isn't going to hurt their profit margin, that individual is going to go. And it's as simple as that. It doesn't matter who it is. Would you agree with that? I would. I would. Okay. From your purchase in economics teacher, do you believe that Fox News will decline in revenue and profits because of the moves they have made? Well, I think the answer to that question depends a little on your time perspective and the balance of what's coming in the next few years. So we're at the start. We're in a low news period kind of easing into a new election cycle. And there are, there are definitely downsides of moving away from a widely viewed. A widely viewed journalist and program, but there's also opportunities. So, so Fox wants and needs middle of the road undecided viewers who maybe haven't developed firm opinions on every issue that will come ahead yet. And that gets harder and harder the longer someone, a longer a journalist is on the air and their views on many issues become known and fixed. It's hard to move away from those. And so if there was going to be a time to make a switch, this seems like a good time for that switch. Okay. Now, I don't know whether you follow my career, but we did that on the O'Reilly factor. In fact, we took surveys. And the last survey that we took, the audience was comprised. I believe it was 50% conservative, 20% liberal and 30% independent. And I programmed for a wide audience. And we were able to pull that off. 16 years, number one, consecutive years. Mr. Carlson, he programmed hard right. However, they were very loyal. Those viewers to him were extremely loyal to him. And they came in. The average cable news viewer comes in twice a week. His people came in more than that. And now his people are canceling a lot of their subscriptions to Fox. You don't think that's going to hurt them at bottom line. So I'm not so sure about the canceling subscriptions to Fox over some period of time, but you're right to emphasize that it's not the viewer of a particular program at a particular time. But is this something that kept people on the network and demanding the time Warner or now Comcast keeps the station? And there is possibly room to make up for some of that with new advertising revenue and new subscribers as well. But Fox Nation is where Carlson really drove the profit center, not on his program as I pointed out because he couldn't get advertising. But the Fox Nation, which is different from Fox News, that's a fee, a separate fee that people pay like Bill O'Reilly.com. You pay it and then you have total access to whatever we do. But Fox Nation is hemorrhaging now because Carlson was their main star. But let's move ahead to CNN. CNN is collapsed in revenue because of their hate Trump policy. Just drove every discretionary viewer out of there. And then when they had a management change and the management said, look, we're not going to do this anymore. We don't like Trump, but we're not going to do 24-7 trying to put a nail on his head. The viewers did not come back to CNN. It's a disaster over there. Sign on to sign off. I think one of the things we've learned from a few decades of research in media markets is that viewers really do like and appreciate news that aligns with their general attitudes and preferences. Not necessarily on every single topic, but they do like to see their point of view reflected in news. And so that makes it difficult to move your position around on the spectrum. So Fox has centered its position possibly on the left. There's more battles. But once you put the stake in the ground, it's hard to shift. And I think that's some of what you see in right now. At CNN, for sure, they don't know what they want to be over there. And that's why. But in Fox News, they have another problem coming up. And see, my opinion is that Fox News revenue is going to deeply, deeply decline. Because they don't want Trump, the management ownership of Fox News doesn't want Trump back in the White House. And the MAGA people and that's a substantial portion of the Fox audience. They're going to see that. They've already seen it. And that's going to cause more angst on the part of this corporate outfit. I'll give it a last word. I think that possibly this battle is one that you've learned well, which is the center, the center right cable news market versus the Internet pieces. And the smaller cohorts in these becoming niche markets. And so I personally don't think the MAGA crowd is enough to drive the Fox News today away from its center right position. But I might be wrong. Well, no, it's not that they're going to be mad. You don't want to give your television or radio person. You don't want people angry with you. That's not the way to success. I mean, you can tee them off. You know, and I have. I mean, I'm not afraid to do that. And one of the reasons that Fox got in trouble with Dominion, as you know, I'm sure, is that they pander to the audience rather than telling the audience the truth. And that started this whole chain of events, which I think is going to lead to bad news for Fox News in the future. Dr. Thanks very much. We appreciate you coming on and taking the time.

One of the reactions last night confused me and I'm not easily confused. I know pretty much what's happening in this world. So I was on eight o'clock on Cuomo as I usually am on Wednesday, but I went on Monday because it's a big breaking story. I will be on Wednesday too. And tonight I'll be on Abrams show on News Nation, which I think is trying to be fair. By the way, that network. So anyway, after me last night on the Abrams program, Megan Kelly came on and, you know, she left Fox News. So obviously she was a guest in context of the day. And here's what she said. Go. One of the last things I remember seeing before I left Fox News, Dan was Bill O'Reilly doing a segment in 2016 on whether Barack Obama was a Muslim. And this is six. There's a very high tolerance at Fox for things that are a little out there off point and don't make the network look good. So I didn't know what she was talking about. I'm going, what? What are you talking about? I was feared of Barack Obama. So then, of course, I had my crack staff research. Now, the segment she's talking about was when the factor uncovered some pictures of Barack Obama as an adult dressed in Muslim garb. And the discussion was how much of an emotional tie does the President of the United States have to Islam. And here's what I said. According to his half sister, Barack Obama attended his half brothers wedding in the early 1990s, Malik Obama was a Muslim. The factor has obtained pictures allegedly from that wedding, which we believe was held in Maryland. Details on the ceremony, the exact location, whether the reports that Barack Obama was the best man, are very difficult to verify at this point. What we can tell you with certainty is that Barack Obama has deep emotional ties to Islam. Now, to some extent, I can identify with President Obama on the religion issue. As a Roman Catholic, I was appalled when the priest's pedophilia scandal broke. There's absolutely no excuse for the Catholic Church covering up many horrendous crimes. However, like Barack Obama, I do make the distinction between the faith and the people who abuse it. Now, does that sound like some kind of a little out there? Does it make the network look good? I remember I didn't get many hate mail, even the far left cranks, media matters and these idiots. You know, it was kind of, this is what we found, this is the context of it. So why would Meghan Kelly use that as an example of how Fox News accepts quote unquote extremist commentary? I don't know. I don't particularly care if I have to be honest. I really don't. But it was so weird. And I'm going to this day, I'm going, what is that? If you think you know, billatbillowReilly.com, billatbillowReilly.com. I'm not smart enough to grasp what that was all about. I guess she didn't want, she wanted to make me look bad, but I don't even know. Let's go to Bud Light. Sales down 17% bar sales, according to Beerboard website, of 35%. And another executive, Daniel Blake, is in place on a leave all this after they hired the transgender person Dylan Mulvaney, which will get down to history is one of the biggest blunders in marketing, in corporate marketing ever. Okay, so Bud Light. I don't drink beer. So I can't tell you, but I know that my friends who do, they're drinking Coors Light now, instead of Bud Light. I don't know, I don't care. Totally different world. I'm not in the alcohol world. Smart life. So I was very pleased to see this study. UCLA, in association with the universities in Australia, Ecuador, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, examined kindness. Very simple concept. And their study was published in scientific reports. They found that people all over the world, signal others for assistance, every couple of minutes. And the vast majority of the time people give them assistance. So you got a flat, you need help. The dog ran away, whatever it may be. You ask people for help. And most of them, the vast majority of them help. I said, finally, some good news, right? So why is this in a smart life segment? You may remember harking back to Lent where I said I wasn't given up anything, but I was doing a random act of kindness every day, which I did a pretty good job on. By the way, I missed a couple of days, but I would search out situations where I could help people. And I examined that and I said, you know, I'm going to continue that as a life philosophy. Now, we're all distracted. And here's the key to kindness. In order to be a kind person, you have to think about other people. And our narcissistic society is against that. You always think about yourself. And you know whether you're a narcissist or not. Most narcissists will never admit it, but you know. But in order to do an act of kindness, you have to think about other people. Yeah, really it's too bad. A guy standing there in the rain with a flat tire, maybe I'll pull over and help him with it. Okay, thinking about the guy in the rain, you don't even know him. Now, why is this smart? Because it builds up karma. Okay. Now karma swings both ways. If you're bad, something's going to happen. Not a matter of if. It's when. If you're good, it'll come back to you. It will. And I don't care whether you believe in God or you believe in the amoeba turning into the brontosaurus, which is one of my favorite analogies now. It doesn't matter to me. You're kind. All right, particularly to the people who really need that helping hand. Children and animals and you know, defenseless people, you're kind. You help. Going to come back. All right, I hate to get a little touchy feel here, but it's true. This day in history, April, twenty, fifty thousand one, twenty two years ago, President George W Bush went on good morning America and said to the country that we, the United States will militarily defend Taiwan at the Chinese Communist attack. That was the last time that a sitting president said that. Twenty two years ago. Now the USA is moving troops into the Philippine Islands close to Taiwan. Did you know that? Thunder way. This is bad over there. The American people will not support military action in defense of Taiwan. I don't believe they will. It's very difficult. But if the firing breaks out, the American people will support economic sanctions against China, which of course would happen first. Military at this point in this country. I could be wrong, but I don't think they're going to support it majority. Anyway, that happened twenty two years ago today. Bush on GMA. Good male segment. A lot of it on Mr. Carson. And our final thought will be right back. Let's go to the mail. Sharon on the message board. If you are a premium or concierge, remember you get to message board. You make friends. You have fun. Bill at Bill O'Reilly dot com. Name in town if you wish to opine. If you want to let me know what you think. Sharon says it would not surprise me if Chuck Schumer had something to do with the firing of Tucker Carlson. He had nothing to do with it. I can tell you that with a hundred percent certainty. Chuck Schumer does not have that kind of pull. Hugh on a message board. Bill, today my Bill O'Reilly premium membership renewed. Excellent. Excellent, you. And I canceled my Fox Nation subscription. No money to the Murdochs. You got about 700 new members last night? I'm surprised. What a surge. One day. So it's because people are they want straightforward commentary. And you'll get it here on bill O'Reilly dot com. David Kans here. Remember, thank you, David. Direct access to me. Bill, it's my humble opinion. And Tucker Carlson's conspiracy theory antics have finally caught up with him. All right, case to be made for that. Kathleen McCloud. O'Reilly, you will now be my eight o'clock news moving ahead. I don't like to boycott, but Fox has lost me as a viewer. Okay, we'll see how long. I don't like boycotts either. So don't get me wrong. I'm not calling for that. Casey Clay, Olathe, Kansas. FNC lost viewers and revenue when you were no longer there, missed to O. And the same will happen now that Tucker Carlson has gone. Although your style different from his, both of you are critical in exposing the truth. I'm a lifetime premium member of Bill O'Reilly dot com. Thank you, Casey. And we'll become a lifetime member of whatever Tucker Carlson does. Okay, well, he'll be happy to hear that. Thomas Bell Elmwood Park, New Jersey. Bill, thank you for your uniquely principled journalism, your discipline, presenting a fact based news program has certainly been a moderating influence on many of us in your audience. As your humble subscriber, I politely suggest you cautiously approach the Tucker Carlson news. I am cautious in all of my research. But then when I'm on the air, I let it fly. I think I've been very fair to Tucker Carlson. If you disagree, please let me know. But I don't think I could have been any more fair. I explained exactly what happened, why it happened, complimented him on a number of things and criticized him for a lack of discipline sometimes in his presentation. I mean, I'm fair. But if you disagree, I want to hear from you. Bill Forrest Woodbridge, Virginia. Lots of my friends are upset that Tucker is gone. I told them there's a great alternative, and that is Bill O'Reilly dot com and then it'll spend news. For more than 20 years, you've been my number one go-to for the facts and clarity of all things. I appreciate that Bill. Very nice of you to say that. Richard Schaffer, Montreal, Canada, with the first TV, consider Tucker as a talent in their lineup. Look, Tucker Carlson would bring numbers and viewers to any media operation. But he's expensive because he'll make a lot of money on his own. If he does a Joe Rogan type podcast, something like that. So, you know, it's about money. Just remember that. Follow the money. Lea Lopez, Lake Worth, Florida. What are your thoughts on the process of interrogating my orcas? He's a hapless stooge. And I don't want to be disrespectful, but that's what he is. I don't know what's going on aboard. It doesn't care. He lives in Georgetown. He's got his private cars. He's got his retinue bodyguards. He eats out free every night. And care? Biden White House calling the shots on him. John Jack Conte, Louisville, Tennessee. Thank you, Mr. Riley, for killing books. I've read most of them. Just finished killing the mob. I want to say your writing style along with Mr. Dugard is so smooth and informative. I find myself lost for hours within the pages. My next buy is killing England. You'll like it. So I appreciate the kind words killing books continue to go wild. Jackie York, Estelle Springs, Tennessee. The United States of Trump was my beach read last week. Excellent. Wow. What insight? I bought it in your deal on Bill O'Reilly.com with Krilling Crazy Horse. And we are going to get to that deal right now. So if you get killing Crazy Horse and the United States of Trump, you pay only 18 bucks. That is a deal of the century. All right. Plus you get a free bumper sticker. Two of them. Atheist, nothing there. If you buy killing the legends and killing the mob together, there's the bumper sticker. I'm going too fast for the director. But mob and legends together, that's 18 bucks too. And you get the bumper sticker. It's free. Now, I want to show you from Mother's Day, the best gift of any gift in the world other than diamonds and rubies and all that. T-shirts, team normal, go. Here we have the models. Look at those shirts. They look, the models. They're in the little, what is that? Behind them. The spring bloom. But the shirts are fabulous from op. Again, buy anything from Bill O'Reilly.com store. You get too free. Atheism, nothing there. Bumper stickers, which are great. You love them. Team normal, get on the team. Final thought in a moment. Okay. Here is the final thought of the day. I mentioned it earlier. I'm not going to spend a lot more time. But we have an assurge of premium and concierge members. And we are overjoyed to have you guys, new people watching and listening to us all over the world. Okay. But if there's something you feel I'm not doing correctly, if I'm not fair, if I'm not clear enough, write me. Okay. Let me know. Well, this program is 100% for you to help your life, to inform you. We will always be honest with you. We don't calculate what we say here. You're going to need us in the next year as things are going to get a little more rough in this country.
