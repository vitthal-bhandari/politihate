alright medical association participants experienced 85% less knee pain here's the deal guys try a pair risk free for 60 days and experience the difference they can make in your life it's the most powerful shock absorption system ever put into a shoe buy a pair today and save 15% with free returns and easy exchanges you have nothing to lose go to gravity to fire dot com use code rubin for a 15% discount on your first order test a pair risk free and experience the difference they can make in your life go to gravity to fire dot com use code rubin for a 15% discount and now back to me so many of you probably noted that yesterday's show yesterday's rubin report we were we were live at 2 p.m. not our normal 11 a.m. eastern time and the reason for that was I was over at the Valuetainment Studios in Fort Lauderdale for the Patrick Bette David podcast Patrick and I got into he's he does mostly business stuff on his show but it's sort of everything's colliding like business entertainment politics these things are all colliding into one thing and he also is a guy much like me who moved himself his family several companies to Florida during covid and we got into what's going on in the Republican race specifically I mentioned him up top something that I said to you guys on the show the other day that there are kind of two things that you're looking for in a candidate that I think you should be looking for let's put it that way number one do you roughly agree with the policies right does he roughly this hear her do they roughly make sense economically whatever the social issues you are care about foreign policy borders etc does that kind of fit with what you like maybe not everything but kind of and the second thing do you think they can accomplish it and I think we should mostly be focusing on that because what they believe or not is kind of irrelevant if they can't get any of it done anyway Patrick and I got into what's going on here and we're going to show you two clips of that and then we'll get to DeSantis and Trump and a bunch more here we go. Do you think we are seeing and witnessing where the whole idea of what Nixon lost to John of Kennedy years ago because Nixon was a very qualified candidate more qualified than John F Kennedy Nixon was essentially a Rhonda Santas forget the Watergate example just set that part aside where Nixon had to learn how to go be a little bit more of a showman yeah more presentable and he had to go work with some people behind closed doors do you think that's a fair criticism that Ron is getting in do you think that's going to hurt him or do you think no I think it's irrelevant he can see still has a shot. Well you know last time we sat on this very stage which was probably about four months ago you brought that up that there's a marketing issue with DeSantis to me that's and I'll repeat what I said that time and then I'll give you a new twist on it to me that's a very solvable problem I think what you want out of a candidate or two things you want basically does this guy roughly believe in the things that I believe in politically are we do we have enough stuff that we kind of agree on that I can support this guy and then do you think that this guy can accomplish it that's that I think is the bigger one now because I think we have a lot of people who say the right things but can they actually do it now in my estimation obviously DeSantis call it checks those two boxes. Okay I suppose I just led into that clip with exactly what I said in that clip so you get the point that is what I think is the important thing what what Patrick is focused on and he's a he's a marketing business guy mostly his argument so far is that he likes all of the policies of DeSantis again moved his family here companies here all of that stuff thriving in the free state of Florida what he's been arguing for about a month and a half now is that since the DeSantis launch there hasn't been a good enough marketing machine behind it to catch fire. I can't really argue with that right like you can just at the end of the day is the thing exploding the way I would want it to explode probably not I believe as I said yesterday that in the tortoise and the hair the hair usually wins but we shall see but there might be some marketing issue there which is what he likens to the Nixon vs Kennedy debate from what was at you know like 62 or so when Nixon you know he's up there and he looks kind of gruff and sweaty and more and Kennedy was very telegenic and pleasant and nice to listen to and all of those things. So let's get to one more clip from the pvd podcast as we unpacked all of this stuff a bit more in terms of what DeSantis could do to actually fix that if you believe it's an issue. So that's a very interesting moment. He's basically his position with the mainstream media. So I don't know where you guys are at internally with that but he should you know just yesterday I think they announced that he's doing Meghan Kelly finally now she's been very critical of him partially because he has not done her show. It's a great move to go on that show. He's going on Jake Tapper today at four p.m. So that is an interesting moment. He's basically his position with the mainstream media has basically been you guys lie about everything I'm not going to play your game as opposed to Trump where it's you guys lie about everything I'll constantly play your game. But now he's realizing okay I got to get in on that so we'll see what happens with him and Tapper. I would love to see the guy go on Rogan. He should just say offhand. He should say hey I'll do Rogan why not why wouldn't I do that three hour thing not just the 20 minute thing. He should sit down with those harpies on the view and let them say all of the crazy BS not. Okay I don't need to analyze myself so let's dive right into it yesterday the governor went on Jake Tapper and Tapper went after him sort of or opened it up by saying you know this thing ain't going that well to which desances reply was. So this issue gets into the state of the race because some of your supporters are disappointed that your campaign has yet to catch fire the way they would want in terms of polling. One Republican pollster one who is sympathetic to you I was asking her about your campaign and she said she thought the issue was you bumped up at the beginning because voters Republican voters saw you as a more electable conservative like Trump like Trump without the baggage. But then they say as you go further and further to the right on some of these divisive social issues that could alienate moderates suburban moms etc. Republican voters see you as less and less electable. What do you say to that analysis? Well I don't think it's true I mean the proof is in the pudding I mean I took a state that had been a one point state and we wanted by 20 percentage points 1.5 million votes. Our bread and butter were people like suburban moms. We're leading a big movement for parents rights that the parents be involved in education school choice get the indoctrination out of schools. Of course there's bread and butter issues that matter to inflation more economic opportunity Florida's economies ranked number one of all 50 states. We've worked hard to make that happen crime you see crime in all these different communities that is now even going into suburbs and some areas. So it's interesting because the interview did not get too combative I actually would have liked probably to have seen it got a little more combative like DeSantis literally just out of nowhere be like you know Jake how many times all due respect to your question. How many times did you call it don't say gay on this program how many times has your network done that because you know the word gay wasn't in there but okay those fireworks didn't happen but it's interesting when I when I called Jake Tapper a Democrat or a Democrat activist or an activist as opposed to a journalist. You can see the way he's framing that question he says well there's this polar who says this except DeSantis by as his answer correctly pointed out by focusing on the social issues which are deeply important to moderates and mothers who don't want their kids sexualized and all of these things. DeSantis then won by a landslide so the framing of the question and that's one of the hardest things to get sort of the average non political person to understand they think people just sit down and everything's kind of equal. But Jake takes everything from a position a leftist position DeSantis when you say he's been to the right on these social issues well is it is it far right or even to the right to say that kids shouldn't be sexualized the kids shouldn't be learning about I don't know hardcore anal sex while in third grade is that like a crazy position is that a position of the right in which case I guess most of us are far right. But it continued because that was Tapper's sort of main push point here that DeSantis is just too far right. I don't think that's the reason. I think the reason is is I was getting a lot of media attention at the time coming off the victory. I had to do my job as governor with my legislative session and we had a great legislative session we did a lot of great things actually things that are appeal to huge majorities of the population so I think that that analysis is wrong. But I had to do that and so I was basically taking fire really non stop since then because a lot of people view me as a threat I think the left views me as a threat because they think I'll be Biden and actually deliver on all this stuff. And then of course people that have their allegiances within the allegiances in the public inside you know. Okay to me that's a clean clear answer I say what I'm going to do I'm doing it. I'm going to be better than Trump I can be Biden I'm running the way that I think I should run then your opinions on that are completely up to you. But I think the next part of this is you can't just be on the defense with these people you have to lay out what that positive vision is right you have to do something that's aspirational for people the aspirational part of DeSantis's core message of course was during when this very state that I am sitting in right at this moment became the beacon of freedom for the entire world. Here's DeSantis laying out more of what that vision looks like. And then the second thing I would say is this country needs to have a debate about the country's future. If I'm the nominee we'll be able to focus on President Biden's failures and I'll be able to articulate a positive vision for the future. I don't think it serves us good to have a presidential election focused on what happened four years ago in January and so I want to focus on looking forward I don't want to look back I do not want to see him I hope he doesn't get charged I don't think it'll be good for the country. But at the same time I've got to focus on looking forward and that's what we're going to do. Okay so we'll get more we'll get two more on the Trump indictment and DeSantis's response to the indictment and some of what the surrogates were doing and the lying and selectively edited videos and a whole bunch more. But there he's saying we have to put some of this stuff behind us and we have to start blazing a new trail. I want to show you one more clip from the interview for now which was that a lot of people I know not you guys but a lot of sort of NPC type people who watch MSNBC in the view they think that Florida is a bastion of hatred. They think that we hate gay people and we hate black people and we are just xenophobic bigots and all of the other buzzwords and of course Jake had to ask him about that. In trans adults in the US what are their lives and the lives of the people who love and support them going to be like under a DeSantis administration. In the military it's all about the mission first. So there's a whole bunch of reasons why you focus on mission first. People's individuality it does take you do have to check that at the door and that's not the only example there's a whole host of other examples. So I think the military culture is unique in terms of that. Now in terms of the larger issue the question is is you know what role does someone that's a man have in women's activities even if they conceive themselves to be a woman. I think it's wrong to have men compete in women's sports. I understand some of those men conceive of themselves differently but it's not fair to the girls who are competing it's not fair to the women athletes. The swimmers who lost that national championship to the Penn swimmer I mean they've been training too. So I don't think it's good for that and I think having things like locker rooms where they're having to share with somebody who's of the opposite sex you know I think is wrong. So I would respect everybody but what I wouldn't do is turn society upside down to be able to accommodate which is a very very small percentage of the population. So that's one thing right there right then number two he's talking about biological men in women's sports the thing that we all know to be true right that biologically men are generally stronger and bigger and better at sports than women it's just reality. Show me the chick who's ready to play in the NBA she doesn't exist every single NBA player would be the MVP and the WNBA we all know it. And then thirdly he's saying but I will treat everyone with respect you don't up end society for the minority you want to respect minorities right you want to give them equality under the law. So he's not saying jail trans people he's not saying they can't be in relationships he's not saying they can't be married or any of those things he's saying you just don't up end everything normal everything sensible everything that we've put to bed in the past. In the name of the new minority hysteria of the day and we all know that's true and unfortunately that's what we've at least the modern left has been doing with virtually everything. So now let's move on to Trump a little bit and I want to give him a fair shake to Trump went on Hannity last night they did another one of these town halls they seem to be doing them about once every month or so. And Hannity asked Trump about the deep state and whether he effectively dealt with it last time and kind of what he would do going forward if he becomes president again. And it was wild that's what we found out all of the corruption had I not fired Comey you wouldn't know any of the things that you were talking about. You think they would have destroyed you. Well they were trying to take me out yeah they were trying to take me out I mean it was like a coup it was like a coup had I not you know it's very interesting some people that are very smart that you know very well said when I did it. Oh that was a mistake that was a mistake you're going to cause now they say it was the greatest instinctual move they've ever seen because Comey was a very bad guy and Comey led that group of thugs in there and they were doing a number they were very dishonest. It's years and years of putting in people Democrats and rhinos and other people but putting them into office and we got rid of a lot of them but we're going to get rid of a lot more a lot more because you have some bad. Okay I want to give Trump credit first before I even analyze anything there he's saying something actually very honest at the beginning of this which is that you get there and then you have a little time to figure out who the good guys and the bad guys are right. I referenced it yesterday that he was a New York City real estate guy and branding and marketing guy and TV host for you know decades before this so getting to the VC swamp I actually grant him a very very long leash on figuring out how deep the swamp goes who are the swamp members and all of those things I think that that's worth mentioning. What's interesting there is you know he's saying you know I got rid of Comey but of course he replaced him with Christopher Ray and the base basically hates Christopher Ray and Christopher Ray was in essence as much a part of the swamp as anybody but okay I'll take his word for it that he has learned some things and that he would do a better job next time. I thought it was worth jumping back to something from about two weeks ago you may remember when Trump was on Fox News with Bret Baer and he asked him the same thing about the deep state and would he be able this time to hire the right people because the track record kind of isn't there. Okay in 2016 you said that I'm going to surround myself with only the best and most serious people. Well I did do that this time. This is the best economy we've ever had. This time. This time. Your Vice President Mike Pence is running against you. Yeah. Your Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. She's running against you. Your former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he's not supporting you. You mentioned National Security Advisor John Bolton. He's not supporting you either. You mentioned Attorney General Bill Barr says you shouldn't be President again. It calls you the consummate narcissist and troubled man. You recently called and Barr a gutless pig. Your second Defense Secretary is not supporting you. Called you you're responsible. This week you and your White House called your White House Chief of Staff John Kelly weak and ineffective and born with a very small brain. You called your acting White House Chief of Staff Nick Mulvaney a born loser. You called your first Secretary of State Rex Tillerson dumb as a rock. And your first Defense Secretary James Mattis the world's most overrated general. You called your White House Press Secretary Kayla Kennedy Miltoast and multiple times you've referred to your transportation Secretary Elaine Chao as Mitch McConnell's China loving wife. So why did you hire all of them? Like there's a lot there. For some reason the one that made us all laugh. The gutless pig one just seems funny because it's like the type of thing like there's just no chance he said that to his face. Like you're a gutless pig. It's like what you just say. It's like so stupid. Also most people by the way just for the record scientifically most people are born with a small brain. The brain grows over a series of for about what 18 20 years your brain is going to grow. If you if you are born with a giant brain you've got a major problem. So that's just a sidebar. But anyway it's up to you like joking aside. It's up to you to decide okay the track record like again I gave him a lot of credit for not fully understanding the game learning about the game and again I'm saying perhaps he would be much better at the game this time. But I wanted to show you that other clip because it's like the track record simply is not good. I want to show you one other clip from the Hannity town hall last night because chump this is a really bizarre one helped me work through this one I'm going to try to analyze it as honestly as I can as I always do. Trump had some very strong praise for Chinese president Xi Jinping. I will tell you that but think of president Xi central casting brilliant guy you know when I say he's brilliant everyone says oh that's terrible we call it. He runs 1.4 billion people with an iron fist smart brilliant everything perfect there's nobody in Hollywood like this smart brilliant everything perfect and he runs 1.4 billion people. That's an awful lot of credit you're giving a guy that has a society that's going through this. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I'm going to show you how to play the game. I want to show you one other thing that happened related to all the political nonsense of yesterday. Of course, the backdrop of all of this is that Trump got another nonsensical indictment. I have no problem defending him on all of these indictments. This is all crazy BS. It's because he's running for president and everything else. There you go. Cards on the table. He gets indicted and then a video, a 14-second video of later in the day. Well, the indictment was two days ago, but then yesterday, a 14-second edited video of DeSantis responding to the Trump indictment was spread by virtually every single Trump surrogate and Trump-related account online. They were all sharing a 14-second video implying that DeSantis was not strong enough against the indictment. I want to show you the 14-second video. This was spread. It has been seen hundreds of thousands, if not millions of times, 14 seconds. So you knew, even before I saw the video, I was like 14 seconds. It's obviously selectively edited. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions of times, and listened to the way they made it sound like DeSantis was responding to the Trump indictment. The difference between being brought up on criminal charges and doing things like, for example, I think it was shown how he was in the White House and didn't do anything while things were going on. He should have come out more forcefully. Of course that. Okay. I mean, I'm telling you, virtually every surrogate he has, I don't have to name the names, but virtually everyone he's got online, many of whom I've had on this show, were sharing that clip. And the implication was this was Trump's fault. He didn't do anything he was sitting at the White House. Now I want to show you the unedited version of that video. This is from a reporter by the name of Meg Konard. She was with the AP. She was a little bit further back in that room. Brought up on criminal charges and doing things like, for example, I think it was shown how he was in the White House and didn't do anything while things were going on. He should have come out more forcefully. Of course that. But to try to criminalize that, that's a different issue entirely. And I think that we want to be in a situation where you don't have one side just constantly trying to put the other side in jail. And that unfortunately is what we're seeing now. Do you see how fundamentally different those two clips are? And of course the full clip never goes as viral as the edited clip. He's saying, now you may disagree with him when he's saying, yeah, Trump could have said more. You may disagree with that. That's an opinion whether Trump could have said more or anything else. He did say, you know, be peaceful and all that. But that's an opinion. His very next sentence is you should not be criminalizing this. And his very next sentence after that is, in essence, we cannot have selective justice where we only go after one side. How much more can we possibly ask for in a clear, cogent way? And I think it's important to play that clip. I'm sure I'm going to get plenty of hate for it and probably have a bunch of people turn on me over it. But I think it's important because if this is, you know, this is the information war that we are left with, right? We are in the midst of a matrix style information war where selectively edited clips can be put out and the truth, it's much harder. The truth runs slower than the quick hit of dopamine that you get when you think you can get the other guy and that this is a major, major problem. Anyway, now I want to jump over to the corporate press because CNN has been covering the Trump January 6th indictment. We don't even know what the full extent of the indictment is. I think they're going to have a hell of a time proving that he incited a riot. But okay, let's put that aside for a moment. Here is CNN's Dana Bash with ever insightful information on the Trump arrest. Turns out even Jack Smith can't resist a $5 footlong. According to what we see right there, new and exclusive CNN video of the special counsel at Subway declining though to respond to reporters questions about today's big news. A target letter sent to the former president of the United States, CNN's Evan Perez, was there trying to track down the special counsel. I won't ask you all of the less important things about what he got and how he paid and all that. But what is important is the imagery here. And it clearly wanted us to see him and that image to be very different from what we saw in the former president's post, which is that he's a deranged individual. We're going to mostly focus on the sandwich and what this guy ate, six inch footlong. Did he get lettuce? How much mustard did he have on? And also he's deranged by the way. The guy is completely completely, the way they frame and by the way, that was exclusive video of CNN. My God, that's incredible. CNN had a man standing outside of Subway. Holy sheep, shit. But it continued. It wasn't just Dana Bash. I'm fairly certain this is her husband. Can you Google this real quick? Is Dana Bash married to John King? I'm 99% sure the answer is yes. They're going to Google it while we show you John King also, also analyzing what Jack Smith had for lunch. And just one last point. Jack Smith, remember when the classified documents target letter when Trump announced that there was a lot of commentary. It was Jack Smith making a mistake here. Is he leaving this all to Donald Trump? And then they released the indictment and we all said, wow, wow, we read it. We saw the documentation. We saw the level of detail. Jack Smith going to Subway today is a message to Donald Trump. Donald Trump tries to intimidate people. He tries to bully people. He tries to scare you away. That was Jack Smith with no words and a simple $5 sub in his hand saying, I'm here. I'm not going to. Yeah, the imagery was intentional and spoke volumes. It really is. All right, first off, we did a little Googling. Apparently, Dana, Bash and John King were married. They are now divorced. Let's just put that aside. It's funny that they're still working together on CNN is what it is. That is some of the dumbest analysis I have ever heard in my entire life. He honestly believes and they sit there and they agree with him that somehow Jack Smith, having lunch, I mean, the guy just decided to go for lunch that that was to send a message to Donald Trump like, you see, I'm so calm and cool and collected about this indictment that I can get a $5 six inch Subway sandwich. Okay. They look at him as if that is a sensible thing to say that is any bearing to do with reality. Now, I actually do believe it might be coordinated because why was CNN standing outside the very Subway that the guy was going into? Are they tracking him all day? Like CNN tracking the prosecutor all day long to follow him? I mean, that seems a little weird, but that really sent him. It would have sent a message to Donald Trump if he would have gone to Orange Julius in the mall and been sucking down one of those gross orange things. Like, see, Orange, man, I got you and I'm going to suck you dry. That would have been something by going to Subway. All he's proving is that he wasn't near a Jersey mics because Jersey mics is obviously way better than Subway. Everyone knows that. But if you think that's stupid and you probably do, I'd like to show you something even stupider whoopi Goldberg on the view. You know, it's more of the way me more. I'm sorry about all of this. You know, the young person that the young man they got for espionage recently? Do you know that he's demanding to be treated exactly the same way as Trump was? He wants to be, yes, he wants to be able to go home and do everything. And that's the thing for me that is most egregious. Nobody goes home. Nobody is above the law. You should not be walking. You should actually be in the building. That has the bars on it. Both of you. Okay, the kid that she's talking about is that kid from about what was that, about six weeks ago or so who leaked some classified documents in a discord group. And now he is under arrest and we can have an honest discussion about whether he should be arrested right now or out on bail or anything else. But what whoopi wants is just because Donald Trump is accused of something, right? Just because a DA, whether it's Alvin Bragg up in New York or it's this Jack Smith guy, just because they basically hammy indictment that Donald Trump should automatically be in jail. And then all of the harpies agree and all of the audience agrees. And do you realize how dangerous that would be if every time someone is accused of something, if we automatically throw them in jail until it can be proven? Do you think that might be a problem? Do you think that might be against due process? Yes, yes, you do. Okay, good. But now to the televised mental institution known as MSNBC, they had a presidential historian Michael Beschloss on and he thinks Trump's on his way to becoming a dictator. Yep, that's right. The guy who's under indictment for like 87 things and 4 billion counts of this and that he's the dictator. You know, as Lawrence O'Donnell said, Michael Beschloss, Donald Trump holds the ultimate incentive for her. I mean, he becomes president. Clarence Thomas retires to permanently vacation with his billionaire friends, who by the way, probably won't want to take him anywhere anymore because he can't give him anything anymore. And she gets on the Supreme Court in her late 30s. And then she has, there's no incentive for her to behave herself. If she's MAGA, she can MAGA and there's nothing we can do about it. Well, and the other thing is we have to ask the question, just as Josh was saying, why did Donald Trump choose this moment to tell the American people that he will become a dictator if a lot? Did Donald Trump tell the people he'll become a dictator if elected? Do we, Phoenix, did we drop the clip on that one? The Donald Trump, I'm going to be a dictator. Clip the rocker you want. You're on the computer a lot. Did we ever see the Donald Trump? I'm going to become a dictator clip. And we try. We're doing the best we can over here. These people are absolutely nuts. But it continues with this specialist guy who's supposed to be, again, he's supposed to be a presidential historian, right? He's supposed to give perspective related to previous administrations and the personalities and behind the scenes what makes a president and an administration go and all of that stuff. But he's mostly a Democrat activist. And if you don't believe me, here he is on both Donald Trump and Rhonda Sanders. Rhonda Sanders actually offers a very good warning about what happens in his second Trump term with somebody who's learned his lessons instead of just being a bloviator that goes to Twitter when he's angry. Rhonda Sanders is actually giving him perfect examples. This is how you crush businesses. This is how you intimidate CEOs. Again, I was talking this past week and the Republican from that's worked for the Republican Party for a generation who said the free state of Florida is a joke. This person said I deal with CEOs every day who are petrified, petrified that Rhonda Sanders will notice them and they're keeping their heads down. They're not doing it because they know he has the ability to use the power of the centralized state to crush them or to make their lives miserable. Right. And you've got the front runner of the Republican Party, Donald Trump, the number two candidate by polls, Rhonda Sanders or DeSantis or whatever it is. They're both fascists. They both want authoritarianism in America. We try to get Michael Beshloss on the show. I want to have him emailed absolutely today. What an embarrassing, pathetic human being. He is their fascists. Donald Trump, who's now under sham indictments, is the fascist. Rhonda Sanders, who fought corporations working with governments against the will of the people. He's the fascist. He was fighting fascism, you moron. And Joe Scarborough, who's just, you guys get it with Joe Scarborough, he just makes it up. The idea that CEOs are afraid to come to Florida right now, Florida's economy is booming. We've basically taken all of Silicon Valley and moved it here, the amount of major money makers. And the people, the movers and the shakers, including guys like Donald Trump, who have moved down to Florida, where there are no state income taxes, where we have friendly policies related to regulation and your ability to build a business here and live a fully actualized, thriving life. Everything they say, it's not just that they're lies. They're 180 lies only designed to confuse you. And speaking of 180 lies, only designed to confuse you. Let me say something very controversial right now. If you're going through puberty as a boy, you're going to have a male puberty experience. And if you're going through puberty as a girl, you're going to have a girl, female puberty experience. You may go, Dave, what kind of segue is that? What can you possibly be doing next? Well, here's Dick Levine, our favorite Admiral Dick Levine, who was interviewed a day or two ago, being asked just to show you how crazy these people are. Everything they say is not just a lie. A lie would be one thing. We could put a lie in a pocket and we could get rid of it. Everything they do is a massive 180 smack you in the face with a fucking pie lie. That's what they do. Here's this woman, this man, oh God, I almost did it. You see what happened here? This guy, this guy, is just watching the video, just watching the video. What would you say to folks who think that they're being reasonable by saying, why can't children just wait till they're 18? Adolescence is hard and puberty is hard. What if you're going through the wrong puberty? What if you inside feel that you are female, but now you're going through a male puberty? He should be fired immediately. You cannot go through the wrong puberty. Your body is your body. When you are of a certain age, if you wish to dress whichever way you want and put lipstick on and all that shit, that's just fine. You cannot go through the wrong puberty. The fact that this person has anything to do with the health of anyone and that this guy we've shown you the video has repeatedly said that he is thrilled that he did not transition when he was young because his two children that he has, that he was the father to, now I suppose purports to be the mother, that those are the biggest joys in his life and that's what he's trying to steal from 13 year old kids. We have an editing machine over here in the studio and we put together a little something. We're going to show you the same clip with a little twist. I think you're going to enjoy. What would you say to folks who think that they're being reasonable by saying, why can't children just wait until they're 18? Adolescence is hard and puberty is hard. What if you're going through the wrong puberty? What if you inside feel that you are female, but now you're going through a male puberty? What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I've ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points and may God have mercy on your soul. That's Billy Madison, peak Adam Sandler, I think around 1995 if I'm not mistaken, if I had a nickel for every time that I got stoned in college and watched that movie, I'd have a small fortune. But these people lie about everything, which is a perfect segway. We're now on the segways today. Corinne Jean-Pierre, how is she going to tackle climate change while they're doing it because of the inflation reduction act right now? And we're doing everything that we can to tackle the root causes of climate change. This is why the inflation reduction act is so important. Oh, the inflation reduction act. So by printing a whole bunch of money that doesn't really exist, thus depressing the value of the dollar, we are going to somehow attack the root cause of climate change. Okay. Okay. I should have drank before today's show. I really should have. So all right, guys. What do we got to do here? We have to expunge these people from the national conversation. They can live in their alternate world. They can be citizens of the United States, but they should be mocked. They shouldn't have anything to do with any of our lives, right? Because what they do, it's not just that they lie about everything and that they're wrong about everything and they accuse you of all of these things. When you start making inroads, as DeSantis has done, for example, when you start doing things right in a flourishing fart and you remove wokeness and you get ESG out of the institutions and things start working, then they lie and they trick you or they trick certain people to think that what you're doing is not good. Here is former South Carolina state representative, now CNN analyst, Bakari Sellers, explaining why fighting wokeness is just the wrong, it's just wrong. It's just not in touch with America. Why would Americans care if their sons are having their wangs cut off? It's completely out of touch with what most Americans are feeling. You know, Joe Biden is out here talking about Bidenomics. And his disconnect is trying to make sure that Bidenomics meets people in their pockets. Wokeness or whatever Rhonda Santas and Nikki Haley and everybody else want to say is so far away from the average everyday American. These people who are working in this, as you can probably hear in the background, working on this hotel across the street, they're not worried about wokeness, they're worried about insurance. They're worried about making sure that they're, you know, that they're constantly booked so I feel they're not worried about somebody being too woke in whatever aspect of the government it is. And so that is my point to Rhonda Santas, he's running against this fairy, he's running against an imagination. But at least Donald Trump is running on policies that I disagree with, but he's run on before, which he can articulate helps strengthen some part of the economy. So that's the different. All right, first off, he's doing the quiet part out loud thing. He's showing you that as a leftist, progressive activist pretending to be a journalist or whatever he is, he's telling you that he wants Donald Trump to run because Rhonda Santas is the real threat. So sometimes they do that thing accidentally when they pull the curtain. That's one thing. He said, there's complete nonsense. Our economy is actually flourishing here in Florida, despite the inflation reduction act and all of those things, we have the largest influx of people that have ever been here. Buildings are going up left and right. You guys get it. The all of the amount of tourism set a record in the first half of the year. I'm sure 2023 will figure as the best tourism in the history of Florida, all of that. You guys get all that stuff. But also this notion that people don't care about the woke stuff that they don't care about their children being taught all the sex stuff, all the race stuff and all of that is complete nonsense. And again, you only have to look at the way that the guy crushed it in the last election to know that the results, like don't, doesn't matter what you think about the policy. Where do people leave and where do they come and what happens in the elections that happened in that place? Well, the guy won by freaking 20 points. Here's the Santas, one more clip from that Tapper interview explaining exactly why fighting wokeness matters. Hopefully Bakari Sellers will check out this clip. So I hear you recruitment without question is a problem. The Army did this survey. I'll give you a copy of it if you want. They haven't released it, but I got my hands on a copy and it looked at it surveyed people, I think 16 to 28 barriers to service and beyond the ones such as don't want to die, don't want to be injured, don't want to be away from my family. The biggest issues were the number two issue, women and racial or ethnic minorities are discriminated against in the Army. This is listed here, but it's only number nine. So that would suggest that wokeness is not as big. Well, but I think there's an issue about, not even really knows what wokeness is. I mean, I've defined it, but a lot of people who rail against wokeness can't even define it. And so I think it's a sense of, you know, this is not something that's holding true to the core, martial values that make the military unique. And I can tell you, the veterans, you don't have to look far and wide. Go to a VFW hall, go to an American Legion. There's huge amount of concern about the direction that the military is going with all the time. We just know that's true. You don't even have to go to a VFW hall to see that. Like we know that every time you see those ads for the military and every time you see the videos that are leaked out and they've got a bunch of guys dressed as girls and drag queen story hours at military bases and all of this nonsense and that military recruitment is now way low. But what Jake wants to do is he doesn't really want you to think about that. That's number nine. There's a whole bunch of other stuff as if you can't do two things at once. So of course there is a huge amount of concern over the direction of the country and the guy that they seem to all be focused on hating the most is the guy that's actually doing the most to fight that very thing. So we have to figure out who is the enemy? What are the bad set of ideas and how do we defeat them? And now to end the show, we will give you a throwback clip old school. Our prime minister of England, Margaret Thatcher, summarizing who the enemy actually is. The essence of socialism is that you surrender quite a bit of power of your own life to the state. Well we all do that to some extent but of course it went much further. You pay very high taxes and they wish to take even higher taxes because they think politicians can spend money better than the people can spend it. The more you take away the less there is for private industry and that's where the creation of wealth comes.

Going into the 20th century, going into the second quarter of the 21st century. That we'd say 12 years is enough. I think 12 years is enough in going into 2030, 40, 50. The rebuilding of Syria, of Libya. This is... they're there. And I want to thank the Prime Minister of Columbia's leadership and the ASEAN's ASEAN chair. Thanks for tuning in to The Rubin Report.
