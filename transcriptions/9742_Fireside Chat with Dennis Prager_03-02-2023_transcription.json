    "text": " Hi everybody and welcome to the fireside chat. We figured out right before I came on as it were, how rarely I have a guess at the fireside chat because I really do like to reserve it for you and me. So if I choose a guess, it's a serious statement about the individual. So let me give you a very long introduction because you need the backstory about how this came about. A couple of months ago I was invited, actually it was invited a year ago, but a couple of months ago I lived the invitation to go to Denmark and to speak in its parliament building. I didn't speak to the parliament, but I spoke in the parliament building for the free speech society of Denmark, which gave me a free speech award. I normally don't take awards, but I really wanted to go to Denmark and to help out this group. There aren't that many free speech groups anywhere in the world including Europe. Thank god we have that in the United States, but not sufficiently, but that's another matter. Anyway, I gave the talk and I was interviewed by a number of people in the on the conservative side of the Danish journalistic world. And one of those who interviewed me is the woman, the young woman that I am inviting here. We invited her. She's never been to America. This is literally her second day in the United States, really technically first day. And my wife and I are just being undolited. So I have to tell you a little about my reactions to people. This is a very interesting subject and you may want to comment on this afterwards. So I have a very dear friend since high school. And when we would meet a new person, he would often comment on the person's intelligence. Because he he as if you were he zoned in on how bright a person was. And I remember thinking and I'm talking about late teens early twenties. I remember thinking, I don't really care how bright a person is. And I have even theories on that because most people are bright enough. But I did zone in on their goodness. I was able to tell and this is a gift. I don't take any credit for it. I have almost never been hurt because I have been given this gift of knowing a person's character. Not everybody's. I mean, there are a lot of people I meet and I don't make any assessment. Anyway, this was a combination meeting this person in Denmark of brains and goodness. And we I think we turned out right. So she is a journalist. She is a conservative. Any conservative in Europe is a collector's item. We said, we'd love to have you at our home. And then it occurred to me. We're going to do a special fireside chat with Astrid, A S T R I B. And now comes the fun part. Because Danish is not an easily pronounced language. Your last name is H O with a line through the O G. And now the fun part. You will hear her name as it should be pronounced in Danish. Okay. My name is a school who did you get that? How do you pronounce a dentist? Ed Lee, it had was I even close? I think you you're better on the last name now. Yeah, the first name. Yeah. So it's very interesting. I had a Bjorn Lomborg, the great independent voice on the environment on my show. He's Danish. And I remember years ago, I think it was his birthday. And I said, how do you say happy birthday in Danish? Say happy birthday in Danish. T L\u00fcgge Mepf\u00fcrstelst\u00e4en. And I realized when he said it, I wouldn't repeat it accurately. I have learned, I love languages and I love music and they're related. And I learned Russian and French and Hebrew. I studied Arabic and can get along in Spanish. But Danish has a world of pronunciation that's unique to itself. Is that right? Yeah, that's that's pretty accurate. Because you don't really pronounce all the letters. Exactly. So in for instance, my last name, we don't pronounce the G. And we also have many. My like, it's a law and name. H-O-G, but we don't pronounce the G. So slowly, I love this. Slowly, how do you pronounce your last name? H-O-G. So every other, every non-dane would say hulk, right? Yeah, hulk or something like that. Yeah. So you're used to that? Yeah. I have. And Astrid is pronounced in Danish. Esk\u00fc. Yeah. So is the D pronounced? Yeah, it's a soft D. But it's hardly hearable. But you can't hear it like Esk\u00fc. Well, all right. But I'll call you Astrid, which is works. Yeah, it's fine. Yeah. So tell everybody the circumstance under which we met. All right. So I'm a journalist for a media called contrast contrast in English. And it's a center-right media conservative, I would say. And actually, my editor in chief was supposed to interview you, but he felt sick. And I didn't actually know you beforehand, sorry, Dennis. But Well, let's put it this way. Thank God, enough people there did for me to get the invitation. It's nothing else to do with you. Yeah. So I quickly did my studies upon you. And then I did the interview. And I think we just hit it off immediately, pretty much. And we both have, I think, the same intuitive understanding of people, I would say too. So we liked each other. And then you said, you should come and see me accept this award. The next morning. Oh, you wouldn't even know that? No. And I knew you were accepting it, but I had no plans of like, overcoming it. No, no, I didn't know about it beforehand. So, but you said I should come and see you give the speech and all that. And of course, I would like to. So I came. And then when you saw me, you had a lot of fans standing around you and you said, there she is. I want you to stay in my life. That sounds like me. Yeah. And then I don't think that happened that day was that you were supposed to have a dinner with the Free Press Society. And someone else, someone couldn't make it. I can't remember who it was. Oh, it's the Free Press. I said free speech, free press. And then I was so lucky to be invited in his stead. And then we talked. So wait, we met through two sicknesses. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. So, so I'm the eternal standing, apparently. But it was a very, very lucky coincidences. And it all worked out. Yeah. So let's get to know you a little better and then talk about Europe and everything. In Europe, as I am, it's obvious. So this is something I'm very, very happy about. So at what age would you have called yourself conservative? Again, you're 30. Yeah, I'm 30 now. I would say in the beginning of my 20s, I realized it. I was studying Danish literature at the university. And I found a Danish thinker. And a priest called a certain cow. And I wrote his, sorry, I read his memoirs. And I realized, I thought, and I understood the world, like he understood it. It's a to be conservative is a way to view the world, I would say. So that's why that's, that's when I would put that word before that. I thought I was a libertarian. And I became politically aware when I was 12 or something. Yeah. Were you influenced by someone or it's just came from your own nature? I believe it's a combination. So I believe I was born conservative in the way that when I was just very young, I had a very clear like, I had a very strong sense of justice. And for instance, I thought in then, in schools, they do a lot of group work. And we are told that the strong people should lift up the weak pupils, and then they do the project together and share the honors. And I thought that was unjust. And I really like to help other people, but sharing the result and not saying who did what I just felt it was completely, it was not right. And I feel that is a conservative sentiment. And that is perfect. That is just perfect. Yeah. Forgive me, but I have to react. What you realized, though you wouldn't have put the words, you believed in justice, not social justice. Yeah, exactly. Like equality of opportunity and not equality of outcome. And that is just from I was very young. And another thing is that I've always really appreciated order. And I've appreciated hierarchies. Like I always respected the teacher, and I always respected like the police, and I always respect people who knew a lot. I was respected knowledge. And that was from an extremely young age. So I feel in that way, I was born conservative. That's right. But of course, there were also But you were not only born it, but this I need to tell you, you can articulate it. See, a lot of people have the instinct. But you can articulate your instinct. I respected hierarchies. You know, a few people would say that. So again, I will just tell you the, I've done a lot of work on the 10 commandments. I might massive writing and lecturing on it. So I'm often asked, what's the most what he then is, what do you think the most important of the 10 commandment is? And I've given different answers of in different times in my life. My answer now is honor your father and mother. Because because of that, it establishes higher Yeah. And and and it's the fifth commandment. The first four rely on the fifth and the second four rely on the 10th. And it's just, I don't want to get into that in detail. But the vehicle to the hierarchy of God is the hierarchy of the parent. Yeah, I believe that's true because it's a model of the universe. Yes. Yeah. Did your parents know you were conservative? Did you articulate this at home? Well, I think that so my parents were at that time, I think, center right. And they, my mom is a high school teacher. And she never believed in group work either. So I mean, in that way, I think she just figured out, of course, I wouldn't be to the left. But I was actually the one who, who started to study conservative thinking. And then I let my mom to realize she was a conservative as well. So it but but they have been like center right both of them. Yeah. So you're very open, which is very important, in my opinion, for all of us who talk to people. Your dad died when you were 14. Yeah. Of cancer. Yes. From after a few years of sickness. Of a few years of sickness. Yeah. Do you remember him healthy? Yes. But not very well. Not very well. Yeah. How did how did his death affect you? Well, it's I guess it's yet to be determined. But I think that the main problem I have is that I need, I need half of the puzzle to understand who I am. And I really need. There's a lot of myself. I don't understand because I have my mom to reflect part of me, but I don't have my dad. And whenever I'm in doubt, doubtful of which way to turn, then I wish I would have his advice as well. And I wish that I would know more about. For instance, everyone tells me that he was very funny and very sociable. And I just wish I could remember that myself because I think I remind I think I'm like him that way. But who knows? And then another thing is that whenever, for instance, if I have a boyfriend, I meet him. I really feel that's a part of me. I can't show him because I can't show him my dad. And I always wonder what my father would think of any man I'm in love with. So, yeah, it's almost like I'm almost a bit embarrassed that there's part of me. I can't even explain to people I meet because there's just a part of me that's just covered in darkness, I feel. That's an interesting way to look at it. I had both my parents till my 50s, till I think older, even maybe late for 50s. But I don't know if you need that parent to understand yourself. My suspicion of you, and I may be 100% wrong, I think you understand you pretty well. I think you're very self-reflective, that you would admit. I think you think that because he left your life at such an early age. But I just, I mean, there are many people who had bad relations with a parent. And they're probably affected worse. Oh, there's no comparison. No, to have had a parent that you loved or admired, or both, who died early is infinitely better than a parent you don't love or admire for many years. Yeah. George Gilder noted that George Gilder is one of the greatest living American thinkers. I read him when I was in college and he's still living. And I interviewed him once. He's done some PragerU videos, by the way. And he lost his father when he was a child. His father was shot over Germany. His father was in a bomber for the US Air Force. So he really didn't know him almost at all. But there was a picture of his father on the fireplace. And they told him stories about his dad. And he said to me, and I'm paraphrasing it. I don't remember the exact words. I had a father. He died, but I had a father. Yeah. So that's what makes me think of that. Yeah. You had a father. Yeah, and that's obviously very, very important. I think it going from your first question, I think that another way that affected me, of course, was having him fell sick at a very early age. It makes you grow up very fast. Because it is when you are a child, you don't really live. If you have a good childhood, you feel protected and you feel nothing can harm you. And you're not even aware that this is how you feel because you have your parents and they are just two rugs in your life. And then when my dad fell sick, of course, I just knew he had to live because like, what else? Like why shouldn't he live? And then at the end, he didn't after many struggles. And I watched him slowly perish. And to have that, it was like having like the, I lost like the ground underneath my feet. And ever since then, I didn't feel shit secure. And I feel that's still one of the problems I struggle with. That I always have this sense, even when things are going well, that it could change at any minute. I'd like to say that I could strike and everything could be different. And I've felt that way ever since. Well, so interesting that you should say that I had both my parents and I have always felt disaster constrict at any moment because you are a realist and I am a realist. Maybe I wish everybody knew disaster could strike at any moment. It doesn't necessarily make you insecure. It makes you appreciative. Well, it hasn't struck today. Yeah, I agree. I agree. I think it makes me appreciate the people in my life more. And your life generally. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. You, you, it comes out of you. Yeah. A sense of delight at how things, how good things are. Yeah. It's true. I really appreciate life. So, so in that way, yeah, and maybe I would have turned out that way anyway, but I don't know. Well, first of all, thank you for your, your openness. So I, I assume that you came from a more secular home because every European home almost not all, but almost every is secular. Is that correct? That is correct. My dad, he did believe in God, but he kept it private. And I think one of the reasons he did that was because my mom was very secular. And so, so we only went to church when it was Christmas and I don't know, someone had to get baptized or yeah. So, so it wasn't really a part of my childhood. So if I would have asked you at 12, do you believe in God? You would have said. I would probably have said, I would probably have said I'm agnostic at that age. I'd probably just learned that word. I would probably say. Did your father's death affect your belief? It makes you less likely to believe? It made me more likely. Really? Yeah, I would say. Because you feel the need to believe that, of course. Otherwise life is chaos. I wouldn't say it's, it's necessarily chaos for me at least. But I just, I just felt very strongly that I, I wanted there to be something more, of course. And also he believed it very strongly at the end. And yeah, so, so of course I wish for it and I still do. And how are you today religiously? Religiously. I am, I won't use the term agnostic. I don't like it. I would say that I'm hoping, I'm hoping to believe. And I, I think it could happen because I do feel I have religiousness in me. But it's just, it's just the thing when you've been, when your brain can only think logically and that's the only thing you've learned. Then being an adult and thinking in a different way is, is just thing it's, it takes time. It's like a muscle that's never been used. Well, it hasn't been used. This is, to me, a tragedy. I mean, you know, my approach is through the brain. Yeah. It's like all my book, The Rational Bible. Yeah. And I've started reading Genesis and it's very good. Well, you're the, you're the perfect person to read it because it appeals to the mind. Yeah. I don't understand a, there is no solid intellectual alternative to what we call the Judeo-Christian worldview. There are alternatives, but they're not solidly intellectual. That everything is a matter of opinion, good and evil. That everything is mechanistic. There's no mind. It's just a series of neurons that are firing. I mean, these are not intellectually sustainable positions, but anyway, I hope, I hope it does touch you because we need you. Yeah. As it were. Why do you think you're a bit so secular? It was, it was the, it was the home of Christianity. Yeah. What happened? So I believe it in a way it was Protestantism that triumphed itself to death because Protestantism is very, it's very invert, inverted. It's, it's all about the essential relationship between you and your God and for, so Luther said, you have to pray alone in your room. So, and I think once you take the social aspect out of faith, like, for instance, if it's important to go to church to show that you're religious, then you will lose, you lose a lot of the incentive for the average person to show. To show that Christianity and then to remember that Christianity. So I think what happened is it became so private that people forgot about it after the generations. That's a very intelligent take. I don't think it's my, it's originally my. Well, yours or not, it's an intelligent take. The, the obvious challenge is that Catholicism is also dying in Europe. It is, it is, but you all, but you could argue that it's, it's dying at a slower pace. And so for instance, the, the Catholic part of France is still much more religious today than, than, yeah. So, and so you, you would say it, there's more to hold them back. And then of course you have all the, the more, the more people study at university and all that, the more secular they become. Of course, yeah. True all over the next world. So there are different things at play it, I would say. So I'm going to bounce a theory off you. So I'm a Jew, as you know, and I, I very, very much worry about the death of Christianity because if Christianity dies, we're not going to be able to do it. If Christianity dies, we're not going to get beauty. We're just going to get secular chaos, which is exactly what we have. Men give birth is secular chaos. Okay. And I can give 20 examples of the absurd that people have come to believe. So, but I have another thought and I'd like you to react, even though it may be the first time you've heard this. There are two huge sources, in my opinion, and it, your, your Luther notion and the, it, it Protestantism sort of committed suicide by getting so inward is a fascinating idea. But I'd like to offer you two external ideas. Yes. World War I and World War II. World War I, it was a religious Europe. It was a patriotic Europe. People believed in God and country. Yeah. World War I shattered belief in God and country because millions died seemingly for no reason for God and country. The Germans for God and country, the English for God and country, the French for God and country. That was the terror. World War I is the great horror of the 20th century. He gave us Nazism and communism, among other things. Then World War II, Christianity, or at least Christendom sort of failed on the Holocaust issue. Yeah. The German church is overwhelmingly back-tickler. I mean, I don't expect people to be heroes, but they, they, they weren't, they weren't good at all, generally speaking. So then people concluded, okay, what we suspected was true from World War I is really true. It's useless. It's morally useless. How does that strike you? It strikes me as true. And I think that that many, that several explanations can be true at the same time and just work together. Right. So I think that once socially there is some leeway to express your not Christian, that, of course, that gives the, that allows people to go that way. And then when first World War came and there was this collective sense of loss of meaning, then it made more to go that way, away from Christianity and the belief in our higher order and purpose. And then I believe your explanation that the church failed, their true purpose is, is correct too. However, I will say that if you study the resistance movements, there were a lot of priests. Oh, that's entirely accurate. And I point that out all the time. That is correct. I'll just tell you, I asked two professors who wrote a book on altruism. Yeah. And they both were Jews, secular Jews, who from Europe. And they were saved by non-Jews. Their lives were saved during the Holocaust. I interviewed them. Sam and Pearl Olinar, O-L-I-N-E-R, people could look this up. And I said to them, you've studied rescuers of Jews in the Holocaust. You've studied altruism. So now I have a question. If you could go back, I think it was Poland. If you could go back to Poland, it's World War II, the Holocaust. And you as a Jew could knock on one door in the hope that they would hide you. Would it be a non-Jewish lawyer, a non-Jewish doctor, a non-Jewish professor, or a priest? And both said the priest. Yeah. So I just want you to know that I know that. And the anti-religious will somewhat exaggerate the failure of Christianity because they have an agenda. Yeah. So you just spoke so eloquently about the collapse of faith. Yeah. I suspect that if I had 10, 30-year-old Danes in this room, they would not be quite as eloquent about the subject as you. And my point is not to compliment you. My point is to say, I don't think that the average European, young or middle-aged, is thinking about these issues. They have a different, their explanation would be, today we all study at university, so now we know that people were just wrong in the olden times. Exactly. They believe that people just- It was nonsense. They believe in a steady progression throughout history where people just get smarter and smarter. Perfect. Yeah. You're a fine. She's a fine. You said it in one sentence perfectly. That's right. That's what they believe. So no explanation is needed. No, because- We have graduated. They are a generation that believe they are the smartest generation that ever existed. Even though today we know they don't- They are not- They don't know how much as my- This is exactly what American kids think. If you went to university in the last 50 years, that's what you think. I am smarter than Moses, Jesus, Aristotle, even- Even- Even though when they are done with elementary school, they know nothing. They can hardly spell and write today. They can't read a whole book in its entirety. And they can't focus for more than 10 minutes so the teachers complain. And when they go to what is like our high schools, then they have to be taught how to read in time. Right. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And then when they go to university, they are at a bachelor level and they can't do the basic math anymore. So they have to have extra math teachers. And so yeah, but they're still smarter than everyone. Yes, they're still smarter. That's right. And so that's now the new about climate change and all that that the previous generation did. And so yeah. I don't want to believe that God inflicted those two people with sickness. But I'm starting to think that he made them sick so we would be sick. So in light of your views, do you have close friends? Believe it or not, I do have many close friends. Well, I do believe it because you're so easy to be with and full of life. But I'll go further. Do you have close friends who share your views? My, I would say my closest friends are my girlfriends of the same age as me. And no, they are, they are on the left wing. But they are not very, they are open minded. So like I am, so we don't really care. But I have many good friends that are conservative, I would say. Yeah. So do you have any religious close friends? Or is that almost impossible to find in your age group? Yeah, I only have, no, I would say no. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So that is what I'm sort of up against. I think if I had someone who went to church regularly and was close with me, then it would come easier. And you're intellectual equal. You don't even have to say yes because you know, you may feel self conscious, but that would help. Look, this is a, this is a terrible crisis. Europe, do you know, I'm curious if you know this. When the European Union adopted its charter a few years ago, like five years ago, I think it was, it, it mentioned Europe and the origins of Europe. It did not once mention Christianity. There would be no Europe without Christianity, but Christianity is not mentioned in the EU charter. I remember you mentioned this in the interview I did with you the first time we met and it struck me as a very good point. And you said that you have to be able to explain Christianity to people. And that Europe can't even explain why Europe is Europe. It shows the, it shows the tragedy of it all. Just, just for the record, I will say to those of you watching or listening, my life, if I had to use one verb to explain my life, it is the word explain. I've explained Americans to Americans. I've explained Judaism to Jews and non-Jews. I've explained Christianity to Christians and to non-Christians. If you don't explain, you lose. It's as simple as that. And they stopped explaining. Now in Europe, they're not explaining Europe. Forget Christianity. They're not explaining Europe. And in America, they're not explaining America. And so we end up with nothing. So in America, we have real, real sick ideas. And they're most obvious where it comes to the trans issue. Men give birth. If a man says he is a woman, he can compete against women in women's sports. If a man says he is a woman, he can expose his genitals to girls in a shower at a YMCA, as was just done two weeks ago in San Diego, outside of San Diego, where a man is in the shower, completely naked, 17-year-old girl shows himself naked. And she says, I don't want to see this. And they yell at her. You don't have that in Denmark yet, correct? I would say it's better in Denmark, definitely. So there are a few ways why I can see that good things are happening. For instance, we've become much more conservative when it comes to giving hormonal treatments to children who believe they are transgender. And so that is obviously good. And also the LGBT community is not quite as radical. And also, I believe you have a separate issue with the teachers' unions that are completely engulfed by this trans ideology. And it's not as bad as in Denmark, but I will say it is still... There's reason to be concerns. If I can give an example, for instance, we have a phone line where kids can call if they have problems and they can speak to anyone else, then they can receive guidance, right? And it's called a baneting phone in Danish. And now if you go to their website, they have different issues, like different issues with bullying, issues with your parents, and then they have category issues with your body and gender. And then if you click that, you can see, for instance, it starts out with a video with a girl who likes to play soccer and likes to play with the kids. And then she discovered she was really a boy. So that is the example it shows up and what it means to be trans. And then you can read and ask a guide. Okay, if you feel you're born in the wrong body, you can ask for hormones. You can guide you in that direction. And then at the end of that page, it has a questionnaire. And it asks the children, what is your gender identity? It has like 12 gender identities. And then 18% has answered trans. 18? 18%. Oh, well, that's American number. But it shows that now the trans issues is just, it's just completely incorporated into the world of a child. Now, Danish children, they are presented this issue, like what is your relationship with your body and gender from a very early age, I would say. So it's still a reason to be concerned. We have a video up, interestingly, a PragerU from a Dane that Denmark is not really socialist. Yeah. Right. So I want to talk to you about that. So I'd like to give an example. I rented a car because to me, liberty is not the Statue of Liberty. Liberty is the automobile. I identify cars with freedom. I rent a car everywhere I go in the world. And so my wife and I, we rented a car. Let me, we came to Denmark just a couple of months ago. And we were debating because we were told, very few people drive around. They go by bicycle, a great deal, or by public transportation. And I said, well, maybe I don't need to rent a car. How's Uber? And they go, there is no Uber in Denmark. Can you explain that? Tell our viewers why there's no Uber. Yeah. So in Denmark, the left wing parties, they were very interested in protecting the taxi drivers' businesses. The taxi drivers, they keep their prices up by having basically too few licenses for the demand. And Uber was obviously a threat. So yeah, then because the left wing parties, they felt the need to protect the taxi drivers. Then yeah, then in the end, they made Uber illegal. And what they said was because of safety reasons that the safety standards weren't as high as in regular taxes. Right. Yeah. But obviously that doesn't make sense. So you even said to me, the wait is so long for a taxi. Yeah. Yeah. So in, I remember when I was in my twenties, I had no money. I would rather stand in the rain for an hour at 2 AM waiting for a bus than to take a taxi. Because? Because it was too expensive. It would be 500 crowns, which it was a lot, is a lot for me to get home. So and when we had Uber for like six months, I would always take an Uber. So I lived a much safer life as a young woman when Uber existed. That's right. So I asked you if what you think would happen if the Danish people voted on whether to have Uber or only taxis and your answer? They would, it was this single issue. They would go to have only Uber. But they still won't vote for the. The love wing parties that band that. Yeah. And I think you asked me why. And I think the explanation is what we call the welfare coalition, where too many people are dependent on the state. And where either they work for the government, we have a huge public sector, all they receive benefits every month. And so they vote for this stream of money to continue. And that is more important. Well, that's why it's almost impossible to vote the left out of power when it's in power. Yeah. Because you're voting that you receive less from the government. Yeah, exactly. And who don't vote to get less? No one vote against so on self interest. I don't remember who said it, but I think it was said in the ancient world, not just the modern, the day people, I'm paraphrasing the day people come to understand that they can elect people who will give them money. That is the end of democracy. It's true. I believe that that is very, very slowly the way it's going. So is there even a conservative party in this way, a party that says basically the way America was founded, small government? Is there a small government party in Denmark? There is a party that comes close to it. It's called liberal alliance. But in Denmark, liberal is right wing. And it is... By the way, I believe liberal is right wing here too. Unfortunately, liberals don't. Yeah. And I think they're leftists. I feel that is a very insightful point. Yeah. It's about explaining. But I would say it comes very close. They want a smallish public sector and they want the taxes to be not much more than 40%. What is it now? Now it's... For me, it's around 42%. And if you are... There's a top text that is around... I can't even... I don't... I can't remember what it is. I assume you're not among the wealthiest people in Denmark. No, I'm the lowest. Yeah, pretty... Yeah. And you're paying 42%. Yeah. What do you get for your 42%? So let's see, free education. Including free university? Well, nothing is free. But... Correct. But... What do they claim? Yeah. I couldn't agree with you more. A tax funded health care system and a tax funded education system and also university. And of course, I studied almost 10 years old and all. So I have in that way really milked the cow. So I shouldn't play wholly or anything. So I've had... Yeah. I've taken my share. How is the medical system? It's all right. It's under pressure as it is in England. Well, in England, it's beyond the pressure. It's failing. Okay, maybe it's... And Canada, too. Yeah. But we have the same problem basically that we don't have enough nurses and they only want to work part-time and they also would rather work in Norway where the wages are higher. And so we have a big debate about the size of the nurses' size. If you want private medical care, can you pay for it? It's basically everything is public. You can. You definitely can. So the rich do that? Yes. And also we have a very good system where if there's a too long wait, you will be referred to private hospital. It has been one of the greatest successes that a right-wing government has made. Private hospitals. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know. I know. And also the... Well, Americans will learn this too late, unfortunately. Yeah. If you need it... You know what an MRI is? Yeah. It's a scan? Yeah. So if you need one, how long will you have to wait? I think it depends on the reason. If there's a cancer, if there's a reason to believe it's cancer, then you get quite quickly treatment. But that's because in the 90s, Denmark was almost at developing countries when it came to treating cancer. And then a lot of governments, they made these cancer packages. So now if there's a reason to believe you have cancer, you get a much better treatment. So we are doing well there. But still there's reason to... I mean, still the private hospitals would be for many, many patients. And many patients wait months with very painful... Yeah, it's what I assume. Problems. Yeah. So we'll draw to a conclusion by talking about you again, because you're fascinating. And would you like to be married? Yes. If I would have asked you at 25, would you have said yes? Yes. 20. Yes. So you've been 10 years unmarried, but have wanted to be married the whole time. Oh, I don't know if I would promise that I will eventually. But at 25, I would have said yes. Okay, fine. Yeah. So you have everything going for you. I know I'm embarrassing you, but what is the issue? Well, I have been married. I was married at 26, because I really wanted to. And I think because I think I ended up almost talking him into it before he was really ready. So sometimes I can be too... That's right. I talked my way to you. Yeah. And sometimes I can be too persuasive. And it didn't work out. And that is basically, that's a long story. But I have been married. Well, you weren't married long. No, I was married a little over a year. And now I feel... I would still, if I'm so lucky, to meet someone that I really fit well with, I would like to be married again, because I still believe in the institution. I believe in marriage because... What percentage of your generation believes in the institution? I have no idea. I feel that marriage still holds value because people admire when people do something that is difficult. And to stay together in this modern world is difficult. And I think because we have a society that admires romantic love, they still admire marriage in that view. Interesting. That is a statement to believe in love, right? So I ask women that I meet a waitress in a restaurant, someone standing in line going on the airplane, if I'm sitting next to a young woman on the airplane, and I'm obviously very open. So I may ask you a question. I mean, I don't begin with it. But if we're talking, it's of course. They always say, of course. I say, so I'm going to ask you this question. You can have one of two guarantees. You can be guaranteed a great career or guaranteed a great marriage. It doesn't mean you cannot have the other one. It only means only one is guaranteed. Which guarantee would you choose? I've asked many, many women under 30 this question and it's 50-50. Okay. What do you think the women of your age would answer? I would say probably a great career because they believe that they can have the same quality of life through friendships. You asked me this as well and I, without thinking about it, I said a great marriage. And so I guess that's just my instinct. Well I had a feeling it was your instinct. But it's also partially what makes you a conservative. That's the conservative answer. It's the belief that some way is a living. It's all rational answer because it's a greater challenge. And it's also much greater joy in life. I mean, how much career is wonderful. But when you come home, you don't hug your career. No, exactly. You don't have a conversation with your career. You don't have dinner with your career. You don't make children with your career. It's not even rational, let alone conservative. So how do you meet men in Denmark? I mean, at a bar, do you have social media sites like we have for singles? So for me, I have been on dating apps at time. But I'm a very social person. I meet many new people all the time. And I believe that for me, it's better to meet someone via my social circles because then we have a lot of things in common naturally. And I am just one of those people who tends to go out at new places and meet new people. So for me, that's how I meet people. And what does a new place mean, a bar? No, it's rarely that I meet anyone at a bar. I would say, well, I've talked to many people, but not very interesting people a lot of times. So I go to lectures, I go to political debates, I go to private parties. You can also be almost, I'm a journalist and being a journalist means that you meet many people. And I'm not saying it's my interview subjects, but it just means I am as a living, I am social, I meet many people. And yeah, sometimes I believe very much in a meeting that you meet someone through a friend. Yeah, something like that. So we met two months ago. You didn't know who I was until we met, obviously. And now you're in my house in California. So in your mind, are you thinking, you know, this is what happens in your life. Is that part of what you're thinking? That it's not, it's surprising, but not shocking. I will say, because I'm very open to new people and new experiences. That's what I would think. Yeah. And I would always say yes to an invitation. Points like the one you gave me. And I would also, even though I'm Danish and we are much more closed up, I'm also the type of person to make invitations to all strangers. Like I am, I'm very, I will take people in. You're not a closed off thing. No. I'm not as extremely open as openness. Some Americans, but I am as a four day, very open. Yeah. I don't find you closed at all. I, if an American is more open than you, it's not, it's not a real openness. You are fully open in my opinion. Yeah. I am. I am because. Yeah. I think that's my basic want, is that I want to connect with people. So I just, my strategy is just to offer me myself. And this is me. And then I hope people will like it. Yeah. Well, this is the beginning of your trip. I would love to know what you had noticed in America that's different from Denmark, but it's too early. Something we did notice, you have no drive through Starbucks. Yeah. That's another thing. And Denmark Starbucks is pricier. It's much more of a luxury. So, and we don't drive quite as much. So Starbucks is something that you find on pedestrian streets. And it's very expensive. Yeah. So would you like to say a final thing? I would say one final thing. I would say another difference. And I mentioned this to you late last night, that to have a show where young people call in and ask someone older for advice, I don't think you would have that in Denmark. Because in Denmark, young people automatically believe they are smarter than the older generation. It wouldn't exist. In Denmark, it would be a program with young people teaching the older generations how what they should believe about the world. That's fascinating. That is fascinating. That's a very interesting insight. Then they'll learn nothing. That's the irony. Yeah. Yeah. Because of course, if we stand on the shoulders of previous generations and if you... That's why you're conservative. You want to conserve the best of the past. Yeah, exactly. But now we have a generation that starts everything over. So, yeah. So the wisdom is lost, I would say. That's the characteristic of the left. Will rebuild. What is it? What is the term in English? No, to rebuild what is already built. What is it? We're going to rebuild the wheel. That's it. Re-engineer the wheel or something like that. Yeah. Re-invent. Yeah. Re-invent the wheel. That's right. That's the term. Yeah. That's what they do. That is what they... if they are lucky, they'll end up doing. Excellent point. Well, we are going to stay in touch. Yes. Obviously. Yes. Ostrid. Heh. Heh. Heh. I'm close. I'm getting there. H-O-G. Drop us a line at PragerU if you'd like to communicate with her. This has been very, very special. I think so too. Good. Thank you. See you next week."
