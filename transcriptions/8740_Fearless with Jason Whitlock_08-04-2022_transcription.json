    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Happy Friday. The weekend is here. We made it through another week. Awesome, awesome feeling to make it to the weekend. Welcome to Fearless with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock, the host of Fearless with Jason Whitlock. There's no other choice, but on a Friday to celebrate the weekend, we must stick the landing. We must have an incredible show on Friday. We cooked up something we think is incredible. I'm going to go off the cuff and start a fire. Then I'm going to bring in Steve Kim and TJ Moda fan those flames of that fire. We're going to hear from Tennessee politician Tom Leatherwood who has promoted and put forth the common law marriage bill that the Democrats have spun into some national story of it allegedly legalizing underage marriage. We'll ask Tom Leatherwood directly, hey, you know, get what you're trying to do with the common law marriage thing. One man, one woman, but why not just include the age portion in there that's commonplace in Tennessee and just, you know, take this controversy away. We'll ask Tom Leatherwood about that. And then Uncle Jimmy will be here to help us with our approval rating and that'll be our show. The fire is going to be about Disney and Disney and sports. And I'm going to try to tie all this together off the top of my head. I got a few notes here written in my laptop that I'll refer to from time to time, but mostly it's just going to be me and you and me trying to pack us together what's going on in sports culture and attach it to what's going on in American society and the culture overall. And then I'm going to bring TJ Mo and Steve Kim in to talk about it. And well, just let me get the ball rolling. I'm going to start here as I try to unpack this. Did you guys know any of you sports fans out there that over the course of his 15 year NBA career, Michael Jordan played all 82 NBA games nine times. Nine times Michael Jordan played all 82 regular season NBA games over the course of his 15 year career 15 season career LeBron James in playing I think 19 seasons. He's done that once. He's played all 82 games one time. I believe off the top of my head that was in 2017. He played all 82 games. Other than that, it's been load management here, injury there, rest here. And so the other night I believe it was Tuesday night. The Lakers were facing playoff elimination. They were playing at home against the Phoenix Suns, the best team in the NBA. Lakers are facing playoff elimination Tuesday night. LeBron James set out with a sore ankle. He missed a playoff elimination game with a sore ankle. I know the initial thought people that you know can't stand me. There's a here goes with a lot beating up LeBron again. I'm not bringing this up to beat up a little bottom. I'm not trying to denigrate LeBron James with this anecdote. I'm just speaking facts about a cultural shift in basketball. Michael Jordan, the best player perhaps of all time in the NBA, took great pride in playing all 82 regular season games. There were like three other times he played 80 or more. Most of his career including his final season with the Washington Wizards at age 39. Michael Jordan played all 82 games. He was a reflection of that era and how important competition was to his era of basketball players. LeBron James is the greatest player of the post-Jordan era. Not trying to denigrate him. But he's also a symbol of where NBA culture and sports culture has gone. Competition has been de-emphasized. Having the greatest competitive fire is not as important as it used to be. And it's easy to say, players have just gone soft. It's all about money. They're just not built like Michael Jordan and the guys from that era. The whole thing has gone soft and LeBron's a wimp. That's not what I'm arguing. I'm arguing that there has been a cultural shift and something has been done to the culture to shift it so that the sports world is less competitive and more soft. Or is it softer? I don't know if it's more so. It's probably softer. The sports world is softer. And I say and what this conversation is about today is that Disney is the reason sports culture has gone soft. In 1996 Disney acquired ABC and ESPN. They took over the worldwide leader in sports. Disney did in 1996. Jordan's heyday in the NBA ended I think in 1998. So at the tail end of Jordan's dominance of the NBA his second three-peat with the Chicago Bulls. Here comes Disney in to take over the worldwide leader in sports. ESPN. And at the time no one thought much about it. No one knew the significance of it. But I think here in 2022 it should be becoming quite apparent that when Disney takes over an industry it's going to significantly change that industry. And Disney's acquisition of ESPN was an acquisition of the sports world. And Disney's influence on the sports world. And so just to put this all in further perspective two years before in 1994 Disney tried to acquire NBC and failed. NBC at the time had the NBA contract. Bob Costes, I'm Bob Rashad. NBC was in partnership with the NBA at the time that Disney tried to acquire NBC and failed in 1994. They turn around two years later take over ABC and therefore ESPN. Six years after acquiring ESPN and ABC Disney bought the rights to the NBA. Disney again a global corporation with a global vision wanted to get involved in America's most global sports basketball. And so Disney immediately after getting ESPN and ABC they go out and buy the NBA in 2002. One year later LeBron James enters the NBA. And so LeBron James entering the NBA in 2003 he enters a league that is in bed with Disney and enters a league that has a global vision and he has bought all into it with Nike and everything else. And LeBron James is part of a strategy that Disney has for sports particularly basketball to promote the values most important to Disney. So now I want to transition and take a little break from the sports aspect of this. And then now let's just discuss and evaluate Disney's agenda unrelated to sports that is becoming very widely known and accepted. It's being unmasked that Disney has an agenda as it relates to grooming and grooming kids. And so any of you that have been paying attention to social media in the media space have been watching this conversation about grooming play out all over social media. And so maybe there's some of you because someone asked me the other day over social what is grooming? And because the word groomers and grooming is being used a lot over social media it's being talked about and people on the left are very defensive about this charge at their groomers and some people don't know. So I want to read you this is kind of the definition with my little tweak on it again and with no negative intent I'm not trying to take anything out of control but this is what my definition of grooming is based off of everything I've read up how other people have described grooming. Grooming is the act of building a relationship trust and emotional connection with a child so that you can shape their sexual gender political and racial worldview. Grooming. Building a relationship with a child so that you can shape their sexual gender political and racial worldview. This is what the parental rights bill in Florida is about. It's trying to stop this grooming process that's going on in our schools. Rhonda Santas is at the forefront and Florida is at the forefront of this fight. They have passed a parental rights law that Disney a California based company has publicly opposed. Disney and its employees have put Rhonda Santas and Florida and this bill in the crosshairs they've called it the don't say gay bill. It has nothing to do with saying the word gay. It's about parents being able to control object to school systems trying to teach kindergartners through third grade that's four, five, six, and seven year olds about sexuality and gender. Parents in Florida and most right-minded parents they want the right to teach their kids about sexuality and gender. They want to groom their children in the way that they see fit not leave it to crazy school teachers. And so I want to play I want to start here by playing just a collage lives of tiktok does an awesome job of capturing the sentiment of teachers across the country very upset that Florida and other places and parents are starting to push back against this grooming process that we we're seeing from school teachers. And so here's a compilation of just teachers on camera filming themselves talking about their desire to groom young people as it relates to this gender and sexuality. One of the things that teachers always do with back to school like and meet the teacher and things like that is they like send on this cute little like meet the teacher thing where it has like a little bio about us. Some of our favorite stuff just so that you know who we are. How do I do that next year? Do I lie and not talk about my marriage? Do I pretend I'm single? Do I invalidate my spouses' stance as a trans fem person? Reading when they've been exposed to information they're ready to learn about it whether you think they are not. And the research says that there is no age too young to talk about pretty much anything. If they know about it they're ready to learn about it. Right. So there is no you know what we think is always age appropriate. It is if they don't know about it. That I don't care what the government tells me to do. I am going to do what I think is best for the health and safety. That includes mental health and safety and emotional health and safety of my kids. I will never let any child come through my classroom feeling unloved or ashamed for who they are. You know like the LGBT promotional like this is a safe community kind of stuff the rainbow stuff all up in my room. And I told them I'm like if you look around the room that should give you an answer to your question. So I did officially tell them they of course went berserk. So instead of teaching the social studies today they just asked me a whole bunch of questions about being gay. So I think it was pretty well. That's what's going on in schools and there's a bunch more of these videos. I want to show you one more. This is from MSNBC. This is a teacher complaining. I think about not being able to talk with his first graders about his sexual relationship or marriage relationship. Whatever relationship. Let's just play the clip. It scares me to death that I am not going to be able to have these conversations with my children because they're going to ask me what I did on the weekend. I don't want to have to hide that my partner and I went paddleboarding this weekend because then they ask what does partner mean Mr. Bernard and you know I'm worried can I tell them what it means. I'm also worried for my kids. I have a little girl this year who has two moms and the kids are curious about her two moms. They want to know about her two moms. You know if they come to if they go to her and ask her about her two moms and she doesn't know to say they're going to come to me and ask me and then you know so what do I do it just it opens up for parents to really take some legal action against the schools and teachers and I am afraid for myself my colleagues and my students. I believe that man is teaching first graders. That was a collage. That was five groomers basically. They want to groom your kids in their beliefs about sexuality and gender. I'm not objecting to their beliefs about sexuality and gender. I don't think it's their job their role to groom other people's kids on sexuality and gender. Teach math, teach English, teach gym class, teach history, teach accounting, sexuality and gender should be left to the parents in my view and I think a view of a lot of parents in Florida and across the country. But there's this whole grooming thing that has taken hold in the educational system and it has taken hold in the movie industry particularly the child movie industry because Disney has been promoting the discussion in a worldview and philosophy on gender and sexuality in the in the movies they directed kids and now here in 2022 they become more confident about talking about their desires openly. Disney has been imposing its worldview on sexuality and gender on kids for years through their movies and they intend to not do it in a sneaky fashion anymore. They're talking publicly about their desires about what they've been doing in a sneaky subtle version and now they're going to become more overt. Let's play two clips back to back from Disney executives, Disney employees, talking about what they intend to do with their movies and imposing their culture. I'm here as a mother of two queer children actually, one trans gender child and one pansexual child and also as a leader. We have many many many LGBTQIA characters in our stories and yet we don't have enough leads and narratives in which gay characters just get to be characters. Heard things like oh you know they won't let you show this at a Disney show and I'm like okay so I was a little like sus when I started but then my experience was bafflingly the opposite of what I had heard on my little pocket of like you know proud family Disney TVA. The showrunners were super welcoming Meredith Roberts and like our leadership over there has been so welcoming to like my like not at all secret gay agenda and so like I feel like I felt like it was I mean like maybe it was that way in the past but I guess like something must have happened and the last like they're turning it around they're going hard and then all that like momentum that I felt like that sense of I don't have to be afraid to like let's have these two characters kiss let's in the background like I was just wherever I could just basically adding queerness to like the Two more groomers this is what Disney is it is the worldwide leader in grooming and people have been complaining about this people have noticed this there are many of them shot shouted down all your conspiracy theories that we don't want to do anything to your kids we're not trying to groom your kids and X Y and Z yes you are yes you are and so Disney again a great maybe the most powerful cultural influencer in America perhaps on the planet they have a clear agenda as it relates to young people and sexuality and gender here. Grooming of sexuality, gender, politics, racial worldview is pervasive in America. It's going on everywhere that's why there are gay pride parades where they're taking young kids to these parades dressing them up in sexualized fashions to having them parade around and participating parades where adults are dressed up in a very sexualized fashion this is commonplace in America young kids are being groomed along sexuality lines certainly along racial lines we the drag queen story hour deal is out of control we have normalized drag queen story hours at local libraries for little kids this is somehow seen as the greatest thing you can do and it's the most inclusive thing you can do bring biological men dressed up as women and have them read to your kids that's inclusive that's progress this is Disney's agenda grooming in every way possible and so to tie this all together they've been grooming the sports world in diversity inclusion and equity die die if you're wondering why the sports world has now become as soft as feelings based as obsessed with race and victimization and victimhood it's because that's what Disney and ESPN have been grooming us for they have changed the sports world incredibly and it wasn't done at the snap of a finger this has been a 20 year process a 25 year process of taking over the sports world and injecting it with diversity inclusion and equity it's no longer about great competition it's about quota systems and that's why there's so much discussion about black coaches have they been treated fairly are there enough women in coaching positions in football or basketball Disney does not care about competition it does not care about a meritocracy Disney is a global corporation that wants the sports world and the rest of American society to get on board with the new world order that does not care about democracy capitalism or freedom it cares mostly about communism and a world that favors an elite class of people and victims and oppressors and that's why the entire conversation now about sports and that's why so many idiots sit on ESPN and are placed out there as leaders of thought on race so they can lead this very dumb down feelings obsessed non-factual emotional discussion about race oh Brian Flores he got fired from the dolphins after three years that's got to be racism oh we can ignore the fact that Stephen Ross his whole his damn their entire organization is run by black people the general manager they couldn't get along with Brian Flores was black but we got Shannon Sharpen these other idiots and uh Ryan Clark and the people on ESPN they all went out there the dolphins are racist because it's all about diversity inclusion and equity they have turned the sports world into everything you hate about your job people getting jobs not based on their work not based on their work ethic not based on their uh production but based on some quota system that the human resources department came up with oh is that person gay is he transphobe is he black is he a woman does he think he's a woman those are the key elements of moving up now in the sports world they've corrupted the sports world this whole little debate model they've come up with at ESPN and Disney it's about a dumb conversation that people who know nothing about sports can participate in if diversity inclusion and equity are your uh primary decision makers and qualifications not whether you know anything about football take and I hate to pick on me and the kinds but I gotta be honest what does she know about football she's there because of diversity inclusion and equity and so everybody else or those football players they have her talking to they have to dumb down their conversation so that she can participate I don't want to just single her out because it happens to men as well it's you know how bomani Jones became a star at ESPN he doesn't know anything about sports he's never played it because like six foot four hundred and twenty pounds I'm not exaggerating he couldn't play volleyball when would blow him away but that when when diversity inclusion and equity again you just dumb down the conversation to a point where people that don't know what they talk about what they're talking about can participate and so it's an explosion of idiots that don't know what they're talking about but they can damn sure talk all day about well I think this person's racist I've never met them I don't know anything about their organization but I think they're racist they're white and racism could be the only explanation for why they did what they did Disney loves it it sounds exactly like the conversations that go on inside a corporation overrun by special interest groups they've turned the sports world into Disney's headquarters and a select group of puppet masters and elites get to decide who gets jobs who doesn't get job who the good guys are who the bad guys are it's not about your work it's not about your production Disney has ruined the sports world everything oh our women is the women soccer team getting paid enough are they experiencing sexism the WNBA no one watches them it loses 60 million dollars a year but why aren't these players find private like NBA players that's sexism Adam Silver is running around right now wondering why and he's talked about it publicly hey we're going to cut these games down these superstar players don't want to play in 82 games we're going to have to address this we got to come up with incentives to make our players want to compete and he's wondering why because the players have been convinced their victims that they're being exploited because every time they turn on ESPN or Fox Sports that's what they're being told them racist owners are exploiting you how dare they ask you to play 82 games like Moses Malone and Dr. J did they're running the NFL like a slave plantation they're at they want they actually want you to earn these millions of dollars by playing in these games those racist bigots that's what Disney has done to sports everybody in sports is now a victim sports used to be about champions and victors now it's about victims you had people Joanne Howard gets his butt kicked in a regular season basketball game slaps an opposing assistant assistant coach and you got people talking about that he's a victim of a white man touching his elbow and that's why he slapped a different white man because the Wisconsin head coach touched his elbow those types of discussions did not happen before Disney's takeover of sports a person that would make any of those type arguments would be laughed off air and be told never to come back before Disney and ESPN before Disney totally changed ESPN now everything is about feelings if if Joanne Howard feels disrespected it doesn't matter whether he was actually disrespected Disney has feminized America the education system the movie and music industry and now the sports world if you go back to the crying videos i used to play of the ESPN guys and i love herb street but Randy malls Ryan claud all these guys crying on tv about nothing that's Disney men used to not do that there used to there's no crying in baseball now the greatest thing you can do is go on tv and cry about nothing oh he's in touch with his emotions i think and i apologize to tj and Steve moe i didn't plan on going on for as long as i have but i i think i unpack that i think that's we're being groomed the sports world is being groomed no different than your five-year-old and first grade or kindergarten whatever they're in is being groomed they're grooming us in the sports world as well before i go to tj moe i want to briefly tell you about my great friends and good ranches you guys know i love good ranches you guys know how i feel about good ranches you guys know what you need to be doing good ranches is on your side on your team with all this inflation going on and the price of meat and the price of everything going up you can go to goodranches.com fearless you can lock in

american farmers and ranches meet that supports you me and what we believe in only look again there's some simple things we can do to push back against this culture that's being overtaken by disney

food if you have an opportunity to spend it with a company that supports you and your worldview and your beliefs and traditional american values only a trader wouldn't do it good ranches.com slash fearless use the promo code fearless get 30 dollars off your next meat order do the smart things support good ranches support yourself all right when we come back well you know what i don't even need to go anywhere in tj mo ready to roll no tj yeah let's go out let's roll out the tj mo i don't got to go nowhere tj okay i don't even know where to start other than to say that disney destruction of american culture extends beyond what is doing to little kids and classrooms and at the movie theaters uh it's it's ruined the sports world as well and and this has really come into focus for me over the last few months uh where again i i think we overlook the significance of disneys involvement take over a vspm i think that's absolutely right one thing that came to mind when you were talking about the feminization of what is now business and the sports world too was the new Simone Biles power aid commercial about the power of pause and we're celebrating how awesome it is for you to sit out the olympics when your country is counting on you the most i mean it it it is not i think we've moved in a good way to where we should not be just crushing people in their hardest moment we used to do that but we certainly shouldn't be them celebrating them Failing us in that moment and that's what we're doing we're now celebrating failure We are celebrating failure. We're feminizing making everything about feelings and as you and glenn discussed yesterday We are attacking businesses and the nuclear family all of those things masculinity the the nuclear family small business have held America together that's what america was built on and the godly principles that came with it and so You know one one of the things that came to mind when you were talking about the the Disney lady who has two queer kids as she's described it The only way you could get up there and say that with a straight face Is that you feel so terrible that you screwed up your own kid so bad that you are trying to screw up other people's kids to normalize your parental And that's what she's doing and someone has allowed her into a place of power to do that So we've lost gods. We're looking for a place to create our own morality, right? And so One thing i was thinking about i first I first heard this term back in september What we're seeing here is the shift from shareholder capitalism to stakeholder capitalism and so uh barry wise In her sub stack had a guy i think i'm saying his name right vivic Ramaswami you can look it up. He wrote a book called woke ink and he wrote in the sub stack here The dangers of stakeholder capitalism and i've heard Dan bongino ben shpiro a couple guys talk about this, but i don't think very many people know about it So i want to take a second to explain it And so what what shareholder capitalism is the capitalism that we all assume We are working under and that is that the ultimate measure of a company's success Is its profits and how it can take care of its shareholders That's Obviously that works that the consumer has decided that your product or service is worth more than their money So they have traded their money for that. That's good. If you are profitable. That means you can provide jobs That's also good, right? So it's working for everyone. That's the way we all understand it We have shifted to stakeholder capitalism and this is coming from the very top stakeholder capitalism is the notion that a firm focuses on meeting the needs of all of its stakeholders and stakeholders are defined as customers Employees partners the community and society as a whole. So what it's done is it has completely Allowed you to get out of your responsibility to your shareholders. We just say well whatever's best for society So joe biden in his campaign trail Back in in the 2020 election. He was preaching this He said quote it's way past time We put an end to the era of shareholder capitalism the idea that only Responsibility a corporation has is with its shareholders that idea is an absolute farce They have a responsibility to their workers their community in their country So he's preaching this coming from the top the world economic forum in the the Davos manifesto in 2020 is preaching this The first line of this said the purpose of a company is to engage all of its stakeholders In shared and sustained value creation. So they are shifting the notion of what capitalism is remember They tried socialism for a very long time. They try to burn out there twice in the last two elections and could not get them there So they've shifted now from socialism to stakeholder capitalism or Elizabeth Warren calls it accountability capitalism They are saying well americans obviously really like capitalism So we've got to find a way to change what that actually is to get what we want and so executives many of them are screwed up like the Disney executive that you saw again can't control her own kids And she has so many shortcomings at her own house She's trying to screw up other kids or many of these people themselves are so screwed up that they're trying to get the world to accept them and recruit people That's one reason but the other reason is we have a lot of people who are executives in these large corporations who look to twitter as What you on must call it the de facto town town square And I don't know if you've ever looked up the makeup of twitter, but it ain't good. Okay in 2019 The Pew Research Center came out with Basically the discourse that occurs and who it comes from on twitter 92 of all tweets come from 10 of posters So 10 of people are creating all of the content and of those 10 percent Seven out of 10 of those people are Democrats and when they say democrats actually if you go read this study they call themselves hardcore leftists So this this is the fringe of all of the crazy people They're all on twitter and they're posting of those 10 percent again a lot of numbers here But The democrats in that 10 percent are posting twice as often as the republicans So to clarify here of all the people that are going it is it is very likely that the the Tweets from the leftists are four times as frequent as tweets from conservatives And so not only do we have the shadow banning and the censorship and the deplatforming of conservatives But of all the content that's disseminating it's coming from the fringe leftists So you have Joe Biden and you have the world economic forum coming out and saying we need move to stakeholder capitalism And then you go to twitter and all these people are supporting that So the executives that otherwise might be reasonable are looking to that and saying okay This is obviously the where the world's going We're not just responsible to our shareholders. We're responsible to our stakeholders Well, that's a real problem because the stakeholders obviously are not invested in your company at all You're just a tool to them You they will use you for as long as they need to and then they'll move on to the next company That's useful to them because they are not actually affected by what happens to your company So they have this political agenda whatever reason that may be and they say you guys need to do this It's for the betterment of society And then you do that your profits go down And so your shareholders are upset and then the consumers leave you and they've turned their back on you This is what's happening to disney plus right now And and then you have to minimize your jobs because you can't afford to pay that many people So a lot of people get laid off and then you're stuck there with a company that was once a monster That's going to be far less than impactful because you have decided that society Is who should be dictating your values instead of the people that are actually Involved and have put their own livelihood At risk to do that and when you do put your own livelihood at risk to do that and you turn around and decide that those are the people that You should make happy remember the consumers are happy because they're the ones trading their money for your goods or service And the employees are happy because they have a job and if you have a A growing company that's doing well, then you can afford to pay them more you can create more jobs And so One thing one thing I was looking at and then I thought it was fascinating This is not a new idea. It turns out leftists don't have any new ideas Marxism is not new it has been tried many times over and they're still pushing it socialism not new This is not a new idea either. This this idea was born in 1932 and it was tried for about 40 years In 1970 is actually when we began pursuing maximizing shareholder value Milton freeman who's my favorite economist of all time he won a Nobel Prize in economics in 1970. He said this any business executives who pursued a goal Other than making money were quote unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society For the last four decades. That's from the greatest economy of our time So we have a bunch of people Who have decided that stakeholder? Capitalism is the way to go and it's going to wreck their business You obviously said a mouthful stakeholder capitalism to me just sounds like rebranding of socialism or communism. It's just it's just taking the word capitalism and Covering it up giving it a beard or whatever, but it's just it's just rebranding of socialism and or communism And it's just a gateway drug to get you where they really want you to go The other thing because one you unpacked a lot and at some point We'll circle back on the stakeholder and shareholder but one of the things I've noticed with executives and what twitter and social media have done is It's a limited leadership And it prioritizes survival And so what I see from every top executive Adversely any company big or small They're just thinking how can I survive? What decision can I make today that will allow me to survive and to keep collecting this check and so uh Roger Goodell. I'm going to use him as the example. He's making 50 million a year His number one goal every day is how can I make continue to make 50 million a year? He's not thinking about hey, how can I protect the sport of football the NFL brand? Uh, how can I make this business stronger and stay true to the values it was founded on and made it great Every decision he makes is about his own survival so he can keep collecting that 50 million dollars And I see the same mentality with executives that make $300,000 Is what decision can I make to keep myself out of the twitter crosshairs so that I can survive? Because they know They that someone can ring up to take take what happened to Papa John. He's a personal friend of mine John Schneider Ball state graduate friend of mine built up Papa John's pizza Uh, they use social media and twisted some interaction he had Uh with a public relations firm and ran him out of his own company That's everybody's worst nightmare. You build up a company Make it, you know Everything that Papa John's pizza is and they on some bs They ran him out of his own company using social media and some balt and paid for uh corporate media and so everybody's in survival mode And and it's why the decisions and the moves that I met I don't I want to thrive. I'm willing to die in pursuit of thriving and Uh, it's why I had to get away from the whole corporate land to escape because I just want to say the truth speak the truth And and even when I'm wrong in terms of because I'll admit like I'm wrong and I'll pivot to a different truth If if I'm shown better information or whatever I just want that freedom and I could care less about what social media has to say about me Uh, but that is not the case of most people and and you know, maybe one day I'll be in roger gadale shoes making 50 million dollars And I'll capitulate on every issue as well to protect that 50 it's unlikely. It's highly unlikely I I made a lot of decisions that have cost me money and I'll probably continue to do that But tg I got to go because I went too long. Uh, I want to get to the korean co-sell Thanks You All right, welcome back Uh, we're going to move on and bring in uh, Tennessee state representative tom leatherwood a former school teacher Uh before joining, uh, tennessee's house of representatives Uh, tom is from the mnfus area. He's the sponsor of a bill that has turned controversial I hate to call it controversial, but it's a bill about common law marriage between one man and one woman uh democrats have seized upon it to twist it into a bill that Uh, seemingly through a loophole Would allow minors to marry or for adults to marry Miners, there's no aids limit or restriction. Anyway I wanted to bring tom leatherwood on and have him explain what his original thought was I believe it's called the bill is called hb 233 I believe uh, so tom, uh, welcome to the show And and please explain to us first we'll start here What was the point what were you trying to accomplish with your common law marriage bill? First thank you, jason for the opportunity to be on and try and clear up Just all the misinformation that is just flying Around out there. Uh, the dogs have definitely been uh released on me here, but that's just part of being in public life Um first this bill changes nothing In current, tennessee law regarding marriage And it does not allow minors to get married And in the version that I passed through subcommittee It would not have allowed minors to get married because it forms a contract And before they reached the age of consent or majority they could not enter into this contract But to try and satisfy these Indirect attacks on the bill. I amended it to explicitly say both parties Have to have reached the age of majority which in tennessee is defined as 18 years or older Um what the bill does the problem we were trying to fix um In current tennessee law and with the core cases associated with that are Process and the certificates have changed where it used to be a section On the marriage certificate for brian and their information their parents names and groom same thing The certificates now through this process and again related to the court actions. You've got applicant one bride groom partner applicant two bride groom partner You've got father or parent mother or parent and then at the bottom the ministers the efficiency Sign off on that. Well ministers came to me who had conscientious objections based on their deep religious convictions They had problems signing off on this marriage certificate So all this bill would do is Create a parallel pathway To marriage and tennessee law and the bill lays out there Um and substantial form what the marriage certificate will say That marriages between one man one woman and uh instead of having bride groom Partner one bride groom partner two where you can groom groom bride bride partner groom Bride partner partner partner. I mean we we know there's a lot of options these days um It would just say bride and groom again. It's not Eliminating the current certificate or pathway not changing that at all a man can get married License marry a man in tennessee today If my bill passes a man can get a marriage license and marry another man and get a certificate that reflects that but I um fully understand and agree with These pastors objections to signing off on that form and frankly tennessee Overwhelmingly voted in a statewide referendum to add to our state constitution that marriage is between one man and one woman So it seems like we ought to be able to just carve out a little niche for these people So tom let me ask you this Just for clarification if I may minister And I object to marrying two men Why can't I just say no i'm not going to do that and and leave it at that um You could in that case but say you're going to marry a man and a woman And then they present you the marriage certificate to sign off on whether marriage certificate says Yeah, bride room partner bride room partner and then you're signing off on this form that recognizes um acknowledges and in many people's eyes um promotes Something they deeply disagree Don't believe it. I mean just think of something you disagree with and you go to sign a contract on something and It really has nothing to do with you buying that car buying that house or whatever but the form says you know These facts or these points of view that you disagree with and you have to sign off on that Now Why can't there be a form that says bride groom and that Parents you have a father and a mother as opposed to a parent parent You know, why can't we have this other Form again not taking away the one that's there today But why can't they just have one that says? This marriage that i'm performing is between a man and a woman a bride and a groom And they have a mother and a father That's really Assembly all the day. Oh, yeah I get what you said that there are people and I would imagine this extends beyond ministers there may be A bride and a groom whose religious convictions would compel them to say I don't want a marriage license That recognizes a form of marriage That violates my religious principles And so the objection could not just be from ministers It could be from of the participants in the marriage in not wanting to get married on a license that Seems to co-sign or promote or normalize a form of marriage that their religious views have made them see as disobedient to god. So so I get it. Let me ask you this though having uh, you're an experienced politician Did you not See this little loophole that the democrats or people because again, I don't even know if i'm a it is the democrats But it's really the lgbt crowd that is really upset with you and look for a loophole to try to Uh, distort what your bill was actually doing and because as soon as I read the story, I was like, well, hold on man The guy's not trying to Legalize marriage between minors. He's trying to do something else but could could you not anticipate that And just have put it in the original bill that you had to be 18 to to participate in this form of marriage Um So Sorry about that I've got a cat ringtone on my phone. It just started ringing um First a point you made with not just ministers but participants you are absolutely right It was ministers signed off on a petition But frankly my district knows what i'm doing. I've gotten so much support From rank and file individuals that totally get it. They knew they knew this being so So it is individuals as well and thankfully Um, I've got a very conserved republican district So they get it and it is more than ministers. So you are absolutely right with that um as far as Changing the verbiage originally I wish I had at this point But again the bill that I passed through subcommittee it did not say it explicitly But we were forming a contract a marital contract and minors cannot enter into these contracts You know, they haven't reached the age of majority or the age of consent. So they could not um do this so The people on the front lines they knew minors couldn't enter into these contracts, but they saw Frankly not a loophole, but a way to distort What they knew was in there. And so once we were Aware that it was becoming distorted and um You made another good Point i'll come back to but once we realized it was being distorted I offered and have put an amendment on there that explicitly says the a so it wasn't a loophole It was just frankly where deceivers Found an opportunity To deceive those people that some are easily deceived others just want to be deceived But you made um A point about this really being the lesbian and homosexual Uh crowd they're very well organized nationally Um, they tried to stop this bill coming through committee in the house and senate directly testifying against it But it came right out of committee because the people understood on the committee But once it came out of committee and the direct attacks didn't work suddenly this became an international Um issue, you know bbc got in touch with me people all over the country that did not happen naturally Uh because I offered the amendment to solve that problem So this wasn't a natural growth of people having concerns. This was an orchestrated um attack by a very well organized nationwide Group, I mean, that's the only explanation frankly why it showed up on your radar and uh I have somebody I went to high school with said I heard your name on the radio and it in lana You know that that can't be time mother would and so It it's been interesting It's been interesting Tom, let me let me ask this and I'll let you go Uh, obviously you're a politician. You're there to represent your constituents You've said that you know your constituents are backing you And and so I get that you're doing what a politician is supposed to do Back his condition constituents beliefs and and look for laws that support them I do want to ask you though personally Uh is any of this personal in your part in your religious convictions In line with what you're hearing from your constituents is this the the Is it just a reflection of what your constituents want to do or is it also what tom leatherwood believes I it is also what tom leatherwood believes and it's important to represent your constituents I believe I do that Um along those lines. I've been told you'll end up drawing opposition Over this issue and sure enough two days ago, you know an opponent is trying to Run with this and support the other side. So I did draw opposition, but that's part of the game So it's important to represent your constituents But you said your beliefs i've phrased it evictions First and foremost, it's important for me to represent my convictions And then represent my constituents and if my constituents don't like my convictions the process is My opponent on this issue will win the election and so be it I'm at peace with that because again, I feel like uh my final judgment Comes uh after death and that's the only one that i'm really Concerned about in the long run and as an example i've told people If my district became a hundred percent Pro-choice, I'm still going to be pro-life because into the day I have to Live with myself my family and answer it to my god and if i lose the election So be it there's life after elected office Yes Yes, there is.
