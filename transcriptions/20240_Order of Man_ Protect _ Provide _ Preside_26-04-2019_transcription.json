You are not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, what is going on? This is Ryan Micler, and I am the host and the founder of this podcast, The Order of Man. I want to welcome you to the podcast. I want to welcome you to the greater movement that is Order of Man with the idea of recapturing and reclaiming and restoring masculinity in a society that seems to be increasingly dismissive of it, which is the exact subject that we're going to be talking about today with the title being the Castration of the Modern Mail. We're going to get into that in a minute. If you are new, I want to tell you really briefly what we're all about here. We've got this show, of course, your Friday Field Notes, where you get to hear from me and some of my thoughts that I've been thinking of from throughout the week. We've also got our interview show where we are interviewing the most successful men on the planet. These are guys like David Goggins, Jaco Willink, Andy Fersilla, Tim Kennedy, Dakota Meyer, the list, the lineup of men that have joined us in this battle is absolutely phenomenal. So if you haven't listened to past interviews that we've done, make sure you go back and listen. Make sure you subscribe so you never miss a podcast moving forward. And also, if you would, please leave us a rating and review. It goes such a long way in promoting the visibility of this podcast and this movement. And the third show that we have every week is our Ask Me Anything, which comes out on Wednesday, where Kip Sorenson, my co-host, and I answer questions from our exclusive Brotherhood, the Iron Council, and also from our Facebook group. So if you want to learn more about what we're doing, those are two great resources, Facebook.com slash groups slash Order of Man and the Iron Council, our exclusive Brotherhood, is Order of Man dot com slash Iron Council. So with that said, let's just jump right into this today. No announcements. I want to talk about this. It's critical, critical that we address this, that we recognize it, that we understand what's happening. Specifically, I'm going to talk about, again, the castration of the modern male. I'm going to talk about why this is happening. I'm going to talk about what is actually happening. And then I'm going to go through 10 very specific strategies that each of us can employ in our lives and the lives of the men that we have a responsibility for, or the boys that we are raising, so that we don't continue to perpetuate the problem of these castrated men. And it's critical, critical that we recognize it, that we acknowledge it, that we do something about it. Because if we don't, then what will happen is the cycle or the process will continue, and it will be too late by the time that we wake up and realize what's happening. And I've seen a lot of people out there, men included, even men who listen to this podcast, who refuse to see the problem, who don't see the problem, who are ignorant to what's going on in society, that continues to dismiss and systematically dismantle and reject the idea of masculinity. And it's not even an idea. Just reject masculinity. It's not an idea. It's biological. So let's just get right into it. When I talk about the castration of the modern male, castration I think we all understand is removing the testicles. And obviously I'm being figurative here. I'm not being literal. This is exactly what's happening. Men are losing their balls. And we are becoming softer, more effeminate. We are becoming weaker. And I believe that there is a larger agenda at play. I believe a lot of this is somewhat organic. And I believe also that a lot of it is orchestrated. And it's orchestrated. And it's moving organically by three main proponents of this idea of castrating men. Number one, it's perpetuated in the school system. Number two, it's perpetuated in the government. And number three, and more recently we continue to see that this problem is being exacerbated by the medical community. So I'm going to break each one of those down. When it comes to the school system, I think it's no surprise that most of our young men and young girls, frankly, are being taught by women. Now, I want to be very clear here. There's nothing wrong with women's school teachers. In fact, I honor any woman or man who steps into that role and has a desire to teach our young children. That is not an easy task. It's often very thankless. It's very difficult to do. It doesn't really pay all that well. And a lot of the times it's very, very frustrating and challenging because our school teachers are pigeonholed into the way that they're performing and the way that they're teaching and the way that they're raising our youth. But if you look at specifically, there's three resources that I want to introduce you to that some of you may be familiar with that go deeper into the problem with the school system, especially in that it's stacked against our young boys. So number one is Dr. Leonard Sacks. We've had Dr. Sacks on the podcast. In the past, he's got some great books, one titled Boys Adrift, the other one titled Why Gender Matters. And then also introduce you to Dr. Warren Farrell, who has been on the podcast as well, wrote a book called The Boy Crisis and then Christina Hoff Summers. And she talks about the war on boys. All three of these resources go more into depth than I'm going to go into today. But what happens is that we have these boys who are growing up in a system that is not conducive to the way boys learn. They're told to sit down. They're told to shut up. They're told to figuratively and literally color within the lines. They're told to do it this certain way. And then if they fall outside of the way that they're supposed to operate, that somehow there's something wrong with them. And because there's something wrong with them, what do we do? We over medicate and we get into ADD and ADHD and all these types of behavioral quote unquote disorders when it might just be that they don't want to sit in the classroom, that they don't want to learn that way, that there's a more effective way of teaching our boys. I'm not saying that these boys shouldn't at some point learn to focus, but there's other opportunities that will allow boys to learn in a meaningful and significant way that taps into that masculine energy that we see so many young men possess. And I think the school system has done a huge, huge disservice by attempting to turn off that side of our young men and silence it when we could actually be harnessing it. And I think this is a large part of the reason that we see in the school system and specifically with our young men, more dropout rates, more suicide, more depression. We see college entry going down for men. Women continue and will continue to get the jobs and get into college and higher education. That's because the school system is quite literally stacked against our youth. So that's the one problem. Again, we're going to talk about how to address these things. Number two is the government. The government is stacked against men. If you look at entitlement programs, if you look at the family court system and how often men aren't able to see their children, if you look at criminal activity, men are more likely to be sentenced for longer periods of time than women for the same activities. A lot of this is really going to create a real and has created a real problem for men showing up in society, men showing up for work and their jobs, and men specifically showing up for their families. And I believe in addition to the attack on masculinity, there is also a huge, huge attack on the family unit. And if they can strip away men from the family unit, I think they're going to have a whole lot easier time being manipulative, controlling, and then subjugating our citizens, which is ultimately, I believe, the objective. Then we have the third component, the third tier of this attack, which is the medical community. Now, I think this is somewhat new, but I think the problems are going to continue to get worse. And one of the biggest things that I see when it comes to the castration of the modern male regarding the community, the medical community that is, is this American psychological associations blatant attack and dismissal, not on what they would dub toxic masculinity, but on masculinity of itself. If you go in and you actually read that study, what it suggests is that the attributes that we would typically and traditionally associate with masculinity, things like aggression, dominance, competitiveness, stoicism, what they've said is that these things are actually harmful in society. And that's the furthest thing from the truth. The reason that men display more often than women, these characteristics, is for good purposes. We just need to be able to harness these things. It's not wrong or bad to be competitive. It's not wrong or bad to be aggressive when the situation calls for it. It's not wrong or bad to be stoic, which I think they've misunderstood what stoicism is. It's not suppression of emotions. Please understand that. Stolicism is not about suppressing emotions. It's about understanding emotions and then using them simply as a tool or a metric for improvement and growth in somebody's life. So with the school system, with the government and with the medical community stacked against men, I think we've got an uphill battle here. I think we've got a real challenging road ahead, and I think it's going to create some real problems in society. And in fact, I think that's part of the reason. I believe that men and families also throw that in there as well represent the last line of defense against the powers that would be, against the powers that would try to control and subjugate us. Strong, capable, moral, independent, sovereign men who are leading their families and leading their businesses and leading their communities represent a threat to a higher power that wants to control and coerce and manipulate them. And have absolute reign over its citizens. That is why this is becoming an issue. And if we want to continue to maintain our sovereignty and our control and our ability to live our lives the way that we are intended to live our lives and that we have the ability to raise our families the way that we see fit without being infringed upon, then it's on us as men to tap into the characteristics and the virtues and the qualities that make us men harness those things so that we can continue to live life the way that we are meant to live and ward off any danger against ourselves, against our families, against our communities, and frankly, against our way of life. And I want to spend the bulk of the discussion on how we do this, because the last thing I ever want to do is create an environment or a conversation in which all we do is complain about how the odds are stacked against us and why this is so bad and what's going wrong. And you'll find plenty of that out there. Trust me. I don't want to add to that conversation. I want to highlight what's going on. I want to highlight why the school system is stacked against us and why government programs and the family court system and the medical community are working against men. And then I want to use that information to equip ourselves with the options to fix the situation. More time focused on the how we fix this rather than why and what is actually happening. So let's get into this, guys. These are not in any specific order. And if you have more, if you have more ideas about how we may enlist ourselves and other men and the tools that we have at our disposal to ward off the powers that would be and keep ourselves as men and keep ourselves. And then, and keep our balls, if you will, then please let me know. Share that stuff on Instagram, Twitter, both at Ryan Mickler. My last name is spelled M-I-C-H-L-E-R. I'm very, very active on both. And I would love to hear what solutions you propose as well. That's the whole point of order of men is that we band together as men to become better men and to keep ourselves relevant in a society that I think wants to make us less relevant. All right, let's get into this. Number one, we've got to recognize and reject the idea that it's not okay to be a man. That somehow masculinity in and of itself is toxic. If we bury our heads in the sand and we play stupid and we play ignorant and we pretend like nothing's really happening and we don't actually look at what is going on, then it's going to be a whole lot easier for these powers to be to control, manipulate, coerce, and again, we won't recognize it before it's too late. That's why this work is so important. That's why what we're doing here with order of man is so critical. I want to get out ahead of the problem, not be playing ketchup. So we've got to recognize what's going on. We've got to see these attacks, whether they're deliberate and intentional or whether they're a lot more covert. We've got to recognize them for what they are and reject the idea that masculinity is inherently wrong, evil, destructive, etc, etc. So number one, recognize and reject it. We do that by tuning into this information. We do that by listening to good books. We do that by educating ourselves and listening to the podcast and having conversations with other men. This is how we begin to recognize what's happening. And by the way, if you have somebody in your life, a man in your life who could benefit from what we're doing here, make sure you share this. Share this podcast. Invite them to the Facebook group. Have them join the Iron Council with you. Get them involved in the movement. Number two, we have got to be strong. And when I say strong, I'm talking about physically strong, mentally, emotionally strong because the stronger that we are and the more that we work, our muscles, our minds, our hearts, our soul, our hearts, our hearts, our hearts, our hearts, our hearts. Our souls, our physical muscles. The harder it is for anybody to have any sort of weight and relevance in our lives because we're able to ward that stuff off. We live in a time where being strong, quite frankly, is optional. And so it's up to us as men to voluntarily step into hardship and struggle and challenge so that we can make ourselves strong in a society that doesn't require it. That's the hard part is nobody's going to tell you to go to the gym. Nobody's going to tell you to do something difficult. In fact, you're going to be rewarded just for showing up. We have these cute little phrases like showing up is half the battle. No, it's not half the battle. You're not even in the battle. You got to the battle field. We've got to expect more from ourselves. So we've got to go into the gym. We've got to exercise. We've got to make ourselves strong and capable. We've got to do the things that scare us, whether that's asking for a raise or asking for the woman out on the table. The woman out on a date, whether that's speaking in public, the things that frighten you, that scare you are the things that are going to make you stronger. And they're going to be able to help you ward off any threat when that threat presents itself. So number two is be strong. Number three, live sovereign. I wrote a book called sovereignty, the battle for the hearts and minds of men. And what I see so many men do is they're giving away their responsibility in their lives. They give it away to the government when they start accepting government handouts. They give it away to their boss when they know they could potentially go start another business. And yet they've got these golden handcuffs in the form of a 401k or some health benefits. And so they give away any responsibility for their own life. We give it away to the school system when it comes to raising our kids and then we wonder why they're not doing a good job. That's our responsibility. These are the things that we should be doing. We have to live sovereign. We also give it away to financial companies when we go into debt in order to have things that we don't necessarily need. Well, now that company has weight over us. They have a bearing in our life and they're charging us interest and they've enslaved us with their debt. You've got to live sovereign. Essentially what I'm saying here is that you've got to be independent of these things. If you can be bought off or manipulated because of your actions or somebody has their thumb over you, then you are not living as a sovereign man and your actions are going to be dictated by other individuals. So you've got to live sovereign. You've got to live independent. You've got to get out from the thumb of your boss. You've got to get out from the benefits you're receiving from the government. You've got to get away from these things. And as challenging as difficult as it is in times, especially if you've been living this way for a long period of time, it's critical. Critical that you do not enslave yourself to any other person, entity, organization or government. Keep yourselves free, fight for independence and freedom, and know that anything that you receive from another individual or from an organization or the government typically has strings attached. And those are strings that you don't want to be tied to. Live sovereign. Number four, gain confidence. Gain confidence. I talk with a lot of men who seem to believe that some men are just inherently confident. And I would argue that if you believe that or see another man who you think is inherently confident, that may not be inherent confidence, it's either something that's been earned or it's an inflated sense of pride and ego. Those are the only two things it can be. It can't be some sort of confidence that some individual hasn't earned. The fact of the matter is that if you want confidence in your life, you have to earn it. You're not entitled to it. It's not a right. It's not something that just some men have. Those who have genuine confidence are those who have gone out and done the things to my previous point that have pushed them, that have scared them, that have gotten them outside of their comfort zone. And because they're willing to do those things, they gain confidence in who they are. They gain confidence in themselves. And they're able to stand up for themselves because they're capable of doing so. So if you're walking around as a scared little boy, it's safe to assume that you probably haven't done anything worth being confident about. And I have guys that will ask me, how do I gain confidence with women? How do I gain confidence with asking for a raise or starting a new business? You gain confidence by taking action, by exhibiting some level of courage in your life that will allow you to feel good about what you've done. That you're actually able to accomplish something that you didn't previously think you could accomplish. This is how we gain confidence. So take some notes and think about what it is that scares you. When you run across something today that's freaking you out a little bit, write it down and recognize that if you can learn to plow through that thing or do it in the face of fear, that you'll come out the other side more capable and more confident. Confidence is critical because it equips us with the mindset we need to stand up to other individuals and organizations that would otherwise control us. So number four, gain confidence. Now, again, these aren't in any order, but if you think about what we've done, we're living sovereign, we're independent of any other person or organization. We're gaining confidence through action. We're now strengthening ourselves physically, mentally, emotionally. We actually recognize, we've opened our eyes to what is actually happening. That gives us the ability now to speak boldly, which is point number five. When we see these things and we see what's happening and we recognize what's going on and how the deck is stacked against men, if we do these other things, it gives us the ability to now speak boldly. A lot of men who reach out to me and say, I'd really appreciate what you're doing. You're putting into words what I've always thought. And while I appreciate the compliment and I certainly will continue to do that, my thought is inevitably, why aren't you doing this? Why aren't you being out there? Why aren't you being vocal? Why aren't you talking with other people about what's going on? Why aren't you inviting people to this movement? Why aren't you starting your own movement? Guys, we've got to do better about being bold when it comes to our rhetoric and the things that we're saying not only to ourselves, but other people. Our family, our friends, our neighbors, our colleagues, our coworkers, random people, strangers, which is obviously what we're doing here when people find the podcast for the first time. It's critical that we speak boldly. We can't just sit back and assume that everything will work itself out because the vocal minority tends to be the ones who get the progress. It's like the squeaky wheel. So we've got to be a squeaky wheel in a way. We've got to reject this, but we've also got to talk about why we reject it and what we should be doing instead. But you can only do that when you're confident. You can only do that when you're independent. You can only do that when you're strong. You can only do that when your eyes are open to what is actually happening. But once you have those things in place, you need to speak boldly and speak out about what's happening. And if you're not willing to do that at a minimum, you should be sharing what we're doing here because I'm willing to do it. And if that's what it takes in order for more people to hear this message, then so be it. The next one. Despise mediocrity. I think this is point number six. Yes, despise mediocrity. Again, we live in a time where it's so easy to be mediocre. It's so easy to be complacent. It's so easy to just take the default path and the path of least resistance. And nobody's going to tell you you need to do otherwise. And that's the rub. That's the challenge. Is that nobody's going to tell you to excel. Nobody's going to tell you to succeed. In fact, in a lot of ways, you're actually rewarded for blending in, for being average, for being mediocre, for doing the bare minimum, for just showing up. We can't be that way. We've got to be assertive. We've got to be bold. We've got to despise the status quo. We've got to continue to elevate our positions and improve in every single way possible by educating ourselves, by getting strong, by going the extra mile, by taking on responsibility that isn't quote unquote, our responsibility. These are the things that we need to do in order to excel in our own lives, make ourselves more relevant, more credible, and then the authority, of course, that comes with somebody who is despising mediocrity and somebody who is excellent in a lot of different ways. If you're excelling at work, your voice is more credible, your actions are more credible. The things that you say and the things that you do carry more weight than those who are just going with the flow and wherever the tides and the, the, the, the kind of things that you do. The current may take them. So despise mediocrity, reject it completely, step into something bigger and better and grander and bolder and make yourself better than you were yesterday and tomorrow better than you were today. Number seven, yes, number seven is that we've got to edify and sustain men in leadership positions, whether this is within our community. Our neighbors, whether it's in a work environment, even in politics, and I don't need to get into politics too much here, but it's critical that we find honorable men and capable men. Those are two different things, by the way, and they're not mutually exclusive. They need to be both honorable and capable. And when we find these honorable and capable men, we need to edify them. We need to sustain them. We need to uplift them. We need to vote for them. We need to support them and rally around these individuals. The more that we do this, the better off we're going to be. I think about, for example, in politics, it's very easy to see that there are males in politics, but I think it's infinitely harder to find men, genuine men who believe in all of the other things that I've been talking about today, who believe that there is a dismissal at a minimum or an attack at the worst end of masculinity. But men who believe in the steps and the things that I'm sharing with you right now need to be uplifted, sustained, voted for, and elevated to the position of leadership and authority. And when those men, when and if those men fall from that, if they start to deviate from the steps that I'm sharing with you right now, then it's on us to remove those people from leadership and instill other leaders who are going to be more effective as men. So that's seven. Uh, number eight, live morally. Live morally. There's a lot of discussion and question about where morality comes from. And I've thought a lot about this. I'd love to hear your opinion on this. Is morality subjective or is it objective? I believe personally that it's objective. I believe our morality comes from God. Now you may not believe in God. You may not believe that's the case. I believe that's the case. So I believe it's objective. But at the end of the day, I believe that most of us, if not all of us, know what is moral behavior because we all have a conscience. Or in my opinion, we have the Holy Spirit guiding us and directing us and telling us what is us, what is right and what is wrong. All of us know right from wrong. We have to live it. We have to live it. And the only phrase that comes to mind when I think about this is through discipline comes freedom. That's Aristotle. He said that 2,000 years ago, Jacco says, through a discipline equals freedom. It's the same concept. When we can learn to be disciplined and live morally, the way that we know we should be living, then we will be more free. But if we get into the things that we know we shouldn't be doing, whether that's lying, cheating, stealing, short-cutting, being lazy, really what I would refer to as the natural man. A natural man, immediate gratification wants the result without the effort. When we step into who that man is, we do ourselves and other people a disservice and we make ourselves vulnerable targets. Guys, we've got to live morally. I'm not going to get into what that means entirely, but we've got to do what's right. We've got to have honor. We've got to have integrity. We've got to have character. We've got to be disciplined. We've got to make sure that our actions are in line with our words. And all of us fall short. I fall short every day. But I'm attempting and I'm trying and I'm doing what I can to live morally so that I can live a better life for myself. And I'm less likely to be subjugated by those who would exert their authority or control over me. So number eight is to live morally. Number nine, you've got to be enhancing your capabilities. In all ways, you've got to become more proficient, more capable. You've got to become equipped with the tools and the conversations and the skill set and the mindset and the resources to be able to fend off any threats to be able to have these types of conversations that we're talking about here to be able to put yourself and those you have an obligation and responsibility for in a better situation to defend to protect, to provide, to preside. You've got to develop the hard skills and the soft skills so that you aren't reliant upon other people. That you aren't giving away your sovereignty. That you are confident that you can speak boldly. That you are edifying other individuals, men who are men. That you put yourself in that position through your capability, through your ability to perform. And ultimately, I believe that is the measure of a man, not what he thinks about, not what he wants to be, but who he is. And the results that he produces for himself. I've talked a lot about the differences between a boy and a man. A boy is primarily a consumer. He consumes more than he produces, but a man is a producer. He produces more than he consumes. And we are able to produce more when we're capable in all ways. So what information do you need to study? What skill set do you need to develop? What area of life could you improve? Write those things down and start working towards those. Use our 12-week battle plan system. Do whatever you can to make yourself more capable in all ways. And the last step, point number 10 that I want to share with you today is that we need to raise these types of men. First, we need to be it. I think the underlying thread between the previous nine points that I've shared with you today is that we need to be the type of men that are capable of reclaiming and restoring masculinity. We need to be the kind of men who aren't castrated, who don't allow themselves to be castrated by the powers that be. We need to be these strong, rugged, individual, sovereign men. And when we can learn to step into that role, like we're supposed to, then we have the ability to raise those men behind us. There is a huge, huge problem. I've talked about it. And that war is being waged, I believe, primarily on our boys. Because if those boys can be indoctrinated to believe that masculinity is somehow inherently wrong or toxic, then this problem is going to continue to get worse. So it's us men who have an obligation and responsibility to turn around and assist the boys who are coming behind us in growing up and becoming the type of men that we're talking about here. That means that you need to be a father in your home. If you have children, boys and girls, then it is now your obligation and your moral responsibility to raise those boys the way they need to be raised. If you don't have boys, I believe, just as a man and a leader in the community, that you have a moral obligation and responsibility to step up within leadership in your community. This could be within a mentoring program. This could be a big brothers type program. This could be coaching a youth sports team. Whatever you can do to be a leader of men and boys in your community, the better off we're going to be. Guys, this problem isn't going to go away. It's not anybody else's responsibility to solve it. It's not my responsibility to be the only one who's engaged in this fight. I'm not. There are millions and millions of men who believe like we do, who see what's happening, who dismiss and reject this disgusting idea that masculinity is inherently wrong, and who are actually doing something about it. I encourage you to be one of those types of individuals. I am trying to enlist more men in this battle. It's an external battle against the school system, against the government, against the medical community, and it's an internal battle in that we are to battle and want to be a leader. I'm going to battle and wage war against what I dubbed as the natural man, the guy who's lazy, and immediate gratification, and once again, the result without the effort. These are the battles that we are called to fight. These are the battles that we need to equip ourselves with, the tools and the resources and the information and the conversations and the capabilities to be able to wage this battle and win. Let me break these down again and we'll call it a day. Number one, recognize and reject what's actually happening regarding masculinity. Number two, be strong. Number three, live sovereign, independent. Number four, gain confidence. Number five, speak boldly against this stuff. Number six, despise mediocrity. Number seven, edify and sustain men in leadership positions. Number eight, live morally. Number nine, enhance your capabilities in all ways. And number 10, raise men. So guys, that's what I've got for you today. I recognize this as being a problem. It's not enough to recognize it. It's not enough to know that we are being systematically and figuratively, I should say, castrated in society today. It's up to us to maintain our position, maintain our authority, maintain our relevance and our credibility in a society that seems to be undermining us at every turn. And we can do this, and we should do this. We do this collectively. We do this together within the order. And I believe that as we adhere to these 10 systems and these 10 steps or strategies and more, the strategies you're going to share with me on Instagram or Twitter, that we will begin to turn a tide of the battle that is being waged against men. So if you would guys, make sure again that you're following along with us in our Facebook group or connecting with me again on Instagram and Twitter, both at Ryan McLuhan. I'm very active in both of those places and that you do your part in this battle to castrate the modern male. Guys, I appreciate you being on this path with me. I appreciate how you're stepping up in your life. I'm anxious to hear from you guys and what more we could be doing to win this war. And I just want to let you know that I could not do this alone and that I'm inspired and uplifted and edified by you guys every single day as I see what you're doing within the walls of your families and your homes and your businesses and your communities. So that's all I've got for you today, guys. Have a great weekend. Take this stuff to heart. Apply it in your life and we will all be better off. Until next week for our interview show, go out there, take action and become the man you are meant to be. Thank you for listening to the Order of Man podcast. You're ready to take charge of your life. To be more of the man you were meant to be, we invite you to join the Order at quarterofman.com. Thank you."
