We started, unfortunately, with Nancy Pelosi's announcement, which almost made my headaches explode. Chris Pratt, Howard Stern, our own writer, Kevin, talked to Kanye and Kamala Harris and his experience. And it's a crazy, crazy show, plus something very, very important, going back to tradition and what I feel we need to do in a special personal request from me all on today's podcast. You're listening, too. The best of the command-back program. I can't tell you. We can't, I think we're trying to find the right feed. We don't have rights, apparently, to this live feed, and it's really hacking me up. We have it. Good. We have the feed. Go ahead. Here's Nancy Pelosi. During the debate over impeachment at the Constitutional Convention, George Mason also asked, shall any man be a bishop? Above justice. Shall that man be above it who can commit the most extensive injustice? In his great wisdom, he knew that injustice committed by the President erodes the rule of law, the very idea that of fair justice, which is the bedrock of our democracy. And if we allow President to be above the law, we do so surely at the peril of our Republic. In America, no one is above the law. I agree with that. I just wish she did. Over the last few weeks through the Intelligence Committee working with the Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees, the American people have heard the testimony of truly patriotic career public servants, distinguished diplomats, and decorated war heroes. Some of the President's own appointees, the facts are uncontested. The President abused his power for his own personal political benefit. There's some contesting. At the expense of our national security, our resulting military aid, and crucial Oval Office meeting in exchange for an announcement of investigation. What does this say? She's a thousand years old and Disney dealt with. It doesn't have the vocal track of the animatronics around. That's right. It shows me the American people heard testimony. The number of voices the hardest thing to get. Well, illuminated without a doubt that the President's actions are a profound violation of the public trust. The President's actions have seriously violated the Constitution. She sounds like a school. And let me tell you another thing. When he says and acts upon the belief, Article 2 says I can do whatever I want. No. What is wrong doing strikes at the very heart of our Constitution, a separation of powers, three co-equal branches, each is check and balance on the other, a republic, if we can keep that Benjamin Franklin. Our democracy is specific. The President leads to no choice but to act. Because he is trying to corrupt, once again, the election for his own benefit. The President has engaged in abuse of power, undermining our national security and jeopardizing the integrity of our elections. His actions are in defiance of the vision of our Founders and the oath of office that he takes to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Sadly, with confidence and humility, with allegiance to our Founders and a heartful of love for America. Today, I am asking our Chairman to proceed with articles of impeachment. Oh my gosh, this is a shock. I can make a decision to our members with a somber approach. A somber? Which the President had not made necessary. Unbelievable. Insigning the Declaration of Independence, the Founders invoked a firm reliance on divine problems. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I'm careful. And we will proceed and we're the oath of office to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. Oh my gosh. And defense. Hey, stop. I don't go ahead. Take it. I can't. I can't take it. But go ahead and keep her up. Oh, she's done. Oh, she's done. She goes. That was one of the worst speeches I've ever heard in my entire life. I, I just, awful. I just about went blind. I just about hysterical blindness. Did she do this to troll people? All she ever talks about in public is the Constitution and God. And then none of her actions reflect either of those things. None, ever, ever. I mean, think about this. This is coming from a party who believes the Constitution is an outdated, antiquated document that barely has anything to do with today. You think the founders couldn't see Donald Trump? I didn't see Donald Trump five years ago. How could the founders see it? Yet this esteemed old dusty document somehow or another still sees him. Huh? Wow. It's like, it's like it really does work except you're, you're saying you want a somber, a somber and, and stoic process here. That's bad. It's been anything but this yesterday was an absolute joke. A joke. A joke. And not to mention, I mean, this is like the equivalent of a NFL head coach calling a press conference two days before the Super Bowl and saying we intend to play in the Super Bowl. It's like, well, we already know you won the championship game. You're all here. You're practicing. We know you're going ahead with the impeachment. This is not a shock. You did not need a press conference to tell us you were going to try to impeach the president of the United States. You told us in 2017, except it's not like that because they didn't win the championship. This is like Colin Kaepernick coming out and saying I'm going to be the quarterback in the on the winning Super Bowl team. If he was the owner of the team, the point is that this is an obvious thing that we all knew was going on and they have complete. This is crazy. This is crazy. We all knew that he that they were going to impeach. We pretty much knew the second they got control of the house. And honestly, it's been their goal since day one. So here's the only thing that that that keeps me sane today, honestly, is drugs. I have been thinking about whiskey an awful lot. I got to say it's great. I mean, I have to tell you, it really works. I have been I see people now with a glass of whiskey and I miss it terribly. And you know what? It's consistent and it's always there for you. Yeah, it's clear as well. Now, some would say God would be a better thing to do, but whiskey is easier. It's easier and quite frankly, as the time where I'm getting ready to pay my tithing, it's cheaper. I could lose my job and it's still cheaper. Anyway, oh my gosh, the only thing that keeps me sane is the fact that I just don't believe the American people and I mean Democrats think this is fair either. I really don't know. I'm not talking about the Democrats who are the die hard, you know, at any cost, you know, because there are those Trump supporters who are like at any cost. He could go out and shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue with some Trump supporters and they would be like, so, so he had a right to do it. No, not really. Not really. So I'm not talking about those people. I'm talking about the I would hope 60%. I would actually hope 80 or 90, but I think it's about 60% of the nation that can honestly say this is just not this is not right. This isn't fair. This isn't right. Well, it's and it seems particularly. Unconvincing, right? I mean, I think you look back at the way this is rolled out. You have to think their plan from the beginning of this was go through the Mueller thing, get the results, find all the stuff that was obvious that they colluded or whatever we can paint to the people that there's collusion between Trump and Russia. Then we go through impeachment after that long process. Well, they just cataclysmic failure when it came to the Mueller report. Right. They got nothing out of it. No one believed it was impeachable. It was nothing. So then they're like, well, if we wait past a week after hearing about this phone call, he's going to wind up. We're going to be in the election. We have to get this done this year. How are we going to do that? Just go for it. This is like almost like a substitute for what they thought they were going to get. This is a jam down. Anything, whatever it takes, if it means silencing people, if it means, you know, just ramrodding this through, there's there is no semblance of fairness here at all. Look at the people they had speak yesterday. Look at their record. They are. I'm going to talk about them tonight at five o'clock. By the way, it's an audience show tonight. I haven't done an audience show in a long time. It's all about impeachment with your questions. You can still tweet your questions at what is it? Is it at the blaze? At the blaze? At the blaze and hashtag ask Glenn. But I'm going to be answering your questions with a live audience tonight. I'm going to be exposing who these people were that testified yesterday. What's your name that gets your gates came after? Listen to this exchange from yesterday with Matt Gates and the Supreme Legal Scholar who, of course, is very, very neutral. Listen to this exchange. We don't have it yet. Okay. All right. We're having a we're having a problem today with technical difficulties. So technical is played by. Stored boy. It was Pamela Carlin. And you know, they well, she's a Stanford law professor. She's a she's clerk for Supreme Court Justice Blackburn. She's she's great. Well, yeah, there's some other things that she has done that are she is a self described. Bisexual I think she said bisexual bitch, didn't she just self or describe herself as that at one, but not yesterday. She has she and some of the others that were testifying yesterday are part of the resistance movement. They've been calling they've been openly calling for impeachment. One of them openly called for impeachment before he was sworn in that this is who they have. This is not fair. You know who the Republicans picked a guy who doesn't like Donald Trump. Yeah, I think that's a really good illustration of why the American people see this is such a ridiculously partisan process. You know, there are plenty. But the question of Palatano on Fox News Channel is saying he would vote for impeachment. They could bring Judge Napolitano out there and he would argue that that he should be impeached. There are libertarians and some on the right conservative wise that are critical of what the president did and how he did it and that it isn't impeachable offense. You can't find one of them who's going to have a little credibility with them with someone in the middle. And the reason they don't do that is because it's got nothing to do with trying to win people over. It's a it's just a partisan issue. They're jamming it through. They can tell all their AOC activists that they got the impeachment done and then they can move on to their election and if they're to impeachment over the president, they're saying that I mean impeaching a president is overturning an election. Now you're doing that with eight months before a presidential election. You are using the power of your office and the power of the Constitution to unfairly convict someone and overturn an election. There is nothing more serious than that. And how dare you say that no one is against no one is above the law. If we use these standards, Obama would have been impeached in his first year. If you use these standards, no one is above the law. Hillary Clinton, email servers. How about just the selling of all of our uranium? What about that one thing that's being investigated here? Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and all the stuff that went on in Ukraine. Unbelievable. Look, you know, it's just it's obviously just a tactic. And it doesn't even seem like they're attempting to convince people that this is a realistic case. And I have to tell you, I have a theory on this. It is a theory, but it is based on fact all the way around it. Now, is this what's happening? I don't know, but it's a theory and I think it's a damn good one. Okay, so Stu, if you've been watching our specials, which I think you've I mean, you're the executive producer. You've watched about half of them. I mean, half the high. You've been in the room. You're rounding up. Yeah, you've been in the room. Okay. Yes, I've watched. So as as we've laid out, what is the Soros plan along with the State Department to overthrow countries, citizens to two civil society, two point, two point, right? What is and how does it work? Do you remember? Well, I mean, I could give you a mediocre recounting of that, but you happen to be the host of the special. Okay. So I don't know what you would just say. Okay. So so here's what it is. What they what civil society, two point, oh, which is part of the State Department's policy. And it is now ingrained and an institutionalized in our State Department is we look for countries that we can overthrow. We can go over and train people to be revolutionaries and we teach them how to use social media. And then after we've taught them and put them through this course, all of this is documented. Once we put them through this course, then we say, wait for it, wait for it, wait for it. And when there's an event like there was in the Ukraine, that's when the State Department notifies all those people now and supports them. By the way, we have pictures of all of this. We have videos of all of this and documents about all of this in Ukraine. Then once they get the once they destabilize the government and flip the government, then they insist the Americans are here just to help. And we start an anti corruption league. That's what we did. We had an anti corruption bureau. It was run by our Justice Department, the George Soros people and their Justice Department. And it is a it's a it's a institution that picks and chooses based on politics who they want to prosecute and who they want to call guilty and corrupt and who they don't. Okay. This institution in Ukraine was completely corrupt. The guy was sentenced to prison that was running it for interfering with our election. Okay. That's how that's how I need on tape. That's yeah, that's how corrupt the anti corruption bureau was that we were the co-sponsor of. So what they have to have is they have to have revolutionaries. They have to have training for those revolutionaries. Would you say that's been happening here in the United States? I think the left is training revolutionaries. Sure. Absolutely. The best of the Glenn Beck program. Hey, it's Glenn and you're listening to the Glenn Beck program. If you like what you're hearing on this show, make sure you check out Pat Gray Unleashed. It's available wherever you download your favorite podcasts. Pat Gray, welcome to the program. How are you? I am great. I just fresh from seeing the crypt keepers press conference. What half an hour ago. She was great. Give me a pack of camels. Great man. Talking about the bedrock of our democracy. Right. How important the founding fathers are to her. Yes. It's really moved. All of those on the left. Man, you know, what has happened in our civilization these last few years has gotten so crazy that the left, you know, this atmosphere they've created on the left is so toxic that not even the left can exist in it. I think now. First today we had this story about well, we've got a bunch of stories. You like some water? Well, yes. I have a tray. This happened in Hillary in her. How are it starting to go? I think I have the same yesterday. Yes, it is. Hillary does. It's amazing because you burn the cup. Yeah, burn the cup. Anyway, go ahead. Okay, so the trans people were being honored in Olympia, Washington. And did you see this story? Do you read about anything? No. Paper today. The trans people were being honored and they were doing I think they were doing the city hall and trans colors and the, you know, the rainbow stuff. And so they invited the police into the building so that they'd be protected during their celebration. And trans people weren't very happy about that. Here's what a couple of them had to say. And you are telling me you're going to light up city hall to honor black and brown trans women. You're going to light up a city hall that has police and police are a part of the problem. Yeah, they're killing dirt. They kill my families. What? Wait, why? They make it unsafe to live. I'm a tranny suffering in the conditions you create for us to not live in this city. I want to say that I am a person that values hearing out people's pain and talking to their hearts. And I feel like the people here at city hall, they don't do that. People's hearts. You create illusions. Point of order. I'm going to ask that you refrain. This is broadcast live out in people's homes with families. So I get families. My point is like, you didn't care what I just said, which proves my point. You're not listening. Okay. So there's that. That's enough on the kick. Okay. So they're telling this very liberal city council that they're they're taking exception that the police are even in the building because the police are killing trans people. I have missed those stories. I have missed those stories too. But that's exactly what you would expect from you, Pat. I believe really we did this story a couple of weeks ago and that the total amount of murders of straight people against trans people was like four. Yeah. It was like no, it really was over like multiple years. Yeah. And all those were police officers. No, none of them. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. And now it's all or maybe all with the exception of one, were men who went to prostitutes. Yeah. Believe they are going for one gender. Got the other one. Yeah. And the other one, I think, was a friend or a, or a family member, I think might have been. I mean, it's this is this is a lie for hate crimes. There's nothing here. There's nothing here. There's nothing here. But again, it's the left turning on the left because of the atmosphere they've created. No, one can exist. talking about how upset he was. This is Al Green yelling at other Democrats for the people they called yesterday. Listen to this. Mr. Speaker, and still I rise with my mnemonic notes in hand. Mr. Speaker, I rise because I love my country, but I also rise today with heartfelt regrets. It hurts my heart, Mr. Speaker, to see the Judiciary Committee hearing experts on the topic of impeachment, one of the seminal issues of this Congress and the problem is hearing experts, Mr. Speaker, and not one person of color among the experts. You could have gone to Thomas. So again, there's no pleasing the left because no matter who they bring before the it's not diverse enough for him because if you had a black person on the panel, where's the Asian? And if you have a black and an Asian, where's the Native American? And if you have the Native American, where's the Hispanic? And if you have this where is the undocumented dreamer, that's right. Now also, Pete Buttigieg is getting flack from the left. I love this one. This is awesome. Look at his heinous crime. I've got a I've got a photo of it so far. Oh my gosh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't even want to look at that. He is standing in front of some sort of store with a red apron ringing a bell apparently trying to I mean, you want to talk about a dog whistle. Here is his his homophobic support of a homophobic organization called the Salvation Army. Yeah. Now, let's do the math here on Pete Buttigieg's homophobia. He's literally married to a man like of all the activities on God's green earth. That seems like a pretty like the whole thing to do. Yeah, like the least homophobic thing on the planet is to marry a man if you're a man. Yeah. I feel like it's like the really making a statement. Right. The the the most pro homosexual act you can do is have homosexual sex. Okay, really? There's that's the most pro act you can do read that though. I mean, he had science. Fox news. Yeah. So here's this guy. Who what he he's married and having homosexual sex. We still he hates that he hates himself for that. What I mean, that makes no sense. I mean, it's very similar right to saying Clarence Thomas doesn't like black people, right? Which they do say. However, Buttigieg actually agrees with them on the issues. And they're still saying you can never be woke enough. Never. No, you will never get there. It's a road that does not have an end. You will never be open. It does. Train tracks usually kind of end right there. That's kind of my point. I mean, I've got another one of Chris Pratt and you'll see the heinous crime he committed the other day is a serial. We also have the photo of that. Look at I mean, there he is with his bulging muscles and whatnot in the one in some kind of gym, but he's holding get this. Oh, I hesitate to even say it. No, no, don't. I mean, well, you have to we're on radio, but people can see he's holding your plastic water bottle. Single serve single use single use. Mm hmm. Like recycled afterwards. So his friend Jason Momoa rightly, of course, called him out for that. His friend his friend. His friend. Yes, called him out. And then and then he just got a crap storm of tweets coming down on him for it. But Jason Momoa in the past has committed the same egregious. Oh my gosh. Look at that. There's Jason Momoa. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, he's actually he's got three of them in front of him. Oh, I just want to point out though. I think he's blind. He didn't know that I seriously I've seen this new documentary that he's in called see he's completely blind in it. Oh my gosh. Wow. So I didn't know that. Oh, well, then he didn't know it was a question. No idea. No idea. No idea. I mean, if we don't stand up against this insanity and stopping so afraid of the names we're going to be called or it's really I don't think it's I don't think it's us anymore. I don't think it's us. Yeah, I really think it's the Democrats. The average person that you know, considers themselves a Democrat. If you don't wake up, yeah, and stand up against it, you're going to be you're going to be scooped up just as fast as as we will be. This is going to collapse on its own weight. There's there's no way you can abide by the new rules that they have set forward for us. And there's no great a minute. There's no actual human being that believes drinking out of a water bottle is evil. They're like those people that can't be right. It is a statement of virtue because you believe everyone else thinks, no, I don't think that's entirely true. I do. I don't think I don't think so. Again, like, you know, Hannah, I know Hannah and she and she and she will actually act on these things and she goes she brings it. She drives me nuts. I use I ask when we go shopping together, she'll bring her little, you know, I don't know, hemp bag to the grocery store. And I respect her for doing that. I ask for double plastic bags when I make up for it to make up for it. But she lives that she doesn't when she goes to restaurants, she'll bring her own, you know, her own. Does she drink out of single use water bottles, the last. Nope. Nope. Nope. Doesn't like it. But she's not preaching about it. She's not. She's not saying to everybody else, you gotta do this because she's not doing that. She just believes she's not done a crusader. Right. We just use too many things that we don't need to reuse. Yeah. No, I mean, it's it's it's crazy. I mean, I just it's just a it's a bizarre thing. I just quickly the number one Chris Pratt agreed with the criticism and apologize for using this. If I remember correctly, somebody threw me a plastic bottle and then the photo shoot and I didn't know what to do with my hand. So I never know what to do with my hands, but you're right. My bad. I don't want to let it's covered in plastic. Here that kids reduce, reuse recycle. Chris Pratt. My gosh. And somebody just tossed it to him and he just held it. Yeah. And he didn't know what to do with his hands. That's why what do I do with it? You need it right now under every Christmas tree. You go to the what is it? Blaze shop. Dot com. What is the shop? Yeah, shop. plane that will redirect you to the new site. Okay. Yeah, where it is. So anyway, whatever. Just go to our store and get the shut up t-shirt. Okay. That's what everyone his next one. He should be holding a water bottle in both and holding or and wearing a shut up t-shirt. This is the best of the Glenn Beck program. Hey, it's Glenn.

So I'm going to introduce you to a young Hispanic conservative Air Force veteran who is she's a believer in the things that we were founded on. And she for some reason wants to go to Congress. And she's running for the seat currently held by Charlie Christ, which would be a shame if he lost. Anna Paulina Luna. Welcome to the program. Hey, Glenn. Thanks for having me on. You're welcome. So we met a few weeks ago. You happen to be here in the building. And I had just stumbled across you and somebody else, some other show in the building had invited you on. And my show was my show was over. So I invited you to come on. So I want to find out a little bit about you, a little bit more about you. You are you seem to be all on the right track. You're pro God pro life. You don't hate America. Tell me about tell me about some of the policies that you think Charlie Chris has wrong that you would not be voting the same way. I mean, first and foremost, the guy says that he cares about veterans of which I am. And then he went and voted against, you know, us getting healthcare and in favor, intern favored illegal immigrants getting healthcare. And I think that a lot of what I talk on a lot of the policies that I am so passionate about is because of my life experience. Not to mention he's absolutely pushing the red flag laws. And again, going back to kind of how I grew up. I did not have a normal upbringing. And I realized that now, and it was really the military that I'd say, you know, helped me change my life around. But I had a very early on kind of interesting experience with firearms. And whether it was me being involved in an armed robbery walking into one when I was nine to having a cousin that was murdered to eventually being at a high school where there was gang violence and resulted on a shooting between gangs on campus, I am in no way, shape or form ever going to say that it is firearms and us taking away the right of the Second Amendment from the American people that is going to fix some of these issues when you have people constantly pushing to remove God from society and replace it with government. That's where the problem is. And so if you want to start fixing the problem, let's start bringing back the morality back to the United States back to the American people. So I mean, what he's done is essentially voted in favor of himself, not the people. He's been a Democrat and independent Republican. He's currently a Democrat. And it's time for him to go time to get people in Congress who care who want to fix the issues and who can reach across the aisle to fix some of these very horrific things that are taking place in our country, not really buying the whole impeachment nonsense that they're really pushing it. It's wrong. And I'm tired of it. So you are the Hispanic initiative chairwoman for Prager University, which is a great endorsement just there. You have over 400,000 followers online. What is where did you come from? When did you decide to do this? So I had actually been on track to go to medical school. And this is about, I'd say a year and some change ago. I got into a medical program. I had completely gotten out of the military so that I could do that. And I actually got a phone call from Charlie Kirk over at Turning Point USA. And at the time I had been in contact with Tyler Boyer, who's their COO. And they basically had offered me the position to be their national outreach director for Hispanic engagement. And I honestly didn't know at the time if that was really what was in the cards for me and really, I guess, on God's plan. And when that happened, I kind of realized I was like, this is going to be, you know, pretty much a story out of the Bible. If I go to medical school, something crazy is going to happen. It's going to be like Jonah and the whale. Big whale is going to come swallow me up and bring me back so that I can help do this. Now kind of catching on why I really politically started speaking out was I had obviously my experience with the Second Amendment, but I started working closely with an organization called Veterans for Child Rescue. And they basically handled counter trafficking at the US-Mexico border of children. And at that point in time, I didn't know that that was even an issue. And honestly, it is. And after I was doing the digging that I was doing, and I found out about the horrific numbers of children that are trafficked, I knew that I had to say something. You know, the whole reason I wanted to become a doctor was that so I could help people. And I realized that by me saying silent, especially as a Hispanic woman, that not only was I failing myself, but I was failing these innocent people. It doesn't matter if, you know, who you are, liberal, Democrat, Republican, conservative, these are innocent children. This is something that we should all be working to stop. And it only can be done when proper measures are taken for border security. So I really started using my platform and turning points been kind enough to work with me on a documentary to get this information out there. So that'll hopefully be out here pretty soon. Well, I'd like to help you with that as well. It is the numbers are astonishing, astonishing. And people don't even know. They have no idea. Nobody in Congress is really talking about this, especially on the Democratic compassionate side. It is, it is the most compassionate thing we can do is to stop people coming from coming over the border who we don't know who they are. Or if those are even their children, we are, we are actually in many ways helping these child craft traffickers now with the stupid rules that have been put in on the border. But I digress. If I could just interject and for those listening, this is not a joke. I've gone down there, talked to Border Patrol agents. And, you know, you literally the staff will say about a third of the children that are coming over are not biologically related to these quote unquote parent or family units and that they are essentially renting these children so that they can gain access and exploit our asylum laws. But aside from that, this Border Patrol officer told me of a story where he came across a family, he or not family, but a group of women and a group of men that had been separated and they were actually being forced to carry marijuana packages over the border. And so obviously they intercepted them and what ended up happening was they found that when they were, you know, processing them in, one of the women was crying and she basically couldn't be calmed down and asked her what happened and she said, you know, where's my child? Where's my child? And what they had done, what the cartels had did is they separated the men from the women and the women from the children and promised them if they successfully brought the loads over the border that they would reunite them with their children. And to this day, art doesn't know what happened to those kids. And it's scary. You know, one of those things that it's not like a drug work can be used once. People think trafficking is this really clean thing. It's not this is literally the sodomy, the rape, the torture, literally sometimes even the killing of very innocent people. And it doesn't matter who you are. If we don't do it the correct way, people don't come here the correct way. They're going to be exploited and people are heard on both sides. So Anna, I used to ask people, you know, how their soul was. But I don't know if I don't, I don't know if people really understand what they're walking into and the danger that you are in when you go to Congress. I've I've had friends who have have become everything that they said they weren't going to become. It's a toxic atmosphere. Are you prepared for that? I am and I can say that this is kind of funny, but right out the gates, I had someone like Matt Gates come out and endorse me. And I've never been the type of person to be bought at one of my campaign slogans is built, not bought. And I say that because everything that I've experienced in life, the reason I speak out is because I know firsthand what that's like. I literally grew up in the welfare system. And I've been very selective about even taking certain money from certain lobbyists. I am a grassroots candidate. I've been to date leveraging my social media to raise all of these small dollar donations nationally. And if all goes as planned, I'll be making the young gun list, which is the NRCC's list of, you know, top competing candidates for district. And obviously, I need help raising that money. So if you can donate, please do. You can donate at www.voteonapolina.com. But I am who I am. And I always feel that I'm answering to hire calling. And I'm not anticipating on being a career politician. I'm going to do what I think is right, what needs to be done. And then I'm going to leave and I'm going to tip my hat and let the next person take over. How competitive do you think you could be against Charlie Chris? I think and I, you know, there are some great people running in this race. But when it comes to being able to actually go toe to toe with him and call him out on some of the identity politics that he's going to be using, I will be able to absolutely flip the seat. Not to mention, I have a very, again, unique background. And in part, what I also am passionate about is I've been working with an organization called Force Blue that does coral refresh duration off the coast of Florida. My husband's a scientific diver with that organization. And, you know, I do have this aspect of, you know, being quote, unquote, a green conservative that I'm bringing to the table. And, you know, every step of the way, again, I've been built for this. So I am probably the only contender for this race. And I do anticipate on flipping the seat. So you are and I don't mean this as an insult, you know, because you're the mirror opposite. But you are kind of the AOC for the, for the right. If you if you were to win, when you say you're a green conservative, does that mean that you're for government green deals cap and trade, all of that stuff? No, I'm in fact, and I'm not even for a carbon tax. I think that it's been really interesting because I do obviously have some extensive background being that I'm a biology major. And you know, I'm kind of a science nerd and not aspect. But you know, one of the biggest arguments for that is the United States is not even the number one polluter in the world. Okay, it's places like China, India, a lot of these Asian countries that we're sending are manufacturing to. So why on earth if you really wanted to fix the problem, would you then, in turn, basically tax the American family, the American people an insane amount of money in order to fix a problem that we can't even control. That's not even us that's contributing that. Why would we not in turn try to encourage these businesses to bring their manufacturing back to the United States? So we know that they're not contributing to this global pollution. And then in addition to that, if these countries want to trade with us, well, then let's write some policy into our trade negotiations with these countries. It's a no escape and form our responsibility to change our whale's life to literally stop eating meat and to stop using planes and automobiles in order to facilitate these countries that have, you know, even according to the climate accord that we pulled out of, thank God, you know, places like China are developing cold, cold manufacturing, cold plants, what once a week. And yet we're all excited on the evil people. That's not what the scope and objective of this is. And in the United States, we actually, in my opinion, have one of the cleanest environments for that reason. So I'm for clean environment, but limited government. And I think that that's the best way that you want to handle those types of situations. All right, what is your web address if people want to find out more information or donate? You can find me at www.vote on our that's a NNA and then Paulina P A U L I N A dot com. Anna Paulina, thank you very much. God bless. Good luck. You bet. Should say Anna. Anna Paulina. How are you? Stu? I'm wonderful. You're not coming with me this weekend. This all like are you? I am not. No, that's not personal choice. Personal. Wait a minute. What? Players decision. Hold it did not play players decision. Really? Great to go. I would love to. Things going on. Book a seat for you. Wait, do you have other things going on? This is the week that Taco Bell is having a sale. They have those in Salt Lake City. Not the one you really don't think is out there. Well, all right. It's going to be a great show. We've been you've done Christmas shows before. And I think a lot of people in the audience haven't seen you do that kind of show before. Yeah, been a long time. It's been a long time. And it's fun. That was the first time I actually realized you had some talent. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you to do this. Yeah. No, it was I heard the show a lot of times. Right. And senior to the show. I never really noticed anything of value. This is the one thing that I do that Stu was really bummed when we said, okay, no more of those. Oh, yeah. It was like, no, that's my favorite thing. It is really cool. It's a fun show. It brings you into the into the Christmas season. It's really, really funny. And it's a I'm it's a can't mess unless, of course, you're me and there's a Taco Bell sale near your house. So there's some scattered seats. You know, the the seats that are available. I think there's a few seats up towards the top. You know, and the deal of that is, yes, you might get a nosebleed, but probably not. But I can guarantee you're not going to get hit with any of the flop sweat, which is huge benefit, huge, huge benefit. I mean, if you're in the front, people are paying all this money for these great seats and then, you know, there's you get flop sweat. You got to bring, like the Gallagher to like guard yourself. So I don't even know what to I don't even know what to wear because you're a Santa suit. You wear your Santa suit doesn't fit me. Okay, too big already shut up. All right. So I don't even know what to wear because, you know, I get hot. But if I if I wear like a sweater, then, you know, it's like the Jim Gaffigan thing. Untucking your shirt. It is the last gasp of the fat man. Right. Because I am Moo Moo. I am right. The next thing is I just give up. I just give up and just start wearing a Moo Moo. Just I I could see that. I mean, you have the when you untuck the shirt, who knows? Is it just falling straight down and not and clearing your stomach by six inches or is it one inch? You can't quite tell when you're that's why it's yeah, you still kind of can see that there's something underneath that the wind hurts you. So no wind in this theater. If you wanted to find tickets, you can just go Glenbeck.com there very few left. But if you'd like to grab a seat, I'd love to see you there. It's Saturday. Glenbeck.com slash Christmas. You're listening to the best of the Glenbeck program. I want to bring in Kevin Ryan. He is a writer for Glenbeck.com and also my program and the blaze. And he is he is a different dude, man. He is just so much fun. And we we send you out to things where you just don't fit. You know, you just don't fit. I mean, you don't fit really anywhere. No, you know, my whole life. I mean, you work for me and you wear Birkenstocks. Oh, yeah. So, I love Birkenstocks. Yeah. You look like a guy who would. I hear that constantly. And I love every single David, by the way. Yeah. Yeah. It's amazing. Yeah. So anyway, so we sent you out to cover a couple of things. And we haven't spent any time this week on Kamala Harris dropping out. You have a story that comes out. Is it today? Glenbeck.com? It's out. Yeah. It's up now. And you have kind of the behind the scenes because you saw her how many times? I believe 15 times. 15 times. A lot more than you should have been required to do. That's part of your job. Absolutely. But you were you went to to follow these candidates to learn something about them. So what is the article about and what do you take away from her failure? My first, okay. So what I did when I first saw her was I was like, this, there's something captivating about her. It's terrifying. She scares me. Yeah. And she just once that she wanted that job so badly. Yeah. That I thought no one could ever stop her. So I wrote five articles about her. And it's like, here we are two months later. And it's like, well, those other three articles are never going to come out. But it taught me something about politics. Yeah. Because you guys are so clued into politics. And it's kind of a new game for me. Yeah. And it's just been fascinating. And Harris, Harris was the one, Mike, because my dad was with me in Iowa. And he said what really freaked him out was that she always has this like tear waiting in her eye to drop. And it's just ready. Yeah. And she can just and she would just could play all these different characters. Yeah. And she did them very well. I really admired her. I didn't think I was going to admire at all. But I just you admired her for her abilities. Ability. Terrefying ability. Wow. Because I think there's a there's a I think in a sense where you look at Kamala Harris and you say see someone who seems to have ability as a politician and is relatively convincing at times. But there's something I think, you know, like when you look at a robot and the robot looks human, but not called the uncanny valley. The uncanny valley. Yes. And you it just feels weird. Like you're you sense that it's not authentic. I feel like that's what it was like with with Kamala Harris as we learned more about her. I mean, you know, if she had, you know, we when you first see her, we talked about this at the very beginning. When you first see her, you're like, she there's something charming about her. There's something real about her that seems like she's like seems like she's likeable. But then the more she's around, you're like, no, it's the uncanny valley. And then all of a sudden you kind of hit the bottom of that valley and you're like, I think she's a fraud. I don't think she's real. Well, where she is, the name of the article to uncanny valley. That's good. I mean, that sums up her kind of essence. Like that there is there in in person, it's like that. Because I also wrote an article about seeing her at this Baptist church. And there's nobody there. There's no media. It was a rainy day. It was a miserable day. And she her sister got up and sang. And Kamala gave this like heart-rending gospel-driven sermon. And I had tears in my eyes. But when she walked off, I was like, that is a good politician. Yeah, yeah. I didn't I didn't come away with like, that is a real great person. Right. And we should know, not a good enough politician. Clearly. People sense it in some way. Well, I think that's why I think that's why Bernie connects with so many people is because that's not a that's not a good politician. Yeah. You know, he's just he's a mess. He's Trump. Trump is kind of a Trump is the same way. He's not he's not what you think of as a politician, but people connect with him because they feel it's authentic. Right. Same thing with Bernie. I mean, Bernie lies a lot. He gets a lot of points for being authentic. He tells a lot of falsehoods. Yeah, he does. But he doesn't. But he doesn't. But he believes him. Right. Right. Yeah. And I think Trump is the same way. I think Trump believes 99% of the stuff that you're like, wait, what? I think he believes that stuff. You know, Bernie is the same way. Bernie is just authentic in his in his look, you know, in the way he dresses. You know, you have to give him credit for being really outspoken enough to say he's at least leaning towards socialism, you know, during the Cold War. Yeah. You know, he's less authentic now because he just won't make that final step in like, yeah, I'm for communism. Absolutely. I don't know. He'll only say he's not for socialism. Yeah. So misleading. Yeah. So misleading. With Kamala, I think too, one of the things we talked about, we were comparing the fields one day about 2000 from 2016 to the Republicans. And I said, she she is Marco Rubio, right? Like the on the paper vibe of Rubio and Hairus was like, this is a good formula to win this race, right? And never, even though they might give some good speeches and have good moments and debates or whatever, never was really able to connect with the with the voting public. And you know, I don't know, you made that point Glenn years ago that after Obama, the last thing we'd be looking for is someone who was packaged packaged and like, you know, every line felt perfectly focused group tested and Rubio did a lot of that and Hairus did a lot of that. You know, Harris though, Harris became, I think, a better in the end, where she was just like lobbying like, yeah, she didn't. Hey, I and Ollie, your children, if that's what it will take to vote for me. What about banning all Republicans from Twitter? Yeah, you guys are weird. It's weird. Okay, so another story that you that you have is on Joel Olstein. We did not have a chance to talk to you. It's been so crazy. I mean, it's hard to keep up with the news. Yeah, you were with Joel's Dean and Kanye a couple of weeks ago. Tell me about that experience. Glenn, it was insane. It was just, I mean, just like setting up the scene is is unbelievable. Joel Olstein hanging out with Kanye West at this church surrounded by media at this mega church and performing with gospel choir. I mean, a year ago, he was a very different Kanye. Yeah, very publicly, a very different Kanye. Yeah, I really, I really wish you could have come. I would have loved to. I would have loved to have been there. We'll go to the next one. Okay, so who, who did you feel he was? Kanye? Yeah. He felt, I feel like his only mode is genuine. And that's what people have a problem with. They think he's being disingenuous. I don't think he, I think there's no off switch. And what does that mean? He can't, he's all or nothing. Whatever he thinks the truth is at that moment, that is what he's saying. George Bush doesn't care about black people. Donald Trump is the, you know, the greatest guy in the world. Whatever it is, he doesn't have the, he doesn't have that filter to stop himself and try to rethink. Maybe I shouldn't be saying this for sure. And, and this is what I struggle with. I don't know if he just doesn't care or if it's just, he feels an imperative to bring it out. And I know there's like, there's some mental illness there. And he's, there's probably some pills. I don't know. What, what does that mean? What, what do you mean? There was bipolar? Um, that's on the record? That he's okay. Yeah. He was hospitalized at YMCA. Whatever, whatever, when they're put in involuntarily, when someone's admitted involuntarily, he was admitted to YMCA, um, mental health facilities and pretty soon. Isn't that, I mean, does that sound like a mental health facility that any of us want to go? What is the dream? You got to get into the pool. Just get into the pool. You'll place him volleyball. Yeah. He's a volleyball and everything will be good. When was that? That was maybe like nine months ago, a year ago. And when he was in at the facility, he was drawing churches and talking about, um, forming a church in Calabasas where he lives. And, um, it sort of turned into this gospel choir that was like kind of quiet at first. And he's just been building from that. And, um, it's funny of all the outrageous things that Kanye's done. I think I, I rank, uh, the Joel Osteen church as like pretty high up there. Why? Why is that? It was just so unexpected. And he's, but he's, he's very Joel Osteen. I mean, I like Joel. He's a friend of mine, but he's very Joel Osteen. Joel Osteen is a, he's a gateway drug, you know, he's, he's getting the people who are not going to church, who are trying to, you know, uh, find some God in their life, but they want, they want the success that goes along with it, along with the happiness and everything else. And Joel preaches this, you know, uh, the gospel, uh, and it's very mechanical, uh, but the gospel of prosperity. And that's what, I mean, you know, even, I think it was that weekend, he said I was down, I don't even know, 50 million dollars. And I just got that back from the IRS. Who has that? Who has that? I love that comparison. And I, I hadn't thought of it, but it's so true. And it's, there's also this idea of like a, a public wide misconception about who the person is that I think applies to both men, and which I have to admit, I was kind of guilty going into this, the service that I had an idea of Jolo Steen that is sort of like, it was preformed because of what other people told me. And then when I met him and when I was in the service, I found myself tearing up and thinking, like, how could this be bad? Like, I can't see any reason why I'm helping people and getting them motivated and helping them sort out at whatever addictions they have or anything. How is that bad? No, I, you know, I know Joel fairly well. And, you know, his father was a real old school preacher. And he didn't have any intention of going in and preaching at all. And when his father died, it kind of came down to him and he wasn't thinking about it. And he had this big kind of transformation in his life, but he doesn't preach it the way his father would have. He, he looks for the things that are tangible today. And he knows he's a gateway to, you know, other deeper spiritual meanings. And I think he gets a bad name because I think there's a lot of people that are in the religious business that don't like the fact that he does that. And I don't think there's any problem. I mean, just help people start on a road anywhere. Just start on a good road. And are you concerned at all that, you know, what percentage of your job includes crying? Because you've told us multiple times you've cheered up. It's the Birkenstocks. Yeah. As soon as I take those off, I'm like, yeah, let's handle the world. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think so. I don't think so. You are a you're a mad genius. You really are. You're a mad genius. More maybe perhaps more mad. Definitely. But I love working with you, Kevin. Thank you so much. It's a real joy.
