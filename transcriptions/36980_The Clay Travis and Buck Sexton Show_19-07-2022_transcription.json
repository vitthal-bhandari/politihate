Welcome in Tuesday edition Clay Travis Buck Sexton Show. We hope all of you are having fantastic days where we may be across this great country or this great world, this great land. We have got a lot to hit you with as we always do. Our buddy Alex Barrington is going to be with us in the third hour of the program. Only guests but you guys always enjoy the data and news that he brings. I suspect that that will be a very interesting conversation as COVID insanity is beginning in many different blue states and blue cities all over again. But in addition to that, we're also going to talk about Jose Alba, the bodega owner. His murder charges have been dropped. We will talk about Kamala Harris discussing that abortion requiring women to have babies is the equivalent of slavery. And Joe Biden may declare an emergency climate declaration today because he is floundering. And in particular, he's floundering in ways that even the left wing in this country can no longer defend him from the poll came out today from the Trafalgar group. They have Donald Trump with a five point lead over Joe Biden. That is the biggest lead that Donald Trump has ever had in any poll over Joe Biden that I have ever seen in the history of polling between those two men. And it's not just that CNN came out with a poll yesterday evening. It has Joe Biden's approval rating at 38% and his disapproval rating at 61%, which is frankly unheard of. That is worse than Donald Trump was at this time in his presidency. And yesterday on CNN, they were at a loss to even explain how bad of an outlook that provides for Joe Biden. Here is CNN discussing a new low in polling for Joe Biden. Numbers show that many Americans share a somber outlook on the state of our nation. Let's bring in CNN political director David Italian to help us break it all down. David, what's the mood of the United States right now? Yeah, somber is a good word, Jake Sauer, totally disappointed, disgruntled. Any of those words gets at how bad Americans sort of perceive the state of things right now. How well are things going in the country today? Only 21% say things are going well. I want to put that in some historical context for you. 21% is the low point. This goes back, in fact, off this chart, Jake, you have to go back to 2009 to find a time when the American electorate was dissatisfied with the way things were going in the country. Buck, it ain't good. And even CNN now is sitting around. I mean, when you talk about getting to over 60% disapproval, that's hard to do. And in order to get out of that hole, you have to get people to change their minds. And it's hard to get people to change their minds once they've made them up. You're seeing regime media with CNN leading the way on this, recognizing now we're going to be in August here really soon that they have to psychologically prepare the emotionally fragile audiences that they've been trying to tell Biden's doing a great job. They've been trying to tell them that for the last 18 months or so. Now it's starting to turn more into Biden's doing the best he can. But it's probably going to be a rough midterm, guys. You can start to see it's seeping in there. And it's even more clear because of what we keep talking about, which is the media, palace coup of sorts that could be underway here where they decide that they're going to turn public opinion from within the Democrat party against a second Biden run. So I think the machinery is all working in the way that you would expect. They cannot. They cannot turn around overall perception at this point because of the economy. And even if the economy wasn't this bad crime, the border, there are a range of issues that I think would be a huge drag on Democrats going into this election cycle. But they're having to, you know, they're having to psychologically prepare them. You know, it's like, you know, you've been a coach. I've been a coach when you're going up against the like city or the state champion and you love your guys and you want them to do their best. But you're like, this might be a tough one guys. Just so you know, we're going to do our best though. That's pretty much where Democrats are going into this, this election. And you know, it's getting bad for Joe Biden. Buck early in Joe Biden's tenure. Do you remember when the defense for why comedians weren't making fun of him was it was almost impossible to find anything to make fun of him about? Do you remember that was literally their defense? Nothing funny about Mr. Magoo. It's not like there's a whole cartoon about him. And so they said, Oh, we can't. I mean, he's just, he's just so so impressive. There's just not very much to make fun of. Well, the gloves are off as Joe Biden's approval ratings have tanked. If there's one thing that comedians are loyal to, it's whatever the audience says that they respond to in a positive way, they're going to do more and more of that. Even Jimmy Fallon, who I think it's fair to say is the least political of the late night show host. He said he talked about Fauci retiring and listen to this joke. Meanwhile, I read that Dr. Fauci said that he plans retired by the end of President Biden's term. And then everyone turned to Biden, like, is there anything you'd like to announce to? All right. So you're, I mean, buck, that joke. I mean, you heard people laughing. The fact that Biden should step down is now a comedic punch line. And a lot of people kind of uncomfortably laughing there. That's a Jimmy Fallon joke that certainly would not have happened in the first year of the Biden presidency. It is remarkable as well to see that they're all turning almost in unison, right? Oh, yes. It says, though, there was a memo that went out to the regime media, which include the late night quote comedy shows. Jimmy Fallon seems to make the most authentic effort at being funny, as opposed to just, I mean, Stephen Colbert should be on MSN. His show should be on MSNBC. Yes. Right. It should just be a straight. It should be right after. I don't even know who's on who replaced Matt. That's a great question. I don't know who's on MSNBC anymore. That's not good for MSNBC. We can't even name her replacement. I know they do have a Republican or to form a Republican or to because that's something that always amuses lives to have fake Republicans, trashing Republicans for a paycheck. But I think that the problem the Democrats face right now, I spoke to a friend of mine recently who is a left wing Democrat about this. And we're going through who are the who options. They got when you really start thinking, I mean, you go down the list and I even looked at who was running in the Democrat primary, which really doesn't feel like it was long ago, right? I mean, this is all coming on pretty quickly. You think about who were the top candidates. Biden's problem is he's too old. Okay. And there's other problems too. But that's the one that's just inescapable. It's obvious, you know, water is wet. Biden is too old. Okay. You can't have Bernie then folks. All right. It's not going to be too old too. Right. He's too old, obviously. So that's that's just not going to work. Why why make that change? Elizabeth Warren is borderline. I think she's too old to old, right? She's maybe a three or four years during the Biden, but also to all then remember, you could say, Oh, well, what about Trump talking about Democrats replacing an incumbent? Okay, forget about what Republicans are going to do. And then you look down the rest of the list. Obviously, Kamala would be the obvious choice. And she will run. So she will throw her hat into the ring if Biden steps out, but nobody's enamored of Kamala. I mean, I know last night on Tucker show, he put out there the two big blue state governors who actually won elections. So that gets rid of Hochl, right? Because Hochl was just there. Hochl is just somebody they're like, uh, we need a governor because the last Democrat governor Cuomo was grabbing too many people. And so now you have Pritzker in Illinois and, uh, and Newsom in California, who's the most formidable candidate that the Democrats could put forward to take over for Biden at this point? I think you have to agree that it's probably Gavin Newsom, which sounds crazy. But who else? Yeah, I think it's Gavin Newsom. And I think you're right. Uh, Mayor Pete, people won't talk about it, but the gay thing, no support from black guys. The black guys are not voting for a gay white guy to be president of the United States. And it's like Democrats won't acknowledge it. But you just look at mayor Pete. First of all, his resume is not very impressive. But when you actually look at his appeal to minority voters, no one voted for him. Who was a minority white people, woke white people, love mayor Pete, because he reminds them of themselves. I mean, honestly, uh, but he has, he has no chance. I think I think it's Newsom. I look, I think Cory, Cory Booker may want to get involved. Not very like, look, I'm not like on the Cory Booker campaign here, buddy. I'm just saying they're going to have to come up with something. I think it's Newsom. I think Newsom would end up being the nominee. And, and the thing about Newsom is I question his ability to analyze anything on a political nature because of that stupid ad that he ran in Florida that was so tone deaf against Ron DeSantis over July 4th. But here's the thing. He would, he would be a disaster. You and I both have to deal with this, right? There's, there are blue checks on Twitter that come after you who have hundreds of thousands of followers and maybe you'll take a swing back. And then there are the blue checks that have 300 followers and you're like, you know, or, you know, 3000 and you're like, yeah, I don't really, I don't really care. Newsom, I think, was punching up. And everyone saw that, right? Meaning that by trying to attach himself to DeSantis, who is the leader of Republican governors right now, I know Trump is still the de facto head of the Republican party for, for a majority of Republicans today. But if you're talking about governors, it's clearly DeSantis is DeSantis in the lead on the governor side of things. Newsom wants to be considered that among Democrats, right? He's from the biggest state in the country, the biggest blue state, slash state in the country. So for him, I think it's an elevation to even put him in the same ring, so to speak, as, as DeSantis. The problem though for Newsom, I think, I mean, becomes one, the policies of California in the outflow, which is obvious. And then also, how does Gavin Newsom play in Georgia, in Pennsylvania, in Michigan, in Wisconsin? I don't think he plays very well. I don't think he does either. I think he would get trounced. But I think he's the best option that they have. I don't that they would select. The best option that they have is actually the guy that they hate. Joe Manchin. Joe Manchin would actually play well in the red states. You know, he's going to win the blue states just because he's a Democrat. He has zero percent chance. He would give them what they want in offices for them. That's why they, you know what I mean? So for them, that's a lose lose. But Gavin Newsom would have to pick because we know that all the Democrats care about his cosmetic diversity now. Like he'd have to pick a minority female running. You think he goes with Stacey Abrams as his running mate? That's my first thought. I lose is she loses in Georgia. Now if she won, she would run. She's going to be the nominee. Excuse me, sir. She's going to be in her second term as the fake governor of Georgia. She was down seven points in the most recent poll. I don't think it's going to be particularly close in the governor's race. I think the Senate race between Herschel Walker and Warnock is going to end up being close. I think I think Herschel Walker is going to end up finding a way to win because Georgia Republicans are so fired up. But I think Stacey Abrams is going to lose the funniest one to me. Buck is the Beto Stacey Abrams ticket. Neither one of them can win anything in their home states, but they all raise a hundred million dollars or so from New York and California people. Beto plus Abrams, the losing ticket of all time. I could see that look at Biden. The lesson of Joe Biden is you can be a clownish loser in presidential elections. Biden, I was invited just to as a spectator to a cocktail event in DC when I was the CIA. And I just went, I think, you know, someone brought me as a date or something. I don't remember now. It was Biden, Kousinich and someone else whose name I can't even remember. He was at that level running in 2008. He was at the Kousinich level of like 1% support. So the lesson of Bidenism is if you just stick around long enough and you don't care about anything other than being there, maybe you can win. Remember Biden got blew up in 2008 because he said Barack Obama was the first black candidate who was, I think, clean and articulate. I mean, that was Biden in 2008 and his entire presidential campaign imploded. The only reason he had any viability at all was because Obama decided to make him his VP. The best in quotes moment that Kamala had in the last election cycle was crashing Joe Biden as an old white racist on stage in front of the whole country. That was the only moment anybody. And that was when she was like, I'm obviously a top tier candidate. Well, but so much, it turned out. But nonetheless, we're going to stay on all this friends because, man, we are heading into a fascinating, fascinating political cycle here. You know, we formed strong attachments to brands and it's understandable why people hesitate to try something new, especially when it involves something as important as your cell phone service. This definitely is the case with Verizon, AT&T and T mobile. There's an assumption that those big companies are better because, you know, they're bigger, right? But what's also bigger is the bill you get every month. What if I told you that instead of spending nearly $100 a month to your current provider, you can get all the same stuff for just $30 a month with PureTalk? I didn't believe it until I made the switch. PureTalk cell phone service is just as good as the big companies with great data and internet access and the same clear quality conversations. It makes sense because they use the exact same towers and the same network as one of those big names out there that you already know. So don't overpay anymore. Why? You want to give some huge corporation more money? Join me, switch to PureTalk. If you do it now, you'll get a month free. Grab your cell phone and dial pound, 250 and say, clay and buck. That's dial right now from your phone, dial pound, 250, say, clay and buck, sign up and you'll get a month free. PureTalk is simply smarter.

But President's approval rating is now hovering somewhere between long COVID and Uveldi Police Department. And making matters worse for him is a runaway inflation, especially when it comes to gas prices. The prices of gas are so high that these days driving is the entire date. You know, it's just like he really spoiled me last night. We drove all the way from my house to the end of the block. He's so romantic. But here's the thing, here's the thing. Until gas prices improve, neither will Joe Biden's approval rating. There you have more comedians or a comedian among many making jokes about this Biden administration. Welcome, acts at clay and buck on buckies clay. And what we're seeing is that the regime media is no longer circling the wagons they have in the past. And and there's this one part of it. You know, there's all this. Oh, man, things are going so badly in the country right now. Things are so rough out there. Ha ha. Let's make some jokes about it. Yeah, we told all of them that this was going to happen. We said Joe Biden doesn't understand business, the economy. All he understands is how to keep getting elected in the state of Delaware as a Democrat and how to make jobs happen for Hunter. And now we're supposed to just say, Oh, who could have seen this coming? Everyone listening to this clay saw it coming. I saw it coming. I'll be honest. I didn't think it would be this bad. I agree with that. Same with me. I mean, it's hard. You know, every decision that you make as president is a difficult one, right? Because it is true that if it makes it to your desk, it was something just like the Supreme Court. It was something that couldn't have been resolved by everybody below. But it's like Biden flipped a coin and he called the wrong side every single time, which is virtually impossible to do. You watch a sporting event. Most of the time, two good teams end up being relatively competitive. Biden is like the guy who's getting blitzed 52 to three. You know, he made the Super Bowl and then every decision that he's made since he got to the Super Bowl has been wrong. And it is kind of remarkable to see how incompetent he has been, even with low expectations, he has come in beneath them. It's stunning. I mean, in a sense, got to give him credit. He keeps setting new records just in the wrong direction, just for things you don't want to set records for. So there's that it is a it is a memorable presidency. The Biden presidency memorable in all the ways you don't want to be. During uncertain economic times, my friends, like the ones we're in right now, it's sometimes hard to determine what do you do with your money? I mean, the stock market is so tricky.

Listen here to the head of the San Diego School District as she makes the argument for why it is necessary. This is Sharon Whitehurst pain on what should happen for people who don't want to mask when they return to school. In San Diego remember right now it's only for summer school but what should kids do or parents do if they don't want their kids wearing masks? Parents who don't want to wear a mask indoors in school are there any other options for them? For the fall there are some options they can go to our school that's online. They can opt not to return to the regular school but to go to the school where they don't have to go to school at all other than via Zoom. And that's the easiest way for folks to know. What if they were already enrolled in the summer school and now they get this mask mandate and they're not comfortable with wearing a mask? They really should wear the mask. If they're not comfortable what should they do? They should just let make it known that they don't feel comfortable and at that point just not return. They ran the experiment with Zoom school and Zoom school is not school. It does not work for kids particularly for kids who do not have well off and more educated parents right particularly for children who need more assistance from the school system in person. This idea that you better mask up or else your kids aren't even welcome in school is cruel. These people are monsters who are saying this stuff. I know they think they're the good guys but they're actually not. This was just from this morning on the Daily Mail which is I think on a global level the most red news site in the world. I think the Daily Mail it's certainly high on the list. Maybe it's top five. The astonishing data that may prove masks don't work as COVID cases in Singapore and New Zealand overtake Australia despite super strict mandates. The quote is they don't matter yet again. We are running in real time another experiment where Australia has relaxed mask mandates because they realize after a while. COVID just ripping through everything. What are we even doing? Singapore is one of the strictest places in the world for laws period and also has super high compliance with the laws among the population. And their cases per capita are outstripping those in Australia. How does one place with super strict masking have more COVID clay than another place just next door with no masking? Well, and this is why it's disappointing the decision that's being made right now in San Diego because we know in Southern California in particular LA County and Orange County which have had very different masking requirements have had virtually identical rates of COVID as you would expect when there's not some massive wall dividing one county from another. These are arbitrary lines very often that you wouldn't even know what county you're in if you're driving on the 405, for instance, in the Southern California sprawl. And Buck, what she said is so chilling because it's what so many kids are doing. I saw the data from New York City. I bet you did too. On the number of kids they just lost that just are not coming to school anymore. When you first of all, if you're in summer school, let's be honest, you're listening to us right now and you went to summer school. For a large majority of you that went, it wasn't because you were stellar students. It was because you were having to make up for something that happened in the prior school year. That's why most kids go to summer school. Okay. I'm not talking about advanced, you know, governor schools or school camps or whatever. I'm talking about going to summer school so you can advance the next grade telling those kids, Hey, if you don't want to a mask, just don't come. You're effectively telling many of those kids, Buck, Sayonara, we don't need you in school. It's the exact opposite of what you would want an educator to be telling people in this country. And the New York City school system is losing 30,000. They're projected 30 projecting 30,000 students this fall. Yeah, they've already lost far more than that in the in the previous year of over a hundred thousand, I think, prior that have been lost, right? I mean, it's crazy. It's a it's a big it's a big number, but I think of all of the school. Remember, people are masking in schools. That also doesn't mean that they're necessarily masking in grocery stores, restaurants, bars, play group areas, whatever, right? When it comes to the kids and Spain, just because of, you know, just because of Spain set up the country of Spain accidentally and in essence set up a perfect school masking experiment. This is this is the best one I think you could find because it's the entire it was nationwide. Six and up you had to mask in school as kids. Five and below you did not have to mask in school for the entire school year. Does anyone want to guess what the numbers and the research research showed for the four million school age children in Spain? No, damn difference. None. Curve goes up. Curve goes down. Four year olds get it. Six year olds get it. No difference whatsoever. They don't even try. No, even ask Fauci try to explain this. He would say, oh, you know, the data and he would do the usual razzle dazzle of bull crap. But we ran a huge experiment. I mean, in a country with better metrics and much closer data watching than we have. And it does nothing. And I got an ask, Phil, and I got the blue hair commies coming after me like an angry mob online. Well, Buck, you remember right after we started this show? I went and spoke at my local school board. I got two kids in public school, like right here in my hometown. And when I said that you didn't need to wear a mask and it made no difference, you would have thought to the left wing blue checkmark brigade that I had just come out and said, like, Hey, the sun, you know, doesn't rise in the east and set in the west. It was like, how dare you even argue against masks? And then we have perfect data here. Williamson County, where I live, the Franklin Brentwood area versus Davidson County, which is Nashville, where I grew up. Absolutely the same rates of COVID for kids. Nashville is required masks forever. Just south of town. They did not exact same rate to COVID. I mean, they refuse, but they so easily could. It's important that we know this. Masks hurt children developmentally. Yeah. Masks, I think, create psychological problems for people. I also think you could tie this into the rise in criminality that we have. Everybody is walking around without their faces being seen or shown on cameras everywhere all the time. I think this is horrible for society. I've always thought it was horrible. I have never changed my tune on that. I have hated this. When Trump was president, I hated masking when Biden's president, I hated masking. They could set up an experiment in New York City or Los Angeles. Take a hundred schools here, a hundred schools there, one with masks, one without, but they won't do that because they have to dangerous for our children. They know what's going to happen. Even though the chance of any of them dying from COVID is one in a million. Yeah. They know what's going to happen. And they know that when that data came out, that it would be significant because everybody would finally say you've been lying to us for years. And my concern on top of this, I'm flying again this weekend. I flew this past weekend. Buck, there were a lot more people I saw in the hospital in the airports wearing masks than I did the previous time that I was flying. I fly a lot and I can see it uptick. And I know that the Biden administration wants to bring it back. I know they do. And I knew five minutes. I asked him to get a chance. I was there young people 30 something years old and 95 masks on the treadmill. Oh, I mean, you have to be way more likely to pass out while wearing a mask like that and breathing heavily on a treadmill. You'll never convince me otherwise or kids on the basketball court or running track for God's sakes.

We've got a lot to talk to you about including the situation of crime in New York City here in a few moments. A big announcement today from the district attorney's office with regard to that Jose Alba case, the Bodega worker here in New York City or as Dr. Jill Biden calls it the Bogadah if you recall because she's like totally down with the Bogadah's. But Clay also, I don't know if the audience knows this has a side hustle as a world class analyst of Twitter stock. He gives me the running analysis on stocks up, stocks up, you know, $5 today Buck. I think so he's falling very closely, which is on my mind right now because there just came down. The breaking news here is that a court has fast, ruled to fast track the Twitter v. Musk trial. Now, Clay, other than the fact that I think you could definitely throw on some French cuffs, Gordon Gekko style and be a great broker. Do you ever see Wall Street, by the way? Oh, yeah, of course. One of the one of the best 80s. I think it's top 10 all time 80s movies. I even put it in my top 10. Michael Douglas's best role ever. Yes, I think so Gordon Gekko, which is funny because Oliver Stone talked later about how he made the movie with Gekko as the villain. And then everybody wanted to go work on Wall Street and be like Gordon Gekko, which was so you know, greed is good apparently. Here's the part of the Twitter saga. Oh, another thing about Elon Musk is that a guy just sent me this thing where you have a Elon just at the beach. He's just trying to hang out. He's got like nine kids or something, right? He's got a little bit of a dead bod. I got a little dead body. You know, he got some deadbods out there. No big deal. Apparently you better you better take some take some HGH and spend a few months at the gym and do a little tatting before you let it even take a photo of you. Elon's getting crushed right now for his dad bod situation, which I think is unfair. The man is a genius. They also have pictures out of Alec Baldwin. I mean, we're to the point now where if you're fairly famous and you go to the beach, somebody's getting a photo of you topless. And so, and so I was looking at the Elon Musk. Elon Musk would look a lot better if he were tan. He might be the palest human on the planet. I'm not sure that Elon Musk has been shirtless outdoors based on this photo in 15 years. I know he's a billionaire, but he might have to spend a million on sunscreen because this is the ripest for a sunburn pale ghostly figure that I have seen in a long time. So here, but here's the thing about the Twitter situation that I, you and I both find really interesting. And Elon Musk announced that he was, and the closest thing that we have to a digital town square is Twitter, meaning it's the only place where psycho libs don't follow me on Facebook. Psycho libs don't, you know, don't interact with people on the right except on Twitter, really. There's no more debates on TV. So it is, it is important for political discourse. Elon says he's going to buy Twitter clay and the libs, they freak out. I mean, you're seeing on TikTok, if you're a Biden voter with face tattoos, blue hair and a few too many cats who works at Twitter, you were crying when Elon said he was going to buy it. And now Twitter is suing to make him buy them. And I don't see any of it for the crying TikTok videos anymore. What happened? Yeah, so this is, this is a wild story that there aren't a lot of precedents for. So Twitter for people out there who don't remember, Elon Musk agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share. The stock price went up close to that stock, right? $50 in change. And then it plummeted. And on Friday, I guess it was like 10 days ago, it wasn't even that long ago, Elon Musk came out not this past Friday, right? But the Friday before and said, hey, I'm not going to buy Twitter. And the stock price fell all the way to $32, basically in a half way below the 54 20 that he was going to pay. Well, since then, there's been a steady buying going on. The stock price is now back above $40 during the course of trading today. And there was just a major ruling that came down as we are on air. And I'm reading from the Wall Street Journal, the Delaware judge has agreed that there is going to be an expedited trial in this case. And I'm reading directly, Delaware judge approved a motion to expedite Twitter's lawsuit against Elon Musk. Twitter is trying to force Elon Musk to comply with the terms of this purchase agreement. And they are now going to have a five day October trial that will decide whether Elon Musk has to purchase this company or not. But my prediction, and I tweeted this out almost immediately, is that they're ultimately going to settle for a bit lower price. But now people are betting that Elon Musk is going to be forced to buy Twitter after initially everybody wanted him not to be allowed to buy it. Now they want the courts to force him to buy it. It's pretty wild. He's just going to pay a penalty and a breakup fee. I don't think he's going to end up owning it, which we'll see. We'll see. By the way, the Hunter Biden prosecution clock is ticking there, Mr. Clay Travis. So we've only got all this money in Twitter. So I can afford to take you out for a steak dinner. There we go. These Twitter's on the rise. Folks, crime is a huge issue nationally. The Democrats are weak on it. We know it. A big announcement out of a major case in New York City. Plus, we have the name of the good guy with a gun in Indiana from over the weekend. That's coming up."
