    "text": " Coming up on this episode of the doctor's pharmacy animal wellness is a crucial part of human wellness Right not just when what goes in our mouths, but when we have unwell animal systems the impact on the environment Hey everyone, it's dr. Eiman Supplements are one of those things that I'm always being asked about is it worth spending money on them Do we need them if we really eat well and can your body even absorb them and the answer to most of these questions is it depends There are definitely certain supplements I'd never recommend taking because they aren't made in a way that your body can take advantage of and you just won't be able to use them And there are definitely some supplements we can benefit from because our food supply even if we're eating whole organic foods just doesn't provide enough Of certain nutrients that we need for optimal health. Now, I made you one of those nutrients that I suggest people supplement with is magnesium And see most soils have become depleted in magnesium. So it's a tough mineral to get enough of through diet alone and between 40 to 60% of Americans are deficient or insufficient in magnesium and since it's a crucial mineral for hundreds of reactions in the body and impacts everything from metabolism to sleep Neurologic health energy pain the muscle function lots more. It's really important that we get enough of it Magnesium also plays a role in our stress response and Everyone I know could use a hand in better managing stress to promote their overall health I like to call it the relaxation mineral Now our new favorite magnesium is from a company called by Optimizers their magnesium breakthrough formula contains seven different forms of magnesium all of which have different functions in the body There's truly nothing like it on the market. I really noticed a difference when I started taking it and I've tried lots of different magnesium Products out there. I also love that all their products are soy-free gluten-free lactose-free non-GMO Free of chemicals and fillers and made with all natural ingredients plus they give back to their community for every 10 bottle So they donate one to someone in need Right now you can try by optimizers magnesium breakthrough for 10% off Just go to buy optimizers.com That's B I O P T I M I Z E R S Dot-com And use the code highment 10 and you'll get 10% off this really great formula I think you'll love it as much as I do starting the morning off right has a huge effect on the rest of the day Personally, I love having a super nutrient dense gut healing smoothie for breakfast So I can feel energized focused and balanced all day long I like to use a ton of green leafy veggies healthy fats like avocados nuts and seeds a handful of antioxidants rich berries and then some good gut foods like pre Biotic fibers and collagen peptides now you might have noticed that collagen has gotten a lot of hype lately And I know a lot of nutrition trends come and go without the science to back them up But collagen is one we can all actually get excited about it's great for supporting healthy bones Nails skin and joints and as we get older collagen production slows down So I love using collagen peptides to support connective tissue and my gut health But quality is key My favorite collagen is from primal kitchen because it's grass-fed and it doesn't have any fillers Artificial ingredients dairy wheat or soy I get primal kitchen collagen peptides at an amazing discount through thrive Thrive market members save an average of $32 on every order when compared to other retailers And they have a huge selection of natural and organic and even regenerative foods They make it easy to shop by diet type get frozen bulk grass-fed meats Wild-caught fish or even skincare products and cleaning products ship right to your door all at a huge discount and right now Thrive is offering all doctors pharmacy listeners a great deal You'll get an extra 25% off your first purchase plus a free gift when you become a thrive market member Anytime you spend more than $49 you'll get free carbon neutral shipping Just head over to thrive market calm for slash hymen to use the offer that's thrive market Dot-com forward slash hymen and now let's get back to this week's episode of the doctors pharmacy Welcome to doctors pharmacy I'm dr. Mark hyman and that's pharmacy than F F AR M A C Y a place for conversations that matter and today's conversation is gonna really matter because it's about a conversation between farmers and doctors between What we need to be talking about right now, which is how to regenerate human health and planetary health and that is The conversation today and it's with an extraordinary woman Anya Fernald who is the co-founder and CEO of Belcampo Which is a regenerative ranch up in northern, California at the base of Mount Shasta they have 27,000 acres of organic farmland and they Process also the livestock for sale of its own butcher chops and restaurants, which is very unusual So they've got the whole supply chain Belcampo in a time means beautiful field and it was definitely beautiful up there at the base of Mount Shasta She's for two decades been leading this field of regenerative organic Agriculture focused on meat and leadership within the meat industry. She's been profiled in New York in the New York Times She's been a judge on iron chef and the food networks since 2009 and recognized as one of Inc. Magazine's hundred female founders And 40 under 40 by food and wine. It was named a nifty 50 by the New York Times so she's one of them pioneers in this field of Regenerative agriculture which is often a male-dominated field agriculture in general and you are breaking all norms in many ways And I'm just so happy to have you on the podcast. So welcome. Welcome. I mean, thank you for having me Okay, so let's get into it, you know, I think I think we were just chatting a little bit before the podcast about the importance of having dialogue between farmers and doctors farm ranchers and health care and between Agriculture and health care. Why because you know, it's all about food and as we know food is really driving so much of our global crises today obviously chronic disease it's making COVID worse and You know, I just a little fact which I think is staggering to me To sort of explain why America is leading the pack. We don't want to be number one in COVID and we are number one in deaths number one in cases number one in the growth and spread and You know, there are many reasons for that But one of the key reasons I believe is our poor metabolic health which has to do with our crappy diet and in China there's three deaths per million population in America there's 500 deaths per million population My goodness, right and in China the obesity rate is 2.6 percent in America. It's 42 percent so it's related and your whole work and your effort has really been to link both flavor deliciousness nutritional quality with the health of the animals the health of the planet and the health of humans and it sort of reminds me of a quote from Sir Albert Howard who wrote soil and health which I read 40 plus years ago or he said the health of soil plant animals and he said man, but I would change it to humans is one great subject and I think you have nailed it with your work at Del Campo and Understand those linkages and have created an extraordinary thing and I just like to dive into your background a little bit because you grew up You know in doing all kinds of interesting things and went to work on a dairy farm in Bavaria you lived in Greece and parts of Europe and you saw a different way of raising animals a different way of cooking and In getting in there you you really had a different view of really what we need to be doing in In terms of agriculture and particularly in terms of how we raise animals because Now you actually are running one of the largest meat production companies in the whole region of agriculture space And I refer people to all the time to have eaten your restaurants anomotic guys fantastic Or and and tell us about your story How did you get started because you were like a vegetarian and all of a sudden you're running a regenerative ranch raising animals I Think I was driven by a curiosity around food that was fundamentally motivated by feeling well, right? So we all have kind of like an origin story for our passions in life and for me being a good cook was a way that I helped My family early on my mother really struggled with anxiety and would get overwhelmed easily right? So I remember diving in as a young girl And it was a way that I could just I sort of had this ability to hustle and to figure to think on a lot of different levels And plan out and get a lot of different things done So the initial kind of genesis for me around cooking was absolutely the role that you play in your family unit and I then then you know as I grew older I I love the manuality of it. I love the history of it So I I pursued a real passion for baking took a year off during school and during college It was a baker and that's when I went to Greece and then as soon as I graduated from college My biggest instinct was just to go somewhere and do something with food that wasn't being a chef You know I worked for a hot minute in New York at at the time a very fashionable food magazine called sever And it was like, you know like champagne and caviar and that's like this is in my world You know that's not into and I still to this day really don't like chef culture and chef culture was fundamentally What I think back on it, you know, you have such a great lens on your choices, right? When you look back it's 2020, but it was it was also that there was no concept of wellness And I think that in general the whole kind of chef culture in In America is like this egregiously Flaunting wellness and health and if you look at Europe the chef culture is about much more about now in France There's these famously like super obese gourmons and stuff That's not totally true, but there's a bit more of a balance in the culinary world around wellness And there's less of this like drive towards over-indulgence But in general I sort of turned off by fancy chef culture loved farming and I moved to Europe I got a fellowship at the time. It's kind of a funny story But I'd read about this fellowship in the Smithsonian magazine I'm obviously a big nerd and I loved reading Smithsonian in the high school and so this fellowship was like you could They'll give you like 15 grand to go do whatever you want. That's not academic for a year And I told my parents I was like I'm gonna get this fellowship and and this is my plan for after college And I'm like well not yourself out But it's like very competitive and I didn't have any other plan and I fortunately I landed Because they got it on otherwise, but I got me you know So I moved to Europe with that like 15 18 grand from this fellowship And I and I went there with a carry-on bag and I came back like eight years later years later I started out as a cheesemaker I mean I kind of can visit my parents and stuff back and forth, but you know I I I when I went there I I worked initially I use that that money to support myself I had a folding bicycle. I was I had a huge amount of hoods father I'm like I'm like let me draw that energy forward to myself today But I kind of you know I charged out there. I traveled around by train. I visited over a hundred dairies I worked for longer periods of time in three different dairies and it was a it was an incredibly challenging time I mean, I remember being you know desperately lonely and stressed out and it was in foreign countries and different languages This is a time. I didn't have a cell phone. I didn't have I mean that was before cell phones I was traveling on traveler's checks. There's no ATMs right different sort of world Exactly and I am my folding bicycle So it was it was a really different it was just learning on so many levels And it's actually now when I get young people approach me and say I'm like what do I do? I'm like push yourself in a in a tough situation and figure it out because it'll guide you well in life You know so so much of what I learned about thinking on my feet and just kind of hustling and finding the path forward Was in that time and it was about about facing struggle now I call that out just on the personal development side But what happened to me in terms of my learning was really tight to my health guys so I grew up in the low-fat 90s I graduated college in 98 and I was a competitive athlete and you know it was like snack wells and Entomans fat free brownies is what the girls would like before and we'd have like spaghetti feeds with like no fat spaghetti So I moved from that environment and I've been a vegetarian on and off to I actually had stopping a vegetarian because when I was a competitive rower It was difficult for my body to get the energy that I needed with a vegan diet So I started eating eggs and some meat but I moved to Europe and in dairies initially and and I started eating like Not just a little meat but like a lot of meat and a lot of you know This is a place where I would get up at two in the morning Typically for my dairy jobs and and have some espresso or coffee and and then milk animals until you know about five And they make cheese sell about 11 and then eat probably like 2,000 calories of animal products You know so it was a mix of like introducing intermittent fasting introducing You know all sorts of different patterns and then a very very kind of proto keto diet And then when I was eating bread It was like locally made in small source and I had this really really powerful kind of transformation in my mood Attitude my overall health lots of different things and in that time Also, you know, it's like when you look back It was that my desire to stay there was as much about learning as it was about continuing to feel good Mmm, okay, you connected to food and your health in a way that you hadn't Absolutely, and I wanted to continue to feel that way. I didn't want to go back to America I felt like I had more to learn but I also was like from a health perspective It was like this is this is amazing and I got a job then I got a visa This is very funny and in 2000 I got a visa from Italy for an independent work permit that was based on me being a cheese expert So I had to go to the consulate in New York City and explain to them That's like 22 year old American was a cheese expert That was like because you have to show that you have a job that Italy is very protectionist obviously and and you have a show That you have a skill that nobody in Italy has so I had to go there and do it like a Interview claiming that I was like a cheese I mean I knew a lot about cheese do still know a lot about cheese But that was that was definitely a lucky chance that I got this visa and I was hired then to work in a rural development Project in southern Italy that was basically doing economic redevelopment via helping small-scale cheese producers scale up get exported Build their whole like marketing and packaging and then from there I moved to northern Italy and did a sort of similar set of works But on a little bit of a larger scale with a larger group of producers Via a foundation found funded by the region of Tuscany So I end up having a very kind of professional progression after that year She's making starting from that base knowledge in the how to of actually working in dairies But you you also learn there things that I think were probably subliminal because my guess is the animals that were on those farms were heirloom animals that they were not consuming industrial food products from commodity farms like in America that the the quality of their milk and the nature of what you made from that was quite different I mean we've lost 50% of our livestock species the homogenization of animals and breeds for human consumption is just staggering and Through that process, we've lost a lot of The quality right so what did you learn there about the type of animals and the way to raise animals that resulted in better food and better nutrition so all of that Really was the substance of my life in Sicily So I lived in Sicily for two years and the group that I work with so jealous Well, they made a cheese that was from this breed called the modicana You can google it that produces less milk than sheep does so I mean various like like you're talking like a liter and a half or two liters of milk a day which is infinitesimal, you know a Frasian will produce 18 to 30 gallons in a commercial operation depending on its cycle of life So it's like growing up to feed a baby. Okay, so tiny amount I hear my ass cool like why on earth would anybody keep a commercial dairy cow around with that low low level of production and The answer is that the milk is extremely high in protein But more importantly these cows can live off of like thorns and bark. Okay, so they're extremely robust in Sicily It's over a hundred degrees two or three months of the year and there's no irrigation where we where I was living Right, so it was adaptive to the environment in a way that really Made it very very suitable. It's kind of like an all-terrain vehicle, right? So it could handle periods of drought and famine effectively and just keep on keep on keeping on and you put a freesion there And I think I've I've seen the same thing with the introduction of these freesion operations into Like tropical countries where the US will pump in millions upon millions of dollars in aid to establish large-scale industrial dairies And the animals will just wither in months due to just they can't handle a parasitic load Right in a tropical environment. Yeah, so actually the low yield Bromacross varieties are actually a much better fit for that So you see this again and again where it's like these large kind of luxury high production and high volume animals Aren't suited for all environments is one key piece of things and then you know additionally there there is a different There's a different quality to the actual product. They produce everything slow growing In my experience in the animal world tends to be of it I won't say, you know, I don't have the science to say it's better But it's of a different caliber and you see this in in density the way that's been documented of protein density in a free range Lower growing animals. There's there's a really solid data point. That's pretty well Documented which is that animals that grow slower have higher protein and have a general higher micronutrient density, right? So in all of these these kind of low and slow I think of them animals, you know, it's the Tyson chicken that's coming to full weight of close to three pounds and two and a half weeks For being a chick to a chicken on our farm taking eight to ten weeks to achieve that same market weight, right? So that trade-off and speed is what I saw again and again is that these products made from Local breeds that produce at sort of like shamefully inefficient levels producing great taste quality and then offering farmers much more resilience and flexibility on a small scale so you basically took all these insights from being insistally and Italy and all these different farms and practices you saw and the different animals and Something inspired you to create this 27,000 acre regenerative ranch in northern California How did you get to there from being this young woman with a boating bike in a backpack? Right, well, so keep in mind that in the eight years I worked in Italy the final chunk of it was doing a random microfinance fund for small-scale food businesses So I basically assisted this is around the time of the European Union. I assisted in small-scale food businesses Coming up to speed helping them get in line with the European Union regulations, etc So all of that was really crucial to my kind of understanding of business development Market compliance, you know, all the different aspects of like food safety, etc Now in the time that I when I returned to the US You're learning the art of farming and the business of farming Yeah, and my inclination is more into the business side of it, right? I'm intrigued by the potential to not just do something beautiful but do something powerful Right, so it's one thing I've seen frequently in the in the kind of regenerative and small-scale ag world I desire to create a small perfect microcosm That's available to very few and I think that's why the elitism kind of claims have stopped and been a perennial issue in in the space Right because they are like they're like beautiful gilded small microcosms that actually are not very accessible even though the the majority of the products that we're talking about fundamentally are the food of the poor, right? These are the foods that we Developed in subsistence economies to eat by because we couldn't afford the mainstream products, right? So it's kind of an interesting lens to look at things now I think that it's all been sort of now viewed as it's really really high end So for me the idea of like creating something small and beautiful and perfect is less interesting than creating something larger and transformative With some some nicks and tumbles along the way, right? So I get the scale idea. We're gonna get back to that because it's a very important question This is great. It's wonderful. You can have an heirloom cow. Okay, it'll feed like six You know tech billionaires and Silicon Valley and like who cares? We're gonna get to why it's important and and how to scale it, but Before we do I want to sort of address the elephant in the room Which is the conversation about meat itself? Is it good for you? Is it bad for you? Is it bad for the planet? Is it good for the planet? Is it bad for the animals? Is it okay to eat animals? Because the conversation that's really emerging in many many circles is that we should all become vegan in order to save our health and save the planet and You put up a very different conversation about this How how how do we become to understand that that beef is the enemy and and why why is why is it not? Absolutely. I mean there's a series of cultural conversations that happened And after the industrialization of beef production that shifted the optic and the lens we viewed beef You know the narrative. Well, I'll repeat it the broad brushstrokes the story after the second world war We had a major consolidation of agriculture Many of the ammunition factories were converted to fertilizer factories Which made we had basically a vast infrastructure for the fertilizer factories that were ready to go We started to make fertilizer much much cheaper. We had a bigger industrialization of agriculture At the same time we had a different approach towards food security is what we call today but the government After the second world war and around that time was very concerned about america's autonomy understandably and invested in systems that Ensured that we had enough corn wheat rice soy those key crops and a few others cotton Um sorghum tobacco that we had those in produced in volumes sufficient to feed the american public in the us The confluence of those two things is an overabundance of food crops starting in the 50s that we began to Understandably redivert to beef feed And we developed the world we started producing too much food and so we had to feed it to something else right? And the thing is to mark it's a bunch of rational things that we did right? We are like, okay, we don't want to have another, you know Victory gardens and terrifying end of the world scenario understandable Right. We we have all these huge factories that we need to do something else with understandable like these were all kind of rational economic It was it was good. It was good intentions with bad consequences and longer term consequences You know these were sort of short-term pivots and responses to things I think sometimes and I do agree with some of the broader kind of conspiracy that times around big ag but the way that it's been built up I think was a normal reactant to a bunch of you know social and economic forces And so what we ended up with though is by the 50s we were Realizing we could get fatter beef faster feeding it human food Right and then about 10 years later Um, you know diet for a small planted planet was one of the first books that that hit around this But then about 10 years later people started to say but wait a second This is devastating for the environment, right? Because we're basically producing resource intensive crops that are maladaptive for beef diet, right? Um and are also bad for the planet being produced at the scale Um for this usage and and effectively we created a very unsustainable beef supply system So the way that it happened is that we we pivoted how we produce beef from a natural regenerative traditional system to the modern factory farm, yeah And then we started to understand I'd say the the the response of that was for many people Well, we're going to be vegan Now why wasn't the response? Like food was like oh my god, look what's happening in these factory farms And then of course all the literature came out that meat is bad for you. It's got saturated fat We shouldn't be eating it it causes heart disease, right? Yes. Yes, and I think a lot of the you know, they the conversation around beef and how bad it is a lot of it I agree with directionally Um in that confinement beef is really bad. Yeah, so if you just didn't to clarify what happened is this is this conflating of traditional let's say heirloom regenerably raised animals and the very impact on health and the planet versus feedlot beef and they're impiked on health and the planet and the in fact on the animals in terms of the horrific conditions they're raised in and Yet the conversation about meat doesn't often distinguish those two things And just like and even the health effects is fascinating we've talked about this before on the podcast But you know there's studies that need to be done more on this and we're working on how to do those But in in australia they looked at wild kangaroo meat versus feedlot beef gram per gram of protein When consumed have profoundly different effects on human biology. So the feedlot beef raised all the inflammatory markers the kangaroo meat Lowered inflammation of the body Same amount of protein both meat but profoundly different effects on human health not to mention the effects on planetary health So they it's a dangerous, you know through line to draw at times But you look at the confinement system and feedlot beef It is an Inflammatory system right the way that these animals are fattened up is by giving them a fundamentally inflammatory maladaptive diet Right, which triggers a lot of different Reactions in their bodies and it also is putting them in confinement which creates, you know competition for mates and foods and resources Unsanitary conditions highly stressful. So it's cortisol So, you know there there's sort of two factors maladaptive diet Inflamm that's inflammatory and then a highly inflammatory stressful Context that they're they're living in so those two together now you're the doctor here So I want to leave it to you to understand like what's you know eating meat from an animal that you know effectively is highly inflamed Inflammatory for us that that would make sense to me And I'm always troubled when I see you know people in the culinary community particular posting pictures of like Cobay and wagyu and that's highly fatty meat and I just think you know you wouldn't put a picture up on instagram of a 350 pound Four-year-old and be like look at how cool this is right you say like this is an abomination right like help us help this child And when you're putting that kind of picture up of those stakes is effectively what you're doing is saying like here's a deeply diseased and troubled organism Um and we're we celebrate and fetishize it as opposed to looking at it like what it is Which is inflamed in he doesn't inflamed tissue. Well, it's interesting that the the diet we're feeding the animals That's inflammatory is a high carb diet corn That's the same diet that Americans are eating is a high refined carbohydrate diet that makes us inflamed and sick and more likely to get COVID and many chronic diseases So it's it's actually an interesting peril that you draw and this russ concert says it's not the cow. It's the how Hey everyone, it's dr. Mark It's no surprise that sleep is a huge part of optimizing our health All of us should be focused on getting the best sleep possible If we want to maintain a healthy weight feel energized and stay sharp and that Comes down to several different factors now something we have the most control over in terms of sleep Is our physical environment and the type of light we're exposed to After spending more time at my computer when working on my recent book I noticed my eyes always felt dry and heavy and it wasn't sleeping so good Or as long as I used to the screens were surrounded by all the longer sources of artificial blue And green light that disrupts melatonin production That alters our delicate circadian rhythms and impacts all Our other hormones. It also means it's harder to fall asleep and stay asleep So what did I do about this? Well, one of the easiest and most accessible steps to reduce the harmful effects of artificial light is to wear blue light blocking glasses Blue light glasses I wear are made by blue blocks That's blu blo x because unlike other mass produced brands their glasses are based on peer-reviewed literature and the science of how light impacts health Blue blocks glasses have reduced digital eye strain and improve my sleep and I can't recommend them highly enough Blue blocks makes a variety of high quality blue light glasses to cover different areas of your life They have a clear lens blue light line to combat computer screens and artificial light throughout the day And there's summer glow line to block blue light But adding yellow light for mood boosting effect and their sleep plus line to wear a few hours before bed that blocks 100% of blue and green light for optimal melatonin production and improve sleep Blue blocks has more than 40 stylish frames Available in prescription non-prescription and readers and they even have kids sizes They also have a really good sleep mask and sleep friendly light bulbs Right now blue blocks is offering my listeners 20% off So just go to blue blocks dot com forward slash hymen and use the code hymen 20 That's blu blo x dot com slash hymen with the code hymen 20 Blue blocks also offers free and fast shipping globally Blue blocks is also giving back by working in partnership with restoring vision in their buy one gift one Campaign for each pair of blue blocks glasses purchased they donate a pair of reading glasses to someone in need I really hope you'll check them out. Now. Let's get back to this week's episode of the doctor's pharmacy How does the how that you're doing at belcampo Change the quality of the meat and how is it different for us from a health point of view And how is it impact climate and the environment in a different way than traditional feedlot So how ethically is it different? I mean there's a lot of questions in there because it's ethic issue ethical issues environmental issues and health issues And they all get conflated and it's important to break them out because they're quite different So around the ethical issue. I do need to state the kind of for me the elephant in the room is that an animal Dies to make meat. Okay. So that's a fundamental choice that we have to be comfortable with as humans What i've tried to do is to answer all the questions apart from that one, which I can't have an answer for it, right? But I what I what i've tried to build in our systems Is the same as I think the thinking of many people in the regenerative movement which is to create an evolutionary system for the animals to Grow up it now to to put the question around the high carbs Do I need to to talk about that? There is a little bit of a difference in terms of our inflammatory Response and the beast inflammatory response. I agree that we're both inflamed, but keep in mind that beef are ruminants And so their evolution is for eating large volumes of extremely low calorie high fiber Nutrient poor food, which is forage So there are amazing kind of like they're like the compost pile of the animal They're offcyclers of nutrients that we couldn't eat We're the predators. We went out in the evolutionary battle, right? We got to eat kind of everything We're a monogastric other animals that we eat that our monogastrics are pigs and chickens, right? Monogastric means we have one stomach and we are able to because of that we need and we seek out nutrient dense foods So if you are I were to eat only grass we would be in the hospital in a week, right? It would be extremely difficult for us to extract enough nutrition from something that high fiber Cows on the other hand are suffering when they eat nutrient dense food because they have these five stomachs which become gassy and inflamed Pounded with a lot of grain the question too is like well, all you know Natural grasses would have seed pods on them But I can say from being in the farming industry that it's like one half of one percent when you have a you know a large field of grass And how much these animals are not scraping the seeds off like bears pick blackberries They're eating volumes of grass and there's a little bit of seed at different phases of the life cycle in there Okay, so that's a very different system. So an evolutionary system means that we're trying to create key aspects of how an animal exists in the wild and in the case there's no wild cow but they're bison and there is oxen right and The plant step oxen from russia the original cows and what we do that is to focus on diet breeding and Mothering those are the kind of the key life points for for animal wellness So in the the diet is what we talk about the most I just I just want to stop you for a minute there. You just said something that I don't think anybody talks about animal wellness Animal wellness that's a very new idea that brings into the conversation a different way of thinking about how do you raise animals for their health and for our health and how they're connected So it's very important. Thank you for I think animal wellness is a crucial part of human wellness Right Not just when what goes in our mouths, but when we have unwell animal systems The impact on the environment and that's not even just the like big picture your grandchildren polar bear stuff That's literally if you live two miles from a confinement agriculture farm You have something like double the chance of having a miscarriage or a low birth weight baby Okay, so it's not just like it's also quite near term here and now and wellness issues Okay So in in our systems and and I want to clarify or point out that there's dozens of farms across the us Maybe in the hundreds. I don't really know but like of that. I know of there's dozens that practice this We're not unique in this and there's a lot of options now I to buy regenerative products, but our system the word regenerative is like looking to the long term So thinking many generations out in terms of the health of the soil And that means that we're trying to actively sequester carbon that doesn't exactly relate to the the it's there's not like a regenerative practice specifically around beef But beef are part of a regenerative system In environments like where I am right now in the belcampo farm. We are it's a brittle Grassland environment. That's where we farm. That's where most regenerative farmers. You couldn't grow crops or vegetables there essentially It's not enough water correct. Yeah, so this is an area that 150 years ago is heavily grazed by by elk And deer right there are massive herds of them around here And this is an environment that evolved in concert So the in concert with ruminants right with with these big heavy Hoof foot animals with lots of sumics that could take all of these massive, you know, volume of grasses a little bit of seeds basically mulch them and Poop them out for lack of a better word in a so the seeds seeds are actually passed entire through the digestive track of these animals And then they're deposited on the prairie on the ground packed in its own great fertilizer Right and while the animals is dropping these mature seed pods packed in fertilizer They're also lightly aerating the soil by walking across it with their heavy heavy bodies and sharp pointed Hooves kind of creating a light like tilling effect as well that allows that the next time the rains fall there's indentations where the rain pools creating greater saturation of the water So those that that whole process so they they beef I'd say are in support of a regenerative prairie management system That's the way that people are part of the system. Well, that's a very important point you make because what people don't understand is that If we wanted to say let's just eliminate animals from the planet Eliminate agricultural animals because they're the enemy and there are many people who are saying this it was just just get rid of animal agriculture What you're saying is that it doesn't actually make sense because 40 of our global agricultural lands are not suitable for growing crops They're suitable for grazing animals And if we do it right and there are many ways to do it wrong through overgrazing which destroy the Environment lead to desertification which has happened all over the world, but doing it right like you're doing it You're actually restoring the ecosystem. You're increasing biodiversity. You're building soil carbon You're drawing down carbon out of the environment. You're conserving water in the soil You're actually creating healthier animals which then creates healthier humans. You're creating this virtuous cycle Which which require animals is what you're saying Yes and the the challenge here is that there's a Really broad spread assumption now that white spread assumption that Animal agriculture in and of itself is the problem not the current manifestation of animal agriculture But we've got plenty of examples in history and some good research being done right now That shows that that when you remove as you mentioned ruminants from a traditional prairie system That system collapses and the great example in american history is the dust bowl Yeah, and so there's there's you know and many many stories about this and in documentation of it But I'll I'll give the short version which is that we took we removed the bison from our prairies through massive killoffs We then fenced in those prairies and for the first couple years of farming it was it remains today Unbeaten levels of wheat production that land was so fertile right so fertile Within two years it cratered Crater and it's and then the dust bowl happened and what happened is the top soil which had been built up slowly through generations of animals walking You know dropping manure in seeds, etc aerating etc all of that evaporated and Turn to it's literally called the dust bowl and there was you know You wouldn't see the sun for days because of the amount of dust that had come up through erosion It went all the way to washington dc Which is why the government actually started to create the soil conservation Carbon in soil The reason we want carbon in the soil is that it supports microbial growth in the soil Microbial growth then supports the growth of microrisoms and root systems that says it's a virtuous cycle Then it further sequesters carbon right so carbon is like it's kind of like think about it in in your own body too It's like having a healthy microbiome is the first step to making sure you don't get the flu And then getting the vaccine is like sort of the on the outer levels of what you want to do Right, so there's a there's a lot of similarities to how we look at the human body and whole body Wellness and how we approach agriculture like we have a very consistent systemic approach in america to those two Kind of problems or opportunities, but here at belcampo, you know, we've been surveying the soil since 2013 Yeah, we are carbon positive. So we've actually been actively sequestering so we've got that monitored by a third party So just to your question of like is beef bad and say hey based on me There's many many people that are surveying this and measuring this right now I think we're probably a decade away from the tide really turning on this issue Big by farms like ours showing concerted long-term shifts, but in our farm in seven years We turned the tide we changed the direction. That's a very important point that you know, we actually can sequester or Store carbon that's in the atmosphere into the soil and draw down carbon in a way that can help stop or even reverse climate change And it's a conversation is starting to happen in many circles certainly happening in europe It's in certain conversations that are happening in the government It's not certainly far enough in my opinion, but what people don't realize is that we have the biggest carbon capture technology ever Discovered it's available everywhere on the planet. It's free It's something that is available everywhere and it's called photosynthesis Well, so it's interesting to me too too because people think like carbon sequestration is important because we want carbon now the Government and this way we put it into the ground where it's stored But then that's just the beginning because what happens when the carbon's in the ground is that there's better microbial action There's better micro rhizome growth and then you limit erosion, right? So it's like it's a totally virtuous cycle and then you go in a row of micros, right? And then you're able to sequester even more carbon So it's not just about putting things in the bank It's actually that there's interest on that in the bank You know, there's actually like a really healthy cycle that carbon creates and we we do a very good job With industrial ag at killing the microbiome of the soil So, you know, it's something that's really painful about for me particularly around Glycophate and Roundup right a very very common chemical is that it kills the microbiome of the soil So as you know, it's a broad 70 percent of crops. It's It's everywhere and it kills like inches and inches of of top soil So when you see these like flash floods in the midwest on farming communities and and whole towns are underwater and mudslides and stuff Like that it's like that's because we've completely killed the microbiome of the soil through the use of the most commonly Used agricultural chemical. It doesn't just kill what's above it kills. What's below So that's another like double whammy in terms of carbon sequestration because then you're killing the ability of those plants to sequester carbon Yeah, you know as a doctor it's also important to me because When you put carbon in the soil you build the microbiome of the soil and the microbiome of the soil Is what allows the nutrients to be extracted from the soil to go into the plant That will enter Us and make us healthier, right? So when you look at industrial farming whether it's growing vegetables or animals One the nutrient density is lower in factory farm animals, but the nutrient density is far lower in industrial Produced crops. So when you've got 50 percent less nutrients and minerals in some crops Over the last 50 years just because of the destruction of the soil. So it's it's such an incredibly virtuous cycle It's hard to argue with regenerative agriculture and yet, you know, many people still do I mean we talk about You know the the the sort of fake meats out there that are being promoted like impossible burger And you know I went into Starbucks the other day and I bought a coffee and I saw in the cabinet the impossible burger cheese sandwich You know, I mean with it was like and I was like what and then I was like, you know The people don't realize one it's a it's a highly industrial food product. It's made from 47 novel proteins It's got more glyphosate than you require to kill your own microbiome because it's GMO Glyphosate sprayed soybeans and three it is better than feedlot beef for The climate environment in terms of greenhouse gases, but regeneratively raised beef actually draws down carbon while the Uh, impossible burger will add three and a half kilos of carbon So you literally have to eat one regionally raised burger from belcampo farm to offset an impossible burger's carbon emissions That would be a good marketing play It's actually it's actually validated science through quantus, which is a life cycle analysis company from australia that looked at both Uh both approaches and and it was kind of shocking to me. I thought wow, that's pretty impressive So I think you know the whole it's not the cow. It's the how message is really important to get out there It's it's a message that's so radical in terms of the modern thinking about Protein that ran all protein that it's it's the difficult it's a difficult one You say it people are like, but can I really believe this? This is so different, but you know mark in the past What five years we've seen a radical shift in people's understanding of the role of fat in their diets There's still plenty of holdouts with margarine in their fridge out there, but the tide is is turning So i'm i'm optimistic that good data and good advocacy can make that shift I know and i'm do what I do With integrity because it's the right choice for the planet I also know though that the levels of meat consumption the way we consume meat are not sustainable Right? So i'm not saying this is just sort of a karp wash to continue what we're doing but change the input Right and you know we throw away almost i hear somewhere between 35 and 45 percent of the meat that's produced in america goes into the trash so I think there's a lot of ways that Well, when you have a really cheap product, you're not very conscious i'll trust you know, just me that the number is on like Caviar usage in american restaurants are not nearly as egregious people don't throw away stuff that's expensive um, meats very very cheap and so it's a you know, we feature it heavily in buffets we feature it in you know It's it's a giveaway effectively. We make it we do abundant portions that people don't finish So food waste and in meats egregious and so we we we raise animals in torture. They die in torture It's bad for the environment the way that's produced and then it ends up in the trash can So tell me that you know, we feeding them human grade food the whole way Right there. There's just elements of that that are so broken and and and and wrong So I think that there's you know the the kind of the big piece that we need to talk about is that raising beef the way that I raise It is three to five times more expensive than the conventional method And one of the great privileges of being american is cheap meat, you know, and so we've Talk about is it is it really cheap though? Is it really cheap because when you look at who's paying the cost of a factory farm animal who's paying the cost of the destruction of the soil the Pollution of our waterways through the production of food that goes into rivers, lakes and streams and kills Our fish supplies like 212 000 metric tons in the Gulf of Mexico The loss of pollinators which have dropped 75 percent half of all birds have gone from from america because of our agricultural industrial system the incredible Damage is happening to the climate as a result of destroying the soil and the way we grow food Who's paying those costs? I don't think we're we're actually paying the real cost Of the food what about the antibiotic resistance and the the 700 000 deaths a year from antibiotic resistant organisms Much of which is coming from farms that cost trillions of dollars. Who's paying that cost? It's not the price you pay the checkout counter It's it's what I call socializing the cost meaning we as citizens as countries pay the cost While the corporations who produce those meats actually privatize the profits Yeah, and if you look the way that The locations of the factory firms are increasingly in disinfranchitized areas with high density of people of color You know california passed the proposition which which basically made the worst actors just leave the state and go to places that were less regulated Right and where this citizenship was less active and disenfranchised right? So I mean it's a pretty It's a pretty disproportionate impact on the poor as well in terms of the actual immediate bad effects of me If you look at for example chicken farming, it's primarily new Southeast Asian immigrants and latino immigrants that are in that industry, right? So it's it's proportionally health impacts in terms of who's actually working there Well the farm workers and the food workers, but also the people who live in your buy as you mentioned the amount of Pollution is driving asthma and the chronic illnesses that are really well documented in terms of their impact Well here in california, you know back to the covid thing when you started to see the death rates in the central valley Spike You notice that how just the death rates per thousand were so much higher and in near the agricultural communities because the General you need to like metabolic health indicators are so much worse there I mean there's three times the incidence of asthma in fresno is in oakland, right? I mean an equally polluted california city, but it's the ag right that's driving that asthma level So I mean that you're this is the point though The question for me is I often get the dollars and cents rationale of like i'm a working single mom And I can't you know afford this and I understand that um directionally there's a there is going to need to be I think to implement rigate generator of agriculture I brought our understanding of that of those bigger picture externalized costs But I don't think in the us we have a great track record of understanding the sort of like nuanced bigger picture impact of Of good short-term economic decisions for individuals, right? Um, so I don't have a ton of confidence in people grappling with that bigger picture negativity It seems like what the the decision is is like well Let's just pivot to this highly processed soy based or grain based Industrial ag off put and and just buy into that if I'm going to be activated around this So the pathway to getting consumers to stay with me But demand better meat is going to be a more laborious build I think Um, but that's really you know, that's what I've been leaning into it's like trying to find a demographic That's ready to convert, um or is open to the message and has you know, maybe not massive resources But enough to have a little bit of optionality. Yeah, I mean there there are ways of buying in bulk There are ways of buying at scale. You can buy half a cow you can buy with your neighbors But I just bought half a lamb from the local farmer here and put in my freezer to last a long time and wasn't that expensive compared to you know It's all local How do we how do we scale this because you know as you're as you're talking it's really clear to me And I think it's clear to many people in in high levels of policy around the world that regenerative agriculture is a key solution to so many of our problems Right water problems climate problems food problems And the un said that if we took two million of the five million hectares of degraded land around the world and convert to regenerative agriculture We could stop climate change for 20 years and what cost 300 billion dollars Which is less than we spend on diabetes in this country the government spends and it's is basically 60 days worth of of military spending around the world and compared to the four trillion whatever of dollars we spent on COVID relief. It's just a drop in the bucket and and yet Nobody's really talking about how do we build and scale this because because a lot of the conversation with this is great It's elitist, you know, if you have money you can buy it. It's not really scalable But there's a lot of challenges to that theory and and guys like allen williams have talked about if we took all the degraded land if we took all the The land that's being used to grow corn and soy for animal feed if we or some of it if we took The conservation lands that the government has we could actually scale this up and and that would bring the cost down it would improve Our our entire ecosystems increased biodiversity conserve water Healthy with the droughts and the floods and the fires and the weather instability and climate I mean it's sort of an interesting concept But how real do you think it is that we could actually move this at scale because it's only 1% now of our agricultural system How do we get it to 10 20 50%? I'll tell you from an organizational capacity management. So we built this operation here I started the business with my co-founder in 2012 with 6,000 acres and we've scaled it to close to 30 through the acquisition of three other large ranches And also acquired and built a land for and built a slaughterhouse so in that time what I've learned is that regenerative agriculture is much more reliant on human know-how and Intelligent engagement with data in a in a series of decision-making points so Unlike in a in a feedlot you can have kind of anybody Show up with the bag of feed or a computer and put the feed in the bucket And you buy the feed from one of three consolidated companies and you buy that based on price and proximity in That's sort of your decision tree is like Where's the bucket go right in in regenerative ag? You know i'm looking at our pastures right now and and I can tell a story about every single one of these like did we decide to irrigate ever if so what's the system that we use that's most efficient when we're planting we do no till planting What and how are we planting and where to optimize sunlight and natural water flow? How are we handling hedgerows and biodiversity? How are we handling biodiversity management and then how are we rotating the animals over the years? How are we handling fencing or any type of containment? So these I could just like rattle off but there's like hundreds of these decisions and they're made by highly skilled ranchers right whereas agriculture on the whole has been de-skilled and put into their sort of like a autocratic class and then there's endless workers who don't even need to speak the language of Like of their bosses right literally don't need to even speak The language right there so little need for any real knowledge transfer and there's no skill gain through the work My jobs here at our firm are careers people are learning really sophisticated Information about how land is managed how we increase fertility Using a lot of subtle kind of EQ type skills around animal management. It's really hard You understand every day why people don't do this anymore Yeah, so scaling this the challenge here mark is and this is our scale so bell campo now we are You know by the grace of god growing in covid our restaurants have actually grown year on year and covid I believe due to the wellness message and the wellness Experience that many of our customers have of just real significant um physical and wellness Goals being met through our product all to cypothisize here But we are actually growing in our restaurants. It's very very unusual my category is down 70 percent year on year due to closures where up 15 percent at this point We did close of two of our restaurants that are in enclosed malls, but the remainder the remaining five Those statistics are true on and then the rest of it with our e-commerce growing and our other Channels are growing we've been in a really fortunate position But as we look at scale we're scaling through partner firms and partners capital I mean and if I think about the real bet the real challenges, you know, I've had a significant single investor For eight years. We're now raising capital for the company in the upcoming months Um to to fund really our our e-commerce expansion our direct-to-consumer mail business, but we are you know The privilege of having an individual committed investor Um and the long-term approach to returns is enormously important And then also just the you know as I scale i'm not i've never been an advocate of let Let's just buy 250,000 acres. I mean a where the money come from that's this kind of patient capital But also from a management and logistical perspective becomes untenable Right. These are systems that are better built for medium and small scale operations. I consider bulk tempo medium scale We have a we have a herd of 3,000 beef currently. So we'll be expanding next year About 25 percent of our production will be coming from partner firms that we then certify to meet not just certified humane and organic Which are our base criteria for bell campo, but then also our own regenerative practices So the scale and I bring up my story is is you know relevant to the degree that it reflects an experience of scaling a regenerative agriculture and failing More than i've succeeded in many many ways right and saying okay. I don't really want to do this four times as big I'd rather be a you know A coach on the regenerative practices a certifier and a marketing arm And so that maybe in 10 years our own where i'm sitting this farm right here is maybe 10 or 15 percent of our production and the remainder of it's coming from many partners. I want to call out something to mark that I think I don't know if if consumers are aware of the amount of frustration in the farming community about industrial ag as well I mean you probably are farmers. Exactly. So I mean the the challenges are I mean if you were to start a farming business right now in industrial systems You're basically you sign up to you're buying all your baby animals from somewhere You have to fatten them in a certain season in the livestock industry So you're buying them at market set prices You're buying what you feed them at market set prices and then you sell them at market set prices the commodity prices All three of those commodities none of that's differentiated. Whatever you do doesn't matter. You just need to come in under those commodity prices It's terrible. It's not entrepreneurship. It's it's there's no um there's no like there's no ability to differentiate It's bad for the farmers if those commodities don't line up great You're just out and you're just in the red that year. Yeah, and there's and you have nowhere to go You have no where to go. I mean we saw this in covid right where those Like up a creek all of a sudden and and killing you know Aborting baby pigs and throwing away eggs and stuff So when when you're squeaking you are squeezed in conventional farming and then also what we're seeing in the you know In the case of the crop industry with with glyphosate They're actually you know, they are mandated to buy the chemical from the farm They're mandated by the seeds from that that same company in monsanto And then they also then they can only sell out of the commodity again If those three things on a pricing basis don't align one year Who's paying the price the farmers are and they're taking And that's something that the that the USDA does a ton of it's just basically bridge financing for farmers that are sustaining Losses on behalf of agribusiness. Yeah, you know like the small farmers have become this giant bank That's funding misalignment in the commodity pricing structure. That's right Yeah, I'm just as a break that down for people the farmers are not the bad guys They're caught in a squeeze between the banks who give them money to run their farms Which then goes to the seed chemical Companies and they're stuck in this vicious cycle and have to buy crop insurance for the downside on their farms And they can't get loans unless they have crop insurance and so they're stuck in this vicious cycle Which is a trap and they often make very little or no money And what you're saying is that that farmers are getting sick of this and they're looking for new ways And I've seen you know had uh, Alan Williams and gay brown on the podcast And they they really talked about how as they go around the country more and more traditional farmers are sick and tired of the way things are happening And they're looking for new way and they're coming out in droves to really learn about regender Agriculture and understand how to implement these and they're profitable in the first year Which is interesting because you know When you think you know the the people who are making all the money in the system are not the farmers It's the seed and the chemical companies and the banks And and and not the farmers, but this turns all that upside down and I imagine on your farm You had a private investor maybe for the land, but basically you're not having to buy chemicals You're not having to buy seeds. You're not having to buy any bodies. You're not having to buy hormones You're not having to to sell your products in a commodity fixed price System that you know lowers the price so you can't actually have a profit So it seems like this is a model that's going to regenerate rural communities That's going to reinvigorate farmers that's going to actually increase profits for them And and have all these side benefits just as our traditional farming system has all these negative benefits It's the opposite right better food better for the animals better for humans better for farmers better for climate better for biodiversity better for water resources And the soil it's all a win win win win win And the key thing we've done is to build a direct relationship to the consumer Right, and that's another thing where although with small farms, there are farmers markets Those often require, you know a lot of driving getting up early on the weekend if it's raining you don't sell anything So the problem is there's really no consolidated market where if you have a differentiate product you can sell it into So there's there's there's not really the channel to support any scale on regenerative And i'll be clear too that our farm has to cost a significant investment So although we don't spend on antibiotics and and glyphosate and things we we've had to scale up the herd We've bought you know thousands of one thousands of animals and breeding stock We have seven species that we raise here commercially all the infrastructure around that So it's a significant lift to get an operation like this up and running But I think they the the longer term, you know Challenge for Regenerative as well is that there's very little left in the way of kind of rural small scale Infrastructure to support so if you do get an a farm up and running it's difficult to find slaughter and further processing So making things like beef jerky on a small scale or just getting your animals killed That's what we have done You know we built our own slaughterhouse down the road about 20 minutes from the farm That certified humane and certified by CCOF as organic So having those pieces has made all the difference for us to be able to build actually a brand But the scale issue for regenerative it's a different model than how The agriculture scaled currently and that's a question that I kind of Mews on a little bit right which is that truly regenerative I see it as a patchwork of medium scale operations that scale up in concert Um, but it's it's difficult to there's there's not really like a an easy acquisition pathway for a large You know well resource kind of agribusives to come and inquire a bunch of these So I do think there is an opportunity around investment too to look at you know longer term This is a this is a field that there are billions of dollars There are billions of dollars flowing into regenerative ag from private investments and funds Okay, so I know you're you're we have a new administration You're called by president biden to lead a an initiative to transform agriculture in this country Maybe of the secretary of agriculture. Maybe just advising him like what is what are your top three recommendations or five? Whatever you want to share that would really move the needle and make make us move forward faster to solve these big problems of of human health animal health Planetary health and and really move things forward flattening the subsidy system flattening it so making it Killing it or or making it equitable. I mean making it equally distributed among all types of farmers So instead of having a huge subsidy go to eight crops have a small subsidy go to every crop If we're going to subsidize farming let's subsidize all farming in the us Um, and if we're going to subsidize any type of farming Let's you know, I don't think it's fair to say we're going to massively like eliminate subsidies to large scale farms or corn or wheat or those different things but um, we need to have a flat and subsidy so a subsidy system that isn't differentially favoring crops that are So incentives for a genuine agriculture. Well in other countries, there are simply tax breaks for farmers as a category Hmm Okay, so that's something to consider instead of saying we're going to give an operational subsidy to producers of this one specific crop Um, we could say we're just going to give an operational subsidy in the form of tax relief to all farmers Hmm. That's a big idea. That's a big idea. I mean that to me would say we're going to incentivize food production and interest Of food security, which I agree is a national priority But we're not going to specify that it has to be these specific eight crops that also happen to be pretty unhealthy Yeah, I mean if I if I were if I were king for a day and had Autocratic power. I would essentially put in one rule, which is that any any food produced this country Must have as its requirement that it's high quality and we can define high quality nutrient density Promotes health promotes a healthy environment, you know It's all the things we would say in terms of food and food production But you know quality has to be king and I think if we did that it would make a huge difference I don't see that happening, but you know, you know, for example, if we we we we give school lunches We have quality standards. We can improve those obviously, but first snap. There's no quality standards for Procurement for food and purchasing in the government. There's no standards for what we grow There's no standards that has to produce quality food I mean to produce corn and soy the way we're doing it that gets put into industrial food products That make us sick and fat and cost the government huge amounts of money and Medicare Medicaid and I mean it just It all falls apart when you focus on quality and that's really what del campo is about. It's about producing quality for The earth for humans for the animals in all levels of the system Yeah, I agree with that. It's difficult with the word quality because it's qualitative, right? But I think broadly if I was to look at what could lead to better quality It's you know right now we actively subsidize the worst quality foods, right? And we don't have any Incentivization or any kind of structure rigor around assessing that point that you brought up earlier Which is the bigger picture impact of our choices in agriculture So those are the kind of the two areas that I think are the most most interesting to explore from a policy perspective is like how do we change subsidies to equally not disincentivize the other stuff But maybe equally incentivize all the stuff I would just instead of I's the best stuff. Yeah, I would I would actually I would actually you know Have the costs not be so Externalized. Yeah. Yeah, that's it. I mean looking at ways to bake in those costs is a very interesting idea. I do. I mean it's it's a The system where right now in America, it's cheaper significantly cheaper to chemically grow corn Harvest it mechanically store it Usually in a modified environment Truck it then to a cow and then feed it to it that it is to just let a cow out on a pasture and let it eat till it's full Yeah That's nuts It is this that's the major sticky point for me is like let's make that It should be easier to just let a cow out underground granted if that's organic grass And it's like all the grooved species whatever but like even if it's just regular old grass It's still cheaper to chemically grow corn Mechanically harvest it truck it store it truck it again Store it again and feed it to a cow then it is to just let the cow out into your backyard It's crazy. It really doesn't make sense and that's the fundamental like this economy that we've got and it's and it's doing us A disservice on so many different levels like that's the fundamental issue is that cost basis You know and so it's interesting when I hear all of this kind of like this Vigorous resentment of the beef industry. I'm like you realize this is just all in the service of agribusiness You know, it's a pretty fundamentally like pro agribusiness angle like to just embrace veganism Because that's actually I think you're just supporting the same Aggregating corn base. I mean they're they see the right in the wall too. They're like people are eating less granola bars They're eating less, you know, highly processed cereals There's this vast infrastructure built to make all that garbage So now they're just getting ready to pivot to something that feels better and it's it's vegan protein You know, like that's the thing. It's like the next highly processed plant based garbage that they're going to convince you to eat So I think it's fundamentally an agribusiness backed message to effectively. I think you're right It's own if that's like we're killing one of our they're you're right. That's a very important insight To like push us too because what are we gonna do with that? You know, we've we stopped eating as much, you know as much cheerios And we've stopped feeling good about giving you know like twizzlers just snacks to our kids So there's been some chefs recently. So how are they gonna get us back? You know from this food's kind of migration And and that's got to be that's a lot of people are thinking about that right now And to me they kind of get the composition of those products is too similar to the garbage It is too similar to the garbage to make me think that it's not It's a you know, it's a bait and switch Yeah, so if people want to get more involved in learning about regenerative agriculture or eating it those products Where should they start? So regenerative is a unregulated word, right? Just like grass fed and finishes But starting with a farm that at least claims to be regenerative and doing some research into it is a great place to start Now if you're looking for regenerative from a local farm, it's probably going to be at your farmer's market It's unlikely that any of your grocery stores are going to be stalking it unless it's a really small kind of alternative shop For people that ship nationally, Belcampo, of course is available nationwide There's a few other regenerative operations like white oak pastures is one of them Porter road down in the southeast is an amazing job of sourcing So you can look for those those words Another words you want to see or you could see in place of regenerative is climate positive And if you're not seeing the word regenerative climate positive The three things that would let that would suggest that that's the kind of operation is grass fed and finished right as one claim Organic certified and then some type of certified humane or animal welfare association approved So those three together are pretty much a proxy for the regenerative approach That's great. And if people are you know, interestingly go to belcampo.com they can learn about what you're doing Can they order can they order belcampo meet there? They can do everything there can find out restaurants in california and then we ship Nationwide now a free delivery over a hundred bucks. So it's it's very accessible. It's usually two-day shipping And we're filling out of the east coast now as well. So it's it's speedy and delivered frozen That's something that's really blossom for us in um during covid And it's been amazing for the business. It's just a huge huge Way for us to grow to control margin to manage the customer experience So it's a great way. I mean supporting belcampo that way or any firm with direct purchasing is huge Many people don't realize that when you go into a grocery store and buy There's a couple layers of people taking a percentage, you know It's so it ends up usually being about 60 percent of what's on top of their farmer cost So if you're buying direct, you're basically giving 60 more to the supplier, which is really crucial for operations like ours It's incredible. Yeah, direct, you know, just cutting out the middleman is a great idea And you know, that's what sort of what you're talking about in regenerative agriculture cutting out the middleman Which is all the farming in the corn production the soy production that has to go into feeding animals. You're just like letting me grass, right? Um, and for people want to learn more about regenerative agriculture There's also an incredible report by the rodel institute It's called regenerative agriculture in the soil carbon solution and you can just google it in rodel institute It's really a wonderful detail understanding of how to actually use your general agriculture to solve so many of our problems in terms of Human and planetary health and actually in ways that are good for animals Um, Anya you are incredible inspiration to me and so many people. I think by what you're doing And you've really gone And created something unique remarkable And I encourage everybody to check out about campbo just go to the website is beautiful You'll learn all about it. You can learn more about regenerative agriculture. Uh, watch kiss the ground, which hopefully you've seen Uh, I'm in it, but I'm just a small bit part But it's an incredible movie that talks about regenerative agriculture and I encourage everybody to watch that And uh, and I know thanks so much for being on the dr. s Grazvid me and why it's so important to our health and planetary health Thank you so much for having me Yeah, of course, and if you love this podcast, please share with your friends and family share it on social media Uh, leave a comment.
