    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Welcome in Monday edition Clay Travis Buck Sexton Show. I hope all of you had fantastic weekends, spring has sprung on much of the country. I spent a lot of time out at the Little League ballpark over the weekend and I'm sure that many of you have been running all about getting ready for spring as well and as spring has sprung. Donald Trump down in Texas big rally in Waco. Tens of thousands of people there including I would imagine many of you listening right now a final four is set also down in the great state of Texas in Houston. Congratulations to the four teams that have advanced there. It is going to be a wild conclusion to the college basketball season. The Trump versus DeSantis battle continues to heat up. How are things going in Iowa and New Hampshire? We have early primary polls there. It is however very, very early. People have overwhelmingly abandoned patriotism and religion according to a Wall Street Journal poll and I think it ties in so well with the overall malaise that this country finds itself in where according to that same poll buck 80% of Americans expect for their kids to have a worse standard of living than they do which is near all time highs. And happiness also ratcheted up to record levels under this Joe Biden administration and the lies that are spread and that you are forced to embrace even if you know they are lies are infecting every aspect of our society. The woke virus is spreading like crazy and I want to open with a video tribute that played on ESPN over the weekend in honor of women's history month. I believe we're in the middle of women's history month and this is ostensibly what is airing on a sports network. I stay ostensibly because ESPN has become a far left wing woke universe just like MSNBC just like CNN and so people say how did you go from sports to this? Well sports became so woke that I found myself fighting back against the insanity out there every single day and covid just put it on steroids and now here buck and I are. But I think it's important for you guys out there to recognize how you can be sitting down just wanting to know who won a basketball game. Your kids can be sitting down eating their cereal in the morning just interested in watching their latest athlete and what their endeavors might have been the highlights and this is what they are being subjected to. Leah Thomas who is a man will Thomas was a swimmer at the University of Pennsylvania is now being honored as one of the greatest women's athletes on ESPN as part of a testimonial that they are running on their network. In 2022 slimmer re-atomist became the first transgender athlete to win an NCAA division 1 championship by winning the 523 style. The Texas native competed for three seasons on the men's swim team at the University of Pennsylvania. She began her transition after the sophomore season and after a gap year due to the pandemic that forced the Ivy League to cancel all sports. Thomas Mayver debuted as a member of the women's team in December 2021. The trans is not a choice. I didn't have any other choice because non-transitioning was not leading anywhere. She competed on this criticism from the swimming community, competitors and teammates. She said she called her persistent service a larger purpose. People will say she just transitioned so she would have an advantage and she could win. I transitioned to the happy. Okay. It's not actually even I mean I'm losing my mind over here. Clay's like I'm trying not to shout over. It's not even an issue of and they try to make it this. Lea Thomas transitioning. Whatever one may think of that. This is Lea Thomas transitions and swims against women and beats all of them and destroys their hopes and dreams after many of them have been you know living in a pool practically for the last 15 years or so. Yes. That's the issue. Okay. Notice it's all but I had to transition. No you didn't have to actually compete at that. What's more important to you right to be able to transition or to be able to transition and compete against women. I think it's such an interesting case study here because they're really pushing this hard ESPN clay right. This is crazy the most normal people all across the country and the whole time I'm sitting on social laughing. I'm thinking like we should just do a video like I South Park do a video with macho man Randy Savage wearing a little you know one of those little man bikinis. Be like yeah I'm pulling through the water in the pool. I'm destroying the female competition. Oh yeah. Because it's like the same thing. It really is. And if you're saying well I don't want to get involved which is what a lot of people say or they say oh this is not really that big of a deal. Now your kids are sitting down in front of ESPN and ESPN you hear the background music. It's like the friggin masters is going on right. It's like oh what a triumphant story. No listen to what Riley Gaines said. She's a University of Kentucky women's swimmer. We've had her on the show before. She said and credit to her. Leah Thomas is not a brave courageous woman who earned a national title. She is an arrogant cheat who stole a national title from a hard working deserving woman. The NCAA is responsible. If I was a woman working at ESPN I would walk out your spineless at ESPN hashtag boycott ESPN. And I mean the very essence of sports buck is the best man or best woman wins. The or is important there. The best man or the best woman. A man who identifies as a woman stole a women's NCAA championship. And ESPN just ran that Haggia graphic women's history celebration of Leah Thomas. And this is to me a perfect representation of how the woke virus they try to infect it in everything. You can sit down. You just want to watch sports best man or best woman wins. Women's NCAA final four set. You can be a big women's basketball fan. Caitlin Clarkson incredible athlete. She's a girl right there is an important difference. You'll notice though this is the this is the ebb and flow of how this argument goes how this policy discussion goes is you know they'll they'll start to realize the left will realize that they're they're in retreat. You know they've really been in retreat for example. The more attention that is paid to the drag shows for kids for little kids specifically they're losing and the Democrats are losing on that issue when there's focus on it. And so what do they start to do they say why are you so focused on this. It's not really that big a deal. You're exaggerating it. They do this with so many issues but on the trans issue it's particularly poignant and then they do something like this. ESPN honoring or you know Rachel Levine time magazine of the woman of the year. I mean they they keep pushing it in you know the furthest they can get away with you know when they feel like the public's gonna not be primed for the defense that's been made or for the attacks that have been made against us for a while. And it's just the same thing over and over again there. They are gaslighting everybody. They're saying oh it's not something that really matters that much to us. Why does it matter so much to you. And then the cultural touchstones that they control and where they can operate with impunity right. I mean ESPN is owned by is it owned by her still. Oh so my Disney. Well 80% to be fair 80% Disney 20% herstone. But Disney owns the majority stake. It's basic business property. Fascinating. I mean I actually did the math here on the show back of napkin math once for the head of content at Disney the one who said on video I have a trans child and a pansexual child. Yeah. And it's funny because I remember recently Jordan Peterson was on Rogan and he did on that show. The math I mean the mathematical this stuff is obvious by the way right. I mean this is it's just important for me to think about this. The chance of having both a trans child and a pansexual child separately as one old adult individual you're the only person on planet earth that would have that unless you the adult we're pushing this stuff on your kids and the environment you're putting them in the kinds of things that you're subjecting them to. And so you know we see this top to bottom and it's coming from some of the most powerful I mean you said Disney owns ESPN I mean yep they want Disney to be the one doing this. I hope everyone understands that the plan here is for there to be full on Disney movies like feature films about trans eight year olds within the next five years does anybody doubt that because everything else that we've set up turns out to be the case. And I think that's why this is so particularly pernicious and not just because if you were sitting down and watching MSNBC and they ran that crap or you were watching CNN and they ran that crap okay you might be in the target audience that wants to buy into that that they are selling right this idea that men should decide they want to be women and become women's champions and be honored for that and that it's somehow courageous. But sports fans overwhelmingly reject this and so what ESPN is doing is trying to condition your child your grandchild to believe that this is normal that biology NPR just tried this recently buck you see where NPR said oh there's no evidence that women are not as good as you know that that trans athletes are having more success and I would just say it clearly the will Thomas Lee at Thomas situation a man identifies as a woman and becomes a champion you know what there's no evidence of buck a woman who identifies as a man and wins a male championship or even is able to make a male sports team because biology is real it only goes one direction and destroys women's athletics well you know that they they also pretend to be much worse at statistics and science and logic than they actually are in this case when they're saying oh but they're not really you know wasn't there like a there was a male to female and you know I actually don't they're not female I mean the real fundamental problem here that we come up against it's not just the pronoun usage is that you're not actually a woman it's not it's not reality and we keep running in these circles over and over and say well the transition and we we trip over all this language you know I will I will say you could say trans woman because the trans modifier makes it clear what we're actually talking about which is a biological male who is of the psychological member it is not intersex I always have to point this out to people intersex is the very rare biological condition of having a little bit of both parts yeah that can happen but that is not the basis for the trans movement that in fact even when that does happen usually they at you know at birth whichever child pick one side or the other to identify us and then go ahead and give the hormones of one side or the other to allow that child to grow as either a boy or a girl I'm just sort of flabbergasted clages share something with me here I you should tease this as we go to break because I was gonna give you credit I want to make sure you saw it you have been calling for this for on the show you a long time I am prophetic about how insane the left is and where the left wants to go I always know folks I have never surprised by this I have been saying it is only a matter of time before they will tell you that you are a bigot if you are a heterosexual man who does not want to date a trans woman who has a penis and it's so crazy out there wait wait but we have to we were not just bring this up chat GPT we will have for you when a eye back yeah AI has weighed in on this if you're wondering is a eye being used to try to program you as well as this oh yes my friends and you want to hear what chat GPT has to say for all the straight guys out there about your sexual preference with regard to the trans community we will address this here coming back in just a second asset managers names you know are using your retirement funds to further their ESG agenda last year state treasure is across the nation sent a message to stop playing politics with our pensions by divesting five billion dollars from these companies 25 states are suing to block ESG nonsense from endangering your retirement Republicans on Capitol Hill recently passed a bill blocking the Biden administration from allowing huge asset managers from using your harder money to further their ESG agenda while conservatives in the House and Senate have your back president Biden uses veto pen to kill this bill last week senator Joe Manchin a Democrat who voted to block ESG investing blasted Biden's veto as infuriating and charge that it is putting a radical and progressive agenda ahead of the country's needs these firms have a fiduciary duty to maximize returns they should be held to account for playing politics with our pensions and doing it without our consent to learn how consumers researchers protecting all of us from these woke investment firms go to consumers research dot org that's consumers research dot org paid for by consumers research don't miss a day of the clay travis and bucks extension After I teach professionally as a No, I have not seen it. It's very well done. They've done a few really good series around Waco actually Taylor Kitch, who most people would know as the actor who played Tim Riggins in the Friday night light show. One of the greatest actors of all time. I mean, one of the greatest roles of all time. I'm not sure he's one of the greatest actors of all time. Yeah. One of the great roles of all time. Tim Riggins on the Friday night lights for those of you. No offense to Riggins, but I mean, you know, he's not exactly you know, Charlton Heston or Anthony Hopkins. But anyway, I'm still washington, not knocking down the door. Exactly. So anyway, it's very good. I recommend it to anybody. A lot of documentary footage and it's really, really well done. I know it's Netflix, but if you have Netflix, it's worth checking out because, well, something we'll talk about more, I think later on the week. I just think that it there's a lot that happened there that you need to keep in mind about what happens when things get out of hand and the government government goes too far. Okay. So this is from the account and wokeness. And I will say I had seen this percolating even some years ago and and it was almost like on the hard left, you know, I know left is clay. I know left is personally. I'm actually I'm actually friends with a few who will tell you that they don't want to defund police. They want to abolish police and that that is the true position of the American left. They don't say it out loud that much, but that they want no police period. And I'm always like, well, that would be the purge. That's insane. They said, no, no. Anyway, the true position of the left on the transgender issue isn't that this is a person who is deserving of respect and dignity and equal protection under the law. Because that that's all true. Of course, these are human beings. We should treat the true position of the left is that this is a woman when it's a man transition to woman indistinguishable in all respects and must be treated as indistinguishable in all respects, which brings me to chat GPT here. Chat GPT. This is on the end wokeness account. Men who won't date a woman with a penis are. Oh, sorry. The question was, is it transphobic if a man refuses to date a woman with a penis and that the response for the AI is if a man refuses to date a woman solely because she has a penis, then it can be considered transphobic. This is because it reduces the woman to her genitalia and implies that her gender identity is not valid or that she is less of a woman than a cisgender woman. That is the actual position of the left. That is what everyone to know that that is the that's where we're headed towards. That's chap GPT. My understanding is 3.5. They continue to update it, but this is also why AI is so slanted in one direction or another. But this is far left wing. This is going to become standard. You are a bigot if you won't date a woman with a penis. That's where we're headed. And by the way, I guess I'm going to be a huge bigot for the rest of my life. And by the way, I hope my kids are too. I got three boys. I don't necessarily want I'm dating women with penises just tossing it out there. More family. You agree?

Welcome back in, Clay, Travis, Buck Sexton Show. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us as we roll through the Monday edition of the program. We mentioned off the top that Donald Trump had a bigger rally down in Waco, Texas where I would venture. Many of you that are listening to us right now were in attendance and it was the beginning of Trump's continued campaign. But as he's going to be working in more and more of these big rallies as a part of his campaign and certainly they have been huge parts of his success in his 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, I wanted to play this cut for Trump accuses Alvin Bragg, New York City prosecutor, city prosecutor. The grand jury is back today in New York City. We will see again, we're kind of on indictment watch this week to see what progresses in that grand jury hearing. Here is Trump accusing Alvin Bragg of prosecutorial misconduct. Prosecutorsial misconduct is their new tool and they are willing to use it at levels never seen before in our country. We've had it, but we've never had it like this. We must stop them and we must not allow them to go through another election where they have yet another tool in their toolkit. When they go after me, they're going after you. Okay. So that's Trump. What was interesting about this book is how many people actually agree with Trump about this being prosecutorial misconduct. Even people who are usually huge Trump critics like John Stewart, who says, and John Stewart has sometimes been saying speaking truth of late, he says something that is very true. When it comes to prosecutorial decisions, everything is a selective prosecution. Listen to cut three. These are people who say it's selective prosecution that this would not. Everything is selective prosecution. The reason why Donald Trump became popular in the first place and the reason why these populist movements is that the citizenry have become fed up with the lack of accountability for those in power. We have no accountability in our financial systems. We have no accountability for the bankers. I mean, our Congress trade stocks with information they get making laws and they do it to great success and they won't stop it because they're the ones in charge of making the law about it. He's right. I mean, to a large extent. And Buck, we'll see again. We're on indictment watch and we've got some good cuts of people reacting to it. But I think both of our positions at this point in time are that the best thing Democrats could do to help Donald Trump is indict him, which is why a part of me believes that this is about Democrats selecting Trump as their chosen opponent for Joe Biden because they are terrified. Biden would lose to pretty much anyone and they have desperate hope that he still might be able to beat Trump. You think that this is going to happen this week? Is that where you are on this? If it doesn't happen this week, I question Buck whether it's going to actually happen because I think the one thing that Trump has been really smart on is when he publicized the idea that he was going to be indicted, it put Alvin Bragg under a massive microscope and increased the pressure on him from both the left and the right side of the political spectrum. And so the far left wing now is going to be crushed if Bragg doesn't bring charges. But meanwhile, the investigation itself is under much more scrutiny. And so the longer it drags on without an indictment coming down, the less likely I think there is to be one. So I think they will indict Monday. I think they will indict Trump this week. If they don't, they look like clowns. That's the problem. There's no there's no easy way to back down from this now. There's no because they take it to the point. They've taken it to the point where clearly they want to do this. Clearly this is a political hit. And at some level, I also believe, you know, you remember when there was that Russian defector who was was poisoned with polonium? Do you remember this clay in the UK a while ago? There was a Russian defector and they effectively radioactive material. And I think they put it in the guy's sushi and this was in the UK. And I remember having a conversation with a friend of mine who let's say knew the new the secret world, the world of intelligence and he looked at me and I said, wow, I mean that just seems so so bizarre and sloppy. He was no, no, the sloppiness is the point that will get you with a radioactive isotope and sneak it into your sushi and you will erode from the inside out and that everybody's going to know that it was us. It's got like a mob hit out in broad daylight versus a mob hit, you know, where they bury the body and nobody knows. At some level, I think that with Bragg, it's yeah, we'll even go after Trump on this because we're sick of losing out on all the other opportunities to prosecute him. So we're losing. I mean, you know, we're willing to go to the mat on something absurd because we can. And because it shows Trump how much contempt we have for him and that we're in charge. And so that's the only way I could explain the decision to go forward on this charge of all of the criminal possibilities, you know, the criminal investigations of Trump, which have all come to not as we know, this is everyone agrees. The weakest. This is the single most pathetic investigation of Trump. And this is the one where it's going to be charged. It's just because it's it's flexing muscles in a different way in an authoritarian way. Well, and it also, I think sabotage is any of the other more severe investigations. I understand there. We've talked about this with Andy McCarthy, for instance, that there could be a pile on effect down in Georgia. They decide to charge him in that case. And then somehow they make a decision to charge with the Department of Justice. I actually think the timing on it becomes more difficult, Buck, because as we get closer to through the spring and into the summer, you're effectively into the campaign season. And the Department of Justice tries, at least claims that they don't want their political, their charges to directly impact the political process. Well, how can you argue that charging somebody running for president doesn't directly impact the political process? Now, it may help Trump with the Republican primary while weakening him in the general, which I think is why this is the goal of Democrats. They'll do whatever they can to weaken that Bernie's two style drag 82 year old Joe Biden across the finish line. You know, all of this, Clay, our entire system, not just of government, but our entire legal system in particular hinges on faithful execution. People being willing to based on a set of principles and common understanding of the plain language of statutes and our and our constitution to faithfully adhere to what is said and what is written down and what we all know or what we all agreed are supposed to be the laws. Anyone, whether it's the president on down to a prosecutor, they can just decide if they if they really want to to effectively nullify, right? They can just decide that I'm not going to do this anymore. By the way, the Obama administration tried variations of this. They they did this with their policy on illegal immigration where it just turned into, well, we're going to use prosecutorial discretion to not actually prosecute anybody under this category of crimes. Abuse of and then this brings me back to the faithful execution point, abuse of a prosecutor's office, whether it's a local district attorney all the way up to the attorney general himself or even the president who is actually the chief executor of the laws in the entire country. You know, the attorney general's the highest law enforcement official, but the president is the top of the executive chain of the law. Yeah, if you've got somebody who has no ethics, no morals and just doesn't care, they can subvert the whole system. So that's what starts to be at stake when you talk about people who are obviously and clearly bending the law beyond recognition for purposes of a political vendetta. These are the things that are done in countries where the system does start to collapse. These are the kinds of moves that authoritarian's make. They can, you know, I was remind people the Soviets had a had a great constitution. People forget this. The Soviet Union's constitution had, you know, paid leave for like six weeks or four weeks or whatever. And you know, free freedom of this and freedom of that Soviet constitution. None of it was faithfully executed. The whole system was a totalitarian hellscape, but that was the point. No doubt. We come back. We continue to to track down all of the latest insanity and more.

There's some really interesting somewhat disheartening polling out of the Wall Street Journal that we will bring to your attention has to do with patriotism, hard work, religious beliefs at a national scale to Wall Street Journal poll and a no surprise I'm sure to to any of you. But there there's been a massive decline in what are considered those core American values stretching back now for many decades. So we will we will talk to you about what that tells us about how we're doing as a country. Also Trump and the Sanchez clay is going to get into that a little bit of back and forth there. But even though it's an unofficial primary that primary is underway. Now let's get to some calls here for a moment. Anna in Fort Lauderdale. Anna you got an idea for us. What is it? Yes. I've researched this and I researched that there are four what they call extraordinary writs in the judicial system. That's meaning WRIT. There's the one that I'm talking about is the writ of mandamus which is when you file with either the federal court or your own state court a writ of mandamus to go ahead of the other cases that are going to go on for years and years and years to force a government official in the federal state system to force the government official to do their job or in the state system it goes to your state supreme court and that's where you file it to force a state government official or a lower court judge to do their job. So everybody should be filing writs of mandamus. I believe it's mandamus but yes a writ of mandamus. I just looked it up myself. I'm not a lawyer. So anyway they should be so all the board of state should be filing this writ of mandamus or whatever it's called to force me or get to do his job. All of the federal Congress people should that a lawyer especially should be filing a writ of mandamus or whatever it is to make a raid do his job to make the outside research the house of Biden and all of that. It's an interesting idea. The problem we have is that you're hoping that the system is going to correct the system and so you also have to wonder Clay what are the enforcement mechanisms for this writ of mandamus. So I don't know if this is this. It's not going to work. All right look I mean if you want better government officials and you want them to do the job you need to vote out the Biden administration and you need the House Republicans to do everything they can to keep Biden from stalking as many people out there in government that are unqualified like the new head of the FAA who decided to step down. It's an interesting question. Tom and Naples Florida you've got feedback for us. We were talking earlier about the use of that ESPN using Lee at Thomas as evidence of a great women's success story and their use of language in that advertisement it really kind of jumped out to you. What do you got to say for us? Well great to be with you guys today thanks for taking my call. Love what you're doing with the show but Miss Rush every day. He had such a way of sharing a perspective that was educational and one of the things I remember was when you give up the language to an ideology you pretty much lost the cause. I think that's what's happening here with the whole gender dysphoria question because all of us are using this transitioning or trans person language and that's not what's happening at all. No one is transitioning from one gender to another. They're just people who are pretending to be the other gender and going to sometimes ridiculous steps like self-mutilation to do it but they're truly just people that are pretending to be something that they're not and maybe we're losing an opportunity here to control the language or at least share control. I think thank you. Thank you for calling in Tom. It's absolutely the case on this issue and a range of other issues that the left. Not only police is what language can be used but comes up with new terms. Comes up with new words and then demands that those new terms be used. There's a creative aspect to this as well. All of a sudden we'll start to say, hold on a second. Who had even heard of cisgender? Unless you were meeting psychiatry textbooks 20 years ago, you had no idea. No one had ever heard of what cisgender was. This is true on a whole range of people saying, oh, you're such an idiot. I knew no one heard the term cisgender because no one used the term cisgender because there was no need to use that term. So Clay, it's beyond even just the policing of language and the demand date of language and this is what I always say. They want you to use words that are themselves a concession and that's why the fight over pronouns is actually not small at all. They want to pretend that it's small and that for reasons of being polite, you should use the words that they want you to use. No, let's say major concession to use the gender pronouns for a person that do not actually correspond to that person's sex. Yeah, no doubt. And that's why we started off the show this first hour talking about the way that they are subtly trying to take over the discussion points by using that language in a place like sports, which is defined at its essence, as you all know, best man or best woman wins period. Best man identifying as a woman, which is a direct threat to the overall existence of women's sports in general. When we come back, Buck, bad news out of my hometown of Nashville surrounding a school shooting. My mom just texted me and said we are off the air in Nashville, where unfortunately young kids have been victimized in an elementary school shooting. We don't know a lot of details, but we will give you the absolute latest there. I obviously have young kids in school in Nashville. It is not one of the schools that my kids go to, but I likely will know many of the parents who do have kids there. So we'll update you next."
