    "text": " The following is a quarantine recording presented to you in a round sound. Hey, this is Lady Don't Take No. Your weekly roundup of all of the real and none of the fake. I'm your host Alicia Garza. This show is pro-black, pro-queer, proudly feminist and pro-do what you like. Every week you're gonna get the best of what goes on in my head and what we're loving on and what we hating on, what we might be and what we ain't going to. Politics, pop culture, police on trial for the murder of George Floyd, we cover it all. We are recording from Oakland, California, the center of the known universe, where we are dealing with Rona and reconstruction. It's a challenging time, it's a changing time, it's a time of transformation. It's all the things all the time nowadays, but we are going to help you understand the dynamics of this time every single week. So be sure to tune in, tell a friend and please leave a review on Apple Podcasts. We do it for the culture so the pod is free 99 because we know that with a country and chaos the least we could do is keep you from putting your money anywhere else than where it's needed. Our guest this week is freaking amazing. They are a co-founder and executive director of AAPI Women Lead, an organization created to address the need for more accurate and diverse representation of AAPI self-identified women and girls in the United States. She's a 2020 Soros Justice Fellow researching race, gender, and the sex trades. She's also my Capricorn homie and I am so, so pleased that this incredible woman is joining us on the pod today. We got a lot to talk about. Please, please, please welcome, welcome, welcome Dr. Connie won. Hi Connie. Hi. So good to be on your show. Thanks for having me on here. Oh, I love having you on here. It's on and popping. First of all, for people who are listening right now, you need to know that at the time of this recording, it is about 80 degrees in the Bay. Okay. So I'm just going to go ahead and mermaid on that. Connie, contrary to popular belief, we are still in a panoramic, a pandemic, whatever you want to call it. So I got to ask you, what has your quarantine life been like? And have you developed any unique habits live and direct from Miss Rona? That's an amazing question. So I wear a mask. I know that. Yeah, just doesn't keep anybody missed that memo. So I wear a mask and I socially distance. There we go. Again, another reminder. And then I also started meditating twice a day, 25 minutes a day to keep myself kind of calm and at ease. And I still practice yoga in the morning. And I force myself to go out and train kickboxing and we tie hitting the pads where I can because most of the time it's been inside and I can't handle all of that. I love it. So basically what you're telling me is wrap it up and back it up. And 25 minutes a day, twice a day of meditation. Talk to us a little bit about that. How have you built that practice over time? That's incredible. Well, you know, I started meditating a little off and on for a couple of years. And then I practiced more religiously, using this form of transcendental meditation actually. So there is a sound that I meditate to. And then I let the thoughts come as they do. But when I remember my chant or my sound, it regrounds me. And so I do that right when I wake up in the morning. And then I do that again before I eat dinner so that it can calm me down for the rest of the evening. And a lot of things always come up. But then I remember my chant and my sound and it just brings me back to center. And a lot of the times actually, to be honest, the most peaceful serene images come up when I'm able to remember that chant. And then my most creative time actually occurs when I'm meditating. Hmm. I love that. This is making me so happy. Now I know why you can't go on bike rides with us. But next time, girl, man, did you just did I really see almost 50 miles a speaker in a what? You did 49.11 miles, two bridges and everything in between under four hours. See, and I was hurt that I was missing that. And then I thought I would probably be even more hurt having come back from that. So I know there's going to be more. Don't even worry. I'm obsessed now. I'm obsessed. So we got to get you out on the trails. Give me the scoop on your pandemic skills besides wrap it up and back it up. In case we enter into the apocalypse, I got to know what you bring into the table. So I'm not going to lie. Once they lifted some of the, I don't know what it's called, when they lifted a flat, you know, red, green, yellow, blue, something or other, I was the first to go get my nails done. So I don't know, you know, your audience can't see them, but I went and got my nails done. Your nails look beautiful. Thank you. Hi, there's glitter. There is glitter. I try finger. Most importantly, you know, I say, so I tried to do all the amazing things that you were doing. And then I failed miserably. I see. I tried to bake the bread and the bread did not come out the oven. Yeah. And then I tried to do my nails and it ended up just me doing really cute stickers. Okay. Good. Stickers work. Stickers work. Yeah. But they're not the same. So I feel like I failed. To be honest, all of the high femme, that is me on the daily, did not do well. What I did do though, okay, to add important things in this conversation, is I did put on heels every single zoom meeting. You know what? I appreciate that. From one high femme to another, I just need to, that's amazing. Hi. I hope my heels still fit. I just bought a cute new pair of heels and I was like, where am I going to wear these? I was like, I don't care. I'm just going to wear them in my living room. It's time. Today, I want to dive back into a conversation that we started a few weeks ago on the podcast about anti Asian violence and how people can understand what's happening in this country right now. We had the brilliant Alex Tom on the pod a few weeks ago and we started off this conversation talking about the history of solidarity between our communities, some of the root causes of the wedges that keep us from being stronger together. Today, I'm hoping we can dive into some of the larger themes of what we're facing now. And Connie, I can think of nobody better to help us do this than you. So a few weeks ago, there was a massacre in Atlanta, Georgia. And I think a lot of people were shocked. But what you and I both know is that this violence has both existed in our communities for a long time. And there are moments in our country's history because of the ways that politics change, where this violence becomes more visible. And I would say that it also increases, right? There was a lot of conversation about, you know, the fact that the majority of the people who were murdered were Asian women. There was also some conversation, but certainly not enough about the work that these women did. And I think there was also, you know, an intentional distortion of how we understood the stories coming out of this massacre. I want to ask you, Connie, tell me what you think understanding the stories that have been coming out in the mainstream media. What do you think is missing from the conversation? And why do you think it's absent? And what are the implications of that absence on whether or not we're able to actually intervene in these kinds of situations? It's a beautiful question. Thank you. So there are a couple of things. One is that I think it's really important to, as you're doing right now, frame this violence that took place a couple of weeks ago, a week and a half ago, in a historical context, right? So we'll do that first. Many of us are now reminding ourselves or learning about the history of violence against Asian and Asian American communities abroad and here in the United States, right? So I want us to go a little bit further when we historicize. And I want us to think about the history of violence against Asians as connected to racial colonial and imperialist wars. I think that's important because people tend to forget or name those wars as racist ones or in particular anti Asian wars, right? Or anti Asian violence in particular. So when we think about war, we of course understand that violence is involved. I wanted to understand war, these imperialist wars and colonial wars as also misogynist ones, right? Because what we know in the history of especially US wars in the Philippines, Vietnam or Southeast Asia, there was always violence against women and children. So not coincidentally, March 16th, I think it was when the Atlanta massacre took place, it was also the anniversary of the Meilai massacre in Vietnam. The Meilai massacre was when the US was at war in Vietnam and hundreds upon hundreds of women and children were assaulted and killed in a village called Meilai. There is gender violence that happens through war and there are racial gender violence. That's the history of our experiences with the US. Then we fast forward to this moment where people are covering Atlanta, right? And they're also not looking at the intersections of the violence that's taken place. So you mentioned that it was Asian women who were the primary victims of this 21 year old white man's violent, you know, his rage. His desires and his rage. Yeah, right. Exactly. So six of the women were Asian. Most of them were low wage workers, whether that meant that they were massage parlor workers or they were working in the massage parlor or spa, right? And some of them were also sex workers. Media has not covered necessarily those nuances, but they have covered that this is just anti-Asian violence writ large. They haven't looked at who the primary targets were and what they were doing for a living. So they kind of leave out class, right? They leave out the fact that many of these women were probably migrant workers and some are maybe undocumented. So they leave out the issue of immigration. They leave out the fact that we live in an anti sex work culture, right? And they conflated all as anti Asian violence. And that has been a problem for those of us who live at the intersections and who are the most vulnerable to multiple forms of violence, including a white man's desires and rage and the police who have criminalized sex work and massage parlor workers. Right. So that's been missing. And what are the implications of those omissions when we don't tell those stories? What do we lose and what do we gain? So I appreciate that question too. You're so good with these questions. You know, I work on it. Good job. Good job. Thank you. So I think what we miss and what others benefit from seem to be quite similar because what I am seeing is that folks are, especially the state and the criminal justice system and those who are very pro police are calling for hyper surveillance for increased surveillance. They're calling for more policing. They're calling for hate crime legislation. And while I understand and many of us understand that impulse for quote unquote justice, what folks who conflated all as the same thing do is they miss the fact that massage workers, sex workers in particular, are often survivors of police violence. Right. They're already being criminalized by the criminal justice system by state, local and federal law enforcement, constantly under surveillance. So when you conflate it, and you decide to name solutions for the most vulnerable, then you leave them even more susceptible to violence that you didn't consider. The other thing is, you know, historically, Asian women have been subjects of gender violence, both intra communally and then inter communally, meaning we experience violence at home in the neighborhood, at work, and writ large. When people conflate it and don't have an intersectional analysis, they miss the multiple forms of violence that folks are experiencing. We're not even talking about queer Asian women. We're not even talking about our disabled queer Asian women who face even more forms of violence, right? So that omission leaves out the solutions that many of these most vulnerable community members already know. So by omitting our nuances and conflating it all, you end up missing the solutions, and you miss telling the accurate story about our lives, right? And then you end up replicating, and then expanding the forms of violence that we are experiencing. That's right. That's right. Okay, I'm just going to go in for a second. So forgive me, Lord. Okay. Look, this conversations rarely begin with celebrities, right? There has been generations of organizing and resistance and efforts to transform, right, the violence that's happening in our communities, with our communities, against our communities, that often starts at the grassroots. But when a lot of people hear about these forms of violence, the root causes of them, and ideas for what we can do about it, they're hearing it from people who have platforms that reach millions of people. We both know that celebrities using their platforms for politics is increasing. And I think that there's good sides to this. And there's also problematic sides to this. On this podcast, I've gone off quite a few times about Andrew Yang. And it's not personal. He's a nice enough guy. But my critique has been that he doesn't have the range, often advocating for false solutions and investing in broken promises that are rooted in the status quo, whether it be encouraging Asian Americans to wear American flag pins to avoid getting beat up to, you know, any other kind of a thing that he's been putting forward, particularly in this moment. And again, this is not to single him out. This is to help us get context, right, for what we see and what we hear on Twitter and, you know, these various social media platforms. And I want to ask you, Connie, help us understand how can we separate the real from the fake? I think in moments like this, people want to do something. And they're coming into contact with people that they're already connected with. And because this country is so deeply segregated, right, because people are discovering, right, that movement is a real thing and that movement is helping to transform our lives every single day. And a lot of people maybe skip some steps, right, of trying to figure out, well, which solutions should I actually be advocating for? I want to do something, right? I'm upset about the fact that people are being slaughtered. I'm upset about the way in which racism functions in our society. I'm upset about gender-based violence. How do we separate the real solutions from the false solutions, the real from the fake? Man, because you know what was coming up for me when you were naming, you know, celebrities and politicians and their band-aid solutions, right? Like I thought about race and gender. And I thought about the ways that some of these celebrities, while I get what they're trying to do, have also just really invisibilized and marginalized community members and community organizers who've been long, who've long been doing this work. Lots of whom are women. Many of whom are women. Come on. Many of whom are non-binary. That's right. Many of whom have been here for, you know, a very long time building relationships who have layered analyses of what's going on in our lives and what's happening to our communities. So I think the other thing is many of us are also survivors. I think that's huge. And when we say survivors, I mean gender-based violence survivors, but we're also survivors of state violence. You know what I mean? And so we have a layered analysis. We sit at the intersections of all these forms of violence, which means we've been thinking very clearly about what the solution should be and is, right? Well, we're like, no, we don't want to be harmed by them or them. That's what you want to be. And that's us having paid very close attention to both our own lives and who is harming our lives and that of the people we love. And so when we say, when you were talking about the real solutions, I think it has to go back to, again, folks who have been on the grounds who are community organizers, but also community members who are survivors of what I was saying are multiple forms of violence, right? I know folks who are with Asian Prisoner Support Committee, who are women, who are formerly incarcerated, who are formerly incarcerated survivors, who have been leading the work to end anti-Asian violence, not only in their own lives, but they're trying to fight detentions. They're trying to fight deportations. They're trying to fight, you know, incarceration because they know that these are also forms of anti-Asian violence, right? And the other thing that I think is super important too, that I've been thinking about related to your previous question, is those of us who have been organizing, those of us who've been in, you know, thinking this through and feeling this through in terms of how to survive and create a different world, we've always been working with other communities of color, right? We have long been working with black, indigenous, Latinx, other communities of color, Pacific Islander communities, right? We've been working together because we know that we need each other. And we're also not going to throw each other under the bus. That's right. That's a part of survival for us, right? So I think that to me is an important part about identifying what a real solution is. And I think that also comes with, you know, you and I both live in Oakland. We are surrounded by communities of color, by a pop communities, right? Our neighbors are our communities of color. So we are constantly taking care of each other. We don't call on hate crime legislation when something goes wrong, because one that's an uphill battle. But we know to take care of each other and to build out our communities so we can be more resourced and create a world where we are not consistently violated and harmed. That's right. We have the solutions, right? So the Angie Yang's throw of the world, you know what I mean? We need to be coming back to the community and asking us, what have you all been doing? You know, and how can we support you instead of everybody just trying to grab the mic right now? I want to emphasize this point, Connie, because in the last, it's probably been months now, I've gotten so many phone calls from young women who are at the intersection of all of these fights, and I'm getting these phone calls because we're in relationship. Black women, AAPI women, queer folks, non-binary folks, right? And the questions are always the same. And the questions are, how do we navigate this relationship where people discover us, but don't want to listen to us? And it really breaks my heart, because I think for people who have vast platforms where millions of people tune into you because of whatever you're selling on that platform, whether it be a platform of policies, right? Or whether it be products or whether it be your art, whatever it is, it is so important to be responsible. And it rarely occurs to people to ask what they can do for people who have already been doing this work. People want to recreate the wheel as if people have not been fighting, working, building, scrapping together, piecing together, and reimagining for a long time. And I think the impact of this often is that, besides the fact that it's a Christopher Columbus move, okay, the impact of this often is that it slows the work down at a time when it needs to accelerate. So everybody wants something to get done, right? And imagine what would happen if five people with a million people on their platforms each just decided we're going to give the mic to the people who've been organizing around this before we discovered it. Ooh. Ooh. Speaking of rediscovery, lots of people now are talking about abolition. Abolition is not a new idea. Abolition has been shaping this country ever since this country was a country. One of my favorite practitioners on the subject, Ruthie Wilson-Gillmore, argues that abolition is not just the absence of a thing. It's not just the tearing down of a thing, but it is also the building of something new and transformative. As a teacher, as somebody who has helped to implement these frameworks in real time, I'm hoping that you can talk to us in laypersons terms about what is abolition and how can it be a tool to help us reimagine how we address harm and how we address violence, whether it be gender-based, economy-based, racially-based, or all three at the same time. And how can we use that at the same time that we are addressing harm? So I think the most common thing I hear is, well, if we don't have police, everything's going to go crazy. And I think that's how people understand abolition, right? So I'm wondering if you could just give that some texture and layer, but also for the average person who's like, I've heard of it, but I don't really know what that is, and I'm not sure I'm with it. It's also a great question for this moment, right? There's a couple of things that I think come up, and the reason I'm pausing, this is a flag for us real quickly. A lot of the response to the anti-Asian violence right now, folks are saying whether it be on social media or whatever, they'll say, where's BLM now? They say that over and over again. So I wanted to flag that, because I've been trying, as I've answered your question, I've been trying to figure out how to insert number one BLM was about honoring Black life and ending police violence. And folks who are racist, want to just be like, you know, oh, yeah, we're used to that girl. We got this. No, no, no, it's good. But then for the folks who are doing anti-Asian violence work, we're trying to both raise awareness around the violence and then also be like, we also have BLM's back, right? Yep. So I'm just trying to figure out the best way to ever address that, whether that be on the podcast together or just outside of this. So I just wanted to raise that first. I love that. Thank you for that. Okay. Now going back to the question of abolition. So I appreciate you citing Ruthie, because she is, you know, a mentor and a dear friend and colleague. And alongside Ruthie is another friend and colleague of mine by the name of Maryam Kaba. Mm-hmm. So we were just on a panel together to talk about abolition. So Maryam and I are both a part of this series called abolition for the people, which is by Colin Kaepernick. And one of the things that we talked about on our panel was about how abolition is absolutely about imagining and creating a different world. It is about recognizing that this system that people are increasingly understanding or learning about is set up to do what it's doing very well. It is not failing, like people say. It's not failing to stand up for communities of color and black communities. It is doing what has always been doing, which is that it has been anti-black at its foundation. It's been white supremacist at its foundation. It's been sexist, ablest, right? Homophobic and transphobic. We see it in the evidence in terms of who is being harmed, who has been killed, and who's incarcerated. Right? If we can own that the system is doing what it is supposed to do, then we have to step back and ask ourselves, why are we trying to fix this? Right? Yep. So abolition is the idea that we're not trying to fix a system that is set up to harm us. We're not trying to reform a system that has caused so much violence, right? To your point, the world would be, I think you said, the world would be crazy without police, right? And chaos is what it's got. Thank you, right? It would be chaotic without police. And I would argue that the world is chaotic because of the police. If we see that as the truth, then we have to recognize that we cannot continue to rely on something as chaotic as that. And then we have to affirm that our communities have long been taking care of each other. We have many survivors that I know, and I've been doing gender violence work for 20 plus years. Most people do not call the criminal justice system. One, because they already know or have experienced policing in their own lives where they feel as though they're going to be harmed. That's right. Then they also, for survivors, for the most part, the criminal justice system has caused more damage when it's brought into the dynamic. So it's caused chaos, like you said. So people have experimented and people have taken care of each other. So we have a colleague and friend of mine, Mia Mingus, who has talked about pod mapping, who's talked about creating community based strategies to attend to the violence in our lives. So for instance, if anything was to happen to you, Alicia, I would be on your pod if I had the honor of being so, which means you would know to call me if you were in harm's way. And it would be my responsibility, along with other members, that you trust to come and take care of you. And however it is that you may have been harmed. We would center you all the time. And we would take care of you. Abolition has also meant creating mutual aid projects. We see it in East Oakland. We see folks having tables where we set up food pantries for each other. Abolition looks like taking care of one another, like we have been doing. Abolition, for example, in Oakland looks like having mobile mental health clinics that are not run by the police who have disproportionately killed community members or disabled, right? It means relying on us to take care of us. And it also means recognizing that we need to create conditions by which we don't harm one another. That's right. So that we are accountable to each other before harm even takes place. Abolition is something that committees of color in particular have already been doing and then challenging those conditions that made harm possible. Let me address this piece that you lifted up. You know, I too have seen a lot of this chatter on social media about where's BLM? You know, and it's actually an old dynamic, right? If it's not this, it's something else. And I think it has a lot to do with one when people aren't just willfully trying to be complete assholes. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that people don't understand movements, right? And sure, BLM could 100% jump in front and make it all about BLM. But is that helping? Right? We could flank, right? And part of, and by BLM, I don't just mean like the organization, right? I'm talking about this larger movement for Black liberation, which I think is a intersectional movement. And I think it's an inter-community movement. And I feel like part of what often happens, and I talk a little bit about this in my book, is that people ascribe qualities and characters to movements that are so incredibly transactional. It's also how we relate to politics. I call it's my snack machine theory around politics. Have I talked to you about this? It's like a bigger version of add water, you know, add water and a little bit of salt and then boom, you have a movement. I think the snack machine version is like you put in your quarter, you press B6, you get your candy bar, and there's justice. That's not actually how this works, right? There's a lot of ways, right, in which movement contorts, responds, steps forward, steps back to allow for the prevalence, the presence, the leadership, the vision, right, of who needs to be centered in that moment. And I think this narrative around where is BLM, right? Often comes from at its best place, a longing for people to explode around this kind of violence, right, in the same way that people have exploded around anti-black violence and racism. At its very worst, it is not only misinformed, but it is also dangerous because it continues to perpetuate this notion that movements should be transactional. One, two, that we're not already in relationship with each other, chatting, building, strategizing, listening, right, sitting quietly together, right? There are so many ways in which people are showing up for each other. And if you're not seeing it, right, it doesn't mean it's not happening. It might just mean you in the wrong place, child. So, I just want to tie that up in a little bit of a bow because I see you trying to navigate that. And we are navigating that as well, right? And folks don't know, right, that we go way back, way back. We just found each other. Y'all just found us. So, there's that on that. And just like that, it's time for our weekly roundup of all the things Lady just ain't going to do this week. Number one, part cannon arrested at the state Capitol for doing her fucking job. Last week, part cannon, who represents the 58th District of Georgia in the House of Representatives, was arrested for knocking on the door of a room where the governor and some of his cronies were signing a landmark voter suppression bill that aims to disenfranchise the very same voters who saved the country. Part cannon is dope. And one of five queer legislators in the entire Georgia House of Representatives, five. And Lady hears that five is the highest number of queer people in the Georgia House of Representatives ever, just so you know what we're working with here. So, Governor Brian Kemp, you remember him, the dude who stole the election from Stacey Abrams, who would be governor, had Kemp, who was also then the Secretary of State. Right. The people who oversee the voting process. Kemp was doing white men who steal shit, thanks. Signing a devastating bill for Georgia voters in secret. Not saying it with his chest, which, even though it's awful, I could at least respect it. But instead, being wrong is two left shoes, in private, during a small ceremony. Now, the officers who arrested Cannon, because you know, this shit made national news, honey, the officers who arrested her, said that they were trying to prevent a repeat of the insurrection that occurred at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th. Now, let me show you how the devil works. The notion that the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, Donald Trump's modern version of the Boston Tea Party, mixed with some, let's kidnap some elected officials that we don't like. An insurrection that was overwhelmingly white and male, reminded this motherfucker of what? Five foot one, Black Queer Park Cannon, knocking at the door in the building, where she works as an elected official and colleague of the governor. She reminded you of what that QAnon dude in a wolf hat howling at the moon in the Senate chambers? Or did she remind you of that white man who put his dirty ass feet on Nancy Pelosi's desk, stole her shit, and then took a picture of his ass doing it? I mean, the audacity, of whiteness, is really the fuck unmatched. This is a real problem for Georgia man. Last year, they were arresting then state senator and now U.S. congresswoman, Nakeema Williams, also the homie, in her own fucking meeting for daring to go to work and do her job. Now, tell me again, your votes don't matter. In fact, I think you should register to vote again today, especially the fuck if you in Georgia, just for the fuck of it. And while you can, because if these people get their way, you not going to be able to vote unless you pledge to vote for them. And you know what that is called? A dictatorship. Jesus, y'all, Jesus, Jesus. Other things, lady, just ain't gonna do this week. The murder trial for Derek Chauvin. Look, lady will be honest with y'all that I have not watched not one nanosecond of this trial. And I'm not going to. I probably won't until they announce the verdict. And even then, I ain't sure I'm even gonna do that. I'm usually a trial watcher. I was obsessed with the George Zimmerman trial, but since then, I can't really stomach the shit anymore. However, lady is doing her job and giving you news you can use as my friend Rashad Robinson is known to say. So for the last week, witnesses to the murder have been interviewed by both the prosecution and the defense. Opening statements were on Monday and began with the more than nine minute video that chronicles in painful detail, former Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, murder George Floyd. Among the witnesses this week were four witnesses who were age 18 or younger, with the judge making the brilliant decision to make sure their faces aren't being shown on television. Other witnesses included a firefighter, a 911 dispatcher, a cashier working across the street, and a mixed martial arts fighter. Regardless of the outcome of this trial, there's a few things we know. First, we know that it is in the practice and the culture of policing to kill people. Second, we know that the law allows for leniency for killer cops while allowing no leniency at all for a man named George Floyd, who begged for his life, who told the officers he had anxiety and claustrophobia, who told the police he was a good person. They saw him begging for his life and they killed him anyway. And what we found out this week is that he was dead for five whole minutes before they even took the knee off the neck. Third, we know that you should not be killed for a counterfeit bill or wearing a hoodie or being high or playing with a toy gun in a park or celebrating with your friends the night before your wedding or any of the other bullshit ass reasons police give. Finally, we know that this will continue to happen and lessen until we change the laws and change the practice of policing. The police do not keep us safe. They create more harm than safety and it's because we are protecting them in doing so. In so many ways, it ain't about them. It's about us. What we allow, what we will look away from, what we will justify, and for what reasons. Guns do not keep us safe. Fear does not keep us safe. The pattern and practice of policing is that lives are altered forever. That's undeniable. So if we know that as we are watching it right now and have been watching it our whole lives, don't you think it's time to do something about it? Other things ladies just ain't going to do this week, anti-trans bills being passed across the country. Several bills were passed this week with more on the way, restricting the rights of trans people to life, to dignity, to wellness and wholeness. 82 bills have been introduced in state legislatures across the nation this year alone, making 2021 the year that the highest number of bills intended to discriminate against trans communities were introduced in history. This week, Arkansas passed a bill outlawing gender affirming care for trans youth. It is the most stringent restrictive bill in the country. It heads to the governor's desk for signing this week. Many of the bills being passed around the country are bills that restrict health care for trans communities. Why is this happening you ask? Well, I'll tell you, no goddamn reason at all except to discriminate. Republicans have made this their signature issues and they should be embarrassed and ashamed, but they're not, of course, because well, because Republicans are now merely the party of makes no sense. In today's culture wars, trans communities are enemy number one. The consequence here is that our society becomes less inclusive and millions of people will lose access to the health care they need to live well. A doctor in Michigan testified that they're seeing a spike in emergency room cases of trans people who have attempted suicide. Cruel and all too usual punishment. Let's talk about things Lady likes this week. I'm sorry, y'all. We had a long list of things Lady and Gondu. But let's talk about what we want more of this week. Number one, a second stimmy. That's right, folks. Lady has it on good authority that discussions are already underway for a second stimmy that will look specifically at more payments. Just like Lady and her team have been calling for through the COVID-19 relief and recovery for Black America plan, as well as our Build Back Boulder plan, a Black mandate for the Biden Harris administration. Now, you can find out more about how to get involved by going to our website, www.blackthenumber2thefuture.org. We don't need these monthly payments until the pandemic is over, and it looks like momentum is building for this exact idea. So, let's make it happen, my people. If we can spend trillions on weapons of mass destruction, surely we can take a little bit off the top, right? For the people? Let's go, y'all. Other things Lady loves this week, it is a officially springtime, my loves. Don't forget to get outside, smell the flowers that are blooming, call someone and tell them you love them.

I said it because Lady don't take no."
