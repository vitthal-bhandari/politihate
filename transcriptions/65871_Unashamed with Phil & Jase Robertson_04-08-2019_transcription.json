    "text": " Welcome to the Unashamed podcast with Phil Robertson, Al Robertson of course here. Oh, Jason is along for the ride. Great episode today. Kind of continuing our discussion of Abraham. Jason, dad are having some interesting connection issues on the episode today. So you'll see that. It's pretty funny. I get tickled easily just when they're when those two are missing the marks. So it's pretty funny. You got a little advice on what to do with the stalkers, especially if you're a man that's an female stalker. So really interesting stuff from Jason dad about that. So be looking for that. And then of course just some good Bible. Abraham sort of hay factors in our faith today. So glad you're along for the ride. Buckle up. Here we go. I am Unashamed. What about you? So Jason, you just had a little trip to a great state of South Carolina. This is turning to an annual event for my family. As in my wife, three kids, which one of them is married now, his wife. And now we have our Nick Rauquin young girl that, you know, she's sort of like the adoptee. She's sort of like Rebecca to Willie's family. We've kind of acquired her. She was an orphan girl from Nick Rauquin. She's worked her way to get a scholarship in the United States and she goes to college. But you know, she has one sister, but no money and you come to America. You don't know anybody. That's a good thing coming out of the immigration problem. The ones we're looking for, the ones you're suggesting. This girl has worked. Look, it's not because of us. She has worked her entire life. The guy who ran the orphanage down there in the Nick Rauquin, he has been her mentor and has really helped her. He said one of our one kingdom guys. Yeah. Well, the bottom line is why you, since you brought it up, we're not at all anti-immigration as God's people. Immigrants talked about throughout the Bible. Sure. We love everybody, huh? That's right. Well, yeah, a shocker of shock. Look, but we are saying that when the open borders and that kind of fiasco, you just can't have it. Well, you have to have a constant sense. Orderly process to get a measure. Well, even Karina, she had to go through, she had a tough time. She had a scholarship here to go to school, but she got pushed out of her own country and she couldn't get back in. Well, there was a civil war going on. You talk about it. You talk about other countries. She couldn't get back in her own country. Now, look, this is what this girl did. She learned English just on the internet, YouTube. And so then she starts applying to other countries to get an education. And so she gets accepted in Germany. She goes to high school there on a scholarship by herself for four years, goes to Germany. Never been there. Don't know anybody. Don't know German. And so there she works her tail off, learns German, and she's still working on her English. And then she applies, gets a scholarship from there to the United States. And now she's here. But they called us because they were like, we got a girl with a strand and she can't get back into her country. And it wasn't her time. She had like two months of interim time where she's basically stuck out of her country in a neighboring country trying to get to the university. Oh, family. She loves her country. America, she's here. Yeah, but she loves Nicaragua. She wants to make a difference there. She, you know, she works and she's no handout here. She won't, she won't even take a handout. She works. She gets her job on campus and awesome, awesome heart, loves the Lord. And really that's what she attributes to her success. She's like, you know, I trust God and he's taken care of it. But anyway, so every year for the last, I guess four or five years, we've taken a trip. It's kind of an adventure type trip. We went to Israel last year. So we went to Utah one year and climbed the mountains. You know, my kids, they're into this, you know, we're running hike and bike and which is so preferring Godly immigrants wouldn't might not fly too well with red lips and the squad. You know what I'm saying? I have no idea what that means. But anyway, so this year we go to South Carolina. There really is at the squad. Because I want to, I wanted to do something along, you know, where I could fish. They got, you know, I just want to see the place. There's a hundred golf courses on, you know, on the island that Hilton had. So we went, Phil, you had to love it. It's like the yuppies took over and they turned a wilderness into like a commune. Like they built a city in the wilderness. They don't cut trees there. And I would love this. Well, I was being sarcastic. And everything's like cookie cutter, you know, and look, everybody bikes everywhere and they kayak and they jog and they run their little families, you know, and well, I really liked it. It's so it's a it is a, I mean, there's constant motion there. I know you know what I'm saying? Everybody's always out there walking the dogs that I could never find a store like because there's no signage. Yeah. The signs are all nothing is like out there. Everything's in the woods. Like if you had a town in our hunting, do all the roofs have mirrors on them yet? I don't know what that I'm not following. Why would a roof have a mirror? Well, these people don't want any kind of power. They want to come in from the sun. Only I figured this much. Well, you know what? I never saw there. Well, you couldn't because there's too many trees. Well, I never saw a power line though. I guess it's all underground. It is. I liked it, but it's like, you know how our culture reverts back is now like riding a bike is the coolest thing ever. It's like making a comeback. Everybody was wearing was was on bikes going back to your roots. So you'll know with the Robertson clan raised born and raised. This is your parents coming on when they were children. You say, was there ever one bicycle or tricycle? Did one ever come out of the Robertson clan? The entire seven children? Was there ever a bicycle or tricycle on the premises at any given time? Zero. Well, you don't like bikes? Nobody had the money. Oh, you walk. Well, walk. We all had a rubber tire piece. And when you were the closest we ever got to a bicycle or tricycle, you would take an old rubber tire, no real or anything, just a tire and you would roll it and you would have five or six of you would take off rolling the tires. So you would pretend like boy, it'd be nice to actually be riding a tire. We gazed who was the had the fastest tire. Well, whoever the fastest child was had with when the contest, which one of these tires is really get it. Well, the fastest one, but always when the contest. He was pushing the tire. He was rolling the tire. Man, but we come along. Oh, man. Well, my first bike didn't have the rubber party, but just T. I found it. The road down here somewhere. I don't think we ever bought any of you a bicycle. No bikes. But we all had them. People held to that. No bicycles or tricycles around here. But we had them. We because people, you know, it's weird about being at the end of the road and the end of the civilization where you live is people come down here and just dump stuff, you know, like, you know, a lot of dogs. A lot of dogs. But I mean, old bikes right over here, there was a sign that said no dumping and people dumped there. Yeah, they took the no dumping sign as they sign for we need to dump stuff here. Yeah, Willie and I used to just every morning we would comb that. And that's where we got our toys. Redneck just took dumping here, but they forgot the no. The no is what they. Yeah. So I'm in South Carolina where we go fishing and they're like, I didn't want to go way out. They're like, it's the largest shark nursery in the world. So I mean, you, you basically, if you put anything on a line and just put it out the side of the boat, a shark's fixing to hit it. And we proved that that seems like a wonderful place to spend three or four days. Well, it was. I tell you this, there were, there were no people swimming in the water that I saw at any point at any time and they had little beaches, but there were people on jet skis and on. I thought, you know, there's a fine line between riding a jet, jet ski and becoming, you know, a devil horse, you know, that bait that you use for large mouth and they never saw a Jaws too. Well, my buddy that just popped in my head. My buddy that day sent me some YouTube video. There's a guy in Gulf Shores, what we go. He's on some kind of board where he's like, he's like standing up, but he's going on the board and they had one of these drones filming it and there was a huge shark just trailing him, you know, behind him. Oh, we don't know. We got their fishing. So look, I, you know, they were, they were catching sharks. My kids going crazy, you know, Missy tied into one of those spinners. I don't know what they call, which kind of shark it was, but it was just literally spinning out of water. She's screaming, you know, in the Necroagum girl, Karina, she's just going crazy. She's never even fishing before. First fish was like some big tiger shark or whatever. So I'm fishing this little cut because he said, you know, the fish you can eat. He's caught them over there. So I got a little spin cast in real 25 pound test line. And so I feel a bump, you know, I sat to hook and I'm like, what in the world? I mean, it just was just slow movement. Just, whoa, dead weight, whoa, whoa, fight lasted probably 20 minutes, but there was no runs. I just keep coming up and he's like, that can't be a fish because it just. And so we thought it was a stingray, but it just didn't, I've caught stingrays for it. It just didn't feel like that. So up this comes and everybody screamed because it, it literally looked like the alien and the alien babies. It looked like the hatch was going to drop and the teeth were, but it looked like the alien when it came up. And I was like, what in the world is that? And so our guide started going nuts. He said, that's a horseshoe crab. And for you that, you know, you can Google a picture of them. I mean, they look like an alien and he's like, oh, right? Oh, yeah. Well, he went on this, this, this kind of bothered me. You know, he said, Oh, that's one of evolution's relics right there. You caught the crossover. You know, they're protected. We got to get him back in, which I want to take a picture and he's like, Oh, no, no, no. I'm like, well, you can't help but we, he, he bit my shrimp. I called him. It's not illegal to catch him. Let's take a picture and throw him back and on its own salt water dream. This thing up and so no way. Why don't we make a, what'd you kind of crab or horseshoe crab? I guess I was the first thought that went through my mind when I saw this, I thought you're telling me this just came from nothing. I mean, this was like one of the most detailed creatures that you could imagine. There were legs going everywhere and I don't know. How big was the, how much the time was it? It was 20 pounds. Okay. It was pretty big and evolution's relic. Well, that gave us opportunity to share. That's, that's code word for we don't know where this one comes from. This is, this gave, you know, me an opportunity to say, well, you know, there might have been a creator behind that. And he was like, do what? I mean, it's like, he, I don't know what I was talking about. But it did make me think while we were there. I mean, I love the place, I love the community is fishing. We're catching these things, but the deer had taken over because there's no hunting on this island. And so there, it's the same kind of deal. A lot of times when you see in the millennial crowd and the, in the yuppie crowd, they try to live together with nature instead of controlling it as a responsibility. Oh, we love it. You know, we love seeing the deer, but in the back of her mind, we know, look, that's greatest thing you can eat on this island. It just ran across the car. And so their biggest problem is deer. It's not car wrecks. You know, we're, they're running over deer. It's more the deer running over the cars. There's so many deer, but their male nurse, you could tell they're all small because there's not enough, you know, to eat them. You need to turn loose about 15, 20 rednecks in there and they, it whittled all that down. Oh, Jimmy Red. Yeah. Managed remedy. He could rip you that situation. But it was a good trip. It was a good, good family. Do you have any fans? Do you have any, a fan? Oh, yeah. Look, so we don't, we never hate, I missed it. Yeah. We don't eat out for obvious reasons because you're wrecking now, you know. But the last night we did, because they said this restaurant, I mean, they go, they take the, they get the oysters in the shrimp and they pull up to the harbor and dump them. You know, and then you can eat. Yeah. So I'm like, well, it did know what was good table fare. Oh, Phil, look, we go this place. And of course, there's an hour wait. There's a thousand people there because I'm like, there's a thousand people here for a reason. You get down there for right in the bay. And of course, it turned into an event for me, you know, I'm taking pictures with people recognizing me and I'm on record as saying, Jase, since you're telling your South Carolina story, I didn't know about the little island with the shark-infested waters. But I did, I did give a speech one time and I said, I've been all over the United States. Most of the states feel my mist. I said, but I'm here to tell you the best people I've ever actually run up on was from South Carolina. And some guy in the back said, you stay around here long. You may change your mind. But I would just say, well, I was impressed. The South Carolina below, I was telling my wife, North and South Carolina. Well, the people I was taking pictures with and this kind of deal, these were just tourists from all over. And my wife got so upset because I had one woman who just, I mean, she was a lot older than me. She was way bigger than me. She was really loud. And she just thought she had in her mind that she's in South Carolina and she's gonna go out on a date with Jase from Duck Dynasty. And so I'm looking at you, Jase. I'm trying to see what exactly was it that was drawing her to your presence. I have no idea. I could say the same thing about you. I mean, tell some of your stories. I can pluse in here. There's a lot of hard up women out there. So what do you do? Just kind of sturd her. What is wrong with my head? First I brought up my wife. I'm here with my wife, you know, but it didn't. It wasn't a treasure. Well, I didn't know my wife is watching this because she's been waiting. They're watching all the time. Been way too friendly here, you know, and evading my personal space. So here comes my son who says, excuse me, ma'am. My dad's here with his family and it's time to go. You know, he just, but so I'm like, why did my son do that? You know, well, Missy sent him over and said, Hey, your dad needs help. Does that? Yeah. He was trying to be. You know, they sent us words. Some of the guys that speak a lot and they said it would be better than when you're staying in a hotel and someone rings the doorbell, it would be better if someone else opened the door, not you feel, not you personally don't open the door. I'm like, what are you talking about? They said, well, what they do is they have these women that they'll send up and they might not be as big as a one. He said she was a large woman. I thought there was anything wrong with it. I was just saying it was in, it was in. You see, why not the door? You open the door. Hey, what do you need? And she just embraces you. Somebody else is down the hallway taking a picture. Then they put the picture on the internet. You know, there's Phil Roberts and you know, one man, one woman, you know, for life. There's Phil Roberts and the lovely Devi with some chick in a hotel. Oh, we got him now. And I'm like, what happened? So they basically said don't open the door. So to this day, when I was warned about that, I had never even thought about that. But I said, all right, I know why. I just wouldn't think there would be a woman knocking on your door. Well, I don't know. That's what I'm saying. If they chase Jase, you know, why not go and greet me over here? Anything's possible. I mean, I did in the first year of the honesty, I pulled out of my house, took the right to stop sign, came up to the next stop sign and a car just come pulling in front of me like you'd see in a movie. So I thought they were going to get out with guns. Yeah. Well, there was two girls, two young girls dressed gently. And one of them comes around and have my window down. And she just comes at a dead run toward the truck. And I'm like, what is going on? I mean, I knew there wasn't a weapon. So I wasn't like startled. And she just jumped in my window in my truck, basically in my lap. I looked at the other one because I'm like, what are you doing? I mean, it startled me then. And the other one was videoing it. And so the girl, did you get it? Did you get it? Yeah. And I'm going to get out of my... I'm not going to speak next day at the time. Well, I never saw it, but I don't check it. That was, I mean, that was like seven years ago. But I thought, okay, yes. It's just frolicking and fun with Jase, you know, the guy that goes around and preaches. Here's what he's doing. They show that. It's out there somewhere. I'm sure somebody's out. Well, I guess it bays to be careful. You know, the Falwells told us that Jerry Falwell, the senior dad, back in the day, because you know, he was after the pornography. And you remember, he was one of the early guys that speak up nationally. So they were after him and they'd do these setups where they'd try to fit women in his hotel room. So it got so bad that he would have to send an advanced team of people in to make sure that wasn't anything because it happened apparently once, but they, you know, they were trying to get pictures of him in a compromising situation to ruin his reputation. That's why you never go anywhere alone. Here's a news flash for America. When you hit about 73 and you're a godly man, if you're truly a godly man, you hit about 73, there's a long list of things that are more important than sex. Yeah. So everybody will understand. If I said, okay, yeah, we might have run at it, but it's way down the list. What do you say? You're in the stage now where you're just trying to get through it. What's on your mind when you get up? Wow, women, I said, the resurrection of the day is on my mind. I was 73 years old. I got four years and that's the average age of a male when he dies and the US and was like, oh, you have to the chick who said not hardly. I'm after the resurrection of the day. I do. There is a lesson in that like, because I travel a lot and you do too. And of course, I'm always have my little team there with me or whatever. But ever once in a while, they'll be a woman come up and be like, what are you doing after the show? Always say the same thing. I'm going home or I'm going to the hotel and I'm calling my wife. Yeah. She's like, oh, that ends it. It's over. Yeah. And I don't travel. As always with me, what you told us that that we were young, never leave the house. Well, that's your woman or your Bible. That's it. And so that's good advice that I've stuck to. So we're already today on the podcast here. We are in, we're in Genesis. We're talking about Abraham last time mom was with us and we sort of looked at the sort of the family relationship. You know, Abraham is a big deal in the Bible. And in fact, today I want to talk a little bit about, you know, he's mentioned more in the New Testament, you know, post-Gospels. Well, I mean, Jesus mentioned him several times too, but he's mentioned more in the New Testament than any other figure other than Jesus himself. Father of our faith. Father of our faith. And so, so, you know, you think about him. Here's a guy. He's basically just kind of living his life. He's obviously a man who believes in God because he listens when God calls him. So in Genesis 12, we talked about this last time, he basically says, Abraham, I want you to take your family and I want you to go to a place you've never seen. And I'm going to bless you. And you're going to be a blessing to many people. And you're going to have at this point, Abraham is, well, he's Abram. He hadn't changed his name yet, but he's 75 years old and he has no children. Sarah, his wife, Sarah at the time, was barren. She couldn't have children. And you know, people are living longer in his day, 150 years. So I guess I don't know if it's just a middle age, but I mean, 75 years old. Yeah, the exact greatest is Abraham against all hope. That's right. Yeah. So having a kid to 75 your wife's about 90 by that time, how old was he? Well, we were 75 when we first see him. Yeah. So Abraham comes back to him when he's 99. So 24 years have gone by and God comes back to him and says, because at this point, you mentioned this last time that Abraham is, he believes in God and he believes the promise. But here he is. He can't, they can't have kids. So he's thinking, well, maybe, maybe I need to do something. Maybe God needs me to, you know, help the plan here along. So Sarah has a, has a hand made has a, you know, person that is, you know, her servant. And so Abraham marries her, which was, you know, in that day, this was polygamy. And then she gets pregnant by him. So you remember Sarah is the problem. She can't have children, but Abraham, even at, you know, hit this age will pass my our lineage down through Hagar here. Right. So that was his thought process. That wasn't God's plan. So, so Abraham realizes in Genesis 16, it's like, you know, I got the son, because God time says, Oh, by the way, by this time next year, Sarah is going to have a child. The promise I told you, you're going to have a son. Well, Abraham laughs. And he's like, he already has a 13 year old kid by a haker who he thought was going to all the blessings. We're going to go through him. And remember last time we talked about the two warring brothers, so you got Ishmael who winds up being basically the father of Islam, because, you know, when you follow his lineage on that, and then you got Isaac, who is the father of the Jewish lineage as it went down through it. It's amazing. It's amazing. It's amazing. And he was thinking he was doing a good thing, but he wasn't. And that's what's that's what I love about the Bible, because Abraham is a central figure. And he is a obviously the father of the faithful. And yet he was a flawed person who made a ton of mistakes. That's one of the reasons I believe the Bible is true, because here's the father of the Arabs coming from Abraham. He, I'm trying to kind of outdo God, help him out a little bit. So Abraham and Hagar, here comes Ishmael, the father of the Arabs. And then here comes Isaac, the father of the Jewish lineage, the seed line of Jesus. When you look at it, you say, how do you dream this stuff up? If it's all a man made thing, how in the world could you come up with that? It's a strong evidence, but it also shows you that God uses families, which is why I told about, you know, the trips that we go. Because it's our, I'm trying my number one goal in life is to make sure I do everything in my power via God's power to get my immediate family, wife and kids headed north, you know, to heaven. And so when you, when you take a trip and that's why a lot of the things we do are hard. And like when we went mountain climbing in Utah and it kind of breaks you down, but you got to come together as family. Because now my kids are getting older. They're all, you know, they've moved across the country. So we come together at least, you know, to do that. But Al, when you mentioned about how despite the flaws, a lot of people, they read the Old Testament. They're like, well, these people were terrible. You know, they, I think of David, you know, and what he did and you see Abraham and the problem with me. But really when you think about it, we're all terrible at some point. That's why he would eventually send Jesus. And that's why he uses this despite, you know, our flaws. It always comes back to that. And all families are different and all roles, you know, change from time to time based on circumstance. But the bottom line was God knows a heart. He knows if your heart is right. And even though we mess up and struggle. And infallible God working with fallible human beings. That's a story of the Bible. Well, and it is. And you're right. You think about it. People look at the Bible and they use talk about Abraham or Sarah or Moses, all these people that we're going to be talking about. And they almost put him in this place of it's holier than, than real people. They become characters. Yeah. A little bit. There's somebody that was writing our story today. Like if God decided he was going to have another revelation, he's just writing about his people. We'd have the same thing. We'd have mistakes. You talked about it with the cell phone deal. I mean, in a family struggling trying to figure out when the Eve one comes in, I mean, that was a godly solution. Isn't it amazing how that God goes to great lengths to show us throughout the ages, beginning way back to here. Genesis, Abraham and all of them. It's amazing that he always shows their flaws. That's right. He always points out their flaws until he himself shows up in flesh. Jesus. And with him, there are no flaws. Right. He speaks. He's the one that started it way back. That's right. And he rolled all the way through history showing the flaws of mankind, but accepting the ones by faith. Counted as righteous. It is interesting. All peoples on earth, he's talking to Abraham, would be blessed through you. All of them. The whole human race. Exactly. You just think about the weight of that on the man's. And when you look at his faith, you say, I'm beginning to see why he was the one chosen. Well, he also said that his descendants would be like, you know, sand on the seashores or stars in the sky. I mean, it would be, you know, countless. That's exactly what happened. What's interesting is the reason he's the father of the faithful is so Sarah gets pregnant. She's 90 years old. Abraham's 99. By the way, when she heard what Abraham said to her, she's over in the tent laughing. She's laughing. He's the way God's your way. You laughing. She said, I wasn't laughing. She laughed. Which he thought it was a joke. It shows the flow in nature. You know what I mean? I don't know. I think it's a shadow of when Jesus would come. If I looked around at Miss Kay when she's 90 and I'm 99, I'm like, we're going to do what? You'd be like, sigh, sigh, sigh, sigh. Hey, boy. That ship has failed. Trust me. It ain't going to happen. I'm just seeing it 73 at 99. I'm like, whoa. So however you look at it on the age thing, the Bible says in Hebrews that his body was as good as dead. Yeah. In hers too. Which is not real good work encouraging words when you get up to 80 and 90. Well, that's what happens. Hey, that ship is sailed. Believe me. It's real. But I do think it was a shot. You know, everything in the Old Testament is a shadow of what Jesus would fulfill. And I do think the difficulty, not impossible, but difficulty of having a child here, which God, with God, all things are possible. Well then when he got to Jesus in the sea line as hell, well, it was just with a virgin. We went from you being 90 and a hundred. Too old to cut the mustard, I get kids out of that. Yeah. Too like, well, that this is impossible. Which I think is a trend that, you know, when it comes down to our everyday lives, no matter what the situation, oh, there's always a way out. Really? Well, this is Zachariah. So, so he has, so they have a son. And so now he's about 13. And so Abraham's like, you know, now he's, you know, 110 years old, 113 years old. And so he's like, all right, well, we did it, guy. We provided the air, you know, all those blessings that are going to come through him. And then God throws him a complete, another curveball. And says, I tell you what, I want you to take your son. Now we're in Genesis 22. And he says, well, doesn't it say you're only, he says your son, then he says your only son as a reminder, you know, this is the only one. So thank you. That's the one you're seeing through whom I'm going to bless all nations. Exactly. And so I'm going to take him and you go over here on the mountain and I'll tell you where to go. Again, he's just this call and he says, I want you to sacrifice him. Now there's been, I've read commentary through the years. People try to say it was, you know, wasn't really going to kill him blah, blah, blah. No, it's, he meant sacrifices. Yeah. Killing on a pile of wood. Well, and a lot of people get offended. People that don't believe when they hear their story, because they're like, this is just absurd. Right. Why would anybody? They underestimated what faith is. Well, and the, you know, he explains it in, in the hall of faith chapter. He was 11, which I, I mean, it makes the hair stand up. It's fantastic. And when I read that, because, you know, in Hebrews 11, he says that he reasoned that God could raise him from the dead. That's right. Just think how hard it is to live in Christian life. And we, we hear the resurrection. See, he's gonna bless all nations through my child. He wants me to kill him. Let's see. Now, oh, I get it. He's going to raise him right away from the dead. Right. He went, where's my knife? Because he's a God where all things are possible. Well, I have two. Even that. I have four sons. Y'all are two of them. I would find it very difficult to take those orders from the almighty to say, take out, stretch them out on the pile of wood there, Phil. Get your knife and kill him. Right. I would have found that very difficult to do. As would most people, which is why he was called in the New Testament, the father of the faithful. I mean, yeah, I mean, that's the organ. The grand, and he did have God talking to him, which I do think affected the situation. It did. You know, if God is not whispering in your ear, but just talking in your ear, audible, if you would say, you know what, I guess, I guess he's going to take care of this. It'd be a little tougher to do through faith, but it would be possible, you know, well, remember, I think it's in Romans four that when Paul says talking about him having the child to begin with at 99, which was also a faith moment against all hope in hope, Abraham believed. So you think about that. That's a, that's a huge phrase against all hope. In other words, it was a hopeless situation. And yet he somehow managed to have hope so much so that he raised the knife up and he's about to kill him. When God says, whoa, whoa, you know, he sends out a sacrifice of an animal and says, here's what I want you to do. So the skeptic would say, well, why go through all this? Why make it so hard? Why? Because that's the way life is. You're always questioning why this is happening. You can't see the direction you're trying to figure it out. And so you have these stories that are inspired by the Holy Spirit and they're real. Not just it's not like we made up a story. This is what happened all of a sudden you start saying, Oh, there's a bigger plan here. I, you know, here I am this finite little being like a speck, you know, on a planet compared to the universe. You know, God's got this. He's in control. I need to be seeking his will and finding how this works in my situation. But when I read stuff like this on what somebody could deduct and reason and then actually do, oh, it's incredible. And it's inspiring because it just seems like my problems aren't that big compared to that. You know, I just did want that there'll be said on a blaze TV about four or five little sessions, but guys like Karl Marx started out as a religious guy, whatever. I don't know what group he was with, but then morphed out into an avowed atheist. One of the questions would be, what would an atheist think if they're sitting here, which I doubt, but you never know. And they heard this story because Karl Marx said the religion is the opium of the people. It's an illusion. It's talking about the heart, he said, in a heartless society. There's no such thing. It's what these people, these religious people are saying. But when you look at the reading and you look at the history and the timeframe and what happened as you followed the faithful from Abraham all the way to Jesus until the present day, if you look at it historically, accurate, archeologically, it's sound, the names, dates, places, they think, you know, they it's just they've proven beyond a doubt, all these places and all these dates are correct. Well, you would think at least it would at least be worth investigating. Yeah, that's right. In my mind. Right. Oh, yeah. And you know, it's really interesting because people, people are hopeless. I mean, there's people watching us on this podcast and they're in a seemingly hopeless situation. Their mindset is, I don't know how to like Jay said, I don't know how to get past where I'm at right now. And so the reason we're talking about this thing, about how cold and dead, if you just if you had no belief and no chance for anything beyond whatever your problem is, that's a pretty that's a pretty way to get the charge. We get the charge all the time. So y'all, if we're atheists, you hate us. We're like, let me tell you about a guy Abraham over in the Old Testament. And we tell him this story, you say, Oh, no, we don't hate you at all. We're just saying investigate this. Yeah. And that's why you tell the stories and look, is it is it possible? Right. Is it possible? Well, let's see. But that's why we're practical dad, because like, at least I wrote our book, we've written several, but we are very open about our lives. And I mean, we had some bad stuff in there, some very hopeless situations where it's just, you didn't think the marriage is going to survive all this. And I was doing a, I was doing a radio show on time when a guy said, why, why would you of course, you know, the show is going and people like our family. And he was like, why would you tell all this bad stuff about your wife? How would you talk about your mistakes? Yeah. Why would you? Because he hears what he says is, because people love you guys. I mean, but they're going to read this and it's like these guys are terrible. And I just remember that moment I looked at them and I said, well, they're saying they're sinners. That's right. I said, I said, people are hopeless. And if they read our story and think they made it, they got passed all that, then it provides a chance for somebody else to do something. So, you know, it's the old power of the testimony. So that's, so all we're reading about with people like Abraham and others are the testimony of what they've done, or, you know, in their lives, which brings us something else I want to bring up to you guys. Abraham is another interesting thing in the New Testament. So Paul spends Romans four talking about Abraham and faith and how it impacts. Because remember, you know, Paul's come along, you know, which we'll get into this later, but when the law shows up with Moses, things change, you know, for the people of God. And so then it kind of becomes this, you know, situation law versus faith and works versus faith. And so that's going to be like the Jewish narrative. So Jesus shows up on the scene. And he spends most of his time trying to get him out of this works mentality. So Paul spends a lot of time in Romans talking about the power of faith and he uses Abraham as his illustration. But then James comes along and he writes an interesting little piece about was not just your faith. I mean, it's what you do. So your faith and your action is working together. Right. And his faith and his Abraham has his faith was based on what he did. Meaning, which it seems action, it seems contradictory. Just value. Right. Which is why I want to bring it up because in this little more in the weeds of church and all that, but there is sometimes this thing about it's either faith only or law only or works only. Yeah. And so people want to just take one or the other. And it's just, I guess it's human nature, you know, for people to look at it that way. But basically the New Testament uses Abraham as the example to say, faith is what you believe, but also faith is what you do. One of the greatest texts in the Bible is when they questioned Jesus and he said, Oh, I didn't come to abolish the law. I came to fulfill it. I mean, and I'm going to show you what perfect love can accomplish. You will keep the entire thing. Right. And fortunately for the human race, he was the only one that actually kept it. And fortunately for the human race, because he kept it, our faith in him will save us. It's counted. We're counted as righteous. It's like Abraham, you know, it's pretty interesting over in Hebrews. I think it's Hebrews 11 mile. Abraham with all the faith that he had, you say, well, at the time it was counted as righteous, but check this out. Where is it for? It says, none of them received what was promised. So that's the last verse in Hebrews 11. Yeah, in Hebrews 11. Yeah. They were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised because at the time God had not become flesh yet died on a cross with very and raised. So that was so great. Yeah. So God had planned something better for us, the arrival of Jesus and his death for the sins of the world, his resurrection, him keeping the law perfectly, our trust and faith in him so that only together with us would they be made perfect. So God went way back in time when the blood of Jesus was spilled and it went back to when Abraham and Noah and all of them coming through the book of Genesis, you say that blood went all the way back. That's why he said in the next verse, I mean chapter 12, you know, man put those chapter breaks in there, but he then said, so we're surrounded by these witnesses, all these halls of faith. And then let us fix our eyes on Jesus. Well, he's the one that brought us all together, present past. Amazing. Past, present future, all under that umbrella of grace. And what I wanted to say in response to that, I think in the religious world, people, they try to look at it like a college course, you know, I'm going to go believe right, you know, dot all the eyes and cross all the teas. And then I, then that's it. I go out there and live wherever I want to. But I think in our case, Jesus brought that grace, which motivates us to have that faith and the resurrection, kind of like Abraham, you know, Abraham did. Because this was almost 1900 or so, almost when this went down in the Abraham story, that was almost 2000 years before Jesus showed up. So when you look the way God looks at time, you think, man, but a focus on grace and the resurrection, then, I mean, when that produces that faith and that belief, well, then you can't help. It's not like, oh, I need to go do it. I mean, if you're looking around at the scenes, I need to do this. I missed it. You just can't help it. It's like to me, when people see see that, that debate about faith versus deeds, it just doesn't happen that way. Like in a room taking a college course, I need to do these 14 things and then I'll be, you know, say it doesn't work. Just like when Jesus said, you know, the kingdom is like a guy that finds a treasure, you know, in a field, then he goes and sells everything, he has and buys the field. I mean, it's just like a radical, well, that's crazy. You know, you found one. Everything you could imagine that you have to do, Jesus said, let me make it simple for you. Do two things. Love God and love your neighbor and everything will be all right. Yeah. So I think that's not asking too much of us. You focus more on the experience of it as far as understanding, you know, getting to know this who Jesus is and what he did and the whole scheme of redemption. And then all of a sudden, you know, you, you kind of start falling in love with him and you start believing. And when you start focusing on that, these things start happening because you can't help it. I mean, it's like me. I've shared many times. Y'all know my story. And I was real shy when I was young. It's just at some point I got to this point where I'm like, you know what? I'm just not going to be shy anymore. But it was all based on grace. You know, in my faith in that, I just made that decision. Now I'm just going to go out there and do this. It wasn't like, Oh, I'm going to do this. So I'll get some points or I'll feel better. It's like, I just can't help it. You got to, you got to hear about this. God raised you up, Jason. All of us. And at some point he said, now go. And here's the thing. Here we go. It's the way all have those. We're here and it's available for everybody. What I love about the Bible and specifically when James was talking about Abraham, tells credit to him as righteousness, this idea that he believed, like you said, going forward. And then he says in the in verse 25, in the same way was not even Rahab, the prostitute considered righteous because she believed. This is the woman that lived 400 years after Abraham. Yeah. She was a famous person in the Bible because she was in the lineage. She was a whore. She was a whore. And he, so think about this. Now he's writing this to a primarily Jewish audience. He brings up Abraham, the father of the faithful and Rahab in the same sentence about being righteous before God. That's the beauty of the Bible. And that's, that's what that's, it's available for anybody. And that's what's crazy. That's what I love about, you know, the church where, you know, that, Hey, the guy that drove up to Arkansas and shared Jesus with you at a bar. I mean, that's pretty radical faith. I mean, I'd have probably said, no, you have hoars and then you had whore mongers. Yeah. You say you and that crowd. Yeah. Who would have thought God would have smiled on me. Yeah. Let's go get in a vehicle and share Jesus. But one of the things we do at our church, they've always done. Nobody said this is what we do. It just happens is when they have, I guess what you would call the altar call or whatever, people actually share specifically, sometimes graphically, which is embarrassing sometimes, but they'll go down. They feel like it's a safe place that they can share their problems and nobody's going to throw rocks at them and nobody, you know, they're wanting to get out of this and they hear about Jesus and they come down and they're like, I had this problem and we're, you know, we put our arms around them and we're like, you know, such a part of our culture. That's the way we grew up. That's in our church being that way. Recently there was a older couple and 68 years old, you're talking about getting past prime and he had an affair, just a crazy situation that he found himself in, the evil one got him, you know, Facebook. You know, we talked about social media, old girlfriend. This is the guy that's spent most of his life leading other people and Satan got him and they come forward. So at least not go in. They call us. We go. We have a two hour conversation on late on the Saturday night next day, Sunday morning, they're down front with that before. And he didn't have a note or anything. And so I just, I told it, of course afterwards, he was a little shook. He was like, you just told it. I was like, yeah, that's, that's what I thought you wanted me to. He's the way I did, but it just, it sounded so shocking to hear it set out loud. What he did. And I said, and I told him, I said, well, brother, the only way you're going to get past it is to shine a lighter truth on it. Otherwise you'll be right back in the situation. Interesting thing about Christianity and salvation and redemption. When you know all your sins have been forgiven, you don't mind telling anyone on the front end, all your sins. That's right. When you know they're forgiven, you don't mind discussing them. That's right. You're old. But for the unredeemed and the ones who have nothing put their faith in Jesus, it's like prying it out of them with a crowbar. That's right. Yeah, they're passing. That's right. I know. Pretty amazing. Yeah. I know I read this before, but you know, right after John 3 16 for God's to love the world, you know, he got down and he said that in verse 19, this is the verdict. Light is coming to the world, but men love darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. Yep. Everyone who does evil hates the light. We'll not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. It's best to give him the dirt on the front end. I think that's what people and even churches, they want to set themselves up as perfect and we got everything figured out. I bet you would drunk back in your pants. I said, guilty is charged. I bet you were tomorrow. Guilt is charged. I bet you told lies guilty is charged. You say, that's why I follow Jesus, man. That's right. Well, in 21, which is what I want to read, which is why we do share, because a lot of people that bothers people when they come to their charts, they're like, why are they sharing their inner most secrets? This is, this is awkward. Which it is awkward. And because we're saying, look, this is verse 21 says what it's about, but whoever lives by the truth, Jesus comes into the light so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God. And that's what's awesome. What you saw in Abraham was God working in his life, his power, even saw the signs of the resurrection there and the impossible. But it's no different than what he does in every person's life that puts their faith in it. That's right. You see God's transformational process. So people say, why are you sharing that? You're like, because I'm showing you what God can do. This will work. No doubt about it. Yeah. It's the strongest evidence. You want to talk about evidence that there's a God, the transformation of people. That is right. That is right. The Ephesians to let around by the dark powers of the world. That's what Karl Marx never saw. Grace Givers. John never saw and wrote it best in one verse, one of my favorite verse in the Bible, Revelation 12 11. They overcame the evil one by the blood of the lamb, by the word of their testimony, transformation, and also that they did not love this life so much that they would shrink back even from death itself. That's right. That's that boldness you're talking about. So if you live those three, trust in Christ, tell exactly what he's doing in my life. And then live it boldly that I wouldn't back away even if somebody says, I'm going to kill you. It's time. We believe in the resurrection. You can kill me. Yeah. I'll be back. We need this powerful. Yeah. It's according to Karl Marx. It's as powerful as the most powerful drug. It's an opium of the people. I'm like, you're on the summer car. You're almost, you're almost there. Hot. We're hot. We're how God can't get off of it. There you go. All right. Well, I think we've we've exhausted our Abraham discussion, but man, that's just sort of the beginning. And so what the rest of the Old Testament is basically following the journey of Abraham's seed line, which is going to finally come to fruition in Christ. Yeah. And so we're going to hit some of those highlights as we go through because there's a very interesting stories just like Abraham's of people that were in the situation where it looks like the line ends here, hopeless. And yet God's going to do amazing things throughout this history of Israel. So we're going to talk about the law and when that comes in and what that means to us, this kind of idea of law versus spirit as well as we go along in our study. So man, we're glad you guys are along the journey with us as we just kind of tell it like it is. If you have a better story, this is me to our audience. If you have a better story, what is it? What's your story? We have ours. I'm looking at the story and I'm thinking, if this is true, there's life beyond the grave and immortality. If it's not true, we're done. I'll our listeners, us and everybody on planet Earth that's ever been here, we're done. I just I'd rather go with Jesus and hope. You want to sing an invitation, Tom? If I could sing, I would. I can't care to in a bucket. So I can't eat the release famous for it. So we're so glad you guys were with us today.
