    "text": " Good morning and welcome to Rising. I'm very excited about today's show and I'm very excited to have Brianna Joy Gray back with me today. Hello Brianna. Always good to be back in the chair next to you Ravi. So what's going on today? Well, first up we have a Tesla and Figaro and Ena Stepman back with us. We'll discuss new polling showing a dramatic shift among independent voters. Plus we'll get into all the standout moments from last night's Florida governor's debate. But first the Washington Post reports that a group of 30 Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill are now calling on President Biden to abandon strategy on the war in Ukraine and instead pursue direct negotiations with Russia. In a letter said to the White House and obtained by the post, the lawmakers write, quote, given the destruction created by this war for Ukraine and the world as well as the risk of catastrophic escalation. We also believe it is in the interests of Ukraine, the United States and the world to avoid a prolonged conflict. For this reason, we urge you to pair the military and economic support the United States has provided to Ukraine with a proactive diplomatic push, redoubling efforts to seek a realistic framework for a ceasefire led by congressional progressive caucus chairwoman, Pramilla Jayapal. Other signers of the letter include Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Corey Bush, Ryo Khanna and other progressives. So this was pretty exciting. I mean, credit where credit is due. I read the letter. I agree with it. It's what I've been hoping. Liberal progressive Democrats who are not on board with a kind of hawkish foreign policy, I've been waiting for them to do something just like this. Some of their Republican counterparts have in fact signaled that they would like to, that there's not going to be a blank check. It's not going to be what the Biden administration has said, which is unlimited support no matter what forever. Yeah. So it's Kevin McCarthy who told Punchbowl News that I think people are going to be sitting in a recession and they're not going to write a blank check to Ukraine if Republicans come into power. And I think that that's obviously true. They're reading the tea leaves and with Democrats, absolutely are not. And what's in this letter is the lowest possible bar. Yeah. They're not saying pull back a pullback, you know, weapons, sending weapons over there. All they're saying is, can you please pair the relief that we're sending to Ukraine with a diplomatic push, which is contrary to what we had learned about the NATO's efforts to basically discourage any kind of direct negotiation with Russia earlier this year. Now, given how moderate that letter is, you would think it was a non issue, a non news story, a total blip, right? But no, but no. But no, this is this is from the founder of the Daily Close, a liberal online magazine. He tweeted this by Rashida Tlaib, Ro Khanna and other progressives is unbelievably naive and stupid, asking for diplomacy with a murderous terrorist regime, literally raping and pillaging through Ukraine. Biden tried diplomacy to prevent the war, only overwhelming force will now end it. That's overwhelming force. Well, not ended. It will not I mean, overwhelming force would be nuclear force. What are you talking about? That's the liberals for you right now. It's yeah. So, so in the there's a Washington Post article, it's a write up of this letter and then is, you know, checking in with other Democrats, administration spokespeople for how they feel about it. And yeah, those people are like, no, hard no to this letter. We are giving the aid and we are not, we are not going to, they are advocating the US should not have any kind of push on Ukraine to negotiate with Russia and should not negotiate with Russia itself. We are giving unlimited aid, according to the Biden administration, until such time as Zelensky himself personally signals that it is time for there to be negotiations with Russia. That's crazy. It's just crazy. It is. And yet. And yet here we are. Yeah. The letter represents the biggest challenge to President Biden's Ukraine strategy from within his own party, yet by no means are all Democratic lawmakers on board, as we just indicated. Senator Chris Murphy said there is moral and strategic peril in sitting down with Putin too early. It risks legitimizing his crimes, handing over parts of Ukraine to Russia in an agreement that Putin won't even honor. Sometimes a bully must be shown the limits of his power before diplomacy can work. And then a White House spokesperson told reporters yesterday, quote, we're not going to have conversations with the Russian leadership without the Ukrainians being present. Bring them. Bring everybody to party. I'm just saying, just include the Ukrainians by all means include them. But our, our fight, our money, our support does not have to be no strings attached. There's no like principle that says we must give Ukraine everything it wants without putting any stipulations on it. But that's, that's insane. Yeah. Every war ends via diplomacy at some point. And to be asking for diplomacy just to be on the table and to get this kind of pushback from the wing of politics in this country historically that has been the anti-war party. You know, if you don't want people, I'm sorry. If you don't want people bringing up Tulsi Gabbard or bringing up conservatives as the vanguard of the anti-war movement in the United States, because you think their positions have been inconsistent, then you have to have a position at all and not immediately back down. Because in fact, the response to this was so striking that Congresswoman Jayapal released this clarifying statement on Twitter last night, where she added diplomacy is an important tool that can save lives. But it is just one tool, as we also made explicitly clear in our letter and will continue to make clear, we support President Biden and his administration's commitment to nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. I mean, if it was so clear in your initial statement, which it was, because it was the most even tempered, reasonable, moderate statement in the world, you shouldn't need a clarifying statement. And the fact that you do really speaks to how off-kilter the anti-war movement is on the left. And I just don't understand this whole idea that, well, we can't let up the pain and the punishment we're visiting upon Russia. It's the Ukrainians who are doing that, and they are dying as well. They are suffering. It is not anti-Ukraine or inhumane toward Ukraine to want a push for diplomacy. That should just be set aside. In fact, it is in Ukraine's own interest, in the interest at least of the people who are fighting and dying in this war to bring it to an end. Remember, in the spring, back in early May, there was a reporting, I'm reading now from article in Common Dreams, that Boris Johnson pressured Zelensky to ditch peace talks with Russia. So there was a point in time where obviously Zelensky also felt like negotiations were apparent about importance. But this is the situation we're in now. We are... I guess Boris Johnson gets that it's okay to put some, to put some, work some leverage on Zelensky to get him to do what he wants. That was just the wrong thing to do. Right. Right. Our interests are different than Ukraine's in some ways. And so far as that, we want to weaken Russia. If our goal is some version of regime change, Americans aren't the ones that are dying in the context of this conflict. So what can look like aid that extends the conflict ultimately could just be extending the number or growing rather than the number of lives lost in damage that's caused before an end that is unlikely to end without some concessions from both parties, because that's the nature of negotiation. I would also suggest that Pramila Jayapal and the other people who signed this letter perhaps can read the tea leaves a little bit better than the Biden administration or more mainstream Democrats in that we're going... the election is just a few days. Republicans now set up to do better than we were expected a few weeks ago in part because of the dire economic situation and energy prices which are fueled by this war. And so perhaps, of course, they don't say it in that letter, but maybe they are thinking in the best... putting the best interests of the party in terms of its electoral prospects in a way that Biden himself is not. Yeah. Or maybe some of the... and I should say maybe some of those protests, like the ones we saw at ASU's Town Hall last week actually worked. Interesting. All right. I'll tell you what's on my radar coming up. Stay with us. What is on your radar today, Robbie? Well, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are likely to add the COVID-19 vaccine to the immunization schedule for children and adolescents. As we discussed on the show yesterday, an advisory panel has voted unanimously to recommend the COVID-19 vaccines for all Americans ages six months and older, and the full agency is almost certain to sign off on this decision. We don't expect any push back there. Now, such a move would not automatically make the vaccines mandatory for children. In theory, CDC guidance is optional. In theory, in practice, many municipalities will be inclined to require whatever the CDC recommends. We know that during the pandemic cities and states controlled by democratic political figures, frequently rubber-stamped federal health officials extremely cautious coronavirus recommendations relating to masks, social distancing, lockdowns, etc. Blue municipalities took their cues from their local health departments, which in turn copied the CDC's guidance wholesale into formal policy. When frustrated, caution-weary constituents would ask their local officials about timelines for getting rid of mass mandates and reopening schools. Their answer was usually something like when the CDC says so. That's when we'll do it. Okay, this means that adding the COVID-19 vaccine to the childhood immunization schedule will create a tremendous incentive for blue states to require it for public school children. And look, this would be a profound mistake. There's no way around it. In general, the rationale for vaccine mandates is public health. Public school children are required to get vaccinated for measles, for instance, in order to prevent the spread of measles to other more vulnerable individuals. This same logic, unfortunately, does not hold for the COVID-19 vaccines, which have largely failed to prevent the spread of infection, particularly for the COVID-19 variants. The vaccines do a tremendous job of preventing elderly and at-risk people from suffering severe illness and dying. But most children are, fortunately, spared the worst effects of COVID-19 anyway, particularly if they were already infected, which is now the case for nearly nine out of every 10 kids according to the CDC. Some European countries have looked at the data, the same data, and determined that, well, there isn't enough net benefit to merit childhood vaccination. Denmark, for instance, is no longer recommending COVID-19 vaccines for otherwise healthy young people under the age of 18. This is not because Denmark's government was overtaken by right-wing anti-vaxxers, but rather because there are reasonable arguments both for and against the policy, thus leaving the matter to individual families and their doctors is the best thing to do. Indeed, even in the U.S., less than 40 percent of kids under the age of 11 have received the vaccine. Most parents have evidently decided that this course of action is not strictly necessary for their children. And look, there's nothing wrong with that. Requiring children to get the COVID-19 vaccine could, on the other hand, create several problems. Parents who are disinclined to give their children the COVID-19 vaccine might start to wonder whether the other vaccines on the childhood immunization schedule are similarly unnecessary, which could have dire results for public health in terms of measles and other things. Unvaccinated children might simply end up dropping out of school, having forced out of school, which would worsen the pandemic-driven crisis of learning loss. Low-income students and students of color will be hardest hit, attempts by Washington, D.C. to require public school children to get jab were delayed after became clear that a disproportionate number of unvaccinated black and brown young people would be banned from school under just such a policy. If, quote, if mandates become the norm, unvaccinated children will be displaced to virtual school, homeschool, or perhaps no school at all. Rights Vinay Prasad, a health researcher and professor of epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco. We've had him on the show before. He's probably familiar to much of the audience. He says the harm to kids from substandard education after nearly two years of disruption far exceeds any gains from compliance. Some states have already signaled that they will not require the COVID-19 vaccine of school children, even if the CDC does schedule it. Quote states determine their own immunization schedule and Tennessee's will not be changing. A spokesperson for Tennessee's governor told the press, given the reality of COVID-19 that most children already have some protection from it and getting vaccinated does not substantially prevent outbreaks of it. Well, that's just the right move. Let individual families talk to their doctors about vaccinating their children, make the decision on a case by case basis. The government does not have a legitimate rationale for butting in. And if it does so, you're going to end up with a lot of kids kept out of school and it's going to make the crisis we're going through in terms of reading scores, math scores. There was new data on that yesterday that we discussed a little bit on the show. It's going to get worse. Don't do it. So I think this is a big concern. The more I've looked into this, the more it seems to me quite likely that this will be not because the CDC adding this to the schedule defacto causes a mandate, but because I suspect it will in practice result in a lot of mandates. And I am deeply, I'm very concerned about that. I think it's hard to say that it seems very clear to me that the effects of that will be worse. Yeah, I mean, it'll be interesting to see obviously we can't predict, but I am struck by the fact that so many blue states like New York seem to have gone above and beyond much to the Sigrin as many, you know, some doctors, medical practitioners, public health experts to say it's absolutely okay not to mask, you know, you remember the Bruha Ha over the signs that Cathy Holtz will put up in the subway that said like this, this, or this are all fine ways to wear a mask, you know, implying that it's okay, you know, it's a public, a good public health choice not to wear one as opposed to just staying neutral and out of it. So it does seem to me that it might be the case that even the blue states recognize that this is like a losing political issue and have backed off of even just blindly following the CDC's recommendations. So it'll be interesting to see, but what I'm curious about is substantively if this, if the recommendations of the advice is largely tethered to whether or not the idea that kids who have already had COVID, which is the majority of kids, have antibodies that offer them some degree of protection that makes the shots moot, the vaccines moot, how long do we know that these antibodies are going to last and does that mean that eventually people are going to get, need to give another shot or this or this, just this expectation they're going to get re-infected. And if the expectation is that everyone just serially gets re-infected or serially gets shots either way, when are we going to get better data about what the effects of those two different outcomes are relative to each other because that should determine what the public policy response is. Right, but that's not in the current, with the advisory panel, right, considered has nothing to do. It didn't consider, it wasn't considering one versus the other, it was just saying there should be, you know, if you're older than six months, you should get the vaccine and then you should get a booster. And I don't know that it goes much beyond that. And I mean, the other question, and this is what I talked to with Dr. Prasad when he came on on my podcast, you know, he also made the argument about antibodies offering protection. And when I asked him about what happens when the antibodies were off, he said, well, we don't really know when that happens. And we'll know when we start to see another spike in hospitalizations and deaths. And at that point, we can reevaluate, which again, doesn't sound so great if you're the person who's dying or hospitalized, sure, as the test case. But I appreciate that response. But the other aspect of it is how much do you wait long COVID? How much is long COVID going to be a concern? And does it matter if the vaccines also aren't proven to limit or to reduce the incidence of long COVID? Those are the kind of questions that need to be asked by these medical practitioners before they can really, I think, credibly impose vaccine mandates on kids. Well, credibly put it alongside vaccines that are really important to get for public health reasons. And I worry they'll erode confidence. And now it's just, they're polluting that list almost by adding something that they don't have as much data on to suggest it's absolutely necessary for this age group over time. We just don't know yet, as you said. But we do know those other things are really important to get. You should absolutely get them. And they serve a public health benefit, not just a because they do limit the spread of those diseases. And now I, there might be, some people might take a second look at that. That'd be very bad if they did. But that's what I'm worried about. We'll have more rising right after this. Stay with us. German sportswear giant Adidas has cut all business ties with Kanye West after he made a series of anti-Semitic remarks. Yay's recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful and dangerous. And they violate the company's values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness, Adidas said. The company says they will immediately halt the production of Yeezy products and stop paying the rapper and his companies. I know you have some thoughts about this, Brianna. You were doing some interesting Googling as we were preparing for this segment. I was. Because look, I do think I obviously strongly criticize what Kanye said substantively. There's not really any daily dialing to be done about the nature of Kanye West comments. I haven't. No one has defended them except Candace Owens. Yeah. And frankly, some other conservatives have been asked to condemn the remarks and they have basically sidestepped away from the question. People are still continuing to put out supportive tweets about Kanye West from that are very much on the conservative side of the aisle, not that that condemns all Republicans. But I have an interest in other conversation that started to happen largely in some black spaces where there is concern about whether or not Kanye West is being treated differently than other people who've been in similar situations. So I think the first red flag for a lot of folks was JP Morgan's choice to no longer bank with Kanye West, which seems like a escalation of the sort that we've never seen despite having gone through an entire Me Too scandal with any number of extremely wealthy high profile people who have been brought to their knees. I've never heard of a bank saying we're not going to do business with you. Banks are considered to be sort of like a take in the train or an airplane. You don't expect that you're right to to transact. I don't know about that. We start. I mean, I agree with you. This is a troubling thing to start happening. Institutions like banks that are kind of thought to be. How much carriers? Right, exactly. But no, we saw that a little bit with, no, okay, not specifically with banks, but with financial services, for parlor and also for the truckers and for certain fundraisers and things. Yeah, but that's shutting down. I'm not saying that was right. I also think that that was a problem. But that's shutting down accounts as opposed to saying that you're not allowed to bank with this institution anymore. That's shutting down your ability to pay for send money to certain movements and things like that. It's a little different. I mean, people, you have to bank being unbanked from a progressive perspective and obviously Kanye is small as violent. He's certainly not hurting for funds or resources. But from a progressive perspective, people can't have when you can't access loans, when you can't put your money into a safe place, when you can't, you know, if so many places are cardless and don't accept cash, it's a real kind of kind of similarities issue to be unbanked. Far right figures have been shut out of PayPal type things, maybe not banks, but possibly banks. Jay B. Ireland. By that I mean, Richard Spencer and like explicitly. My point here is not to say that it's fine when that happens. No, I know you're saying that. This feels like an escalation of the sort that I think that people should be troubled by. So this Adidas contract, I think, is interesting for similar reasons. And so, you know, is this something that is kind of par for the course for this kind of company? Now, I do think that we have a longer history of apparel, clothing manufacturers, things like that, just sending themselves from bad actors. But well, and also certainly associating themselves with people who had various points have been bad actors, probably. I mean, for sure. But here's the question. Some people have chosen this moment to look at how Mel Gibson was treated after his anti-Semitic comments as a point of comparison. And just as a reminder, Mel Gibson was accused of doing many things. He has repeatedly apparently referred to Jewish people as oven Dodgers asking Winona writer at a party where not she was quote unquote, unquote, oven Dodger, obviously really horrific reference to the Holocaust and gas chambers. And he was famously pulled over by the LA County Sheriff's Department in July of 2006. He drunk, said to the officer, Apropos of nothing, athing Jews. He did not bleep out the effing, obviously, the Jews are responsible for all the rules were wars in the world before asking the officer, are you Jew? He's also not meant to words about black people. You know, there was that recording that he had when he was in that abusive relationship with his previous partner. And he told her if you get raped by a pack of inwards, again, he did not say inwards, it'll be your faults, you know, those kinds of statements. And even after he made those statements, he wasn't dropped by his talent agency, a little way that Kanye West has now been dropped by CAA. In fact, he joined CAA after those kind of remarks were made. So the question is, is that that Kanye is just too big a star or are there other factors going on here? But a lot of that, it wasn't a lot of the Mel Gibson stuff that was many years ago. My guess is if that happened today, it would result in dropping of everything. I mean, there's greater, there's greater sensitivity to that kind of stuff. There's more intolerance of that kind of stuff in the corporate world, in everything. I don't know, you're trying to put it. Maybe it's a discrepancy. Maybe it's not, but I think today he would suffer those things. It is the direction. I mean, is this direction that people should be moving in? Is the critique that Kanye, you know, Mel Gibson should have been held to a higher standard then, and perhaps should still be held to a higher standard now as his career has largely rebounded? Or is it that banks and these kind of organizations just stay out of these kind of cultural wars? I do have a sort of, you know, you can appreciate the art while thinking the artist is reprehensible kind of attitude. I think you can have that attitude for Kanye. I think you could still enjoy his music. You're free to do so. I probably wish he would just focus on creating more of it. Similarly, Mel Gibson is obviously repulsive. I don't care for him as an actor. I love his film Apocalypse Doze, one of my favorite movies of all time, as I've said. I think it's fantastic. I think it should be able to separate these things from a creative standpoint. And then, yeah, I think it's right to be troubled by, the Adidas contrast kind of a different thing. He's a spokesperson. He's a brand ambassador for it. Kanye is, you can understand them wanting to part with someone who is now several times gone out of his way. This isn't a, ooh, I screwed up. I said something. I shouldn't have it. I'm sorry. He's continuing this. For sure. That's different than the financial institution, which doesn't really have a message or expressing an editorial view or something. Yes, Amtrac, I'm not going to let Cutie take the train because he's anti-semitated. Although people often bring up the Amtrak thing, it is, Amtrac does throw off like aggressive passengers. If you don't follow the rules of Amtrak, you get thrown off. I know because I wasn't super happy about the mask rules. Oh, gracious. Speak your own experience. Before you roll your eyes at me. No, I've never been thrown off of Amtrak, etc. That was someone else. As of this recording, yay has not yet responded to the Adidas decision. We'll continue to report on any more developments, more rising after this. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and his Democratic challenger, Charlie Christ, met for the only debate of the Florida governor's race last night. Chris Pester DeSantis on his presidential ambitions. Let's take a listen. And let me remind the viewers, he wouldn't even answer you if he would stay four years if you re-elect him as your governor. You're running for governor. You're asking them to vote for you for governor. At a minimum, you ought to be able to tell him if you get re-elected, you'll serve as governor. Ron. While DeSantis refused to directly answer the question, he used the question to take a jab at his opponent. Well, listen, I know that Charlie's interested in talking about 2024 in Joe Biden, but I just want to make things very, very clear. The only worn out old donkey I'm looking to put out to Pester is Charlie Christ. Christen DeSantis also traded jabs on a number of issues. Let's listen to some more of that. You have people that are teaching, and actually his running mate has said this in the past, that teaching the United States was built on stolen land. That is inappropriate for our schools. It's not true. And I'm happy that we're going to be able to have accurate history, and we're going to make sure that we honor those who have sacrificed so that we can be free. There's an old expression, Ron. Those who don't know history may be condemned to repeat it. Usually people use that in reference to the Holocaust. It could just as easily be referenced to slavery in our country. It happened. It's a fact. We shouldn't have a whitewash approach to educating our children. He said you need to force people to shelter in their own homes. That would have destroyed the state of Florida. That would have caused our tourism industry to go into the toilet. It would have locked out millions of kids from school. I rejected Charlie Chris Lockdown letter. I kept the state open and I kept the state free. You're the only governor in the history of Florida that's ever shut down our schools. You're the only governor in the history of Florida that shut down our businesses. I never did that as governor. You're the one who's the shut down guy. We need to have somebody who is at the helm that understands it's important to listen to science, to do what's right, utilize common sense. You don't just shut down at the outset and then when it's politically convenient for you, you want to open back up the store political call. I just think we're better when everybody counts. I understand not everyone's going to be born in perfect circumstances, but I would like to see everybody have a shot. I'm proud of the 15 weeks that we did. I know Charlie Chris opposes that even though the baby is fully formed, has a heartbeat can feel pain and can suck their tongue. I don't want to be in abortion. I want to make sure we keep a woman's right to choose available to the women of the state of Florida. And I want to make sure that we don't have a governor in the future who wouldn't even allow exceptions for rape or incest. Meanwhile, a new ABC News Ipsos poll found that 72% of Republicans support DeSantis and say he should have a quote, good deal of influence in the future direction of the GOP, while only 64% said the same about Trump, which is very interesting. Joining us now to discuss is state Capitol reporter for WFLA in Florida. Libby Dean, welcome Libby. Thanks for having me. Good morning. Yes, thanks for joining us. So I know you were covering this debate. What were your takeaways? I mean, as you can see from those clips, the takeaways and the jabs were there as they always are in these kinds of debates. But the main takeaways are the presidential run. I think that that is the most clippable moment from the debate that people are going to see the most of. But also, I mean, they touched on several hot topics of abortion, LGBTQ rights, and several controversial things that DeSantis has talked about for the last four years of his gubernatorial reign. Do voters, do you think have the sense that they really are, if they're picking DeSantis, they're picking him for two years because he is absolutely going to run? I thought it was interesting that Charlie Chris pointed that out because I do expect that he will run. Is that on people's minds as they're making this choice? The thing is when I talk to live, because I interview a lot of state lawmakers here, and I ask that question, you know, do you think that that is going to make a difference when people really head out to the polls? And most of them say no, you know, this, they're going to vote party based and stick with their party lines here. And that's, that's what we're seeing with a lot of the polls that are coming out that that's not going to change. And then also, if it were to change, it would just be him running in 2024. And then we have the lieutenant governor lined up for that position. So I think it'll be interesting to see more news comes out about her policies and what kind of gubernatorial, what kind of governor she would be. Yeah, I can't see that mattering at all. That might be the kind of conversation we want to have in a primary. But I'm the one that's going to be here for four years and we're just using this as a launching pad for a broader political career. But I can't imagine a single person saying, oh, he's only going to be around for two years. Let me take a Democrat instead. You know, it was interesting from listening to the clips and trying to judge the audience, you know, judge something, glean something from the audience reaction, is that it felt like the Santis was on a really strong ground when he was talking about COVID and lockdowns. There was an interesting kind of pushback from the room when he hit on some, some other subject. It sounded like he really walked into something that he didn't need to walk into claiming that, you know, it's, it's wrong to acknowledge that the United States was, is on stolen ground. So that's factually untrue. I mean, you can have an opinion about whether or not you should start meetings in classrooms or organizations with an acknowledged, a land acknowledgement. You can think that that's, you know, cringe or not how you would want to use your time. But saying that as a factual matter, the United States, I guess, just was here empty when, when Europeans arrived seems like a weird way to defend your way of teaching history in the classroom. How, how do you think that that, that exchange came off in Florida? You know, that exchange, and there's been several instances where the Santis makes these kinds of claims that obviously are capable, like I was saying. But the difference here is we had Chris coming back and being able to kind of, you know, debate him. And that was something that was new, because usually it's just a Santis at press conferences, like kind of talking to the crowd and saying, here's what, here's what I'm saying. There's not this response. When we saw the response from Chris here. And when it comes to the response of the crowd, it was very loud and somewhat distracting, some of the things. Do we know anything about the crowd composition? Because I know, for example, when like Bernie Sanders said, as Fox News Town Hall, where people were very receptive to Medicare for all their accusations that he had stacked the crowd, which wasn't actually true. And there, there's sometimes a sense of whether one side or the other has managed to get kind of like a louder cheering section. Do you think the kind of feedback that we're hearing in the room was reflective of what's going on in the state? Or do you think it was rigged there at all? I don't necessarily think it was rigged. I mean, obviously, there's going to be some kind of imbalance there. But it was interesting because each issue that they would switch between, it was the same kind of like, booze or ahs from the crowds. It wasn't necessarily just one candidate that was getting that kind of feedback. And I think the loudest they got, though, is on that abortion topic, which would obviously be coming from Chris's side of the crowd. There's been lots of reporting in the media that suggests to Santas consciously models the way he talks, the way he debates after Donald Trump in a sort of move to, I have the same kind of support among right-wing people that Trump has. I think this debate is most interesting in that, like I obviously expect to say, just will win the gubernatorial race. And then I expect him to seek national offices. So it's interesting, maybe because you're right, he doesn't do a lot of debates. Interesting to see how he would handle someone like Joe Biden or maybe someone like Donald Trump, even before he gets to a Joe Biden. What was he like from a command-the-room kind of debate perspective? Is there truth to him modeling himself after a Trump? I would say that he definitely has a different style, but I was actually watching his debate that he did four years ago when he ran for governor. And that race was close. And his style changed a lot. And I could see that being modeled after Trump, but I think that might just be also some that's kind of the Republican rhetoric sometimes is to be combated. But we also saw that from Charlie Crist, which was interesting because Charlie Crist is very, he's just a well-season politician who has been through three of these gubernatorial debates already. As a Republican previously. And we even had someone that I was speaking with who was an analyst last night, he would debated Charlie Crist in the past and he was saying, you know, he's good at this, he's practiced this, he's a well-oiled machine when it comes to these debates. And I think just Sanchez was offering sometimes, but I wouldn't say necessarily that he took exactly the rhetoric that Trump did say when he debated Hillary. Yeah. To see them on the stage at the same time. Yeah, it should be really interesting, especially I'm curious to see how to Sandis's response to the abortion question plays because again, he didn't actually answer the fundamental question that I think is on a lot of voters minds, which is, are you going to support a ban on abortion instead pivoting to this argument that a 15-week gold fetus is fully formed, which is obviously not true. Well, doesn't it isn't that suggesting that he supports a kind of 15-week policy? Absolutely not. I don't know. That's what that's what Young can support. That's what other... No, a ban on abortion, not, a ban on abortion totally was the question at hand as like the ban that Lindsey Graham... He didn't say that he did. No, he dodged the question entirely. He didn't say no, I don't support Lindsey Graham pushing for a 15-week, a full abortion ban, a national abortion ban. And I think that given the inconsistency of Republican pledges on this issue for years now saying that they would uphold Roe and wouldn't come for Roe, obviously that wasn't true. It has led a lot of people to not take any kind of those representation seriously, but we appreciate you joining us today Libby. Thank you all so much for having me. It was great. We'll have more rising for you right after this. A recent New York Times, Sienna College poll, shows that 49% of the likely voters polled plan to vote Republican in the upcoming midterms compared to 45% who plan to vote Democrat and improvement for the GOP from September. The biggest shift came from voters who identified as women and independent. In September, this cohort favored Democrats by 14 points but now favors the GOP by 18 points. Joining us now to discuss is host of Straight Shot No Chaser podcast, Tesla and Figaro, and senior policy analyst at the Independent Women's Forum. Annette Stepman, welcome to both. Thanks. Thank you. Annette, what do you think explains this fairly rapid reversal in favor of the GOP, reversal of Democrats' fortunes with this specific group? I think it goes back to other polls that repeatedly show that the top issues in this election are the economy and inflation. By the way, as a third place consistently across different polls, immigration and voters see, and especially independent women see, the Republican Party addressing those issues. They are not swayed only by abortion. The New York Times had a quote from one of the voters that I thought encapsulated the data pretty well in that article, which is, she said, I am concerned about Roe v. Wade being overturned, but I'm concerned about other things. I think that's a pretty good encapsulation of why this group has swung so fast. Although, I would caution, this is it polled just over 300 people. The margin of error could be pretty large. I think that still there is that swing, there is some kind of swing of independent women. I would be a little bit cautious about this number and how large it is. It is what in your view has been the productive Republican messaging on inflation. I think that you're right that they've been stressing that in lieu of issues like abortion. But it's not clear to me that there has been an affirmative plan articulated by Republicans as opposed to just criticisms of what Democrats are doing on that score. Yeah, I mean, I actually have to agree with you. I don't think Republicans have been very clear about anything about what they actually want to do. And that's somewhat by design. Their Republican leadership has been afraid to actually put forward an agenda that relying on how unpopular Joe Biden is. And that may not, that may be a good strategy for the election, but it's not necessarily a good strategy for after the election. They actually need to put forward a plan and actually show how they're going to fix some of these issues if they expect to retain popularity and actually do something good for the country. But yeah, I actually agree with your criticism. I don't think the Republican Party has been clear about what it wants to do about inflation or just about anything else. And that I think is by design from the leadership. Tesla, what do you think Democrats need to do to be competitive, more competitive with this group? Well, I'm so glad you brought up the point, Annette, about how this was only 300 people in the poll. You know, that's one of the things that I think is critically important. I have an entire training that I talk about polls in different area polls that shows you that polls are not as accurate as we would like them to be. But it is an indication to give you an idea where folks are going. I really just do believe in the NBC poll, even though again, not completely accurate, but the NBC poll shows that 70% of registered voters are more enthusiastic. And both sides say that this is the election of our time, which they say that last time every two years, they say this is the most important election. They'll say next time, etc. Right, right. So it is showing that voter enthusiasm is higher on the Republican side, 78%, 69% on the Democrat side. But again, it's really going to come down to those who really is going to get out for their team on election day to answer your question more directly on what Democrats can do. You know, I'm not trying to be pessimistic in any way. I'm just being very real. I think everything that's going to be done has been done. Not much will change in two weeks. People have already made their mind up. They've already decided which side they're on. And it really just comes down to how will folks be able to get out the vote, which means how many people can they actually get to the polls between now and election day. But I do think I will caution Democrats in basically being excited about the early numbers showing that they had a lead on early voting, because that is a strategy time and time again that folks say that they think they already have it in the bag and in election day, Republicans show up and take a lot of those seats. Well, despite Democrats' heavy focus on abortion, this election cycle, at least recently, the share of likely voters who said economic concerns were the most important issue facing America has leaped since July to 44% from 36% far higher than any other issue. And voters most concerned with the economy favored Republicans overwhelmingly by more than a two to one margin, which speaks to what you were saying. And at what point will Republicans have to explain what they are going to affirmatively do? Does that mean cutting spending? Does that mean they've suggested some of the Ukraine spending might come, at least in the House. Kevin McCarthy has talked about that. But a positive agenda for what the party is going to do. Is that a symptom of the fact that we're going to have even a Republican, massive Republican victories are going to produce divided government so the reality will be mostly thwarting what Biden does anyway, rather than putting forward what their program is? Yeah, I don't know that they have as clear a case for what they're going to do in the future as they do going back a sort of blaming case. I do think they have a good blaming case. They're pointing to a lot of spending that increased inflation, a lot of government packages. They're pointing more especially to the fact that closures in many states went on much longer during the pandemic than were necessary. And I think they probably will hold hearings about the decisions to lock down and especially to close schools for so long. I think so they have a better case essentially blaming a or a case of how we got here, blaming Democrats and blaming Joe Biden for some of the decisions that he made. I think rightfully so. They have less of the case, as you just said, for what they're actually going to do other than perhaps not pass another massive stimulus bill. But that's not really a positive case. That's just, okay, well, we'll stop doing some of the things that we think are causing the inflation that Democrats are doing, but that's not actually a positive case to deal with the economy. I do think they can rely on the pre-pandemic experience that we all still remember of a roaring US economy. And by the way, gains that actually went more proportionately to blue collar workers than it passed the past 30 years in terms of economic booms and busts in the United States. So I think they're going to again point backwards to the Trump record before the pandemic on the economy. I also think Democrats are really hampered by a couple issues that they can't stop talking about internally because a lot of their base wants to talk about them. Here I'm thinking about the fact that the president just gave an interview to Dylan to talk about minor transition. And then also the focus, incredible focus on climate change when every poll, every issues poll shows that those two issues are either very unpopular or at best, they're very, very low on voters priority list except for a tiny part of the Democratic base. So they have to keep talking about that, those issues in order to play to their base. But unlike abortion, there aren't even a sort of substantive number of voters who are concerned about those issues. And I think if anything, they're turning away voters by talking about those topics. So I don't know, I've never heard any of the divided administration be particularly vocal about climate change. I think frankly, much of the chagrin of the left, but I will say this, Bernie Sanders has been making the point that you made earlier there and as about the fact that Republicans aren't making an affirmative case, he came out saying, you know, what they are talking about cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is that irresponsible. It's absolutely irresponsible. He said that on CNN recently, Tesla, do you think that there is room for Democrats to be making that point more strongly that Republicans do invite to have a plan? And the reason that they're not talking about it is because the plan is largely to strip what little social safety net support is left for folks who have been devastated by not just the COVID pandemic, but the economic decline since that and who have been at the the poor end of Trump's tax cuts, which 85% of which went to the top 1%. Is there space there for Democrats to make that point and bring that point home or do you think there's still some legitimacy in relying on this kind of abortion approach? Yeah, I think with less than two weeks in the game, my communication advice would be to not worry about trying to counter somebody else's argument and constantly chasing what Republicans are talking about and offering a defense. They really should have been building a more offense strategy to talk about what they've done and Democrats have still not really grasped the idea of talking about what you've done. And so if Democrats believe that they have made some deliverables to the table, then they need to be talking about that, you know, constantly just countering, allowing Republicans to control the narrative and constantly just responding to them. It's just simply not working. Right now, there are three states that are really the states to watch for Senate control Pennsylvania, Georgia and Nevada. It really comes down to just these three states. So while we're talking about a national conversation on what's going on in Oklahoma or what's going on in New York, the reality is, is these three states. So looking at the economy in these three states matters. How are they getting out the vote in these three states? What messaging are they pushing in those three states? Because remember, Republicans only need to win one of those states where not only do Democrats have to maintain, but they also have to gain. And so they have the uphill battle. Right now polls indicate that the Republicans will win on the House side. But again, polls are just polls we won't know until they actually come out. But the strategy of trying to respond to Republicans has not worked. It will never work. It will constantly allow Republicans to control the narrative to control the puppet street, the puppet strings, opposed to Democrats actually delivering on policy. And then when they deliver on policy, actually putting that message. So for folks, for folks who are voter deep press, what I call voter deep press, which is different than voter suppression, they don't see it. They don't see it. They don't hear it. And they don't feel it in the pocket. And that is what is really hurting Democrats. And to be honest, I just don't know how much can change within the next 10 days. Well, and as Ann Tesslyn, we've got to leave it there. But thank you so much for joining us. Thank you. And stay tuned for more rising. Just a minute. Inflation reached the highest it's been in 40 years peaking at 9% in June. And Americans are paying the price. People are shelling out more and more for everything from gas, food, and other basic goods. But leading Democrats are attempting to redirect the focus and claim that inflation is a global problem, not just a US problem. Here is progressive Senator Bernie Sanders on CNN's State of the Union speaking about the issue. I think it's important that when we talk about inflation, Republicans will say, well, this is Joe Biden's fault. Really? Our inflation rate is much too high. It is 8%. It is 10% in the UK, 10% throughout Europe, 7% in Canada. Inflation is a global problem. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sung the same tune, which he would on CBS's Face The Nation. Let's watch. The fact is, is that when I hear people talk about inflation as I heard him there, we have to change that subject. Inflation is a global phenomenon. The EU, the European Union, UK, the British have higher inflation rate than we do here. It's not, the fight is not about inflation. It's about the cost of living. And if you look at what we have done to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, to bring down the cost of energy and the rest in our legislation, you will see that there has been opposed every step of the way by the Republicans, and they have no plan for lowering the cost of living or helping with inflation. I don't know what she's talking about for lowering the cost of energy. I mean, the strategic oil reserves, the 15 million barrels, whatever, have been released. For a very short-sighted plan. But nevertheless, why, I don't see why it excuses Biden or Biden policies to say that other countries that have had similar policies are also suffering from inflation. How does that get our leaders off the hook? Well, so two things are happening here. They think the argument is right, that there are some, there's some aspect of the inflation that is global and not predictable. It's caused by the, Republicans are blaming a $1,400 check that was given out two years ago for the inflation that we're having right now. They're laying the cost of the fee. Well, a $1,400 check times, hundreds of millions of people. Well, they're laying the blame at the feet of the social support services that enabled so many people to survive through the early days of COVID. And the point that Democrats are making is that you can't attribute it to that when you see global inflation rates being similar in other countries who did various different things to head off the worst effects of COVID. So Republicans on some level do have to reckon with the fact that EU it's 10.9%, Germany 10.9%, UK 10.1%, Italy 9.4%, America's down below all those countries on the list. It is a little bit lower in Canada, but still high. It's very high in Canada as well. So the argument isn't that America has done it best compared to the rest of the world. But it's that when you see all of these numbers globally, you have to get at the root of what is causing inflation and not pretend that Republicans are magically in office, it's going to go away. People are going to be in for root awakening if they wake up. Inflation is still high and Republicans also aren't willing to give you any of the social safety. Those countries all also spent a lot of money and also had shutdowns of their economy for long periods of time. So that doesn't expect to be policies. So what country would you want America to be modeled on in terms of how it addressed COVID and inflation? I would want to, none of these countries, they've all done things that are bad. What is the model? What is the stop spending more money than we have to spend? What is the Republican recommendation that there shouldn't have been $2,000 checks? A Republican's going to run on no checks because right now in Florida, Ron DeSantis is administering the COVID aid that his state received rightly so to help people out in the form of checks per child. So the same kind of program that was extremely popular that Democrats implemented, the child tax credit, Ron DeSantis is doing maybe a person that is in inflation whether it's a popular has nothing to do with anything. But Ron DeSantis, regardless of the inflationary effects, thinks it's a good idea and that's the point. At the time, there is an awareness that a certain degree of spending can cause inflation. But unless you were going to sit out here and own the fact that you are saying, people should die in the streets, people should be homeless, people should be able to afford food, people should be able to afford glass gas because the number one thing is free now. Spending trillions of dollars feels good in the short term but gets us in a bad place for our economy. Well that is. Republicans, I'm forcing you to derive here what Democrats are forcing Republicans to do. Well Republicans are as just as dishonest as Democrats but they need to be honest with the people that spending this amount of money hurt is bad for the economy in the long run, shutting down the economy is bad for the. But you don't get to paint half the picture. Do you think people should not have gotten to that $1,400 checks? Yes or no? That's the question Republicans have to answer. I also wouldn't have shut down businesses beyond the initial. Fine. Don't. Do you think that would have been a great idea? Do you think that Republicans should cut Medicare and Social Security because that's what they're angling to do right now? Yes or no? I really appreciate that. You can think that mistakes were made. I have a difference of opinion with Republicans about whether or not the COVID interventions were right, proper and good. I do think there were a lot of corporate payoffs and PPP loans and a lot of things that shouldn't have gone out that Republicans have had no issue with as well and corporate Democrats have had no issue with as well and they have happily taken those funds and that's fine. But you can say mistakes are made. But now we're in the today and people are suffering. You don't get to go on TV and out of one side of your mouth say people are suffering. What are we going to do? Democrats are failing. Americans are struggling. They can't afford milk. They put can't afford gas. And then the other side has absolutely no solution for it. But to say, oh remember a year ago when we did help you out a little bit with those things, we shouldn't have done that either. And we're not going to do that going forward. And also when we build out the airline industry and when we build out things. Yeah, we should have done that. We should have bought the airline industry. When we send you free. And when we send you free millions of dollars. I agree with all of that. I agree with all of that. Some aspects of our spending and our social safety net are more defensible than others. I 100% agree. And I think where we can agree on this Robbie is that the problem is that the focus of both Republicans and a lot of corporate dims is always first and foremost to cut those benefits that go to the poorest, most fragile, struggling people on the margins and not to talk about the more Ukraine spending, not to talk about some of the other things you mentioned. It's all social security, Medicare, and hurting the poor. It's not cutting taxes for the rich, which are historically low rate. Like it's never those kinds of conversations. What about all the spending that's happening by the 1%? The Republicans my op currently, myopically focused on social security. I don't think so. They are. They are. They never talk about it. No, they're never talk about it because they know it's unpopular. They want to secretly cut social security and Medicare. They want to secretly do that. I think they're giving up on that. No, they absolutely have not. Bernie Sanders has been trying. I'm sorry. I'm bringing up Bernie Sanders, but he's literally the only person who has his eye on the prize in that because guess what? A lot of Democrats want to cut social security and Medicare too. Barack Obama wanted to cut social security and Medicare. And we have to start focusing on what the elites are doing to the poorest people in this country. Okay. The social security going to go and solve. I mean, part of it is this is a problem. No, social security was designed to go and solve it by a test being put on a funding test. People who are not paying in the other. People who are not going to get the benefits they're paying into. And I do think that is a problem. There are a range of ways you could solve it, but it is just letting it go the way it is. Right. Don't solve it. Don't cut it and cut and do things like what was it? Marco Rubio, or was it Ted Grimm? Sorry, I forget. But one of them, their big plan was to, you know, they're constantly trying to raise the retirement age. In a world where people are dying earlier for a whole host of reasons, including, I'm sorry, the ongoing pandemic, the Republicans plan is to make it you're concerned about people not getting the benefit of their social security. No one's going to get the benefit of their social security if you have to live to the age of 70 to even cash in. Well, I don't, to punish people paying into it right now, I mean, like, how much more do you tax, like young people when they're not going to get that benefit? I mean, like it's generational crime, generational theft. You should get the bit of it. Talk about generational theft. Our whole generation is fakakta, as they say. Yeah, by some of these entitlement programs. So the problem is the solution is to return to a tax rate that we had in the golden age in the 1950s and 60s where the rich actually pay their fair share. People the fair fair. 20 years longer than they did. When the rich pay their fair share and start to reform some of these programs to make it more beneficial for the poorest or most working class people in this country. Not the way that the solutions pay millions and billions of dollars. No, it's not. No, they don't. The the top tax bracket used to be upwards of 90% in the 1960s, which doesn't mean that rich people pay 90% of their earnings. What it means is that over a certain income amount, you that the additional wealth is taxed at a higher rate. We can't even get people on board with the attacks on two cents that Elizabeth Warren was advocating for during the campaign. And when I say people, I don't mean the American people who find the tax, tax wealth tax overwhelmingly popular. It's the corporatists in Washington and both parties who refuse to get that kind of a policy that could bale out the American people up there here. There's so many, so many things we're doing to benefit corporations that have nothing to do with lowering their taxes, including much of our entire pandemic policy being a giveaway. I entirely agree. They should start there. All right, we're being told we got to go. More rising after this. President Biden is facing backlash from conservatives online after he hosted transgender activists at the White House for an interview. Let's watch some of that. It feels like Republicans have turned trans and non-binary people into this thing to blame societies downfall on in some ways. And this narrative is not only dangerous to our mental health, but also our physical safety. And particularly trans women of color are being murdered at an alarming rate. More than any other group of people. Thank you. How can democratic leaders be more effective in advocating for us trans people and our families and our lives and our opportunities? I'm not being facetious when I say this being seen with people like you. I mean it. I genuinely mean it. People fear what they don't know. They fear what they don't know. And when people realize, individuals realize, oh, this is what they're telling me to be frightened of. The trans part's not immoral. What they're trying to do to trans persons is immoral. The president also reveled some feathers by confirming his commitment to gender affirming care. Do you think states should have a right to ban gender affirming health care? I don't think any state or anybody should have the right to do that. As a moral question and as legal question, I just think it's wrong. So I don't know. What do you make of this, Robby? Well, look, I do take issue with what this individual said in the first clip. Yes, it's true that there is, there have been a number of deaths of killings in that specific demographic trans women of color. It is not, however, because of anti-trans bigotry. They're not victims of anti-trans hate crimes. We're talking about people who are in very dangerous at-risk situations in terms of like drug dealing and prostitution. And these are very tragic deaths and fine to discuss policy interventions to protect them. But it is not transphobic people are killing them because they're trans. It's just not true. It's not part of the argument that the whole point of having various marginalized identities being poor, being more likely to be poor because you are disproportionately kicked out of the house at a young age, are experiencing homelessness at a higher rate, are therefore turning to certain kinds of jobs that are more dangerous, like sex, work, etc. All of those things coming together are part of the experience, right? I don't know how much you can just aggregate them. But if the point is that we're in agreement that this population is uniquely vulnerable for whatever reason, I don't really care if trans women are dying because, so when you as a teacher, this is, I hate trans people, it's going around on an event data versus being in situations that put them higher at risk. The point is that you don't want people to be dying. I mean, I support legalizing both sex work and drugs. So, sure. I support policy interventions that I think would address this. But it's not, if there's no trans, I wouldn't put a, there's no reason to frame it. Well, my critique of this would be of anything that there is a little dissonance for me seeing, and again, I don't know this woman's background, but seeing someone who is not a trans woman of color. So she recently, she recently, she has a TikTok account or something like that. So she's media account. Yes, where, where it's a day, whatever, of being a girl, day seven, being a girl. No, I've seen the coverage of that. So, again, these are, these are choices that I find to be incongruent. Why have this person who, you know, frankly, is not a trans woman of color, is not from that kind of a marginalized space that she's speaking to, who has, you know, herself attracted, is not going to be the most sympathetic person rightly or wrongly to a broader right audience, and who also isn't talking about the material issues that are affecting trans women of color. I would have loved to have seen a round table with trans women who were talking about poverty, who were talking about homelessness, who were talking about the renter's crisis. A lot of issues that, frankly, Joe Biden has been insufficiently responsive to and which are disproportionately problems for the trans community, but which are problems much more broadly. Why not talk about why haven't you, you know, offered any kind of plan or solution to incredibly high health care rates, since that's something that is affecting people's access to gender affirming care. Instead of just sitting here, talking in the abstract about how people, rich trans people who can afford these kinds of intervention, can have access to them. Right. I asked for the banning gender affirming care. Look, yeah, I don't really want to involve legislatures or governments in these kinds of things. I, you know, if you're, if you're above the age of consent and you're, well, if you're above the age of consent, whatever, you can have, if the, if a doctor is willing to do it and you are an adult, that's your business. The, the dispute is over people who are underage, people who are children. And particularly probably in a case where a family is not as on board with it. Again, if the kid really wants it, family really wants it, the doctor wants to do it. Maybe I don't approve, but you know what, it's just not my business at the end of the day. People should do more looking out for their own families and their own children, minding more of their own business, I think. That said, I do see the kind of, like there's, there's, it's much more unsettled. The science behind a lot of all of this is a, I think more unsettled than activists on behalf of these issues concede that we don't have long-term, term data on what happens if you socially transition when you're very young or pre-pubody and then you take hormone blockers and then you have everything else and you know, how does it turn out for you? Again, I'm sure this is a good, positive step for some people. Is this the normal experience for someone because it is a little bit of a cultural thing now to start identifying the different gender, which I also don't care about, but there's that category of like people just messing with the concept of gender because that's like things young people do now. We cannot say that. There is not, it's not a black box that we don't know what happens. People have been transitioning for decades and I understand that there is with greater social acceptance of trans people, more people who are going to be transitioning and on the margin, some people who are going to come to detransition and make a different decision as they're older, but it is worth noting that the overwhelming majority of people who transition, who medically transition, do not detransition. The conversation about detransition is that I really respect folks who brought it up because everybody deserves to have their story told and be written about, but we shouldn't fall into the trap of over representing that type of issue. The issue is that most people diagnosed with gender dysphoria do not ultimately transition and are glad that they did not. But the concern is pushing more widely diagnosing this or more widely discussing it and the concern that people feel is if we push more of these people who are just being captured by this softer category of gender confusion into harder medical interventions, then you would have much more significant agreement. But then you have to prove that that is happening and what you just described was an extent, like an existent reality in which people are increasingly accepted and diagnosed in this way, but there's not concurrent evidence that people are also detransitioning at a higher rate and that they are being quote unquote pushed into medical inventions that are premature and irreversible. Well, then we're not just a situation. So yeah, I just I want to make sure that we don't frame it in a way that presumes that there's a problem here that needs to be demonstrated by the folks who again are trying to have legal bans on people living their life the way they want to live. And that's the issue here. Well, I don't support legal bans. There is a the greater diagnosis of the sort of the gender dysphoria category. And I just I think it's perfectly fine, perfectly reasonable for there to be there should be a lot of conversations, families, children, and doctors, and then you know what it's your business not mine. And that's fine. And I don't want to involve the government. We should just be a little little cautious about how we proceed because some people some people do regret it. And my sense was if they're if they're if they would be more aggressively pushed, there'd be more regret on the other side. Well, the we the we again as family. So we we don't need to do anything but make sure that people have the right to live their life the way they want without the kind of bans that Republicans are advocating for across the country. But we'll have more rising for you right after this. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave these warnings looking ahead to 2024. Let's take a look. Right wing extremists already have a plan to literally steal the next presidential election. And they're not making a secret of it. The right wing controlled Supreme Court may be poised to rule on giving state legislatures. Yes, you heard me that correctly. State legislatures the power to overturn presidential elections. Just think if that happens, the 2024 presidential election could be decided not by the popular vote or even by the anachronistic electoral college but by state legislatures. Many of them Republican controlled. Wow, there was a lot of a lot of interesting content there. The popular vote has never decided anything ever. I know she wishes it was the case because she won it. That would be a different system. We just don't have that system. Yeah, I think that claim is always weak when Democrats make it. Like also if the popular vote was was the determining factor, Republicans would run completely different campaigns. I mean, I'm not saying they would necessarily but they would be you don't know. They would be very different. Like they would campaign in California. There's a 30 to 5, 40 percent of the Californians are probably Republicans. Their votes don't matter. We don't focus on getting turning them out at all. It would just be totally different. It would be different. And also it's not as the Democrats between election seasons are like campaigning for election reform to try to make the popular popular bear majority system in the United States of America. So it just smells a lot like a taste a lot rather like sour grapes. Also state legislatures did. I'm not saying I'm not advocating for this but they were initially under the original understanding like largely responsible right for picking the electors. That's been reformed. I'm not saying we should go back to that. I don't actually think this I mean this. There is also the Supreme Court in the face. She's talking very real threat. She's talking. She heard us making fun of her and she's getting back in this conversation. Well, look, I do think that I want to ask you this about this other point that she's making about the vulnerability of the system as it's set up. I do think that sometimes generally speaking talking about Donald Trump's doing the election glosses over the call with Raffinsberger, the Georgia Secretary of State that Donald Trump called claiming that he had won the election by hundreds of thousands of votes which was not substantiated insisting that the election results were wrong and that he not certify the election results. In a world where that did happen, not just this kind of generalized claim of oh, I should have won popular vote whatever, that Trump did unsuccessfully try to influence the outcome of the election not based on the democratic outcomes but on the influence with these individuals who are positioned at various places in the legislature and poised to actually affect the outcomes. Is there some truth to what she's saying and should voters be concerned about it? I think they should be concerned about Trump. He was that was deeply irresponsible. So wrong what he did, he was rebuffed at every turn including by the Supreme Court. I mean the argument is that we have a different Supreme Court now and that we've also- Well we've won two different people. It's very meaningful and there's been a lot of coverage about how Alita in particular his entire posture and affect apparently has changed now that he's in the majority in a way that people have known him for a very long time. A law clerk went on the record in a New York magazine interview a month ago. But his attempt was that he would have heard a case the rest weren't even willing to hear, not that he was necessarily inclined to agree with the argument being presented. So the point is that there's a different- there's a more conservative, there's a different Supreme Court that maybe arguably feels empowered again look at the job's decision. But in addition that Republicans have been playing this game and state legislatures on the ground, I don't mean game flippantly, I mean kind of smartly positioning people so that the next time there is a Raffensberger call, it might go to someone who's a lot more sympathetic to what's being asked of him than Raffensberger actually was. And is that something that voters should be concerned about? Yeah, it's a concern if like at the local level political figures are winning who you know want to cheat or change the mechanisms or do- yeah that is a bad thing but what happens if democracy gives you people who are bad and try to corrupt democracy? I mean you just got to run and beat those candidates. I mean this is- I was actually- you'd write Max Boot who's not a figure I like very much just tweeted and I made fun of him because this framing does become ridiculous. He said if the current trends hold Republicans are likely to take over house quite positive to Senate along with many state offices this is how democracies die both at home and like well democracies die by we having a democracy and then the wrong people getting into power. I mean I guess but what else can you do other than run against them and argue that things they're doing are wrong? What people do mean by democracy is the idea that there is direct representation. It's not how our democracy is structured and maybe we should think about that but it is not a popular vote and the way that districting and gerrymandering has happened and Democrats ready to do this too obviously we just covered the story out of LA where there's all these internal fights over redistricting there and the power struggles there but the reality is that it's in so many places in this country people feel disenfranchised not legally in terms of their ability to vote but they don't feel like what is popular in the area is actually reflected in the people we're getting right there. It pulls on how much people care about existential threats to democracy you see you know the mainstream media trying and failing to to make that the thing people the actual people are talking about and care about so my advice probably would be if you're really concerned about this is to stop talking about it and you know convince voters that whatever your party or your factions agenda to make their lives better to improve to lower the prices of food and gas for them is good and then also happen to have better views about democracy and election. No I think that the only point that I was trying to make is that they have to do that there's only that's the only option but that it is also a rigged up pill battle because Republicans did a much better job on the redistricting battles of 2010 than the the Democrats did and so everything that they do now from here on out even if they have perfect messaging and improve everything it's still going to be not reflected exactly in the vote total. But Trump's efforts lost in court over and over and over and over again a little laughed out of court at every level. Trump appointed more federal judges but but a lot of those were people he appointed to a lot of those were people he appointed. Sometimes sometimes it was there were a lot of Trump appointed or Republican appointed judicial officials who who laughed at the arguments he presented. Yeah with the with the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago there was a Trump appointed judge who ended up doing the right thing there and on and on but at the end of the you know that the question is does some combination of the Supreme Court composition and the the election of people who are not quite made of the same medal as a Raffensberger create a situation on the on the fringes where we have a legitimately quote unquote stolen election and have Democrats like Hillary Clinton who I think to some degree have been the boy who cried wolf through all of this who have not I think done a good enough job of distinguishing what they mean when an election was stolen versus just being in their feelings about an election being stolen versus like real real efforts to steal an election. People aren't going to pay attention to the real stuff. When the election is extremely close there are there are going to be opportunities to do some stuff. Either side can always win in a blowout by being super popular and delivering policies to make everybody really happy that has happened in our lifetimes. Obama did it. Bush did it once. Yeah it can happen again. Yeah well I might as I keep thwarting progressives that way. Prove the populace that way did they do. I don't know. I don't know about that. Yeah well we'll have more rising for you right after this. Ted Cruz was front and center on the talk show The View which aired Monday topics ran the gamut from inflation to the legitimacy of the 2020 election and even his attitude toward former president Donald Trump. Conservative host Anna Navarro pressed the Republican senator from Texas on his seemingly is seeming rather change of heart. I frankly don't know how you get over your wife being called ugly. I don't know how you get over those kind of calamities against your father but you obviously have gotten over it. Today you're saying a very different tune. So tell us were you lying then or are you lying now? Yeah that's that's a loaded question there. Look it's I think a lot of people have the same question. It's a very different Ted Cruz that we're seeing. We are. I mean would you not agree that that's very different Ted Cruz than today's Ted Cruz? No what I would say is this in 2016 we had a primary where Donald Trump and I beat the living crap out of each other. I'll tell you Heidi laughed when he said that my father laughed by the way my dad didn't just kill Kennedy. He's got Jimmy Hoffa buried in the backyard. It was idiotic. Cruz seemed to take the interview and stride as the host didn't pull any punches. Even members of the audience took the opportunity to heckle him. Here's a bit more. It's most money in history we've ever taken in. The problem is we spent nearly seven trillion dollars and that's what we do cover climate. Excuse me ladies ladies excuse us let us do our job. Let us do our job. We hear what you have to say but you gotta go. Here's the thing. We may not like when Republicans win but we don't go and we don't storm. We don't try to change but I miss an entire year of Antifa riots where cities across this country were burning at police cars being firebarbs. Your position is the left doesn't engage in violence really so Joe Biden claims to our country but not each other right or do it or say just you that gets done. I agree. Okay then lower your voice because we are very close. So right off the top I got to say the hecklers I think were heckling the panel for not talking about climate change enough. Those were climate protesters not Ted Cruz protesters. Painting to throw soup at or something. Yeah they then I support them in doing that as well but let's take that step it apart from the Ted Cruz issue. What do you make of the back and forth about the 2020 election being stolen where Ted Cruz says basically deflects from weighing in on the appropriateness of one sixth and instead says well you guys support violence because he does. He does the deflection that I see some Republicans do so much where they say yes Joe Biden is the president and they say but do you think he won the election and say Joe Biden is the president. It was just a kind of you're not admitting that he won you're kind of saying that he like give him some kind of brute force way he you know. Well right I guess that would be the employee if he didn't win legitimately but and we didn't play it what he does press him on that but then she says that she thinks the other election was stolen. So then she just totally loses the well it's a segment of the view of course. She loses the moral high ground because then she says suggests that there was something nefarious about the previous election. They're making staffing choices and those staffing choices are creating these kind of segments. I do appreciate that the addition of Alyssa there in the right the right seat. She did I think show Grace in saying that she had to have a kind of reckoning and you know when Donald Trump was encouraging people to storm the Capitol and kill her former you know attack her former boss that that was a come to Jesus moment for her and frankly she had tried to some ire from the other liberals on the panel for even having that amount of grace. What we go over didn't and she also didn't respond I think as well as she should have the Ted Cruz which is to say you don't have to like the George Floyd protests. The George Floyd protest happened prior to the election and we're not about Democrats being bad about the outcome of an election. Whoa they were there were a complete separate entity so if the conversation is about what what sides deals the election or what sides claim to have elections stolen go ahead talk about Hillary Clinton and Cruz Jean-Pierre having said that they thought that earlier elections 2020 the year 2000 and 2016 were stolen make that argument you don't get to say some other stuff happened over here that was Democrat aligned and therefore it was okay for Donald Trump to actively encourage people to go and storm the Capitol. Okay I agree with that yeah they're not exactly equivalent things they weren't over exactly they're not over equivalent issues but but I mean I okay I do take his point that there was a lot of there was looting and rioting and nothing to do with election interference. So it's not but I can sit here and say conservatives killed you know 11 Jewish people at this Tree of Life synagogue, Republicans endorsed violence that's not fair either. The conversation is about election ceiling and the fact that Republicans aren't willing to look at the easy at this point say look there there were moments in the wake of the election where the Donald Trump was making representations that confused a lot of the Democrat the Republican Party. We wanted to make sure that everything was handled accordingly before we conceded the race given how important it is presidential elections are and now Donald now Joe Biden is the president of the United States of America. You don't have to die on this hill but they're choosing to die on this hill. The problem is that people like with the Goldberg won't also make the concessions but that different kinds of statements have been made by people like Hillary Clinton in the past that muddled the issue and that we should be talking about specific events like Trump calling the Georgia secretary of state to try to get him to not to certify the election and not use broad generalized terms like stolen election. I make no excuses for January 6 including the behavior of the people there but I also not for people who set fires to the right and I'm not for murdering a bunch of Jewish people in a synagogue but none of these things are related to each other but the view got twice the last episode apparently not enough for Trump who thought co-host of the one of the show and the one-time communications director Alyssa Faragriffin should have defended him more. Well he took to his social media platform truth social to rant about Faragriffin calling for her to be fired from the network in his post he said quote Alyssa Faragr totally misrepresented her true feelings about me and the Trump administration in order to get her job at ratings disaster CNN and I see it with the low IQ people at the view ABC hired Faragriffin to replace former co-host and also a Trump critic Megan McCain Alyssa also guest hosted or hosted rising a few times at one point. Yeah but I think like she's made her feelings pretty clear that yes she obviously worked in the Trump White House and also it's weird to take the position that if you're an anti-Trump person you should want the Trump White House ensemble to be staffed by people who are not like guestsmen absolute right absolutely devoted yes men and that was I think characterizes Alyssa and then and then she you know when it came to that horrific end where you just there was no way to continue to justify what was going on she exited or she exited before that or it became more vocal about how uncomfortable it was and it seems perfectly justified to me I feel similarly yeah I think that she's doing a good job in that chair it's a hard seat I know I'm already on that friends with Megan a little bit and she she had a lot of I thought Megan did also did an actually really good job of representing a actual conservative point of view and she kept getting talked over and yelled at by the rest of the money. Yeah well much more so than Navarro who I got to say is when he's not a Republican she's not a Republican who was there to make Democrats feel good but doesn't actually reflect any more than anyone at all right good on good on I guess Ted Cruz for giving it the old field college try it's hard it is hard to be in an environment where you're sitting at a table with like five other people and four of them are just yelling at you and the other is kind of actually politely and civilly trying to engage you and have some disagreements with you so yeah I mean it's best they should inject a little balance that table by getting a leftist and you might see some ally. Baro might see an ally on the left. Breonna just always auditioning for for the view. Always be close. I hope you make it and then you can have me on and then we can continue this epic feud. To deal.
