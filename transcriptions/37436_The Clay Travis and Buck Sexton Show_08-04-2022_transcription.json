    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast Welcome everybody to the Friday edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show got a lot to discuss with you Appreciate you coming to hang out for a few minutes few hours, whatever you got the fights with the Activist left over transgender Children specifically and how the White House is going right into the center of this battle. That's something we will be Discussing here for sure in just a moment. It's pretty stunning is what you play out Nancy Pelosi Complaining allowed it seems reports of it that the far left members members of the Democrats in Congress are just making the usual Democrat head fake too hard to pull off You know the all the the Marxist stuff the trans agenda stuff The older Democrats want to play that stuff down in the election year. They don't want the American people to really think about that before they Go in and cast their votes in a midterm election where inflation's already very high the borders wide open Which we all know border is a total mess right now. We'll talk about that to updates on it They're trying to say well, we can't really tell if when we get rid of title 42 It's really good to cause a surge. Yeah, they can actually they're just Lying to you and we'll have more on that in a moment, but first this was This is pretty remarkable because Disney as we all know clay is the company that It's probably most associated. I would think I'm your parent I'm not yet but most associated with the entertainment that you can trust your kids with Disney movies safe for the whole family good family fun and And we've seen these videos and I got a hat to Chris Rufo for getting them out there He's the one who has sources inside Disney who are Feeding these these videos. I mean before I get into the CEO one clay. Did you see the senior Disney executive? who referred to herself as By romantic asexual yeah, I don't even know what some of these terms are now What I was gonna ask you. I mean you're a smart guy What I never heard that one. Have you heard that one? I never heard that one. I have no earthly idea What in the world that represents and they're just making stuff up now. I mean I It's not like I'm clueless. You know, I'm not 85 years old and have never heard any of these terms at all I don't even I can't even imagine having to sit through this entire crazy Disney Ritual humiliation it felt like basically a Bob Chappock their CEO because his contract buck is up next year and this feels like they have just ordered Effectively a hit on this guy and they're going to try to find somebody else and how crazy is the CEO? That they are going to end up putting in place. I mean look Disney is The quintessential for many of you out there listening right now. This is a quintessential middle America Pro America kid driven company and they've lost their minds with this woke Agenda to the extent where I know a lot of people out there who are listening to us right now are thinking Hey, do I really want to spend all the money to take my kids to Disney World is there somewhere else? I saw where people are pushing to take your kids to Dollywood Which is in my state of Tennessee because it's a more wholesome environment. Would you have ever believed buck that Disney? Even Disney which is directed directly at children would go this woke It's really kind of Unbelievable that we're here what it proves to us is that the wokeness the mind virus of wokeness and I still really love that Elon Musk description, which is Essentially wokeness gives vicious nasty people an excuse to attack people and pretend that they're virtuous for doing so it gives unhappy Unkind vindictive individual some kind of virtuous armor to use while they go on attack against people And and this is also reminiscent I think of the Maoist Struggle sessions, right? This was from the cultural revolution in China. There would be denunciations public denunciations that people would be expected to do of themselves and then clay So they would march people out into this into the town square or you know a city square whatever and then their friends their neighbors even their family members to be could be told to come out and first the individual have to say I'm sorry that I Am not enough of a friend of the revolution and I betrayed the revolutions principles that I'm disgusting And I hate myself for it and then all of their friends and family members would have to get in on it too This was the way you had to prove your purity and fealty Listen to that was under you know Maoist Maoist China This is a real part of history within living memory close to living memory and here is Disney CEO Bob chap Egg groveling in struggle session fashion play 18 I pledged to be a better ally for the LGBTQ plus community Apologize for not being the ally that you needed me to be and committed to ensuring that our company lives up to its values I know that we've got work to do and that work starts with listening I understand that we've made mistakes and the pain that those mistakes have caused and I know that our silence Wasn't just about to build in Florida But about every time an individual or institution that should have stood up for this community did not We know the moment requires urgency in words are not enough. So we are taking some actions right now I mean they might as well invite a bunch of school kids to come out with little sticks and hit him so he could say I'm sorry. I'm sorry cuz that's what they did in the struggle sessions in China this Idea and I'm just gonna continue to repudiate it. This is what I wrote in my most recent book This idea that corporations should take sides on every single political issue Is just complete madness to me. I don't understand it I don't I think we're gonna see I really hope a massive swing back in the other direction Where companies are gonna come out and say you know what? we're just trying to serve everybody and The idea that we want to wait Wait in on incredibly contentious issues in what is effectively a 50 50 country and be constantly fighting Political battles when we are a for-profit corporation to me is Absolute insanity and it's been allowed to this is the Trojan horse analogy that that I that I think applies very well here to buck This idea that you allow it starts off relatively minor right you're gonna allow in these diversity and inclusion people Give them a job title where all they care about is diversity and inclusion and what do you think they're gonna find? They're gonna find issues with diversity and they're gonna find issues with inclusion because if they don't find those issues Then their jobs aren't protected. So they come in they start looking around they start tearing up the existing infrastructure and arguing that you have to Reform yourself in order to in some way justify why they have their jobs Let's think about it Buck. There's never a diversity inclusion person who shows up and says hey, you know what? Everything's perfect here because then they don't have job security. They have to find flaws in the diversity inclusion universe They tear apart everything they don't build anything back and effectively they are the Trojan horse or allowing all these people Into our institutions they are coming in with no goal to build anything Except to destroy the existing infrastructure and every corporation and every major government entity is falling victim to the same problem And this is all happening not because it's necessary buck But because spineless leaders like Bob Chapick at Disney are afraid of what those D&I people are going to do if They become the target. They're gonna lose their jobs. They're not doing what's best for the company They're trying to do what's best to preserve their job This is not a new strategy either. I mean we call them D and I Positions right now all through corporate America and also in in bureaucracies In the CIA where I used to work which as an organization I think its brand has just unfortunately gone down when everyone thought of it before if they thought it was nefarious At least they thought it was semi competent and serious when it was doing its nefarious stuff And now it's just like what is going on over there? And I I do not have good answers other than it's a mess But if you've ever seen folks out there the hunt for red October great movie Sean Connery Alec bald. Oh, I like Baldwin There is in the early stages somebody this is well in the early stages in the movie Sean Connery kills someone on the sub Who is the political officer the commissar? And this was a reality all throughout the Soviet Union whether you were working in a in a printing shop or you were in a military Unit or you were on a submarine there was someone assigned to make sure that you never committed an act of wrong thing That was that person's entire job of course in the context of the hunt for red October You're like the slimy grotesque Soviet apparat check is the first one to go and everyone's like yay But the reality here is that you have ideological commissars all across corporate America all across the federal bureaucracy And even down into the school system Which I think is where we should probably go on this next clay because at this at this phase and you see all these these Parallel's right we just talked about Bob Chapik doing the struggle session How many people have we seen even if they say something very mild or they're just insufficiently committed to the cause they go on these? Apology tours they bet I'm so sorry. I'm not enough of an ally It's never enough of course because the nature of this mindset this really Totalitarian mindset that's taking over has taken over the left in this country and really I think was that the purpose or the the goal All along this has spread all over our cultural and political institutions certainly within our media institutions And now in the school system and we should talk about this clay you mentioned this to me We both you know we coordinate right beforehand our favorite things we want to talk about and we're both saying this in New Jersey This is madness. I mean they're doing exactly what they say They're not going to do or is not happening. Therefore the Florida bill is anti-gay notice They've tried to do that. They've tried to mobilize the gay community against a bill that just says no gender identity for toddlers Essentially, it's so dishonest. They don't say gay aspect of it. It doesn't say gay in the bill Never mind doesn't tell you not to say gay So they lie about a clay and then we see in the school system in New Jersey other places too by the way We're just gonna keep digging they are teaching gender identity You know Megan Kelly great Megan Kelly on her show I mean I know the school where she pulled her son out of very well It was a rival school the mine growing up in New York City She said straight up. They were pushing trans ideology on her second or third grader saying, you know You may think you're a boy, but are you sure you might be a girl to second graders adults are doing this folks? I I know it sounds crazy because it is But notice how they're not actually denying that this ever happens. They're just saying it's bigoted when you talk about it We're gonna talk about it because I do think it's significant It's amazing how quickly in the conversation shifted from You should well this is not even going on in schools, right? That was the initial response to to the Florida situation To now New Jersey coming out and basically saying yeah, we're teaching gender identity to second graders Yeah I just wanted to buy time to figure out what the talking points were gonna be That's what it feels like because they are doing so it Completely justifies the Florida bill for anybody out there And I think it's the vast majority of parents who think that kindergarten first grade second grade and third graders should just be learning basic educational methods or learn how to read learn how to do arithmetic Learn the basics of education. We don't need to be in indoctrinating these kids in sexuality But that's what's going on right now in New Jersey and also by the way This kind of all feels like it came out of athletic competition But buck you got Jen Psaki yesterday and I'll play the cut for you when we come back saying oh, yeah minors should definitely be getting gender related medical treatments to allow them to transition minors It's crazy. It's it's reckless and there are doctors who are still willing to they're brave enough They know the truth many doctors know the truth about this But they don't want to lose their licenses that I want to lose their livelihood There are doctors who are saying this is this is reckless. This is reckless and I better not hear any libs They're gonna do this, but we are not gonna accept the it's the medical consensus now really well what is shot number eight the medical consensus to I just want To make sure we know about medical consensus when it comes to contentious topics We'll come back into this in a second clay will we'll lead us in on that one if you ever Travel like I am right now. I'm actually down in Florida. I'm down in the Palm Beach area and I'm staying in a hotel Look, I'm at it's a nice bed.

So this is Disney executive producer LaToya Raveno Said that she is a biro mantic asexual. That's how she defines herself Listen to this as she discusses the challenges at Disney of being a biro mantic asexual I identify as like a biro mantic asexual. I've had a lot of Learning and growing about myself this year kind of facilitated by how comfortable I felt on the proud family and with my immediate team at Disney TV a and so it's just sort of like this creative dissonance between my personal experience Where I feel so safe and so supported. I mean like I wasn't like in the closet But like I'm real out now. I want to use my content to like go deeper like talk about how Non-monolithic the lgbtq plus community as an asexual as an asexual like is just like I feel like a lot of people don't know What that is I have to like have a dissertation ready at any given time I want to like add the pockets of the lgbtq community that you don't see I want to get like gay advanced And then I realized like oh you need to go back to like day 101 I don't I don't know a single guy Can you imagine if you had to date a So we're trying to figure out exactly what this is I a biro mantic asexual is like the friend zone forever I was gonna say what if a woman tells you on a date that she is Uh at the end of the day. She's like just so you know, I'm romantic, but asexual You're probably not do it as well as you thought you were as a guy That's just you know in that situation The worst date ever you're friends your friend zone forever Friend zone forever not only friend zone responsible for all the romance and you get none of the sex I mean and by the way, you're also competing in the romance field with with women and men First of all who signs up for these relationships Like I can't think of anything worse than being perpetually friend zoned as the goal of the relationship It's not like hey, I'm just not that interested in you but maybe one day down the line I could be interested in you which is the the friend zone, uh, you know dichotomy the difficult spot to be This is forever I just want you to spend money and take me out to dinner and wine and dine me But I have no interest at all in any sort of intimate relationship with you ever Like how are these people exist? So I guess if you're a bisexual a romantic, I'm sorry No, no by romantic I just messed it up. I just heard of I Well, I guess there probably are some bisexual a romantic that's a whole other but if you're a by romantic asexual Then that would uh then that would mean that you're happy to have like dates with people and think that they're just dreamy But like everyone's going home separately. You know, I mean that that's that's the situation. I think you don't need something Awkward. Yeah, I think that's right the awkward like kiss or don't kiss scenario Isn't even in play Which makes me wonder who are these people that are actually Like bragging about you've been married what 15 years man the awkward and the night hug 18 years the awkward end of night hug You're lucky you don't have to deal with that my friend There's a lot of married people out there that are like hey I've been in an asexual relationship for a long time if you're comfortable in your office space You're less distracted and will stay engaged longer very likely perform much better That's why you need the best possible chair sign up right now For an x chair and you can get hooked up better heat better cold It has both also a massage element. I have this in my office. I sit in my x chair I love it. You will too. How do you sign up? Go to x chair clay calm right now That's the letter x chair clay calm. You can also call one eight four four four x chair hundred dollars off your order Right now again that website check it out for yourself x chair clay calm do it now This is the plan this is the program And that is evident From what's going on right now with the the bill in new jersey clan. I mentioned this Um and and look the left is going to play this game where the moment that they feel like they're losing the argument They'll just shout big it or they'll say why are you making such a big deal of this or whatever because the american people by By solid majority um, do not actually Uh, do not actually support This agenda. They're not actually on board for this so they have to play all of these all of these games And we know that in new jersey they are soon going to be teaching students in the 2022 2023 school year Um, they're going to be teaching kids about in the second grade mind you about gender identity So this is happening in schools, but even you could say even even worse than the teaching of gender identity or even more destructive Is what gen saki? This is from the white house This is not A fringe thing that we're making a big deal out of whatever They are coming for your kids using the apparatus all over the country They want to start using federal law to go after people Who try to stand in the way of this agenda to civil rights violation? Oh, they're studying the feds after you the same people that said that parents you show up At school board meetings and are a little bit, uh, testy are kind of like terrorists that same doj They may decide that a doctor who doesn't gender affirm in eight year old but tries to Actually just have some eight year old live with their gender until later on That's not what this white house Is okay with they'll send people after you here is gen saki saying that it is gender affirming healthcare for transgender kids to have them take Uh The full transgender surgery and the hormones play clip one just like the extreme government overreach We've seen in texas where politicians have sent state officials into the homes of loving parents to investigate them for abuse just to harass and intimidate The lgbtqi plus community today's vote in alabama will only serve to harm kids But alabama's lawmakers and other legislators who are contemplating these discriminatory bills Have been put on notice by the department of justice and the department of health and human services That laws and policies preventing care that health care professionals recommend for transgender minors May violate the constitution and federal law to be clear every major medical association agrees that gender affirming health care For transgender kids is a best practice and potentially Lifesaving president biden has given both words and actions to fight for all americans and will not hesitate to hold these states accountable They're gonna send the feds after you clay if you don't want the gender transition people to cut Children's I mean you can't even talk about this stuff without it's just it's it's horrific Yeah, and it it is absolutely crazy that we have reached this point Where I mean just think about it take it outside of transgender related issues for a moment right now And just think about this You can't drive a car in most states until you're 16 years old You can't certainly vote you can't go sign up and join the military you aren't considered an adult until you're 18 years old You can't buy a beer until you're 21 You can't rent a car in some places buck until you're 25 Why do those age limits exist because we believe rightly for anyone who has ever been a teenager And certainly for anyone who has ever raised a teenager that teenagers often make really bad decisions And you're going to tell me that a 13 year old who is Uncertain about their gender probably uncertain about many things in their life That you should fill them up with hormones and start to change their gender In a way sometimes that becomes virtually irreversible In terms of your ability to have children in terms of your ability to live a life without difficulty This is child abuse to me. I mean and buck take it outside of transgender related Issues, I mean think about how often we heard over the years Um about for instance in Africa There are some places where they will have surgery on girls genitals in order to General mutilation that's right. It's a it's gotten a ton of attention over the last 20 30 years And people say man, this is unbelievable that this would ever be allowed to happen And we didn't someone would have this surgery happen to me. It's awful But that that would occur is considered universally to be an awful thing To a minor Well, you can have surgeries that are occurring to minors You can pump them full of all sorts of hormones that are changing what their body would naturally do This is child abuse and and I don't I mean the idea that jen saki argued their buck that it's a constitutional Violation to uh to say hey, you got to wait till you're 18 years old to make a choice like this I mean clay that is this is where this is true. It's great. This is where this is heading Okay, this is heading to a place where you're going to have parents who say I don't care that my eight-year-old thinks that he should be You know mutilated and transitioned before even going through puberty I want to you know until this child is an adult. We're going to treat the child as Their gender and we're going to work through this and be supportive It's only a matter of time before there's going to be a movement here to say The lack of gender affirmation from parents Is the child abuse and maybe this state has to take your child away? We can all see this coming Look at the language that jen saki's using she's invoking the power of the federal government to say if you oppose as a doctor Children's mutilation, which is what we're really talking about here. They're talking about gender Affirmation surgery give me a break dr. Mckew of john's Hopkins university was the chief of Of gender transition there for decades clay and i've been sending you some of his editorials and some of his positions this guy is Was essentially the national expert on gender transition surgery And shut down his clinic at john's Hopkins university medical center after decades Why? Because when they did long-term studies they found that the people that got the surgeries had all kinds of health problems And didn't have better psychological outcomes It was bad practice to do this for adults. Does this surprise anyone? Yeah, this I mean Follow up for for children. It's he says it's child abuse. It's crazy and the white house is Advocating for no I think every state should be passing the laws that say you can't have these kind of surgeries and you can't have this treatment until you're over 18 Years old I I mean it seriously because there's all sorts of things that we do to protect minors from making poor choices buck You can have gender reassignment surgery at 15 But you can't buy a beer until you're 21 Right, we don't even let kids buy alcohol because we don't trust them with a beer And we're going to allow them to change their gender via surgery at 15 Well, since you go along with exactly what you're saying it doesn't even you know It doesn't matter what anyone says or or even what what parents would say, you know in this country You could you can't marry off your 13 year old there are some countries Well, though where they will do this you can't marry off your 13 year old to somebody right? That's against the law It is against the law because you don't believe that a 13 year old can consent to any kind of sexual relationship with any person with any adult right and Yet, we you know, we don't we understand why that exists and that's obviously very important And yet with this issue we think that a 13 year old should be able to consent to life Life altering what if a 13 year old were to say, you know, I want to get massive Breast implants our doctors gonna come along and say, you know what that's a good idea I mean I would say that too for people out there who are upset Uh about this perspective that we have I mean I don't think that if you are straight and you are a 14 year old girl And you wanted to get breast implants. I think that would be crazy, right? If you want to get it when you're 18 years old, okay But the idea that we would be having surgery to fundamentally alter a young teenager's body in any way Even if you're heterosexual and you just want I mean that that to me seems to be total madness They're introducing this to children because they know they're malleable because they know that children's minds are susceptible to persuasion ways That adults are not and because they want to create a perception that this is a much more widespread situation And also should be a much should be a celebrated situation By the way, doctor or dr. Mckew again. I would recommend anybody go and and check out He's written the wall street journal on this. I mean he was that of course he's the wokesters have gone after him now They reopened the john's uh hopkins university. It used to be the you know, the uh transgender surgery cli now It's the gender affirmation clinic. They've all they've gone woke there But but clay you would say Psychiatrists have completely abandoned the field to the woke left on this one a lot of them are very woken left wing Anorexia nervosa, which you're right about anorexia is a psychological disorder in which somebody believes that they are Uh, they are essentially too fat no matter what right and that they're ugly and horrible because they're too fat no matter what Everybody understands that that's something that and people will die from this right? They'll restrict their food until they actually will will have a organ failure Everyone understands that good medical care is not to say well, that's your you know, if you if you think so no, of course not There are psychological conditions that exist where the affirmation of what the person believes is actually doesn't matter how closely held The belief is it's actually not good medical practice and that's exactly what dr. Mckew was saying. So This is again, but again, this is for kids They're going after the kids clay and that's the part of this that I think is I It's even honestly there even more extreme on this than I had anticipated and I thought they were lunatics So I don't even know what he said the white house the statement that we played from jen saki is it should be jaw dropping for Anybody out there listening to us right now that that's considered Mainstream perspective of the democrat party right now. It's crazy. All right. We'll come back into uh more including on the border here in just a moment Chaotic world events are not kind of the stock market look it's been rough Last few months your 401k is probably getting hit you see where inflation is right 7% give or take and probably going up too, especially the democrats can get some more that crazy spending underway How can you protect some of the assets that you have? How can you prepare for this volatile financial future that we're entering here gold real gold and silver? I buy my gold from the oxford gold group They've made it so you can have real gold and silver delivered to your home If it's gold or silver you've purchased you can easily take delivery now The same kind of thing can happen with your ira or 401k real gold and silver into your retirement accounts The oxford gold group will beat any competitors price on silver platinum and palladium Get gold you can hold or get real gold in your ira or 401k today Call the oxford gold group today request your free precious metals investment guide all you have to do Is dial pound 250 on your cell phone And say the keywords gold ira you'll receive your precious metals investment guide directly to your phone Simply dial pound 250 and say the keywords gold ira Welcome back in clature avis bucks ex and show appreciate you guys hanging out with us on friday Encourage you to go subscribe to podcast help us set a new record in april nearly 13 million of you Downloaded the podcast in the month of march a new all-time high for the show You can search out my name clay travishing search out bucks sexton, but what percentage of americans? Do you think would agree with our? discussion when we said hey If you're under 18 years old you shouldn't get any form of gender reassignment surgery 75 or 80 percent. I think I may even be higher than that Um, and and the reason why I bring it up is what they are trying to do Is convince you that you are on the fringe Outside of the mainstream of society If you have that opinion and that it is an unacceptable opinion to have and it is a very calculated Choice to be making uh and again. I am saying and everybody else Uh, everybody out there can have different opinions on this Just wait until you're 18 years old wait until you are 18 years old till you've reached the age of majority To have surgery like this now. I think it probably would be better to wait even longer because just to kind of Make certain that you want to make a choice that is that long lasting in your life Would be my opinion But the idea that we're allowing under 18 year olds to be treated like this to be treated as if this is a medical condition Is a fringe idea that they're trying to make it seem like is not a fringe idea That's the clear intent right now and can we just be clear? It's obviously A radical change that they're proposing to societal norms here And so instead of admitting that and saying hey, it turns out there's this whole new realm of of belief and science and ideology That means that kids, you know can be trans at age six or age four and need to be told about this They just say do what we say or else you're a bigot. I mean that that's the way they go on offense right away They act like we're the crazy people and and clay No 10 year old thinks about gender hormone or transition surgery without adults Advocating for it and there are already states where if you don't gender affirm if you gender I mean first of all, I don't even like that terminology because it's actually it's transition. It's not a firm It's it's not even really change. It's doing something else to yourself And if you don't do that you can be held liable under state law Yeah, and look at what senator chris murphy is trying to do We just said and buck and I may not be perfectly right on this But I think 75 to 80 is a reasonable number of american adults that believe that children should not be treated With gender changing Drugs which injured trit changing surgeries when they are minors well senator chris murphy he wants you to know This is the trump wing Of the republican party that has declared war against transgender kids. That's what they're saying. Listen to this all across america Republicans not all republicans, but the trump wing of the republican party has declared a war Against transgender kids and these children Have noticed a recent survey of transgender youth showed that half of them 52 at contemplated suicide Over the last year just think about that for a second my colleagues Half of all the kids who are transgender come to the conclusion at some point in their young lives That they would be better off dead Than live in a world that believes they are threats to be marginalized or expunged So senator He's a moron Let me let me start with this clay and also does he know the data on the long-term implications of suicide For people who do transition because their suicide rate is astronomically higher after transitioning by the way Because there is I believe the idea that if sometimes people make the decision If I just changed this then everything would be perfect in my life Everybody out there knows and sometimes it can be true right? Sometimes if you're an alcoholic and you stop drinking alcohol your life can change in a big way There are things you can do that represent substantial changes that make you healthier that make you better off If you're a drug addict and you leave behind drugs But there are a lot of people I think who are unhappy teenagers 13 or 14 years old and they think oh The reason why I'm unhappy is because i'm not comfortable in my own skin and my own gender If I just change my gender, I'd be happy And then what happens bucks some of these people change their own gender and then they aren't any happier But the idea here is not that you say that transgender kids are awful or they don't deserve respect You just say wait until you are an adult to make a life changing choice just like we do with married You know a doctor or a q-cell? Or driving a car Yeah, new dr. McCue says about about trans children They just need love and good parenting and support until they're adults and then see where they are Yeah, that's pretty straightforward. That's infinitely rational That's the choice. I think that should be made everywhere when we come back the border Unfortunately is a mess. We're gonna also head up to Alaska and talk to senate candidate kelly shabaka I think you guys are going to enjoy that that's coming up next Clay Travis and bucks exon on the front lines of truth oh"
