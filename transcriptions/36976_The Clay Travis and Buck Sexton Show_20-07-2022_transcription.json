    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast third hour of the clay end bucks show is here everybody Thanks for rolling with us One thing that the Biden administration does have going forward right now. I suppose It's not like we can Look at them and say that they control everything but one good thing is we're not in the midst of a war So that's good The end of the Afghan war was obviously a debacle under the Obama under the Biden administration decision-making but Situation in Ukraine has not yet brought us into conflict with Russia. So That's good Although I don't think the Biden administration's handling that well at all at least we're not at war I bring enough because as we talk about a lot of what's being done by this White House and the Constant pushing of wokeness whether it's diversity and inclusion training for all government employees and the constant focus on the issue of white privilege all throughout the federal bureaucracy which I hear about From friends of mine. We're still in for example the intelligence community. Oh, there's all this concern with confronting white privilege So wait, I I'm working in the intelligence community. I thought we're trying to keep America safe I don't think I need a history lesson on white privilege every every you know time we have some kind of HR meeting This is very real and the the intel community. I can tell you which is you know CIA NSA DIA There's 16 I think they might have even added one but there used to be 16 intelligence agencies There's a lot of them the military services all have their own intelligence Branch and then there's a whole bunch of others a lot of letters a lot of acronyms But they're quite woke not only at the HR level but also at the level of executive decision-making authority the the people that run these agencies now have been picked specifically because they go along with the diversity and inclusion rhetoric and belief system and this is true also of our military and We are seeing something that is just by the numbers a real challenge Clay going forward. This is from the Associated Press Army cuts force Army cuts the force size and made unprecedented battle for recruits and unprecedented challenge in getting new recruits to join the United States military Okay, here's what we're looking at right now. They're projecting in the army. They're gonna have a total force of 466,000 down from the expected 476,000 All in It's looking like they're gonna only achieve half of their goal recruiting goal of 60,000 Soldiers for this fiscal year. So they're down tens of thousands from the goal The force structure is eventually going to have to take into account whether it's brigade combat teams other military formations and and entities That they don't have the ability to recruit what they who they need to fill those ranks. They're changing Clay all the time now, you know, oh no, they're trying to change You know, no high school diploma of any kind or GED or maybe we'll make an exception tattoos on your hands in your face Maybe we'll make an exception. They're making all of these shifts body fat Requirements for body fat percentage because you know military fighting being fit. This is all tied in together The people who I talked to and we have a lot of current and former war fighters in our audience and the people I talked to say folks who would be you know the guy who was the You know defensive tackle on the on the college or high school football team would want to go and be an army ranger Wants to be a war fighter saying I don't want to do this. I'm not gonna sign up given what's going on here given their firing Thousands and thousands of national guard members over the vaccine given that we're gonna get constant lectures about diversity and inclusion or the threat of white supremacy from inside of the United States military, which is an actual thing that they Lecture people about I think we got a big problem here. I Think it's a massive problem And I think it's a massive problem that cuts across so many different parts of American life and let me explain what I mean here We want the best military possible. What's the number one goal the military that I think almost every American should agree on We want people who can kick ass we want people who are bad asses and When you allow the target to move from we want ass kickers to we want people who represent the overall population of American life Everybody is not equally adroit and adept at serving in the military and We shouldn't try to create a military that is designed to fulfill a cosmetic diversity quotient when it doesn't fulfill the ultimate goal that is underlying Which is to be the most proficient at kicking ass possible and I'll tie it into a story I don't know if you saw this this morning buck it is turned into a massive story in England That there are too many white women on the English women's national team And I saw this story and I thought it perfect and soccer I saw this story and I thought to myself this perfectly epitomizes where we are as a nation No one is arguing right now. Oh these girls are not talented enough the argument is they aren't diverse enough and I want to read the the athletic had a big story about this and I thought it tied in well with the struggles that our Military is having right now. Here is the headline that was up on the athletic which is now owned by the New York Times England's women's soccer team has been successful in recent years But the team doesn't look like the country it represents its players are almost all white and it has a long way to go to improve diversity Why the hell do you care what the race of the soccer team is if they're the best soccer players in the world and There is a difference and I think this is significant and a lot of people miss it There's a difference between providing equal opportunity and getting equal results You could have a completely diverse and representative football team NFL team in America Half of them could be women 60% of them could be white 13% of them could be Hispanic 4% Asian that team would lose Every single football game they played buck because they aren't the best possible football team And I tie it in with our military Because we are focused now not on creating the greatest fighting force in the world We're focused on trying to make the fighting force look like America that oftentimes doesn't correspond And I think it's why a lot of people are not going to work in the military I remember being in Iraq as a civilian CIA analyst many years ago and being on US military bases And there were big placards, you know diversity is our strength And I mean I remember spending time with these guys and gals and their strength was actually strength and being badasses and willing to go out there and Defend each other and defend US interests and and just kick some ass I don't care what the military looks like from a demographic perspective I want the United States military to have pilots who can shoot down Chinese fifth generation fighters Which may become a big thing for us in the years ahead I want green bureys and navy seals and army Rangers and an airborne Who can do you know a hundred push-ups like it's nothing carry their rucksack for 15 miles? Engage the enemy shoot them at 200 yards with iron sights I mean I want the best of them and by the way that is what our military has for a long time been producing here It's what they should be it's the job, but now we're starting to see a shift in focus And I think that shift in focus is a big part I'm not saying it's the only part but a big part of why it is that you have people who Again are the war fighters because the other part of this is that a lot of people certain military services military service But there are people who are serving in much more Logistics capacities which is that's honorable service. I'm not putting that down But they're never gonna be outside the wire. They're never gonna be shot at they're never gonna be in harm's way The people who are war fighters are Overwhelmingly in my experience the door kickers. They're people who when they're told that you know six-year-olds in school need to be lectured on trans ideology and that there needs to be you know mixed Units of male and female infantry on the front lines all this different gender identity stuff. They do not go along with that I Think you're a hundred percent right buck and we know that our foremost enemies do not go along with that China and Russia and Iran are not recruiting people into their militaries by Advertising pronouns. That's what's going on right now in our United States military advertising. It is this woke diversity and inclusion propaganda and I think somebody you probably saw this. I think we even like might have texted it back and forth the way that Russia is recruiting soldiers right now is We want the baddest ass of the badass. This is before I think they invaded Ukraine but China's trying to do the same thing and The way that we're recruiting soldiers is by saying we're gonna make sure that we respect your pronouns And I'm sorry if you're 17 years old and you are trying to decide what you want to do with your future Most people want to try to become elite. They want to become elite at something There's a great deal of demand especially in young men to find a way to finally Their bodies take their minds to a different level all of that They don't want to sit around and talk about pronouns of white privilege And I think that goes across all the way by the way white black Asian Hispanic the badasses among us Do not want to be recruited into a woke military and I think it's a massive issue with why we're having trouble recruiting If you're out there and you're either current you're personally You know a door kicker served in the US military or you are close to people who are and you're here in the same thing Or you're somebody who was kind of joined up even and said, you know what? I've decided that I'm gonna drop out. I'm not gonna read list I don't want to be a part of this anymore I'd be curious to hear about it because I hear from people who are saying this all the time that they think this is really damaging The ethos of wokeness from the top down of the military brass is really damaging The esprita core and the recruitment of the people that you really need Which is the people who are gonna run run toward the sound of the machine gun fire The woke virus destroys and I think you use this phrase almost exactly yesterday buck the woke virus destroys everything it touches and Trying to turn our military into a woke military is going to destroy its fighting ability just like it's destroying frankly many different companies out there from the inside and we can either talk about this and be honest about it as we do clay or We can wait until we lose a war and then we're gonna have a whole bunch of other problems folks You know start working on your Mandarin No doubt just get People who can kick ass into our military and encourage ways to get more ass kickers into our military Instead of trying to tell people their pronouns matter my pillow having the biggest possible cell out there right now on bedsheets Your opportunity to refresh your home some great products sell is on their perks Cal sheets that are available in a variety of colors and sizes.

The same award that believe it or not a former male swimmer at the University of Pennsylvania has also been nominated For and they swim against each other and I think you're gonna want to get your popcorn for this upcoming interview But buck we were just talking and I was curious about About military enrollment signups everything else you went into the CIA coming out of college because a 9-a-lake of 9-11 Yeah, if you were You're if you're 21 right now Would you want to go into the military into CIA based on what you are seeing of the services right now? I mean, I'm I could have a college age child right now I mean, I don't but I could and and if my kid said Should I consider a career in the US intelligence agency right now? I would I would discourage it so I can't I mean I obviously haven't served in the military people wonder how did I the CIA was totally my idea? 9-11 happened it was an attack on America and it felt like an obviously a Call to action for a lot of us and I just thought the best way that I could help I had a background in Middle Eastern politics and history and was studying Arabic before 9-11 even happened So I thought I could help by essentially finding the bad guys and sending in our war fighters to you know To get them and help them find the bad guys that was just my that was my thinking you know, I'm gonna be kind of the bird dog for our shooters to go get the bad guys and I would not tell somebody right now go Joy in the intelligence community a very see I heard this from a friend of mine a very senior CIA officer that I'd worked for Left recently well and while walking out of the building said something to the effect of I got sick of all the lectures about how I need to be sorry for being a straight white male Which is the at I mean again it goes to what's the essence of your job if you're losing talented people because you're focused on diversity Inclusion which has nothing to do with the essence of the job Then the organization itself is failing and John and Washington state called in John you spent 34 years in the military What are you seeing and hearing from people who may be multi-generational military families? Well, I can't speak for all of them, but I was proud to serve my father served in military I did for 34 years at back of duty My son has served in the military my son-in-law my grandson We're basically a military family But the military that we have nowadays is not the military that most of us served in Between the vaccination mandates and all the lokeness I think fathers and grandfathers mostly are telling their their sons and daughters and grandsons and granddaughters if they're if asked is Don't join the military and so I think I think that has a lot to do with the military not meet and recruitment levels Well, thanks for your service Would you have ever believed so you got in 34 years ago? Would you ever believe that you would have been in the position of telling your kids and your grandkids? Hey, I don't think it's worth it based on the culture that's been created in the military No, and I mean I was proud to serve as my whole family was but it's it's just changed drastically And the Afghanistan debacle was a big big part in it John, thank you for your service. I'm a clay this just oh, well, we have all the here we go James in Pennsylvania James, what are your thoughts on this 24 years active duty? Oh, do we not have James I thought we had James James. Yes, sir. Go ahead. We got about a minute. Oh Okay, hey, listen, I was about I was in I took the screwy way My father and I both listened to the Russian ball for 30 years And I think the first time I got to talk to anybody But as far as the military goes nowadays There's still a lot of people out there that know this country is worth fighting for and they're not afraid to show their colors and and I have a lot of gratitude for them and I can say this being I was a drill sergeant too For a while and let me tell you something the troops when you get out there and you train them properly they perform Well, we got some optimism from James. Thank you for your service or 24 years for a master sergeant Thanks for calling in. I mean, maybe it's just the you know the American Patriots isn't clay is the one thing one thing We can rely on even if the system itself is making it harder for those folks come back to more on this with Riley gains in a moment Thanks to people like you the time of the Towers Foundation delivers on its promise to do good and never forget the sacrifices of America's greatest heroes Heroes like officer familiar who couldn't wait to join the NYPD to protect her community She proudly wore her uniform, but was ambushed and shot in line of duty solely because of that uniform She is survived by three children including a daughter who was 20 at the time of the murder The daughter became the guardian and provider for her twin siblings who were 12 at the time Thanks to your generosity Tell the towers gave her children a mortgage-free home some families The foundation brings them comfort the comfort of knowing they can stay in the home They made memories with a fallen loved one for other families the foundation enables new memories to be cherished forever Help our nation's greatest heroes and their families join us in donating $11 a month to tunnel the towers at t2t.org That's t the number two tea.org clan.

Sorry. You've had to deal with some nonsense around it What was your first reaction to hearing that Leah Thomas was put forward by the University of Pennsylvania as NC double a woman of the year? Yeah, it was just this feeling of heartbreak. I really thought this would never happen But of course the NCAA proved me wrong yet again Just thinking of all those amazing female athletes that you've been who lost out on this this nomination For the most elite the pinnacle achievement and all collegiate athletics To someone who's always spent maybe 5% of their lives as a female and I'll say that with quotations around it It's incredibly just just heartbreaking Clay what percentage of people out there in the women's swimming when you would have conversations with them would say I Completely agree with everything that you are saying but they were terrified to actually say that publicly Definitely the majority obviously I cannot speak for absolutely everyone but There's there was few encounters I had where people did not thank me or agree with me I actually had a ton of Thomas's teammates reach out to me and just thank me because what they have to go through every day They said it's really taking a toll on them It rather can you tell us about that like what what do what are they when they're saying what they have to go through? What are some of the things that the actual female athletes on that team are dealing with? Well one the locker room situation It's incredibly uncomfortable It just kind of puts them all in a place that they didn't sign up to be in and so they're threatened they're intimidated their coaches Obviously quiet them down. I actually saw an email that the Ivy League sent out to The swimmers that said if you feel uncomfortable seeing male genitalia in the locker room You should seek counseling and so what an infringement I mean that just seems like it should be illegal. She doesn't know Yeah, look I and I think that's kind of crazy and I want to circle back around on it because I think our audience may not even be aware of this Not only does Lee at Thomas get to claim that that that she is now a woman But that he is a she clay. Yeah, it's all crossed up right But he is using the women's locker room as well and still has male genitalia. I mean this is crazy town stuff Right and under Biden's new administration of child 9 It's actually sexual assault now to refer to a transgender As the wrong pronouns, but it is not sexual assault to have male genitalia in the female locker room And my understanding from I saw reporting on this is that Leah Thomas Still claims sexual attraction to women, right? So you're having to get Undressed if not you because you weren't on that team But if but a woman on the u Penn team would have to be getting you know It's a swim team getting fully naked next to an adult male with male genitalia who is still attracted to women because he has long hair now Right, I actually talked with girls who have dealt with sexual assault in the past In the locker room situation at in siblings was enough to cause enough trauma to where they actually had to Seek some help again Which is just crazy. We've gotten to this point So Riley, where does this go because one of the big questions that's out there? You you probably have heard this from people as well is a why do you care? Well, my answer was always this is leading to men taking over and beginning to dominate women's athletics because they're bigger Stronger faster. Let's just talk about the competition element of this. I believe Leah Thomas is six foot three six foot four How much fairness in competition is there for you a woman who has swam for her entire life I bet you started when you were four or five years old training for this to suddenly be competing against someone who was A male swimmer up into a year or two ago And now they're the greatest women swimmer ever from a purely competitive perspective What is that like and what advantages exist for Leah as a swimmer that do not exist for the other women you swim against? Right. So obviously there's the the blatant physical advantage of just height, but that Clearly is not everything a sport like swimming. There's certain aspects like your aerobic capacity Your capacity all of those things men have larger hearts men have larger lungs And that's not something that would ever change with testosterone fuckers.

Guy still has male genitalia walking around in the locker room still attracted to women at some point I Just continue to to to slam at home if you are running or working on a campaign in a governor's race Senate race congressional race heck all the way down to a school board race and you're running against the Democrat I'm just telling you one question in most of the country right now can win you the election and that is Ask your opponent can men get pregnant Democrats want to claim to the party of science They got dudes with male genitalia swimming against girls getting nominated for The women's athlete of the year. What do you what do you think clay the crossover is? between People who won't answer the can or actually will say yes men can get pregnant. Yes People who will say yes men cannot break say it's not an important question. It's a distraction Yeah, they'll just evade it But if they but if they do answer and say yes who also will tell you that shots 5 6 7 and 8 are the ones that really kick in and protect you hashtag. I think it's a hundred percent. I think that there is a leap of faith across all science and all data and all logic Democrats have become a party of insanity I really mean it and would you have ever believed that we would be in this day and age having conversations About whether or not men can get pregnant AOC got fake arrested yesterday or fake handcuffed yesterday She would tell you that men can get pregnant If she were on the show with us right now, she would say it she would mean it in her heart It's you would tell you that you were a bigot for asking the question remember that's it's not even that they're trying to win converts they're hunting heretics if you deviate from this you're a bad person They're not sitting there saying hey Clay and Buck let's have a conversation about what it actually means to be a man Who is pregnant? No, no, no, it's how dare you you're a bigot You're as bad as somebody who's a racist because you think that a uterus is necessary for having a baby Positive I was just reading during the commercial break The vast majority of Americans agree with us white black Asian Hispanic gay straight Democrat or Republican honestly that this woke virus is Destroying everything it touches and if you are actually anti-woke if you move in the opposite direction if you were pro America Top-gun Maverick buck. I was just reading one of the most successful movies ever If you haven't seen it and you want to just be entertained for a couple of hours and get away from everything Go watch it. I guarantee you'll like it Tom Cruise on track to make over a hundred million dollars Yellowstone is the number one show on television. They won't nominate it for an Emmy It's pretty decidedly anti-woke in nature if you are willing to Throw up the middle finger in the direction of the woke ideology to give it the Heisman show up into the distance The market will reward you we're seeing it with this show biggest in radio We're seeing it all over the country Buck our Hollywood studios so committed to their ideology of wokism that They are unwilling to take all of the money that they can make by just making us decent movies and television shows That don't try to tell us America's awful and focus almost exclusively on woketiology I worry because some of these you you look at Amazon and Netflix and these epicenters of wokeness And and what you find is that they're so dominant now in the space of content creation That it's a little bit like Okay, well if they're the if they're the ones that can tell you what the only products are on shelf Even if you don't like them at the end of the day They may be able to make enough money because they control the market which good which brings us back to why aren't there more? Why aren't there more conservative content creators at that level and that's a whole big discussion We've been having that on the right for a long time But clay this has been clear for a for a long time every every time. I mean it's it's remarkable every time There's some independent studio or that or you know that that makes something that has I don't know like a history of the Bible Or you know something that has some biblical themes in it that goes into you know Christianity at a positive light Or just is a story about somebody whose whose faith was inspiring or whatever and it makes all this money at the box office The libs are like what movie we didn't even what that wasn't even a movie didn't even exist didn't even happen if they do review it They're like all this is crash the acting is so bad if they wanted to make money They would look at the formula and say let's do more of this They don't want to make that kind of money or rather They don't want to make money doing it that way. They think they can make enough money by you know Shovelling wokeness and more pansexual cartoon characters at us. It's wild, but because I did this in my own life without kick I Was disgusted by the what I call the knife fight of Woke-ism in sports and I know a lot of you out there are sports fans still and you know what I'm talking about every media outlet every media figure Constantly lecturing you about diversity and inclusion and racism and gender issues and all this stuff And I just made a website and found that a company were like yeah, hey We like sports and we're saying and we're dominating. I know what else did it. I haven't I have an important Yes, and the market rewarded you handsome. Yeah, that's right. I Have an update for you in the AOC fake arrest story. I knew there was going to be some There would be some laughable X because it was so stupid the whole thing right AOC tweeted this straight from the source No faking here Putting your hands behind your back is a best practice while detained handcuffed or not to avoid escalating charges like resisting arrest I Mean not only is she an imbecile. She's a fraud folks a fraud But she could do an Instagram live right now and there'd be more people watching her than watch MSNBC and then I'll be saying And they're all so dumb and I feel badly for them they should listen to this show they would learn something I Rarely pay attention to AOC But after that you're my favorite big booty Latina video, which was up I think last week, right I went into the comments and buck the number of what appeared to be male Twitter accounts Just It's like they were desperately asking for her to date them when you read these comments It's like well if he had said that to me and you were my girlfriend I would have punched him right in the face. Oh, she's got like 900 She is the the most if you are a beta male with Ukraine flags and yes double masking selfies and if your profile photos you in an N95 and you announce your pronouns to Everybody all the time AOC is The dream woman. I mean she is the absolute best you could ever imagine and hope for if you happen to be one of those guys It is fun. I just loved reading their comments because first of all You're not gonna get to date the girl that you're making the comments about in the in the social media accounts Alright, that's not unless you're also famous and rich. She's not gonna be like, you know Mateus 4 6 4 6 9 2 3 with the Ukraine flag and the triple mask profile pick You're the guy I've been dreaming of dating forever. It's just next level pathetic The men who are like throwing themselves at AOC's feet in the comments. I couldn't help but enjoy it so I got to tell you folks we have the Audio action to share you tomorrow of the CEO of Starbucks Who is telling everybody not only have they closed 16 stores stores that were making them money But it is because Democrats who run different cities all over the country have decided to stop enforcing the law and More Starbucks closures are coming because these Starbucks locations are unsafe Play and Buck. It's a perfect example. They ran their company for decades almost Setting policies in place that made them very popular and beloved then they got woke and now they're going broke in those stores Clay Travis and Buck Sexton on the front lines of truth"
