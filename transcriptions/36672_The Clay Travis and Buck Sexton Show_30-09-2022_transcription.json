Well, I decided it was time for me to investigate precious metals from Oxford Gold Group. You're now an owner of precious metals from Oxford Gold Group? I am. They make the process of purchasing and taking delivery of gold and silver to your home very easy. And they're equally competent in answering questions on values. And whether placing gold into your 401k is the right move or taking physical delivery of gold and or silver to your home is right for you as well. Whatever amount you want to buy, you need to reach out to OxfordGoldGroup at playbuckgold.com. Our names playbuckandthewordgold.com. Major phone carriers make you sign contracts with rigid data plans to trap you into a kind of forced phonogamy. Sounds pretty insecure if you ask me. At Consumer Cellular, we believe in a more consensual and healthy form of phonogamy. Free of contracts and more flexible to your data needs. This way, you stick around not because we force you to with contracts and fees, but because you love our phone plans. Like, ardently, love our phone plans. Phonogamously. Consumer Cellular.

Well, Georgia as well as this storm, Ian now comes in on the Atlantic Seaboard and crosses those states over the next several days when all of you to stay safe and hope that if you were in the midst of Hurricane Ian in Florida that you are able to find the help that you need to get started on rebuilding down in Florida and we're not going to let this story disappear. We will be helping out many of you in Southwest Florida in particular as we get into the next week and become able to see what needs to be done in particular to get people back up on their feet down there. Buck, a bunch of other things we're going to get into in the next couple hours and Colter's going to be in studio with us. Ainsley Earhart from Fox and Friends, who many of you start your mornings with will also be in studio with us here in New York City. We're about to give you some updates here in this hour on the ongoing battles in the Senate as trend lines continue to break in the direction of Republicans even though a lot of people out there have not talked about it to a great extent. We'll give you some of the latest data out there polling and gambling lies on many of these elections. But one of the guys who writes for me at Outkick, Joe Kinsey, has done a fantastic job, Buck, covering much of this transgender insanity as it pertains to athletics. And I just want to share a story that he posted in the last hour from the state of Vermont. There is a boy who has decided that he identifies as a girl that is using the women's locker room in a high school in Vermont. And this is in Burlington, Vermont, Randolph High School. The girls complained because a boy who identifies as a girl was using the locker room and changing with the girls. Parents and athletes raised concerns with the school. And what do you think happened? The transgender protections out there essentially said the biological girls, the girls were the problem. And email said, there's plenty of space. This went out to the school. But they said, because of Vermont law, there is quote plenty of space where students who feel uncomfortable with the laws may change in privacy. If you are a girl who was uncomfortable with there being a boy who is using your locker room, if he identifies as a girl, there is no way for you to use your locker rooms now in Vermont. And the reason why I think these stories matter, Buck is we hear all the time, Oh, there's no issue with transgender athletes out there. And then we see we got a dude winning the women's swimming championships in the NCAA. And slowly, this is becoming a reality all over the country where boys decide to identify as girls. And I mean, it sounds like a made up ridiculous story. But they now are able to have equal access to women's locker rooms. And when the girls complain, they say, well, there's other places you could go if you need privacy inside of your locker room. I mean, what kind of crazy world are we living in when we're allowing this to happen? First of all, the most, well, the most dishonest argument is when they say men can get pregnant, right? I mean, the most dishonest arguments when they say they plan Parenthood, Dr. said yesterday, testify. You know what, actually, let's just I wasn't going to go here right now, but you're right, Clay. We should just let everyone know plan Parenthood of Texas said yesterday on Capitol Hill that yeah, this is a doctor saying men can get yes. Let's just keep it real simple. Dr. Kumar, can biological men become pregnant and give birth? So men can have vertencies, especially trans men. First of all, why men can have pregnancies like he's asking a question. Can men be pregnant? The answer is no. Yes. At some point in the future with new technology or whatever, maybe they'll be able to do womb transplants, et cetera. We were discussed that Dr. Artica Kerry told us that. Yeah, it was pretty mind-blowing. At that point, I guess we will have to say it is theoretically possible. It is not even theoretically possible right now for this to happen, meaning it's not even something that science can do. So you have doctors who are lying to Congress, but really they're trying to change the plain meaning of languages where they get into the difference in sex and gender and all these things that they've just made up five minutes ago. But one of the so that's the most dishonest argument. But another one is to the point about the women changing at this high school, at this high school, they say it's not a big problem. The most dishonest, leftists, especially you see some of these leftists pundits who want to pretend like they're tough guys and they'll be like, yeah, that's right. Men can get pregnant. It's like, no one even cares about this. We'll say it's not even really an issue. That's a lie. Yes. It's a lie because they want to amend Title IX to include gender identity. So they want to change federal law to this end. So if it isn't really a thing and whenever we talk about it, this is just hide the football, so to speak. This is just, you know, oh, the moment that there's focus on it, they don't want to have to defend it. So they pretend that it's not really an issue at all. They're trying to amend Title IX. The Biden administration was pushing for this. They want to do it. So that's a huge sweeping federal law. And on top of that, I would add, notice how there's never any consideration given to the feelings put aside for a second. I spoke to Riley Gaines. You're right with her. Yes. Thank you, sir. Oh, she's very former Kentucky swimmer who was on with Rand Paul and she is speaking out against the idea of biological men being able to compete against women. So usually this debate becomes, well, okay, maybe she had to share the podium with a biological male. She's been a great swimmer. You know, it's not like there's millions of dollars to take that. They try to minimize losing to a transgender female as though that's not a big deal. In this case, and that the feelings of the woman should be made secondary to the need to be inclusive. That's right. But in this case, it's home on a second. Why does a transgender male, why is it so important that a transgender male has to change in a female locker room and such that the females in that locker room, their feelings are irrelevant. That's right. This is what's going on in this high school. This is what's happened in many other of these cases. It's, oh, you're uncomfortable with this. Women too bad. We have an agenda here. We're lunatic leftists, and this is the way it's going to be. They never take into account. I mean, you know, if I had like a, if I had a 13 or 14 year old daughter, yes, and there was a 14 year old boy changing next to her, I would have a problem with that. And she would have a problem with that. And that doesn't make them bad people or doesn't make her a bad person. It just means that they're reflecting on the separation of the genders as a privacy issue and a respect issue. And notice that there's no respect given to these women. It's obey the trans agenda or else. Yeah. And I think one way to think about it for everybody out there, first of all, the policy as it's written in Vermont says a transgender student should not be required to use a locker room or restroom that conflicts with the student's gender identity. So if you are a boy who decides that he is a girl, you cannot be made to use the boys locker room. But Buck, to me, the way to think about this, that, that makes a lot of senses at some point tolerance expands to such an arena that it becomes intolerant of other people's opinions. And that's the good way to think about this. Like the idea is this transgender student has to have his decisions tolerated to such an extent that the girls own opinions are considered to be intolerant, right? At some point you have conflicting spheres here where tolerance infringes upon the rights of someone else to be comfortable. And for the most part, I think everybody out there listening to us right now, the idea of a 15 or 16 year old boy just deciding to say he's a girl. And he's going to use the girls locker room is crazy. When any of us, especially if you are, I would say pretty much 25 or older, anybody who's in the 25 or older camp, if you would ever even tried this, you probably would have gotten arrested Buck. If you are an 18, 19 year old and you walk into a women's locker room for most of human history, you would be arrested for trespassing. There will be all sorts of laws that you were violating. Now you're protected class. This is crazy. Think about this as well. Why is it? This is all based in this in this high school story talking about, but this has happened in other cases as well. And it's happening all over the country right now. People forget. I mean, the Obama administration was was really a huge surge toward all of this. It was under Obama's second term that they, I believe he even said, I know it was from the White House. I think Obama himself essentially threatened to pull federal funding from the school system in was it, I was getting confused. It was North or South Carolina, North Carolina, right? Yeah, North Carolina. They were going to pull federal funds over the bathroom policy over this exact issue over. But just as we think this through, why is it that consideration for the emotional needs of a person who is male and has male genitalia exceeds and really erases the emotional needs and the need for safety and dare I say safe space of women in this case as in, why is it? Okay, if we're all supposed to use, you know, call, we're going to call, you know, Bob Jill now and you know, you can change your name fine. And they're going to say, we have to use the female pruning and say, all right, maybe that that's a matter of respect. But why does the burden fall upon women to have to deal with this and the emotional discomfort? Why can't the transgender female in this case just change with the men? It's not that big a deal. They'll say it's not that big a deal to the women. They will not say it's not that big a deal to the transgender men. And we should all ask why. And let's be honest, Buck, there's also now because of these stupid policies, gonna be a bunch of teenage boys who just decide that they're going to identify as girls so they can go change the girls locker room. I mean, this is this is the recipe, the crazy that we are unspooling here does not end. And maybe that's what has to ultimately happen is it becomes so ridiculous that we go back to, Hey, you know, boys and girls need to change separately. I know some, some true leftists. And I do talk to them occasionally about these things, you know, be, uh, all fair and, and in places where I'm just trying to get information. And the real answer to my question, by the way, why is it that the women have to, you know, we ask these questions, we're approaching this rationally. The ultimate answer to all of this is that to be a true believer and it almost requires a religious tran, like a transformation of perception that is religious in nature, a transgender female is a woman the exact same way in the, in the left's mind and the left's methodology, it is a woman 100%, no difference. So in their minds, the true leftist believes that women who don't want to change with a person with male genitals, they're the crazy one. Yeah. And I, and I, and I know that that is an upside down. What, what does Buck say that I'm telling everybody that is the real belief of the left. It's not that we need to make accommodations for trans women. It's that trans women are women period, which is why they say men can get pregnant. And it's also evidence, I think, Buck, of how left wing insanity doesn't stop. They always have to find something more. It really is a slippery slope. Would you have believed a decade ago that we would have fights over people who are deciding boys are deciding to identify as girls and they get to just walk right in the locker room. And if you complain, the Vermont schools shut down the locker room, Buck. Yeah. I mean, they're just like, oh, the only way we can solve this is just not let anybody. So the women suffer the consequences. A hundred percent. The emotional needs and the desire to feel safe of women is irrelevant when the trans agenda is at work. That's what the left is telling. And here's what has to happen. Women have to speak out on this sooner or later. Real women like Riley Gaines is doing. You talk to her on Wednesday. Women have to speak out and go to war over this.

Welcome back Clay and Buck here in New York City and we were actually celebrating my engagement last night. It was a lot of fun. We were we're having a lot of fun here in the city. A lot of people that you all know came by our friends from radio Jesse Kelly was there. I can't name at least a booth tons of Fox News people Carol Mark was David Marcus Ned Ryan. We had people it was awesome. We people flying in from all over the country. You and your parents and family and Carrie your fiance's parents and family. It was an awesome awesome event. It was really cool to see so many different people and they did a fabulous job putting it on. One of the highlights was a friend of mine who's getting a book published on an aircraft carrier a particular aircraft carrier in World War II that had a really unique story got to talk to Carrie's grandfather who was the first and only person to ever land a C-130 on an aircraft carrier and is a highly esteemed and kind of legendary naval aviator. So I put those two of the core. They were having a great time. It was awesome. I met him too. And remember we had was it three generations basically of Top Gun fighter pilots? Three you had on Carrie's out of the family three generations of naval aviator in attendance. Yeah, it's pretty amazing. Yeah, so that was very, very cool to get to meet all those all those people and a lot of the people who have been guests on this show were there and that's always fantastic because we talked to them in the audio sphere. People are all over the country. So it's good to see people face to face. A lot of speaking of which a lot of Fox people at face to face. I haven't been I hadn't been in a place with that many people in that kind of a setting in New York City without masks on. I can't remember when it was. Yeah, you're you because it was an engagement party. Everybody who's ever been to an engagement party or wedding and all those things. It's so hard to talk to everybody, right? Because you are moving constantly and there's so many people you want to talk to and you never feel like you got to talk to was long for people as you wanted to and everything else. But they're so much fun to just see everybody in one place. Yeah, and you know, Carrie convinced me not to have a DJ so I could bring back Gangnam Style for everybody. So we kept it pretty. We just had piano. We kept the very classic, but you know, maybe at the wedding. I don't know. I might have to bust out not the makarina. That's definitely for cruise ships.

We were talking about how awesome it was a good time, right? Yes, I want Buck to just get married every year. We need more parties like that. We had fun putting it together, but I got to say, when you've had a fun event afterwards, one of the great things is you get to just chill for a bit. Yes, I walked in and ran into someone else moving to Florida who asked me, what's it like down there? I've been down there for a while and my life has gotten a lot better since COVID. Look around the room. One third of the people here used to be New Yorkers and now live in Florida. There was a very sizable contingent of New York to Florida corridor there last night. And I think it was probably one of the- Did you go to Florida for the first time? Long time. So you were way ahead of the curve. And now Florida, it feels like- I mean, there was just I saw a story, something like 50,000 New Yorkers in the last year have reloved it. Yes, and they've lost New York City has lost billions of dollars in taxable income. I wrote about it in my UK spectator article because the crime that masks the COVID policies. Well, I used to say really up basically up until COVID that I'd write my books in Florida. If I wanted to have fun, go to LA New York or import LA in New York to me. Nope. Now you're all living there. There's been a lot a lot of my- I won't have to make beds, clean the bathroom. So what's the- We're hoping you're going to give us some good news on the midterms. And as you're seeing it right now, you are a prognosticator of these things. Most famously, of course, on the Bill Marshall, which even he gave you credit for calling the 2016 election when everybody- At first they booed and then they cheered when you came back whenever it was many months later forgetting that one right. And we're seeing right now, Federman Oz, Pennsylvania, this is one where I look at Clay- Because sometimes I have to- I look at Clay for sanity check. Am I crazy? Or is it crazy that anybody could vote for this guy, John Federman? What are you- The poll I think today was a two-point difference between the two. I say that all the time. Who is voting? It's like Michael Moore is running. Yes. He's slovenly. He's always wearing- I mean, this sounds like a minor thing. I'm not even getting to his policies yet. He has tattoos, that ridiculous goatee. He looks like one of those canowuts from the Twilight Zone thing, isn't that what they were called? It's a cookbook to serve man. I don't know. If you were trying to design the worst possible statewide candidate, I think you would pick John Federman. He is not well-spoken because of the stroke, right? But even when he was speaking, he said, I'm a Bernie Sanders clone and he's running for his flanger. Bernie Sanders is more attractive. I can understand Bernie Sanders. All he does, Federman, is suck up to criminals and release proved murderers, vicious murderers who have engaged in anti-Hispanic hate murders. He's out campaigning with them and lying and saying, oh, they were proved innocent. No, they weren't. So we have a theory here that we've been talking about and with the crime issue, which the polls are all showing, this is a big thing, and that fortunately the American people have seen the last few years, this is Democrats. This is theirs. There are lunatic prosecutors, there are lunatic state legislatures that pass whether it's the Nobel thing. Prosecutors are among the very worst. It's really not the cops, although there are far fewer cops. The cops are still trying to do their jobs. There's just a lot less of them because of Democrats. And they can't do anything. I mean, even if they arrest these people and then they get their views criminals and they get released, that's why you have to vote for Zeldin. Yeah, this is on the on the prosecutor side. Anyone who lives in New York or could plausibly claim to live in New York, you have got to register to vote, you have got to vote. I mean, in New York City, people are talking about crime nonstop, because criminals are really helping us out here because they're not slowing down every day. But you talk to right wingers. There's a viral video. No, no, Republican went, yes, yes, a Republican can win in New York state Republicans. Please vote. Zeldin and Oz are my two upset votes for, you know, who knows right now, the polls are pretty close, I think in in both cases, maybe the Democrat is ahead. But these are cases where I think the Republican can stage an upset win. And what we've been talking about is you look at Washington, I think Tiffany Smiley could potentially beat Patty Murray. She's running a really good campaign. Patty Murray is the stupidest center. That's that's that's a bold that is a bold call. I know that's the maybe her own wants a word. I know, I know. And also she looks speaking of, you know, how Federman looks. Look at Patty Murray. She looks like a homeless woman. She knows she just hangs out in front of the library. She doesn't really bother any. She she is. She is. But potentially going to get beat. We got Christine Drayzen, who we had on the show last week, I think in Oregon may end up being the first Republican governor in Oregon. And then Colorado's got some some some spice to it in terms of the governor's race and the Senate race. They're making these Democrats uncomfortable. That's right. And so to your point, what we keep echoing and want to make sure everybody out there, sometimes it's frustrating to lose all the time. Yeah. I mean, if you're in New York, you've seen over those years, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, a lot of losses stack up. And eventually he gets in your mind, you think, oh, we can't win. Why bother? I just get on a jury list. Yeah. No bother this year. Please, please, please, they can win in all those places. I think there could be maybe there isn't maybe I'll be wrong. But I think we all think there could be a secret anti crime vote as there was to get Giuliani in the first time. Giuliani was losing according to the polls, but even liberals on the upper west side just couldn't take the crime anymore. And the crime is way worse now. And I'm sure they told all their upper west side liberal friends, no, I'm voting for Jenkins. I'm voting and then they get into the privacy of the voting booth. And they voted for Giuliani and he saved New York City the rest is history. So please, please vote at one point on which I think you will have to concede to me even with Maisie. Orano, Patty Murray being the stupidest United States center. After the 9-11 attacks, she gave a speech in which she said, well, you have to understand why Osama bin Laden is so appealing to people. He's out there building, you know, health care centers and daycare centers. I don't even remember that. For the people, you know, because he was really into career women. Yeah. Daycare centers. I'm not making that up. Well, here's an encalter here. By the way, she's subscribed to her sub stack. It is always illuminating and spicy. How dumb do you think Kathy Hochl is? Very, very, very dumb. Oh, and point point another point on Zeldin is he needs money. He needs money. He needs money. What is how what is Hochl's advantage? Right now she's the governor and she's utterly, at least from what I've been told by many people. What's the word for it? Oh, corrupt. And so she's hitting up all the big donors in the corporations who have to do business with the state saying, don't you dare give money to Zeldin. So even people who are probably voting for Zeldin won't give him money. And yeah, we all see the videos on Twitter. Um, as horrible as Twitter is, God bless the internet where you can see these videos. No, he gets needs to get that stuff up on TV. So maybe some of you rich people in other states instead of writing another check to Tim Scott could write a check to Lee Zeldin. We had the founder of Libs of TikTok on yesterday by the speaking of the internet and showing things. She's great. It is fascinating to watch how the big tech Democrat left has now gone to the point where when you learn what they think, if it's at the wrong time for them or in the wrong way, it is hate speech now. Yes. It is, it is almost like saying, oh, you guys wrote this manifesto. We're going to pass it around. You can't pass around our manifesto. Yes. All she really does. Yes. Yes. Yes. Um, no, if only Trump had done something about it. By the way, uh, his followers, the candidates before to cut you off, there is a pretty good, uh, no, I sent it out on my sub stack. Yeah. That's what they just sent it. I mean, Ali just texted it to us to make sure that that is a, she's going to do a great research on the Federman comparison. What do you, the Democrats who are still going to vote for this guy? It is pretty crazy. Yes. But the end, they were gigantic beings from like, Mark, some, some planet far away and they, they told the, um, earthlings were here to help you, were here. So everybody also has a certain uncle, but then it turns out it was, they translated the two serve man and right at the last minute, they find out it's a cookbook. So anyway, he is, they all look alike and they all look like Federman and they're gigantic. I mean, but like he is, this gigantic freak with tattoos. And you know, he wasn't paying taxes in the place where he was made. He doesn't know. He doesn't mean taxes and, and he can't, I mean, you see the guy on, on stage, he goes here, I am in Honolulu. It's like, no, that's not right. And why are you, they don't care. He can't speak that bad. And I always pretty bad. I think you're, yeah, yeah, yeah. I saw him. I've seen him interviewed on MSNBC. So don't lower expectations because he can put a couple of sentences together. Look at his record. Look at how he dresses. He had to keep us when he was, um, Lieutenant Governor, um, he had to keep a suit in the office for when he had to, any, you know, complain to them out because all he wears is jeans and the sweatshirt. No, I'm sorry. Bernie Sanders puts on a suit. Yeah. I mean, they're buttoned down. Colors, but it does wear colors and he's not Mr. Release criminals. Bernie Sanders. I don't know why I'm defending Bernie Sanders. He had a lot of Trumpian policies. No, this is Michael Moore running and I don't understand what is the constituency for that soccer. I think a lot of people have not paid attention, candidly. And they're just now becoming aware. And I think Oz is going to end up winning this race comfortably before all of a sudden. I, and I'm also worried and I think you guys should get on. It's one of your, one of your, um, one of the issues you are so good on. I think the media is going to help. Better men get out of a debate because I think that's going to hurt them. There's going to be another going to do the same thing with Biden when they were on Biden, for Biden, um, Biden's not running with me on this one, by the way, because we had on yesterday, Joe Contreting Biden's not running. I'm like, oh, but how, how can the media help them? There'll be another COVID scare. What was our, what was our, we can't do it. Didn't we bet? I was just, we have two of them. You said Trump would be the nominee. We have a steak dinner bed on the other one. I'm not going to say because I'm betting against my interests, but it's a Republican that I was betting is going to lose right now. He's up in the polls. I, who knows what will happen, but I don't want his admit publicly that I'm betting against me. So I'm not betting against him. I'd love for him to win. It's, it's just a bet. And it's not Zeldin. It's not on. It's like, master's gonna. I don't know. I hope so. I hope so. I love autistic, um, candidates and he is, he has this incredibly high IQ. I mean, he is like one of these tech guys like Peter Thiel is helping fund him. He just, I mean, the, the alleged like missteps he has. It's, if you have any really high IQ autistic friends, he's like, oh my gosh, it's the exact same thing. But I think he has the, one of the toughest raises, Blake Masters in Arizona, because he's running against Mark Kelly, who votes with Chuck Schumer, but he doesn't look like Chuck Schumer. Were you, he doesn't do or say anything. We're used to Democrats looking really hateable, like Federman. And Kelly looks like he's a normal. He isn't Arizona. So, so Democrats basically going to lie about what they really think and hide from the public until election day. And they're just hoping people don't realize this. That seems to be the strategy. Yeah, especially when they rerun by. They're definitely, I'm so running, running, viders dropping out at the screen. I just posted a little sub-stack video. It's only a half an hour because apparently people, and I start off with why and how they're going to do the weekend at Bernie's thing, which I will give you a short preview of. Which we get to Bernie's part two Google right now. This is the last time we vote for an all white ticket. That was 2016 when black people said, nope, we're not. They were ticked off that both Hillary and Tim Kaine were white guys. So once they get rid of Joe Biden, they are done with the white guys, the Democratic Party. I mean, blacks give the Democratic Party 90% of the vote. That's never going to change. So just give it up Republicans. But that's why I think they have to do weekend because what do they go to next? AOC Ilhan Omar? It's going to be Gavin Newsom. I disagree with my thing. They're going to go with Gavin Newsom. White guy can't do it. All right, look, we'll come back a little bit here. But if families or friends ever had arguments over politics, always about one politician or another, which policy is best for the country, no one debated whether the country was great or not. That was naturally assumed too often, however, we find ourselves arguing about whether the country's even great about whether we should love America or be ashamed of it. One reason for too many years, too many of our schools have been neglecting teaching young Americans about Americans. Great heritage of liberty. What they're often teaching is a dishonest narrative, which is why Hillsdale College is weighing in for America by offering free online courses such as the great American story, A Land of Hope and Constitution 101, the meaning and history of the Constitution.

President Biden is currently speaking about the hurricane, the devastation from it. He is putting out more warnings for South Carolina to heed the advice of the local authorities there when it comes to preparations for and possible evacuation depending on where people are also detailing the enormous rescue and repair effort that is underway right now already in the state of Florida. We'll continue to watch this. There's not anything from Biden as of right now that is new or newsworthy beyond what we've already told you here on the program. We had Nancy Pelosi with a moment here. This was earlier today on Capitol Hill. I just want to say the immigration issue is in the final weeks or the campaign possibly one that could of the election cycle here make a real difference and I think Democrats realize they have a problem. Here is Nancy Pelosi speaking about immigrants and the recent flights that dropped them off and Martha's vineyards. We have a shortage of workers in our country and you see even in Florida some of the farmers in the growers saying, why are you shipping these immigrants up north? We need them to pick the cops down here. She has such a master servant mindset buck and this is one of the things that I think is you know there's so many events that she does during covid where you would see her raising money and all the rich people were not wearing masks and then all the servant class were walking around in masks and the way she spoke there it's like we're living in a caste system right like where these people are like untouchables that are supposed to just do all the menial jobs that she doesn't even care about. You know pick crops. I mean it sounds like it's something from the 1800s. And Nancy Pelosi has what exactly when it comes to connectivity to the illegal immigrant community in this country. I mean she'll speak about it a lot but to your point Nancy Pelosi thinks that we need to be importing as much low skilled non-English speaking labor from the third world as possible. That that is her immigration policy to be her servant illegally to arrive to be often paid off the books to be not subject to the usual labor regulations and rules the Democrats love to pass in different states and even at the federal level they want to make sure they have cheap labor for you know home domestic purposes cheap labor in the fields. What about supply and demand paying people more paying Americans more dealing with the fact that wages aren't keeping up with inflation. Nancy Pelosi wants to make sure she has a steady stream of servants is really what she's saying here. There's no doubt we come back final hour of the week. Some really good news buck in the gambling odds and in the Senate polling as I really do believe we are working towards building a real red wave. I'll tell you what some of that data is reflecting as we head into the weekends a little bit over five weeks from election day and Anzley Earhart's going to be in studio with us from Fox and Friends should be a good conversation there.
