Uh, we will discuss with him at 230 Uh in the third hour of the program tutor dixon who ran for governor in michigan against gretchen wittmer Uh and lost a close race there. She now is a part of the clay and buck podcast network She will be in studio here in new york city We'll talk about what she sees in the midwest what has to happen in order for michigan to flip back To a red state what has to happen for wisconsin pennsylvania and more We're going to discuss run desantis replacing his campaign manager at some point What does that say for that campaign? Uh, but in a moment here. I want to talk about neo who is an r&b singer that i'm gonna be honest with you guys I'm not familiar with neo's body of workbook. Would you know a neo song buck? No Okay, I tried I thought I do know I I do not know all right There must be one really famous one that we've heard Let's put producer alley on the research train for what neo songs are out there that we may have either you or I heard of I would bet that a large percentage of our audience does not know neo Uh, but i'm gonna play you a clip. I think it's emblematic of a story that I write about an american playbook buck Which is we have opened up an opportunity to take over comedy on the right side of america You just by liking to laugh Democrats have become so self-serious That they don't allow entertainers to actually entertain anymore because there might be a joke that made somebody a little bit uncomfortable And I write about this in american playbook and I just want to do this off the top of the show you guys are amazing Uh top of the second hour buck yesterday. We were ranked 15,422 next uh year you're gonna have your book out Right now we are number 38 If you guys listening to us right now can go to amazon type in clay travis type in american playbook I'm donating all the proceeds to whoever the republican nominee is and i'm taking it a step further because I would love to be number one On all of amazon books This audience I believe can take the book to number one overall if we hit that I will donate 10,000 more dollars To the january six political prisoners out there you are by buying this book helping to fight a battle for sanity Uh, and you can also get uh become a vip and you can get assigned Copy so you can go to amazon right now typing clay travis if you're out there and you're not going to be able to get a signed copy You become a vip you get copies. I've signed all these myself though get shipped out to you I I promise you you'll like them Kids grandkids if you're having trouble talking to them about politics, I bet they will be able to read this book That's what producer alley said Very accessible and it will address many of your concerns if you have kids or grandkids Just get them a book tell them to read it And again I'd love for you guys if you could to drive this to number one overall clay travis on amazon type it in right now It comes up at the top where 38 can we take it to one? All right buck big part of this book. I spent talking about comedy. I like the righteous gemstones I think it's the funniest show on television right now. It's on hbo What do you think's the funniest show on television? No, I've never even I don't mean you know this show at all I've never heard of this has anybody in the studio here if you anybody watch the righteous gemstones Greg raises his hand says he Uh, uh, he's heard of it. This show is really funny, but at times It will make fun of people like me who are from the south and grew up going to church It's basically the idea is like it's a jimmy swagger like character who has created a big church And he has three kids who are total screw-ups that he's trying to find somebody to be able to run the church Uh after he is gone and the gemstones is the name of the family. It's really funny But if you're religious, there are things that you might find to be a little bit offensive Um, it's uh, danny mcbride who I think is hysterical. He played kenny powers for those of you out there What I am seeing happen And I think we're starting to build what is legitimately a tidal wave Remember when ice cube came out and said i'm not going to get the covid shot And he did a sit down with tucker carlson recently ice cubes a famous rapper You're starting to see musicians. I assume I I know his work I am familiar with yes Uh, what you're starting to see is a lot of entertainers comedians in particular are saying we had adam carola was at last week buck They're saying i'm done with this. I'm done with cancel culture I'm done with walking around on my tip toes. Not able to say what I think I want to play this for you This turned into a huge story And I love the way it's turned out but first rnb singer neo Uh commented in an interview. He's a father of multiple kids boys and girls And he uh went after the idea of transgender surgeries. This is cut to I have no issue with with this albi. G. I have no problem with none with no Right, love we love do what you do. I just personally come from an era where a man was a man And a woman was a woman and it wasn't but two genders and that's just how I rocked you could identify as a goldfish if you feel Right I care that ain't my business. It's it becomes my business when you try to make me play the game with you I'm not gonna call you a goldfish, but you want to be a goldfish you go be a goldfish I can't take credit for it, but I heard somebody say one time you're like, all right If your son comes in and says daddy, I want to be a girl ask your son son. What is a girl? What is he gonna do? He's gonna say uh, well, he might he might want to play with dolls All right, you want to play with dolls? Come play with right? You're a boy right? With dolls That's right. We're pink. All right cool. We're pink mature boy. That's right wearing pink That's what got everybody fired up buck Well, it gets him it gets everyone fired up in the activist community in the brainwashed left Because it's so obviously true. Yes, this is why it's so upsetting It's the the notion that and I know he put out initially a statement and now he's walked back That statement or he said forget that he's he's recanted his his bending of the knee as I Publicist put out a statement and that's what I want to play next buck So he put out a statement. I didn't mean to jump ahead Yeah, this is great This is this is uh the the whole progression here really makes you think that maybe the country is not doomed You want to play the yes, but so here's what happened He put out a publicist statement buck And everybody said oh look this rap and the rmb singer neo. He's bending the knee. He's doing everything So he didn't say anything wrong Publicist put out a statement and then he came out. I love this reminds me of what Charles markley claimed that he was misquoted in his autobiography Which is really funny because the way that this works for a lot of people out there most celebrities don't write books I wrote every word in my book book. You're writing every word in your book Most people who write books who are famous don't actually write the books right? They have ghost writers and some don't even know what's in them. That's right and we're turning some conservatives But i'm not i'm not naming theirs. I loved when Charles barkley claimed that he was misquoted in his own autobiography It was just hysterical. Uh you was supposedly wrote the book bud Um, but neo, you know, these guys all have publicists They all have apparatus designed to uh to keep their careers rolling Publicist puts out a statement. He says he had nothing to do with it and he says i ain't apologizing basically Here's cut three first and foremost. I do not apologize for having an opinion on this matter if my opinion offended somebody Yeah, sure. I apologize for you being offended because that wasn't my intention my intention is never to offend anybody. However, i'm entitled to feel how i feel I will never be okay with allowing a child to make a decision that detrimental today life I will never be okay with that. I don't I definitely plan to educate myself a little bit more on this matter However, I doubt that there's any book anywhere or any opinion that somebody's gonna tell me this gonna make me okay We're letting the child make a decision like that That's just period point blank and that's how i feel if i get canceled for this then you know what? Maybe this is a world where they don't need a neo no mo All right, and i've got no problem with that i'm a hustler. I figure it out I I need to create a neo playlist now I'm gonna down the iHeart app. I'm looking up some neo songs I'm excited about listening to neo's whole body work. Look he's totally correct Yes, everything he says is entirely sensible everything that he's putting forward here Makes sense to all the people who are listening right now across across the country And and if you're wondering like how crazy can things get uh, well first off Remember if they can make you say That a man is a woman They can make you say anything correct the most most foundational fundamental observation of reality If they can make you affirm the most obvious untruth They've got you so that's why it's so important I mean, it's it's really tied into the totalitarian mindset that has overtaken the left But just how crazy can this get clay this? This is one of these things. I had to be told by a friend who was running for congress uh up in illinois And she told me the story about how she went to some of the you know the Things that con congressman do where they go or would be congress do where they go and raise money and At one of the school board meetings and they were talking about how there were kids who were showing up who identify as animals. Yeah Not not I don't mean that i'm not trying to like say that in a foot like they're no no seriously They're like I identify as a tiger And they're young kids there there are you know 10 years old or whatever and the school Doesn't know what to do Because why can't you identify as a tiger? If that's how you identify What's the difference if by if identification is a feeling and not a biological reality? So if you're wondering how crazy it can get If a kid shows up and a left wing lib is the teacher and the kids 10 and says i'm a hippopotamus The teacher says, you know, maybe we should put you in the kitty pool like they don't know what to do I I just I love everything about this story buck because we get asked a lot How do we win? How do we change? How do things get back to the 70s 80s 90s 2000s early when people might disagree and have a variety of opinions But nobody tried to attack you and say you can't believe that You get fired if you believe that you get fired if you like that you get fired if you tweet that or instagram that or whatever Neo, I think this is how you win You have to get artists Musicians comedians television performers movie people Hall it is a great story one of my good friends who lives out in la said La used to be the land of eccentrics buck you've talked about how when we grew up California was this shining beacon that all i remember how excited i was to visit california I was so envious to me malibu was just i'd never even been i thought it was paradise One of my roommates lived in the san francisco area and we went out to visit him during college It was the first time i'd ever been to california And I was so excited to get on the plane to fly to california because just the opportunity to experience california One of this guy he's a buddy of mine. He's really successful He said you know hollywood used to be a place where eccentrics went If you were a little bit outside of the mainstream you went to hollywood and they embraced you They said hey, we love you. We want you to be here Live creatively create new things We want to be the land that embraces eccentricity and creativity now buck hollywood Is the most stultifying the most confining the most one party state almost anywhere in america And I think there are in fact there are a lot of actors and actresses i bet listening to us right now In the l.a. Area we know we hear from some of them You're starting to see a rebellion build and that rebellion is founded on hey I should be able to make whatever joke i want. Hey, I should be able to say whatever I want in a song Hey, I should be able to make whatever kind of movie i want And if people are offended by what i say That ain't my thing that's on them And I think i'm starting to see it build and I ever tell you that I was uh When I was doing the six to nine Accomplification, which is now our friend jesse kelly slot When I was doing that slot, I I was talking about how I watched a big foot movie That was pretty entertaining but really violent like I was a little sort of I was talking about this movie And I was giving a real critique of it on the air, you know You know eight o'clock at night. I'm talking about a movie I saw and one of the main actors was listening and called in Called in and we actually end up hanging out having a drink in l.a. Later. Oh, but he called in he was like Let me tell you more about that movie. I was like and I actually Because I just seen the movie his I mean his voice I could tell you know i was actually so uh, anyway You never know but your point about actors listening. Do you feel that building by the way the creative community? Slowly starting to rebel against the idea that everybody has to have the same opinion That's exactly right. This is and it's it's important a note for those of you who I mean I'm fascinated by the history of totalitarian regimes because I think it's an important lesson for today Maybe even ties into the book that i'm writing but anyway Um one of the things that the Soviets did very early on was they co-opted all the artists I mean, you couldn't be a real artist. You had to be an artist Doing writing painting composing for the glorification of the Leninist workers paradise right Kind of like what's going on a little bit with the woke in hollywood today. They don't actually get to be creative They are taking orders from the regime and and that's what we see And I think you need to be a little bit comfortable with sometimes being the butt of the joke laugh Laugh and enjoy. I think slowly we're making a big difference in the creative community I really gave a laugh yourself as the best Karen and I were talking yesterday after we finished our show about how Honestly, you're your your book a man with plays a man with many endearing stories But you're sitting alone for eight hours at your first book siding years and years ago That's that's very endearing alley can testify how nervous I was driving to the book signing in new jersey I was like if there's one person there. I will be happy. I'm going to cleveland tomorrow at lenn I've got a little bit of post-traumatic stress after wall I mean you sit by yourself in a bookstore for hours like I'm just happy to see anybody I definitely back of the day was a conservative who's standing in line for photos when there had been multiple speakers and like no one came Yeah, so that happens, but you know now it's things change So you just got to stay with it Companies like pure talk by friends.

I know rockaway beach very well and uh the woman's okay she had to go to the hospital Now this freaks everybody out it gets a lot of media coverage clay. Can I just ask you a question? I'm not trying to be provocative here, but I'm just wondering Why do they close the beach down for the next day? like You're in the ocean. It's very rare It shark probably took an exploratory bite. Do you know what I'm saying? Like it's not a murder scene It's not like they're trying to catch the culprit. Oh, I think they try to catch the culprit, don't they? I mean if it's a really big shark they may try but how tough are you you got a rogue shark in New York city Just biting people and you're like just getting the water kids. You'll be fine. You're like the mayor and jaws I I think pretty much. I don't understand what we're waiting for. You just made the legit Can we pull the audio from the mayor and jaws who's like we're gonna open the beach? It's July for you legit The beat you just made the same argument the mayor and jaws makes I'd go back out there. I don't know It's probably uh, you know, it's probably a I don't know a broadening serial killing shark Some believe all right. We'll get back into this the artificial intelligence gold rush will soon mint new millionaires But while everyone's focusing on chat gpt and ai stocks like in video something smarts happening less than two miles from chat gpt's headquarters For the past few months engineers from google and microsoft have been working on little-known crypto projects that could revolutionize the ai industry And you have a chance to get on the ground floor of this project for pennies may give you a chance It's written a thousand dollars into a six-figure nest egg This information all comes from tikka tawari the same guy who picked the number one crypto six years in a row Tomorrow wednesday He's hosting a free online strategy session to give you all the details on his number one coin for this ai boom If you're interested and want to participate go to ai 20 ai coin 2023 calm. That's ai coin 2023.com paid for by pom beach research group Welcome back in clay travis buck sexton's show we bring in steven miller. We got a lot to get through with him He's doing some fabulous work out there. Uh, but I want to start with this. I know you were a monster fan of cobra kai Steven Um, and I love it karate kid spin off for everybody out there We were just talking about the righteous gemstones. Have you ever watched the righteous gemstones? No, I haven't do you recommend it? I do it's really really funny If you want to laugh and we've got somebody who works on the show that we're going to talk to at the bottom of the hour Who's called in they filmed it in charleston. Did you ever watch kenny powers back in the day? No, I didn't Uh, so it's uh, danny mcbride. I think he's hysterical. They do really funny stuff But we're talking in general. I want to start with this because you grew up in l.a Um, if I remember correctly Uh, and we were talking about how l.a. used to be a place for eccentrics for people a little bit outside of the mainstream And they would go there and they would live creatively and try to build new things And sometimes advance the culture and and make movies and film and everything else and television shows that the larger american population could embrace And now it's become the stultifying one party's system. Yeah Yeah, l.a. Was from the 50th the 80th was a was a paradise An absolute paradise on earth and now it's ruined Okay, so do you get the sense? I'm just curious because i'm sure you have a lot of connections still in the l.a. area and in the entertainment industry Buck and I were just discussing this neo controversy where he basically says hey you're a boy or a girl and then he apologizes and he says That was my publicist. That wasn't me at all. I get the sense that comedians creatives and and film and television Uh, certainly people who are writers in general that there's a monstrous backlash building Against this woke culture that tries to destroy tries to determine what you're allowed to say I feel it. I really do and I think republicans can own this. Do you feel it? I'm curious I do feel it. I think the challenge has always been you know as as conservatives or even just as normal americans We've been wanting hollywood to produce content that speaks to regular people For uh for years now as long as I can remember and we've always felt like we're in the edge run the threshold run the precipice The problem is and remains that those two control access to capital Uniformly think one way about everything the heads of the studios the heads of the talent you can even get a talent agent If you think like a normal person in hollywood So while while you can do independent projects and occasionally you have these incredible breakthroughs Uh, you know if you watch anything on netflix or disney or hbo max or just the regular Uh to be something anybody's still watching just sort of the regular, you know cbs nbc abc sitcoms I mean the the writers rooms and the actors clearly are just completely monolithic and I bet people are still terrified of of challenging that in any way which is what makes entertainment like copper kai so refreshing or makes Films like I just saw the mission impossible that reckoning par one and have an ounce of politics in it It was it was a block buster action film. It could have been released in 1989 with more advanced um effects, but other than that just a true blooded american film I think well you still have that it's just rare and rare and I hope we're gonna see a breakthrough soon They'll be a tipping point. I just don't know how you overcome the financial obstacles Hey, steven and spook I want to talk to you for a second about what you're doing over at america first legal Uh, because I think this is it's so important. What's happening now with the usage of the law To push after the supreme court said You can't just do this racial discrimination thing anymore because you want to democrats That's not Allowed you can't do it in schools or school admissions Which also then seems to indicate well, why should you be able to do racial discrimination policies in hiring or in Contracting or in any other aspect of public life. Isn't that also an equal protection clause? Violation and you're bringing lawsuits and going after dei training and contracting etc Can you tell us about where that stands because I think that's that that makes the supreme court decision? Something real. It's not just in the theoretical Yeah, so this is a very important point which is that Conservatives every now and again will win a big supreme court ruling and will plant the victory flag And then we'll go on about our lives, you know going back to whatever people's various jobs and occupations are And then we'll wake up in the morning 10 years later and realize we won the case but we lost the war Afterwards people forget we want to big affirmative action case years ago That's the case where john roberts same as we said the best way to stop discriminating on the basis of race Is it stop discriminating on the basis of race and what do colleges universities do they all programmed around it? And then here we are again We have to now go and enforce the ruling the ruling doesn't mean anything if we don't enforce it and not just against as you said Universities but also against private corporations. So we launched a hotline It's 1877 a fl 5454 1877 a fl 5454 We have operators full-time So if you're an american and you have been victimized by a university a college a corporation Or a business in this country on the basis of race Call us and we will pursue if the fact support we will pursue legal action And that's what we are doing at america first legal and we also you can you can reach us at our website a f legal dot org slash hotline a f legal dot org slash hotline So one of our lawsuits for example is against amazon Amazon has a delivery service bonus So sort of a if you're a delivery service partner that they call them uh the drivers for amazon and um and you are Black or you are lekino or you're a native american, but you're not white you cannot be white you cannot be asian You get a $10,000 bonus So explicitly excluded from the bonus are any drivers who are white or any drivers who are asian No matter how good they are no matter how reliable they are no matter anything They cannot under any circumstances get that bonus. They're walled off because of their skin color And so we sued amazon And we'll see how that goes. That's in federal court, but it's a pretty open and shut case Federal civil rights law is explicit and now buttressed by the supreme court ruling But we need to go after every corporation has illegal policies like this And you may not realize if you're listening in home or work right now You may not even realize that you could be a potential plaintiff in some of these actions. I'll give you an example Uh, go back to universities john hofkins Uh after the supreme court ruling came out on affirmative action They announced a new essay program where asked candidates to talk about how their race or gender has shaped their life experience Clearly clearly it's meant to be an end run any legal end run to circumvent the supreme court ruling So maybe you have a kid right now in high school who's thinking of filling out applications Maybe they want to go to john's hofkins. Maybe they want to go to john hofkins medical school Right now you need to get in touch with us and talk to us like today or tomorrow and tell us what's going on What your family situation is where they want to go to school So that we can look at those facts and see what kinds of actions we can pursue And that applies to anyone in a corporate setting and business setting anywhere else It also means if you've been subjected to a mandatory Critical race theory workshop that made you feel less less than because of your race that is harassment based on skin color Violates federal and state laws And so again you need to get in touch with us or if you protested a policy at work And you think you were denied a promotion based on that or denied a race based on that we want to hear from you So All of this all of this could be sued on based on the facts, but it requires patriotic americans to stand up and call us Steven I appreciate all the fighting you're doing you've been proven to be 100 right on the collapse at the border When you look at massachusetts governor basically coming out and declaring a state of emergency new york city mayor eric adam said and i'm quoting him our cup runneth over that they had no more space basically You've seen the same thing happen in chicago in washington dc What would a trump administration do because i bet you'd be a big part of fixing this to immediately make our border secure again? Well, I do hope god bless to me with the chance to be able to return to some version of my prior role in a federal administration and restore law order and integrity help restore those things with the border I think one of the first things that you would need to do Would be to immediately re implement all of the policies that were in place under the trump administration So remain in mexico safe third agreements title 42 and so on But in addition to that president trump is outlined there would be very clear here in saying that you know afl my group america Is absolutely apolitical has no Part of synathiliation where completely apolitical, but just talking to you here is the the miller president trump has said that he would also invoke something known as the alien enemy fact This is probably the most powerful statute on the books that has never been used under the alien enemies act You can instantaneously deport Any illegal alien in the invent of an invasion event And so if there's a declared invasion from a foreign country If you invoke the alien enemies act this was passed Back in the 18th century and this remnant of this statute is still all the books and president trump has said he would use it You can not only instantaneously deport the aliens cross in the border But you can deport the aliens who have already entered the country under the body administration You can also use that authority to dismantle the cartels by if you declare the cartels to be A foreign enemy state and you can round up all of the cartel members all throughout the country and all of their affiliates and all their associates And you can instantaneously deport them too. So it's a combination of using this extraordinary new tool And then putting back into place all the policies already exist and the last thing which again president trump has talked about Is using state and local law enforcement using the national guard using other federal law enforcement like the dea the fbi the atf etc And you create an vast force That you can then go around into the country and start ejecting all the people that bide and let in because it's not enough Just to stop all the new people you have to go eject everybody that bide has allowed into the country Steven keep up the good work. I'm telling you. I think you'll like the righteous gemstones There's humor making fun of religious people, but they make fun of everybody and I think again We should become the party that likes to laugh because the democrats certainly are putting forth laughable policies But they ain't enjoying just a good old laugh from comedy appreciate the time, my man Amen. Thanks. Talk soon Uh, look, uh, we we just talked with steven miller who worked in the trump white house Trump white house was filled with a lot of people with testosterone a lot of men who wanted to do their best to protect This country and make it as bet as the best version of itself You feel the same about the bide and administration? I don't I feel like the bide and administration probably has the lowest level of testosterone and the men that work in the white house in the history of our nation It's not even hyperbole. You know your testosterone levels declined by 50 over the past several decades And many men out there today as a result don't have the same vivver vitality that you might have had in the 50s in the 60s And before how about getting your testosterone backup get hooked up now with my guys at chalk They have something called a male vitality stack all natural supplement leading ingredient proven in studies to increase testosterone by 20% in three months times including this in your daily regimen will give you the energy You don't even know you're missing let alone what you are capable of why not go check it out today CH oq calm that's chalk spelled with a q CH oq calm 35 off chalk subscriptions for the life of that subscription when you use my name clay in the signup process That's chalk calm.

Who do you got on the board there? Yeah, Alex in charleston, south carolina I was talking about how we need to be embracing comedy on the right side of the political spectrum since the left believes that Jokes that hurt people's feelings shouldn't be able to be made and I was saying I really like the righteous gemstones Um, and it's a show that's made in charleston, south carolina Alex is calling in he works on the show I'm curious. Are you hearing other people who've grown up in the south and maybe grew up going to religious Large religious churches right the sort of uh the jimmy swagert style, which this show is a send up of in some way What's the reaction that you're hearing from people? So hey nice to be with you guys Good fan. Um, so the majority the crew is from south carolina, georgia North carolina and people above the line so the pyrops are usually new york and l.a Some south carolina, but I mean the show the crew has a smack line of everybody Uh political walk in life. Um, there are some rabid leftists that would probably never talk to me again I found out I was a republican But everyone just wants to make a good show. Yeah, and and that's the thing about it Uh about the majority of these issues is how i was surprised with Is how more moderate People really are that you would think are typical Leftists and that they are able to see the absurd of what the abidant administration is doing and i'll give you an example one of uh Higher up some like i named named above the line Uh came up to me randomly unprompted and basically picked my brain about the whole uh department of energy official the guy who's caught stealing Luggage and just talking about how absurd and ridiculous and just couldn't believe that this was enough government official And I kind of you know this joked around and was like you're just hearing about this now But you know secretly I was like oh man like I can't believe this guy just came up to me Then talked to talk to me about this because you would never expect it from this kind of person I mean the goal of the show and I don't know exactly what your role is but I appreciate you calling in and I know it's filmed in charleston The goal of the show is to make people laugh of all stripes and persuasions I think that's fair to say right and that used to be the goal as we were talking to steven miller in the 80s and the 90s in the early 2000s when I was growing up it felt like you know the sort of the goal was the south park mantra where everybody gets made fun of Seinfeld everybody kind of got made fun of and then we turned into a bunch of interest groups where you're not allowed to make fun of certain people This feels like a repudiation of that and like everything can be mocked Absolutely and one of the things that I love about the job is that I have fun every day and everyone in the crew has fun every day And I can tell it and no one's sitting there feeling You know ostracized or put in the corner And that everyone just wants to make a great show that makes people laugh and entertain And I think that shows in the comedy and I'm so glad you enjoyed it. I'd never expected to hear you say you love the righteous gemstones Is that well you just so you sold me on it buddy. This is buck. I've never I even heard of this show It sounds great. So i'm gonna check this what channel is this thing hbo? It's hbo. All right. We just finished we just finished the third season. I've been with the sees the show all three seasons And we just got renewed for the fourth season. So go watch it Invite danny mcbride to come on the show. Uh, we'll have him on clay and buck Uh, thank you for the call buck. Should we play you as the mayor or should we play this when we come? We'll put the time we don't have time we'll we'll we'll put it out there to everybody Are you with me? Would you go swimming at rockaway beach even though somebody got bitten by a shark Or You know, do you think that there should be some artificial like well if we wait a couple of days there won't be sharks I'm just pointing out it doesn't make any sense. The sharks are still out there Uh, look if there's an 18 foot great white or something. I would say maybe we wait till it passes through You know, maybe the seal colony will get whittled down a little bit, but you know In the meantime You told me today I'm gonna come on the show and buck is gonna turn into the mayor of amity in jaws demanding that the beach be open No matter who gets bitten and eaten up. I would have never believed it. That's next"
