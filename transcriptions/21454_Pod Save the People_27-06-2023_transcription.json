    "text": " Hey, this is Dorei and welcome to about saving the people. In this episode, it's me, Diora Miles and Kai talking about all the diseases you don't know from the past week, the underreported news about justice and race and equity that should have been national headlines that might not have been or take over was. We talk about the world's first known drag queen. We talk about entrepreneurship, black entrepreneurship in DC. We talk about the alarming trend of missing kids in Cleveland. We also had a much needed conversation while male suicide within the black community. And if you were someone who was struggling with mental health, speak to someone and search for free wellness resources within your community. Remember that you are not alone. Here we go. Family, you missed you. Welcome to another episode of Pod's Save the People. I'm Diora Ballinger. You can find me on Instagram at Diora Ballinger. I'm Malzy Johnson. You can find me on Instagram, Instagram, and Twitter at Pharaoh Raptor. I'm Kia Henderson. You can find me on Twitter at Henderson Kia. And this is Diora at Diora Wild Toutet. So deep side as we get into this one. But given, I don't want to call anybody out, but given what some black media outlets are saying about this incident, we thought it was only right. And our wives and mutual perspective. To talk about this camarly Simmons, Russell Simmons situation. I am still completely confused why Russell Simmons hasn't been taken down fully yet. See what I mean by mutual perspective. So I was very confused to see that this got so much buzz around. It got so much buzz last week. Camora and Russell's daughters both saying that he's being abused there, that he needs basically he needs support and he needs he may have some government of a health issue. So it kind of blew up for a day. Now it has completely gone away this week, basically. But you know, it's been an interesting ride. The rest of Simmons given that he was accused of rape and sexual assault over the course of, I don't know, a decade or so. And nothing really came of that. There was a documentary on it. There was some light fanfare around the documentary, but definitely nothing that could change or impact his life and suit after that. So I don't know, curious about what you all saw, particularly those of us who really know what's going on on the internet. But yeah, I just, I think it's just really bizarre for me to self-attribute. Yeah, I think the weirdest part is that Russell Simmons, you know, does have that documentary out about him. And that, you know, it was Kamora in his daughters saying everything that he had to say about him was like, I guess, like kind of shocking for me. And that the fact that they went public, but the content of it didn't misalign because I did watch the documentary with Drew Dixon and the other and the other victims of Russell Simmons. And you know, I mean, hot off the presses take ever is just so interesting to remember Kamora defending Russell, you know. And I do think that those things that has to do with, you know, even Herbie and Groomed and meeting him at 16. But I can't help but think that, oh, wow, this could be easier or this could have went easier if we believed victims the first time. If we took what black women specifically in these male and black or in industry seriously, we wouldn't be so surprised. And maybe we wouldn't have to kind of feel like almost a little bit feel like we're starting over. If that makes sense. This, this, this, this feminist we like, oh, now we, now we have enough and now start over kind of reminds me of our Kelly where like something new needed to happen each time for us to start over because the first time was enough, the second time enough and the third time was enough. I'm feeling a little bit that way about Russell where I'm like, this is a few years ago where this came out in Oprah said something and we were around and there was a lot of, you know, respectable black woman who said it. And now, and now we're here again trying to say this person's not safe for the community. So yeah. Yeah, Miles, I like you. I think one of the surprising things was how she was like, I'm tired of defending him. And he is all of these things that people say. And, and I felt a little, like, I mean, first of all, I feel terrible for Kimura and for Ioki and all of them. And, you know, the thing, the way he talks to them and the way he talks about them, I feel terrible for all of that. But I also felt some kind of way about like, you know, now that you are in trouble or now that you are catching heat from this dude, now you're like, I'm tired of defending him. I'm tired of this. I'm tired of that. I'm tired of the what about all of those other women who were who were tired of being abused and you were complicit in the cover up and the after abuse and whatnot. Now is coming your way. And so we should all feel sorry for you. And I'm sorry for them. Is petty kayak talk. And she lives here too. And so I just want to keep it real. I also I really mean, watching that young lady watching a. OK, like really just have a like a breakdown on on social media. Like, I'm so worried about the youngs and and their mental health. And it just was heartbreaking to watch this young lady big her father to stop talking to her like this and and feel like she needs to put her life on display on social media. It was so disturbing to me in my old lady. I was like, come on, y'all. But where's the therapist? Where's the interventionist? Where are the where are the people who's where's the team? Everybody's got a team. Where's the team team? Making sure that this stuff is not happening on on the socials because that is an added dimension that makes an already horrible situation even worse. It was deeply disturbing to me. I think I was so I agree with you, Kaya. I was saddened and I was appreciative of Kamora saying, you know, I'm not going to defend him. And it totally in one moment took away her. It would some people were like, well, maybe she didn't know she wasn't there, right? She wasn't in the rooms when Russell did it. And it's like, no, no, she she it was clear she knew it was clear that she was not like a random person who didn't witness this side of him. She saw the only good side and he was bad outside. It's like, no, no, no, she actually saw it. And and that was sad. And it was it reminded me of the complicity of a victims even in perpetuating abuse, right? Like that whole moment. The other thing is that this seemed pretty cut and dry to me. Like it was like, OK, Russell is a bad actor. The kids are dealing with it in a in a way that they should not even have to deal with anything. Kamora doesn't know what to do, which is why she's going to social media because this is it felt very less resorty. And then I see the breakfast club and their defensive him is so stunning to me that I'm even I'm like up all the things that take away from that. The idea that you don't criticize him because this is your father, because this is your family, because if you really loved your parent, you wouldn't do it this way because he's famous and you're trying to embarrass him, they actually said that those are like that's not even a poor paraphrase. That is a more generous repeating of what they said than they deserve. And I just want to say, I allow that that is how abuse submits itself in families. That is how kids and partners get abused for decades because people are like, you know, we'll deal with it inside the house. We will and kids come out traumatized. Whole communities are affected by that behavior. The idea that Russell Simmons can do whatever he wants and those women can't say anything about it to anybody because that's their dad is such a wild thing to say a lot, especially because he's not accused of not giving you lunch money. He's not accused of, you know, he won't buy you the Ferrari. He bought you a Saturn, right? This is rape. This is abuse. This is financial abuse. I mean, these are legitimate concerns and for the Breakfast Club with such a big platform in black communities to legitimize abuse and wrap it up in the idea of love was just scary. Actually, I wasn't even I wasn't even sad about it. I was scared for the families that will consume that and abuse will continue. Even worse is like, I think I think about people who hopefully there's not many people who are looking for the Breakfast Club as kind of like guiding lights and compasses morally and especially that that is scary for which is, you know, that's scary. But I think the worst thing are people who wear just Simmons what they owe it already think and I think in they already feel that way about those kind of conflicts and abuse and it just kind of seems their reality. And I think that in media, you have such a good opportunity to disrupt maybe a shared thought by distancing against it and using these moments to, you know, break the hedge amount of sway of things that we might have adopted thinking in. They just gave up that opportunity. Really? I don't know why I was so obsessed, but I actually was following all the summary news and mostly because, you know, I live in a household with a journalist who nonstop covers immigration is always at the border. We're always talking about how unsupported asylum seekers and other folks who are coming to this country and going to other countries to find better lives for themselves are completely unsupported. So to watch the intensity to which this thing was covered where rich people who are doing an adventure tour of the Titanic side notes rich people, if you need to know what to do which money, please call me and ask me because I will help you so that you don't become casualties in the summer being explosion. But I thought that was it was just wild to know that this industry exists number one, that there was so much interest around it. And then really it just was kind of like the media kind of taking us along this journey when all the long most of the people that are like experts in the field knew the thing exploded that day. So what did what did y'all but we all follow what do you think? What is that? Well, I am grateful for the fact that I am now an aquamarine biologist in less than a week because of all the things I can do and it's official. So, you know, yeah. Oh, the silver lining of the sea cloud is that I know so much. You got a whole new career out soon. I have a whole new career out soon. I know about deep pressure and I'm saying I'm counting in meters and not just this big and this big. I'm now just doing the aquamarine biologist life thing and I'm wearing lots more shades of blue. The thing that was the most interesting to me about it, of course, like the critique around the, you know, American doing something for rich people, not for, you know, vulnerable people, like, yeah, absolutely true, but kind of like that is on rhythm for American, fortunately, I think that the thing that is most interesting to me is the, the, the poetry in it, I guess, like just the idea that it was they were going to see like the, like the whole idea around Titanic that captured any interest of mine was the fact that all the class issue and that certain people didn't get to live and certain people didn't get to survive simply because of the class. And here is this other thing that like is, is kind of perpetuating this like class issue where even now I've, I don't, I don't have the institution correct, but I know now like some kind of like esteemed institution associated with the Titanic is going to like help or they're going to be in the, in the memorial with them now. So even like in this like embarrassing silly death, they're still kind of being being made like serious by where they're being buried and honored. And I think that I don't know. I think that's the, the, the class story of if you have enough money, you, it will always be somebody will always make a statue. Oh, somebody, somebody will always make it seem like what you did was not so silly or, or great. And I just can't really think about people, you know, 150 years from now looking at that same memorial, like, you know, memorial and be like, well, who are these people from 2023 and figuring out why they're included and has nothing to do with the Titanic because that's to do with, you know, having too much money and shoddy technology. But now that I'm on the scene, the technology will be improving and it will be getting way cuter. Well, they're, and they're already hiring for the man that was controlling the submarine that perished. So if you're looking for a role, they're already, they're already hired. And I have three PlayStation controllers, which I also like, sorry, I was just saying somebody talk about, somebody talk about how like nobody took this seriously who was black. I've never seen anything like it. Well, first of all, my, I, I have an auntie who know, one of my aunties took it seriously, but then, but she spiraled on an in our family group chat. Do you know how many black people were on the Titanic? So then she was started to research the black people on the Titanic. I was like, wild, this is helpful. I don't know how we got here. I mean, I could not think of, I mean, maybe I could, but that is like, it just struck me as a horrific way to die. Five of us or whatever in a little metal room with a toilet in the corner. It broke jail to me a little bit. And we're deep deep under the sea and we explode like horrific, horrific. And then to read the story is about the people who didn't really want to go and all that we knew about how shoddy the equipment was and how many risks people were taking. Like it, it is, it just, it, like none of it had to happen. And so it adds insult to the people's death that like this was totally preventable. It didn't have to go down this way. And I do think like, I, you know, people are like, oh, don't make fun of, you know, people dying and all that kind of thing. And you know, with reverence and respect for the people who died, I also think it is absolutely unreasonable to not point out the sheer. I don't even know hubris, the, the, the wealth, something like whatever, all of the things that made this happen at the same time as, you know, we're watching real people who really need to change their life circumstances perish and, and how we treat that in the media is completely different. Like this will, I was not obsessed with it. I was not following it. I thought it was like, I don't know. I just felt like it was a misplacement of my valuable time and energy. I was glad, you know, when they were saying, oh, they have 40 more hours of 48 more hours. And then we found out that they had died days ago. I was like, great. I'm glad that we have no longer on death watch. Like the whole thing laughing to me. Sorry. Nothing's laughing sound. Hire is educated through and through just in case you didn't know. Yeah. Yeah. I'm with you. You know, if not for a black Twitter, I don't think I would have known a single thing about this because Lord knows the memes, the everything about it. Twitter was on 10,000. The meme of like, if you survived, how would you get out of the submarine top tier? It was, I mean, the content was really. Like, I'm like, what are they? Oh, it was like old Twitter back. I do think it's, it was also a reminder of like what money does that like because they were just so wealthy, not enough people ask questions, not enough people forced order or expectations like that would have saved them. And this is like what happens in the political spaces that, you know, one of those states, right, just got rid of the regulations that some set of workers had to take breaks every 10 minutes, I mean, 10 minutes every hour. It's like the quest to do whatever they want. Normally some sort of like commercial enterprise, but this one was just purely pleasure. Yeah, people just let them do it. And to the detriment to their detriment and frankly to ours, right? Like we, why were we all paying attention to that? That was ridiculous. I will say the graphics that emerged too brilliant. I didn't know how deep 14,000 feet was until this happened. It's like, why would you even what there is you would have to send me to 15 seminars to show me every aspect of the submarine is going to take me that deep. When I saw that image of how deep they were going and then it's like to what? Yes, that is so far. And then to just drive by underwater, you like, what you see it, it's a wreck. You know, like we, there's a museum with stuff already. You don't need to go down to the, but again, there is something about wealth. There's actually white wealth that is like you can do whatever you want. And the voyeurism, this was like a beautiful example of the voyeurism of whiteness that like they just had to see it. They had to see the death and destruction. They just needed to witness it themselves because the museum and the movies and stuff was not enough and people let them do it. And here they are. The rebranding of them as victims is wild. They chose that route and they chose ending that was tragic. That is just true. There is, I don't know anybody who would get in a vessel that tight with that loose of whatever and they knew they were going. If you told me we ride in this to the grocery store and then we magically go on to see, you know, you got me these people. That's not what happened. They knew what they were going to accept for the little boy, the little boy, the son. He is the victim here. But the idea that they get included in the memorial and all that stuff, they chose this. This is that sort of wild, especially when the migrants trying to flee places. Nobody is helping them. It was like a whole set of countries sent out the coast cards and stuff to try to find these people for what they chose this. So that was sort of wild to me. I think the last thing I will say on it is just that the legal perspective, first of all, these folks, unless it is true that it was like extreme negligent, there is no lawsuit against the submarine sub-company. And the other thing that ends up happening is that all of the U.S. assets that were sent to find these people, that is paid by tax-fairy dollars. So that is just the way that it's set up, that if there's a rescue mission, no matter if people put their own selves in peril, the U.S. government puts the bill on that. So I think the other part about this is the complete unaccountability all around that this company is not getting off-scout free. And the last last thing I will say about it is what I do love about black capitalists and rich people is I do think that there is a little bit of a bougie thing that gets baked into us about how we want to see things aesthetically. And I think that in times like now where we're going with technology, it can really be like a superpower because just of a pure aesthetics, it just looks crazy in there. They didn't try to make it look like a private jet with the all-bage. I would have went in there and be like, do you know I am a black billionaire? Do you know that Madam C.J. Walker flew so I can fly private. She flew so I can fly, however. You think I am about to sink in this? It's not even gold. I am not doing none of that. So it did look very much like inside of a can of peas. You know like what would have even asked y'all to go on there? Miss Frizzle would have been like no, this is too jig for us. Don't go anywhere. More potting than people is coming. My news this week is combines our respect for and celebration of pride with some unknown D.C. Black history. I am excited to share with you the story of William Dorsey Swan. So there is a street in D.C. called Swan Street S.W.A.N.N. and it's in DuPont Circle which is a very Tony neighborhood of D.C. It's also a very, it's the neighborhood where the gay pride parade is held. There are lots of gay bars. It's sort of the center of some gay life in Washington. And Swan Street is this idyllic little black with lovely homes and whatnot. And it has it's thought to be named after the former mayor of Baltimore and former governor of Maryland Thomas Swan. But thanks to a recently passed bill by the D.C. City Council, they are renaming Swan Street or dedicating Swan Street after the in the memory of William Dorsey Swan. William Dorsey Swan was a formerly enslaved D.C. resident and he was the world's first known drag queen. How about M. Apples? It turns out that William Dorsey Swan was born into slavery in Hancock, Maryland. And he later moved to D.C. after emancipation where he actually conducted what are known as the first drag balls. He were and I don't we knew about drag balls in the 20s and 30s in Harlem. But this is like the 1880s and here to four it seems people didn't even realize that these kinds of balls were happening. He hosted balls in secret and he had men who would come together and dress and dance. They competed in dances like the cakewalk, which was a dance that the enslaved people performed pre civil war, which mimicked the plantation owners and actually resembles voguing according to the researchers. And while there are no, you know, videotapes or recordings or anything, we know about these things because the police would raid the balls all the time. And the only way that we know about these things is because there were police reports and and Dorsey Swan would get dragged into the police station and they'd pull off his dress and that kind of thing and there are newspaper accounts of that. And so I just thought that this was really interesting because who knew that the first official recognized drag queen was an African American man, a former enslaved man, the term drag, the balls were called drags and the queen was the person who hosted the ball. That's where the term drag queen came from. But these drags that he hosted were legendary and I thought it was really interesting. I think, you know, we talk about representation. We talk about seeing ourselves in history and how important that is, especially for our young people. And this for me was a totally new historical story that we didn't know. And I'm excited about it. And I'm proud of the DC City Council for a unanimously passing a bill to recognize William Dorsey Swan. It is so beautiful. I feel I feel we are family playing in my heart right now. I love stories like this. No, it's super beautiful. I've been thinking about. I mean, I don't know in what ways I want to express it, but I've been thinking about how just in recent years, but just since drag has been created, how this kind of like gender conversation has like also happened and as like, I feel like the transgender conversation has been able to happen more the more that I'm like seeing a shift happening like the in the drag community, even the one that I grew up in or the one that I've like reviewing and just seeing how gender expression, trans aesthetics, all these other things that kind of were just only done by people who were in, who were moon people, who are just people who were out at night, how those things are just becoming just more proliferated and more common and seeing more commonly in the out in the sun. And anytime I hear a story like this, the reason why I bring that up is because into my hero story like this, I can't help but wonder like what would be the identities if given the choice, you know, if having if given the choice, what would be like to me as in these people are we. I mean, I shouldn't say misgendering because not like done derogatory, but like what do you with the people that we know is he, him, and and and she hers, would they if they had the the ability what would they go by, you know, it reminds me of me even seeing Adakimaz Rahi earlier this week in how Adakimaz Rahi said like if he had the opportunity back in his childhood that he think he would probably arrive at a totally different gender identity and totally different ways of thinking about gender. And yeah, I guess I'm taking a little bit of a stretch with this news, but that's what I really think about when and when I hear about black people doing queer things in history is wow, if we have the language or if we have the time and the ability to sit down and think about it, what will we come to like what what we were arrived at and how would that affect how odd queerness seems today if we have the availability of that language, you know, and how much it would have been seen like the trend wave. But thank you for bringing this news, Antikaya. I feel held. Miles, I think my, my line of thinking was very similar to yours in terms of I just imagine what it would be if even black people were supportive of queer folks throughout history. I mean, we could have had 200 years of these conversations you're talking about, but I think black conservatives, um, black, was legit. I just think all of those politics have directed even how the black community has talked about gender identity and sexuality and all those things. And so I don't know, that's where I just, I mean, I just imagine what the world would be, what our experience would be, what our interactions would be, some of our family members if there was a language and a, an established language and a staff. And establish creativity and imagination around identity. That's what I don't know, that's worth looking at. But thank you, Kai. This was great. I obviously hadn't heard of Swan and it makes me think of, I remember I was, I was doing something with the Afro newspaper archives and they have pictures of drag balls in the 20s. And I just had never even imagined balls that far, to me, balls are like 60, 70. That's like when they, that is the beginning to me. So seeing these like people in drag when like the makeup is less advanced, like every, I just, I don't know, I just feel like it emerged 70, 60s. And to see in the 20s and 30s, I was like, wow, I don't know. There's a lot. I don't know. Like we need to do better mainstreaming of this history so people can remember how long people, especially when it was even riskier than it is today have been living for lives. And it just really, I was like, well, I wish I could talk to any of the people who were in drag in the 20s. I'm like, what? I love it. Especially in places like Baltimore and DC and, and DR to your point in a different way. It's like, what is also true is that black people have loved on queer people, even in private and in moments where it was unsafe and publicly unacceptable. I think about my aunt had a gay friend. Oh my God. Mr. Tony, I think that was, he was always, we were so young, but he was like, he was definitely gay. And I remember I was on Sheena's best friend. And it was like, you know, like nobody talked about him being gay. And so it was just like the family didn't treat him any different, but it was, he was definitely gay in a moment where like being gay was not cool. But it was like, I also grew up with gay not being publicly accepted, but also seeing black people love on other black gay people in a way that I worry does not get shown either. Right. So that's what this may be. Think of so, Kaya, thanks for bringing to hear. Yeah, Kaya just mentioned that this was during the 1880s. These parties are happening. The 1920s party that popped though, Madam C.J. Walker's daughter, through those parts, those salons are legendary. So that's what we need to go back to. 1800 is so wild. I mean, I love it. It's so dope because I'm obsessed with the Gilded Age. If just obsessed with the show, like obsessed with the era, New York Gilded Age and stuff like that. So it's, it's, or it's, I say that to say it's already. It was an ostentatious time for all. For everybody. So like I can only imagine adding queerness and drag performance and bending genders to an already, you know, new money, art, art, new, era of time. Yeah, that's super fascinating. Um, so today I'm going to be the bummer. I'm going to be the, the, the depression pill that I usually wait for the other three of the co-holds to be. But I figure everybody needs to have their day. So I've ran across this, um, article. It is entitled the suicide method never discussed in the black community regarding black men. It's by Patrice and Douglas. So to, to note, to know me is to know that like I take depression suicide really seriously because it's because of personal experiences with it in my own, um, dealing with mental, mental health and suicide attempts, but then also kind of, it was kind of my great awakening when I had those struggles because I did not notice it changed the way that I interacted with so many people and habits that I was observing and things that I was seeing because I had went through this line of suffering where I'm like, oh, I know that because I used to do that or I understand what that, what that word really means, what this intention really means because I used to suffer with that too. Um, and it's give, it gave me a different muscle when it comes for empathy because I just didn't have the wisdom because I don't think I've ever, I just didn't add it golf to that dark place to really be able to, to, to, to name it. Um, so it's saying that usually at this point it's very rare that something gets said that shocks me or that makes me think differently, but this article did it and it talks about the, about the, about what, about when the leading causes of, uh, su, of suicide completion in the black community and the black men's community and it's something I'm going to give you the definition with it too. It's called, um, slow suicide, um, which is defined as a prolonged period of self abusive harmful behavior, which made result in suicide completion. Um, I was kind of stunned and it just lit me up when I read that because I was like, oh, that's the culture. If you can't hear me, I'm snapping. I'm, I'm teaching with, with my hands too, but I was like that. It just was a, a, a, where I was like, that's the culture. That's what's going on. That is the thing that I couldn't necessarily name when I was listening to certain rap music, when I was seeing certain types of content and certain types of, um, images, uh, being created and they were toxic, but we were okay with it, but it was, and it was confusing to me. I was like, Oh, wow. This is, that's what we're celebrating or glorifying are these like kind of slow, so, um, suicide methods. So to be even more clear, so suicide is when you know something is going to, um, kill you or harm you and you participate in it. Um, either not caring about the results that might be suicide completion or secretly, maybe not so secretly, but like maybe subconsciously the better, better word, hoping for those results. And I think about how many percocet and alcohol, um, uh, how, how many, how many of this drug or how much this alcohol or how fast can we go with, with this songs we have and how many movies we have of those things. And I always just kind of, uh, wondered like, when, when did this become the culture, not subculture, but like the culture and it really hit me during COVID specifically because I was watching so many of my good, meaning liberal community oriented friends say like, try to get people to wear masks and try to scare people into wearing masks and, and, and, and, and types people and, and, and hit people into wearing masks and stuff. And I remember thinking to myself, I was like, well, you're not going to make a suicidal culture care about life just all, all of a sudden, that's just not how it's going to go. And I was like, you're, you're kind of talking to the people, you're, you're telling your certain people with things that they're not scared of and you're going to hit a wall. If you're saying you could die and they're like, that's what I wanted. You know, that's what I wanted to happen. And I'm so glad that this article focuses on black men because that is the culture in, in, in, in young black male culture right now. If it's not conservatism, if it's not in cell, internet, BS, it is somewhere glorifying this type of soul suicide culture of taking a little bit of taking this drug, doing this alcohol, participating in this dangerous activity. And the underlying thing is, if you die, it's okay because we don't like it here anyway. And I thought this article was simple, but it offers something to me that just really just illuminate the way I saw people's habits around me, the culture. And then even how I saw my own habits, even during times when I was, um, when I was my most suicidal, the month, the year, the two years before I was, that, that I, um, that I, that I attempted, I was taking the, doing the riskiest drugs at the riskiest times and the riskiest amounts. And I never even connected that behavior as me trying to try, trying to do that. And I think that even what, when you do that to like somebody, if you're, if you're a patient of, of, if you're a therapist, patient, whatever, um, even saying that to a client can change the way they think about stuff. Cause I know it changed me, even though I'm removed from the situation, it still changed me and be like, Oh my goodness. It didn't just pop out of nowhere. Where sometimes I think that it happened. It was two months and then I was down and then I got better where I'm like, no, this was something that was gnawing at me for years and then it got more pointed. But the more we kind of take this, it is the third leading, the third leading cause in, um, in suicide in black men, the more we take these signs seriously, I think the more we'll kind of know we're handed what we're really handling, we're really getting into. So yeah, I wanted to bring this to the podcast. Um, I know it's not the most comfortable situation to talk about or thinking to talk about. And then also the case that I wanted people to offer is not just like black men or them out there, just to kind of review, oh, are there ways that may be in my own anxiety or clinical depression? Are there things that like maybe I even do now that, you know, trend towards slow suicide and stuff like that. And because we don't talk about it, um, we went and label it that way. And sometimes that harsh label helps you really address those problems when you can't just say, Oh, I'm just, I'm just having fun or we just outside. But I'm like, if you outside seven days a week and you and you on these drugs, I'm like, you, you about to be outside with the Lord for real. If we don't, if we don't talk about these habits and we've seen it, I've had so many friends this year, this, this year, um, I've had four friends who OD, you know, and who, and who did stuff where when I really look back on it, I'm like, that was suicide. I mean, it says cocaine, but that was suicide or it says alcohol, but it was, that was suicide, you know, so yeah, I wanted to bring that to you all. And for us to talk about it and for us to be deep. Miles, thank you. So first of all, thank you for sharing and being so wonderful. I think we need to be talking about this. And I think what was so chilling to me about this, that thinking one of my biggest things is that I think that in particular, who I lost a couple of years ago, and when he passed, the all were like shocked because he's not always in a good mood and he always was so excited to see all of us. And he always was the life of the party at family events. But when you really start to look at the substance abuse, depression, like all, all of the time of slow suicide, like all of it that, that is in this article, he showed some version of that or some parts of those things were very present in his life. So I think even for, even as we're paying attention to our love, it's so important to know how to recognize, right? Instead of saying someone, you know, well, that person's under us, they're gonna be all right. No, no, no, no. So like we actually need to like be supportive and have those support structure around that love, love one. So I think that's what really really just screamed at me about this. What we're even, what we're on the lookout for is so far from these things in terms of somebody being on the verge of or being on a path to take their own life. It's so interesting to me, Mouse, first of all, thanks for bringing this. I thought it illuminated a bunch of interesting statistics about black men and suicide, Caribbean men complete more than any other men. Like there were all of these interesting facts that I didn't know. But the naming of this slow suicide is really, really important. I think it's very interesting that you came at it from what's happening with young black men, but people who I thought of immediately were my uncles, like my great uncles who, you know, were all sort of functional alcoholics and were literally like drinking themselves into the ground. Most of them died from cirrhosis or some sort of alcohol related affliction or my uncles who were substance abusers and all of them, you know, it was just hard being a black man in America and you start to, you know, you start to run to cope with, you know, all of the madness. And ultimately it turns into, I mean, you could see it in a way that there's no reason for you to drink that much alcohol or take this many drugs or do all of this and to put a name to the fact that like it goes from, I'm trying to cope and, you know, whatever, self-medicate to, I'm actually trying to get out of here. Maybe I'm not trying to get out of here, but I wouldn't mind getting out of here. I think I, for me, I could look across a number of men in my life and see sort of when that switch happened and what the like actual completion of that was. And so I think this is an opportunity for us to, as a community, to start talking about this slow suicide and to start calling people out and thinking about, I want our mental health professionals to help us think about what the right interventions are. And I feel like, oh, yeah, there's a moment to figure this thing out and not just let it happen anymore. Kyle, I'm with you. The first thing that comes to mind is just the power of language. There's something about the phrase that really clicked for me. I was like, oh, this is giving language to this thing that I've seen my entire life. And, you know, my father, I'm going to call him the moment we get off the phone because he has spent his entire life working in Narcotics Anonymous and sponsoring people. And I cannot wait to share this language with him because I'm sure he sees it in his work, but just doesn't, you know, says it in 2000 words instead of in two. So I thought this was, I thought the language was brilliant. I also thought that what's interesting about it is that the action of slow suicide takes away the stigma of suicide in the community because there's such a big stigma in black community. So people like don't want their families have to deal with it and deny. And, you know, all the research says that it's underreported in black communities because of the stigma, you know, they, they died in their sleep. They did it like all these things are not suicide. And, but when it's slow, when it is not a moment, it is, you know, two years of your liver eroding, then people actually get to sidestep the stigma. So that was interesting. The third is that we can all name behaviors like like you, Miles, the first thing that came to my when I heard this was Percocet in or, um, or what's the drink, Lord? Why am I old man now? The cough syrups, scissor, lien, lien, scissor. That's, that's immediately what came to mind, right? And yes, I thought that was asking the fourth thing. And this is like, you know, I feel like there's always a police carceral is when people think about fear and danger in the black community, they are not thinking that this is the third leading cause of death amongst black men. That's not what they are thinking. Drugs, murder, they are thinking all these wild things in community and suicide is not what people are rating as the top three. But really, if you are thinking about a healthy community, public health, public safety, you need this to be number 200 on the list and not number three. And it was another reminder to me about the, I, the, the nuance that people bring to talking about suicide in public because of the research that says, if you talk about it more people commit more suicide, but the danger and not talking about it means that we just don't, we are not addressing it in mass. The third leading is crazy. I mean, that's, that's big and what happens when you don't talk about it. So I left with a lot from this. Hey, you're listening to POD Save the People. Stay tuned. There's more to come. I'm in DC this weekend, which I realize when I'm staying on the path. So my friends, I didn't reach out to are now going to text me and say, why don't you call me from the home? But I got the opportunity to go to a new development project initiative in board seven called Sycamore and Oak. So I grew up in board seven and eight and it's really fascinating slash heartbreaking what's happening in the neighborhoods that I grew up in. So DC essentially looks completely different. And if you're familiar with DC, you know that it's been gentrified to the nines. I think I wrote a paper about gentrification in law school in 2007. And at that point, a quarter million people had been displaced. So I can only imagine what that number looks like now. But housing projects like Berry Farms and others have been completely gone. And so what's now happened, I guess, is there's a movement around protecting some of what DC has left of black culture. And so this development, it's beautiful. It's made all out of pie. It's huge. And part of it is to galvanize entrepreneurship in board seven. And so there are a number of black businesses there that are all amazing. Also, everybody needs to go to this place. Like please visit these black businesses. It's on St. Elizabeth's campus, which is also a whole other mind for me that things are on this campus and the history of St. Elizabeth is that it was a psychiatric hospital for many, many years, but completely unsafe and completely treacherous to black people. And when DC closed, they just closed the door and let everybody out. I've been to any house. So this development is in the heart of the heart award, the heart award eight. And there are boutiques like Museum DC. And if you don't know about Museum DC, I don't know where you've been. But it's a clothing line. People would describe it as urban water, building lines, but it's amazing. And one of their locations is there. There's also this woman in Manda C. This is the owner of Fresh Food Factory Market. So she's bringing the four days of the desert, a three-desert. So she's bringing high quality groceries and ingredients, et cetera. The whole village is supposed to create about 100 jobs over an award eight. And it's also going to really work in collaboration with DC Department of Employment Services. The other interesting thing is that they're also going to use this space to try to bring more health care, health clinics, health access to folks in award eight, so that'll be interesting to see how that unfolds. But the business is there. Southside Creative is another business that's owned by Keanu Jones. And all it's like art and clothes and all representing the African diaspora and her shop, which is a beautiful shop. But it goes on and on. So there's incredible businesses there. The space is just amazing, to be honest. And it's right next door, again, if you're familiar with DC, to where the washroom is in the place. Like, you can sort of camp this if you're on, that's the East Campus. But I just wanted to bring this to the pod because I'm just sort of going through it with what's happening in DC and how the whole that in my heart, then how to action that in terms of how I can do, that I can do to preserve beautiful, chocolate city. Used to be known as chocolate city that I grew up in. And it was interesting because when I was at the space, I was having a conversation with some folks and folks that grew up in Ward 7 and 8 as well. And they were like, it's just nice to have something in the black part of DC. And I was like, great. Now DC has a black part. The whole thing, sweet black, and I was like, that is wild. This absolutely wild. And the wilder thing about it is this gentrification and this development, it's all happened under black mayors, whether it's Mary Bowser, whether it's Vincent Gray, Adrian Fenty, Lord of Mercy, and the person who really held this down for years. And people can say what they want and maybe rest in peace is Mary and Barry because that is still my mayor for life. And I believe Southeast would look a completely different place if the takedown hadn't happened. But it's interesting what's happening in DC and these types of investments, after all the gentrification is said and done, then it's like, oh, now we want to preserve a little bit of DC. And I'm like, okay, I guess we'll figure out how to be supported to that. So yeah, I just wanted to bring it to the park because it's really personal to me what's happening in DC. And I guess I'm just grappling with now living in New York. How do I still figure out how to be a supporter to my city as well? So thanks for bringing us to the pod, Dara. I'm excited to go over and see the development and support like businesses. And I think for people who aren't from DC or aren't familiar with DC, the thing to know is DC is divided into eight wards and four quadrants. And most of you have only been to the Northwest Quadrant of DC. You've never been to Northeast or Southeast or Southwest. And all of the monuments are in Northwest. All of the universities are in Northwest. And so you literally know a quarter of the city and the rest of the city is very different than Northwest. In fact, word seven and eight are the blackest parts of the city. Not always have been, but have been for the last 50 or 60 years. It's where the most children are, it's where the most poverty is. And it has been the place of the most neglect. There's not a sit down restaurant anywhere in word seven and eight, except for Denny's. Right. And so this has been, there had been targeted neglect for that part of the city. And now there, it's where the cities, I mean, you called it a psychiatric hospital. Like people think of cities as an insane asylum and all that that conjures up, right? And so to have now this new stuff happening in a neighborhood and a place that was so neglected is really, really important. I think what I would say about this is it's cool to have the business incubators and all of that stuff. And like people need jobs. So it's going to be important for those hundred jobs to go to people in that community, right? Because oftentimes what gentrification looks like is putting pretty things in rough neighborhoods and then bringing other people in to take care of those pretty things. And I think we as a community have to be vigilant, not be, I'm no shade to the business people or anybody who has helped make this project together. But I think we as a community have to be vigilant about holding people accountable for not just giving us shiny, pretty things, but helping us get the things that actually change people's lives and change people's circumstances. So my news was something that I was, you know, I brought it because I was both surprised by it. And then I was like, oh, maybe I'm wrong. And I was like, oh, well, my correction was even weirder. So there was a story about how 27 kids have been reported missing in May of this year in Cleveland and how it was a big increase. You know, the police department is saying actually that they received 33 reports of missing kids for all of May, which is a little broader than the New York Post, New York Post, like in Fox and some other places that posted this story about this rash of missing kids in Cleveland and a spike of missing kids happening in Cleveland. And then I have a friend who I follow on Instagram who I've known who actually do from Twitter. She also posted something about black kids going missing or in Cleveland. She's from Cleveland. She posted this plea from my mom being like, please help her my son. So I was like, okay, I hadn't heard anything about the missing kids in Cleveland. And then the police department, there's an article in Axios. And the headline is Cleveland police address misinformation on missing kids. So I'm like, whoa, this is another example of the internet running away with the story and did it. So then I look at it and their correction is not that that many kids were not missing, but that there's just not a crisis. And I was like, well, that's not that wasn't the correction I was looking for. So the police department is like, you know, there are always a lot of missing kids and yes, that it's a 20% increase from last year. But out of the 1,072 kids who have been reported missing, 1,020 of those kids have been returned home. That's the police department's claim. So they are not contesting that there's a spike in kids missing. There are a lot of kids who are missing in May, but they're like, you know, some kids run away and it just happens. Remember, those kids don't get amber alerts. And they are sort of saying, well, we found most of them. And I was just floored by this because the story of a rash missing kids is a problem. I mean, even if you find the kids later, the idea of this many kids being missing is actually in and of itself a problem, especially when you think, I mean, they're kids. I don't even know, especially when you get whatever, whether they're running away, the police department's like, you know, we don't know anything about trafficking. But I when I read misinformation, I was like, Oh, they the kids weren't missing. That's what I thought the story was going to be. I was like, no, no, the kids are missing. There actually is a spike in kids missing. And for the police department to be like, Hey, you know, this just always happens was not a comforting response and was certainly not the response that I was expecting. So I wanted to bring it here because this is something from a numbers perspective that I don't deal with in my work. And I don't see much information about missing kids until there's like a tragedy that happens. But I hadn't even this made me want to look at spikes across the country. What is happening to kids like, where are they going? You know, and how do we deal with that? So I thought I bring it here. Yeah, I think that's really interesting. I I definitely understand both both takes. I think the thing about when Black children go missing or when just marginalized children in the community, like, oh, missing, it's always a hint that there's like a person who's a predator on the on the loose. So like the 20% would have been alarming to me. That's what's kind of wild to me where I'm like, sure, a lot of kids are going missing. And you're finding most of them. But still from last year, there's a 20% spike, which might mean that there's actually somebody who's, you know, an individual who's making this happen. I don't know if that's just like my true crime brain or or what, but that that would just be where my mind goes. And it's just a wild that for me, because I grew up in grew up in Atlanta, this obviously reminds me of the story that happened in the early nights with Atlanta, where that man was like killing all the Black children. And because because of similar reasons, because children go missing all the time, it wasn't connected that this might be one individual. And I just think that we should always be alarmed when spikes like that happen in one place, because our ignorance to it can obviously cause lives. I thought the exact same thing, Miles, I remember being in elementary school and wearing little green ribbons every day for the days that kids were missing during the Atlanta child murders. And people literally did not pay attention because they were missing Black kids. And this feels very similar to that. Like, and like, I want the community to be outraged. I want, I want us to have done everything that we, you know, could do to realize that it's not one person, and it is just a bunch of runaways. But I don't feel like that's the case right now. And kids are in danger and we need to do something about that. You always rather overreact, right? And we spent seven, so whatever million dollars down the down the down the exactly $1 million, you know, what did y'all think about the misinformation? When I saw misinformation, I was like, Oh, they must say the kids got found. And I was like, Oh, no, it's just, and I guess you wouldn't know about this more than I went to right. But it just seems like police have gotten even more even on a local level, like have gotten even more like savvy on on internet narratives, because it felt so PR and it felt so it felt so savvy. Yeah, it's been pure spin. Yeah, it felt so savvy. And the fact that it was, the fact that it was made into an article and that means that police have some type of relationship with some with with a media outlet, you know what I mean? And it just felt very pea it felt. Yeah, just he already, which is not how you want police to say. You know, I think it's just building on what Kaya said in terms of just activating the community around it is it just does seem like something that the administration should pick up or something that the black community as a collective should be pushing the administration to address. Just like we're, you know, working to address maternal health care for black women, I think this missing children thing is a crisis and and should be getting national attention and federal funding resources. Like, I wouldn't what I wouldn't want to do. My else, your point is leave it to local governments, particularly communities where local governments have oppressed suppress those black communities for years, for years and in Cleveland or have mercy. And what you say makes me think of the idea that and we've talked about this on the podcast before, like kids are not just missing from families, kids are missing from schools in droves. New York City lost 300,000 kids. They're independent. They literally don't know where these kids are. We did this article and it seems like and this has tremendous implications for the funding of education across the country. Los Angeles can't find 40% of its kids, all of these staggering numbers. And so why isn't there a federal task force that is trying to figure out where are the children because they didn't all get on a rocket and go to Mars looking for a new experience, right? They are here somewhere and we got to find those kids. Well, that's it. Thanks so much for tuning in to PODS or the people this week.
