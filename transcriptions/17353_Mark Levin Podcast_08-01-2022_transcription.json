    "text": " It's all quiet in the underground bunker. Doors closed, blocks bolted. But the great one isn't just resting on his laurels. He's making sure your weekend is even better by giving you his best. This is the best of Mark Levin. Boy, I missed you. My radio family missed you very, very much. Needed the two weeks off, spent a lot of time together with my beautiful wife, family. That's always a good thing too. But I really did miss you very much. And I want to thank all the folks who sat in here for their time and their outstanding broadcast skills. And I want to thank you for listening to them. Now I have to jump right back into the slop. It's unfortunate. The slop that is Washington, DC, the slop that is the American media, the slop that is the Democrat Party, the slop that is the American Marxist movement. But we all have to jump in in order to wrestle it to the ground, don't we folks? And so here we are. I hope you didn't watch the Sunday shows, except mine, of course. I hope you didn't watch them. Filled with propaganda, all saying the same thing, all bringing on January 6th committee members or they never trumpers, all telling us that if Donald Trump is nominated again, democracy will fail, all telling us that Donald Trump led an insurrection because he failed to act. All telling us that this was the greatest threat since the Civil War. And they're going to subpoena Trump, the Trump kids, they're going to subpoena conservative members of the House. They're going to get to the bottom of this boy. And it's all being orchestrated by Nancy Eva stretch Pelosi, all of it. To take attention away from her dereliction of duty to protect that building and to accept the offer of 10 to 20,000 National Guardsmen to accept the offer from law enforcement to beef up protections. So much so that I read over the holiday. That the committee wants to release an interim report. Well, why do they need to release an interim report? Because they might lose power by next year this time. So this is entirely political, entirely political. This was not an insurrection. Five people were not killed on that day. One person was killed on that day by a capital policeman who got away with it. And is now celebrated as some kind of a righteous hero. The only cop Nancy Pelosi in the Democrats like the only one. The only one. Meanwhile during the holiday, cops were murdered in the street in this country, murdered. And there was a decision against former police officer pal that turned my stomach in Minnesota. She never should have been charged. The individual she killed was clearly an accident. And it was called on the body cam for God's sakes. And the individual, this 20 year old had a criminal record as long as my arm. And yet because of the ambiguity, ambiguity in the law, this police officer pal was convicted. Potter, excuse me, Potter was convicted. Outrageous. Now, if this event on January 6th last year was an insurrection, how come nobody's been charged with committing or participating in an insurrection? The Department of Justice highly politicized on their Joe Biden, Emeritus Garland. They're looking under every rock. They're charging people with trespassing with parading in public. Where's all the insurrection charges? There's not one. Not one. And of course, all the firearms that were used in the Capitol building by these so-called insurrectionists. Well, they didn't use any firearms. None. Oh, OK. Well, they tried to burn the building. No, they didn't. No, they didn't. Now, I'm not going to defend violence. I'm not going to defend what took place on January 6th with those who were violent. But I'm not going to sit here and pretend that this was the greatest threat to this republic since the Civil War. The greatest threat to this republic is the Democrat Party before the Civil War, during the Civil War and after the Civil War. That's the greatest threat, including Nancy Pelosi. She threatens her liberties more than anyone or anything else, as far as I'm concerned. But it is time for a brief history list. Because you're not going to get it from Chuck Todd, who's as dumb as a rock in a political hack with a stupid haircut. You're not going to get it from George Stephanopoulos. Remember him going after women, a misogynist? When he headed the war room for the pervert in chief? Oh, I remember him. All these political hacks, the worst of the political hacks, now have Sunday shows. To tell you what to think. But before I jump in, let me remind you of something, the greatest threat to democracy. We've had three presidents, JFK, McKinley, and Garfield, who were assassinated. Seems to me a pretty great threat to democracy. How about you? How about you? We the Democrat Party throughout the south. Post Civil War, right up into the last century, hanging black people, the Klan, and others. The party of slavery and segregation, the party of the Klan, the party of Jim Crow. That seems to me a pretty grave threat to democracy. When it comes to voting, it's not Republicans who've prevented people from voting. It's the Democrats. The Democrats want people to vote who shouldn't vote. That's a big difference, you know. Today they do. And we'll get into that later. It's lots to cover here. Tierney knows no bounds when the Democrats are in town, or when they're not in town. 2016 Russia collusion was the most aggressive, comprehensive effort to reverse an election and overthrow an elected president in American history. And the party is involved with the parties who are now self-righteously projecting about 2020 in January 6th. Chuck Todd, George Stephanopoulos, Jake Tamper, all the reprobates, all the miscreants and malcontents dressed up as journalists who've destroyed the First Amendment and freedom of the press. They were all in on it. Obama and Biden, their various departments and offices, they were all in on it. Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, the DNC, they were all in on it. Perkins, Coy and Mark Elias and Sussman and the other lawyers slip and fall types. They were all in on it. All in on it. But now they say January 6th is the worth orchestrated by Pelosi because they must. They must. January 6th, it's the first time an election was ever really challenged, don't you know ladies until first time. Well, let's disabuse these moronic hacks of this. It's pointed out even in the New York Times by a guest columnist some time ago, in January 2001, the late representative, Alcy Hastings objected to counting his state's electoral votes because of quote, overwhelming evidence of official misconduct, deliberate fraud in an attempt to suppress voter turnout. Sheila Jackson Lee referred to the quote, millions of Americans who've been disenfranchised by Florida's inaccurate vote count. Maxine Waters at California characterized Florida's electoral votes as fraudulent. Vice President Al Gore presided over the meeting in 2001. He had overruled their objections. The Al Gore brought all the lawsuits. He started it. When all the way to the Supreme Court, we tried to overturn the election system, the laws in the state of Florida, as did the Florida Supreme Court. But the US Supreme Court under Chief Justice Renquist had the guts and the wisdom and the foresight to act, to intervene and to stop what the Democrats were doing to the Republican legislature to stop what the state Supreme Court had done. Unlike this court, which wouldn't stop what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did to the Republican legislature, in January 2005, in the wake of Mr. Bush's reelection, Democrats were more aggressive. Barbara Boxer, Rep. Bate, California joined Representative Steven Tubbs, Joseph Estefany Tubbs, Jones of Ohio to lodge a formal objective to Ohio's electoral votes. The objection compelled Congress to spend two hours in debate, even though Mr. Bush won Ohio by more than 118,000 votes. Barbara Lea, California, claimed that the democratic process was thwarted. Gerald Nadler, New York, the right to vote was stolen. Waters objected to dedicating her objection to the documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, Fahrenheit 9-11. It failed, but 31 members of the House and Ms. Boxer in the Senate voted to reject Ohio's electoral votes, effectively voting to say some franchise to people of Ohio. In January 2017, after Donald Trump's victory, Democrats in Congress once again challenged the election outcome. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts, said to quote, the confirmed and illegal activities engaged by the government of Russia. Mizzly of California argued that Michigan's electoral votes should be thrown up because, quote, people are horrified by the overwhelming evidence of Russian interference in our elections. She cited, quote, the malfunction of 87 voting machines. There were objections against the votes in at least nine states. And it goes on. It goes on. Oh, what took place on January 6th was that the greatest threat to democracy in American history. Nancy Pelosi wants you to believe that. Joe Biden wants you to believe that the Democrat party and the media want you to believe it. This is the same cabal that is pushing to destroy our economic system, our immigration system, our financial system, our voting system. And as I said, pushed the Russian hoax collusion lies for two and a half years. March, 1954, Puerto Rican nationalists, a gang sat in the gallery at the house of representatives and they decided to try to kill members of the house of representatives. This is how it was actually, let me take a break before we went out of time. I want to play for you what took place and how it was reported. We'll be right back. Folks, our friends at Hillsdale College wish you and yours a happy and blessed Christmas and a healthy and prosperous new year. Since Hillsdale's founding in 1844, it has taught its students by precept an example, the teaching and practices of faith. The college continues this mission in its classrooms and nationwide through its educational outreach efforts. Hillsdale College pursues learning, character, faith and freedom in all they do. Because supporters like you allow them to refuse every penny of taxpayer money, even indirectly in the form of federal student grants and loans. So this Christmas season, my friends at Hillsdale want to thank you for your kindness toward the college. They've prepared a special video featuring their sacred music choir singing O Little Town of Bethlehem in their beautiful Christ Chapel at the heart of the campus. When you visit levinnforehillsdale.com, you can see and hear the choir and view many other free resources to help you celebrate the season. That's levinnforehillsdale.com. Making your weekend even better. This is the best of Mark Levin. We're going to have to wait till after the bottom of the hour to do the audio, because there's not enough time in this segment. But there was an outstanding piece written some time ago. This is important because you were being indoctrinated all Sunday, January 6th, they're going to push. And really, it's all aimed at attacking you, Trump supporters, painting with a broad brush, attaining attacking President Trump. You hear, if you want to hear what they're up to, listen to Liz Cheney, she's actually pretty stupid. And she goes out there and exposes the whole agenda. The whole nasty, sickening poisonous agenda, which is to stop Trump. She would like to be president if she can, or she'd like one of the other rhino frauds to be president, one of the people that might get the rubber stamp from the Cheney family or the Bush family or the usual reprobates. But it's a different time now. I remember when the Bushers did their best to undermine Ronald Reagan, and they done their best undermine Donald Trump as well as far as I'm concerned, as they slobber all over the Obamas. Now, all that said, all that said, the point here is to try and stop Trump, because they see that the vast majority Republicans would support Trump for president again. Now, some of you may not, some of you may, that's not the point. They just fear this man like nothing else. He's a great threat to democracy, they say. Not the Democrat Congress that wants to destroy the court, even John Roberts, the feckless John Roberts, the Chief Justice, finally came out and said that these threats about packing the court, they're an effort effectively to intimidate judges and justices. Well, of course they are. You've got Schumer now pushing to eliminate the filibuster by January 17. Why? So they can nationalize all elections, destroy the Republican states. And it's not so every person who's loud to vote votes. It's so every person they want will vote once, twice, more than once. And illegal aliens will be free to vote because you will not have ID requirements, and you will not have election judges who can question the voting of individuals. And it turns out thousands of the 12,000 foreigners actually voted in the state of Texas. That doesn't get headline news. Nobody's running with that. I mean, you can't prove fraud. You can't show fraud. 12,000 illegal aliens voting in Texas. That sounds like fraud to me. And if 12,000 illegal aliens are voting in Texas with voter ID, imagine. Imagine foreigners, not necessarily illegal aliens, even worse, just foreigners. Because they don't want any rules. The Democrat party is embracing Marxism. And why have rules? This isn't about majoritarianism. This isn't about democracy. This is about republicanism, little are. Voting is just part of the system. It's not all the system. It's part of the system, which is why they keep attacking the constitutional system, which is why they have the borders wide open, which is why they don't believe in checks and balances and separation of powers unless they can use these rules to attack a Republican president. All right. When I come back, we will start with the attack. The shooting of members of the House of Representatives on March 19th, March 1, 1954, something that Chuck Todd never talks about because he's a dumbass. I'll be right back. Mark, about them.

March one 1954 cut for go in Washington, D.C. Ruthless fanatic violence erupted in the halls of Congress. Three men and a woman believed to be members of the Puerto Rican nationalist gang that in November 1950 attempted the assassination of President Truman opened fire from the visitors gallery of the House of Representatives. Five congressmen were hit. Ben F. Jensen of Iowa Clifford Davis of Tennessee, Kenneth Roberts of Alabama, George H. Fallon of Maryland and Albert Bentley of Michigan who was seriously injured. So stop. Four members of Congress were shot one seriously. From the gallery down onto the house floor. They were shot. Go ahead. Tech came as the enter American conference opened in Venezuela and it suggested the motive may have been to arouse anti United States feeling in Latin America through an act of apparently blind violence carefully calculated to inflame America's relations with her neighbors. Estimates of the numbers of shots fired ranged from 15 to 30 and each bullet hole found as a grim reminder to those who were present of the terrible surprise attack. The gang seized by shot bystanders as they emptied their guns was held at police headquarters as a widespread search was launched for others who shared in the plot. To Irving Forest, Rafael Miranda, Mrs. Lolita Lebron, Andre Cordero, the gun wielders and to their accomplices goes the evil distinction of having perpetrated a criminal outrage almost unique in America's history. What an violence that shocked and stirred the nation and it only harmed to the cause of the Puerto Rican people. Bullet holes can be seen in the house chamber from shots fired in 1954 by Puerto Rican nationalists. March the first 1954 and that's when the four Puerto Ricans entered the capital in the house gallery where I was working and began to shoot into the chamber. Five members of Congress were wounded no one died. I was a staffer at that time in the gallery and that position was to sit at the apex of the gallery and we took notes and kept the rest of what was happening. At that time we were debating a bill which is very much almost very much in the news today was called the Brousero bill. It was a bill allowing immigrant workers from the south of the aborters to come into California and Arizona and New Mexico to work the fields and harvest the fruit and things like that and it was pretty controversial even then. And I turned around noticed some people came in the door which was to my left upstairs and then I turned around and looked at them and you know I figured they were just tourists like so many people and I paid them more attention to them. For some reason or another I've never been able to fathom this. I decided I couldn't hear very well and I still have that problem today and so I moved my seat further down the aisle. We had stools there so I could be almost directly above the speakers there so I could hear better which was true you could hear better. And it wasn't 10 seconds after I moved that I heard this loud popping or it pow pow pow and I turned around in my seats to my left and looked up and I see these people are standing up with guns in their hands and the woman was standing with them and she had a big flag and she was unfurling the flag waving the flag back and forth and I ducked underneath the ledge. We had a ledge a writing ledge and a phone right there and I subsequently found out I cut my hand and I got on the phone and to come to our office and I said there's a shooting going on out here to my boss and everybody was scaring and running around and I noticed basically some people who were in the gallery, visitors who were grappling with these people and pushing them out the door. I was in the back benches in the corner waiting to be called to go to the various members chairs to determine what they needed. A call came in I was in the first chair I got up to go and I took about two or three steps and I recall hearing what I thought at the time sounded like firecrackers almost as if you lit a pack of firecrackers through them fast rapid reports but in reality after the third step I got sprayed with what made me feel was sand or ash or stone and as a young man I had done a lot of target practice in quarries so I was well aware of what a bullet does when it hits and glances off a stone it sets off a spray and it felt like the same thing and immediately I remember thinking by golly these are gunshots they're not firecrackers so I hit the floor and that's right behind the elevated floor of the house and then within a matter of a few moments the firing ceased and there was a lot of commotion on the floor disorganization but because I had an early realization of what was going on my first instinct to see whether anyone was hurt and my best friend as a matter of fact who was also a page Bill Emerson who I'd met that was just several while a year and a half before that time but we were roommates and best friends at school he was also in the corner and when my sign was made immediately I got up and I got Bill and we both went on to the floor and we determined that they needed stretchers and some people were wounded so we we tried to organize the pages and other people to help us out to get these conveyances and over the process of the next half hour so we participated in carrying three of the members out to the ambulances and the last member that we took out we went to the hospital with them it's now a famous picture in several respects it's the picture of the year 1954 in life magazine and it was taken right outside the doors of the house as we're starting on down the steps of the capital the fellow was finger pointing front is my best friend Bill Emerson he was a member of I folks you get the point it was heavily covered by the media in the 1950s 1954 it was a direct attack against the members of the house four members were shot one seriously the house was breached these individuals came in with weapons they were waving the Puerto Rican flag they wanted independence what's interesting is there's been many votes on independence and they all lose so what happened to these four people these four people who sought to murder members of the house of representatives murdered them we don't have a single charge of that kind not one not even close in the quote-unquote seven hundred people who've been rounded up not one not a single gun was fired except by a capital police officer who killed an American army veteran who did not have a weapon opposed to threat to nobody as pointed out in the daily signal 23 years later president Carter commuted the sentence of one of the individuals who had cancer two years after that he commuted the sentences of the other three the one-oh-one cancer died in 79 the other three live long lives of leftist activism the leftist activism and some were treated as heroes one got a fawning obituary in the New York times Carter's sector state Cyrus Vance said the release would be a significant humanitarian gesture and will be viewed as such by much of the international community Carter later told congressional spanish caucus members he had released them for humane reasons over 25 years was long enough the four were unrepentant at least two of the terrorists said they would not rule out using violent means again which was probably the reason then Puerto Rico governor Carlos Romero Borrello sent Carter a strong and forceful letter against releasing unrepentant terrorists and warning of dangerous repercussions a letter Jimmy Carter ignored 1954 you see because they know this isn't taught in the public schools or colleges and universities and they know that Chuck Todd and George Stephanopoulos and the others will cover up for them they just continue to repeat that January 6 is the greatest threat to American democracy since the Civil War not the assassination of three presidents not 9-11 not the Democrat party and their alliance with the Klan and lynchings none of that no no no no not segregation and Jim Crow not 9-11 January 6 which is why they have to keep calling it something it's not an insurrection which is why they have to keep saying five people died that day when we know four of them died having nothing to do nothing to do with an assault except one who was a protester who was a protester gets even more interesting there's going to take a little time you know I I'm not you know we're not speeding through the show it's just going to take a little bit of time the weather underground you're familiar with the weather underground people in the weather underground were buddies spill air's Bernadine Dorn with Barack Obama when they came out during the primaries brought up by Hillary Clinton and other Democrats and when it came out during the general election you although feebly impassively when McCain was running against Obama the media all but covered it up or really just rejected it which is what they do all the time they actually exploded a bomb in the Capitol building in 1971 when we come back I want you to hear this we'll be right back mark of oven tis the season to shine with h&m discover the holiday collection and to find fashionable pieces for

folks they have all the networks and 98 percent of the news platforms and you have me which is why we have to take our time and go through this because much of this you probably have heard for the first time well let's get started 1971 march one again the weather underground bill airs in his buddies cut one go at one minute before one o'clock this morning the switchboard at the Capitol received a phone call a man's voice said a bomb would go off in the building in half an hour at 1 30 in the morning it did in a small unmarked restroom on the ground floor of the senate side next to a barber shop and near several small offices including one committee hearing room for a report on the first serious damage to the nation's foremost structure since the british burned it in 1814 here is a bc congressional correspondent bob clark there was alarm for a time that other bombs might still be hidden inside the capital a least used dog specially trained to sniff out explosives in a painstaking search both inside and outside the building the single bomb set off by a timing device left the men's room a shambles bombing demolished rips and plaster ripped from walls army and fbi experts sifted the debris seeking a clue to the nature of the explosion there was heavy damage to the nearby barber shop windows were smashed there and a hundred feet away in the senate restaurant where tables were overturned in a priceless stained glass mosaic destroyed damage estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars might have been far worse but for the three-foot thick walls in the oldest part of the capital as it was the violent explosion ripped off doors in nearby conference rooms there was no damage to the senate chamber itself on the floor above daylight revealed more smashed windows and debris tourists were barred from the senate wing all day but the entire capital will be reopened to the public as soon as possible everyone entering the senate wing today had to pass a security check the capital's police chief told how an operator received the bomb threat uh this building will blow up in 30 minutes uh evacuate the building this is in protest of the nixon involvement in louse in louse when george washington the chief of a new and shaky union laid the cornerstone of the capital building he said it may be relied upon it is the progress of this building that will inspire or depress the public confidence when lincoln first met confederate negotiators towards the end of the civil war the first thing the southerners all former congressmen asked was tell me sir how is the capital well after yesterday's desecration the old places today a little depressed and confidence is not unshaken abc capital hill correspondent bob clark reports officials in charge of security at the capital along with army bomb experts were summoned to a senate hearing the immediate problem is to guard against any more bombings while keeping the capital open to the public it was clear from the testimony about yesterday's bombing that this won't be easy it probably was um or could have very well been a clock delay device and it very likely could have been normal dynamite which is very easy to obtain it could have been oh 15 to 20 pounds a dynamite that amount of dynamite is very easy to bring in in a briefcase police did their best to keep the capital under tight security today with check points set up to examine packages and briefcases we tried out the security system carrying a briefcase into a house office building past police guards threw an underground tunnel and into the capital without being stopped or searched well we may have been recognized by some guards it's clearly almost impossible to enforce security through all six buildings linked by the point as the daily signal points out no arrests were made nor were charges charges filed in connection with the 1971 bombing of the capital by the weather underground so there were no sentences to commute now it goes on the weathermen were at it again a dozen years later in 1983 setting off another bomb that tore through the second floor the capital's north wing according to the u.s. senate history site 1983 12 years later moments earlier group calling it something armed resistance unit called in a warning to the senate switch war but lives were spared only because debated ceased earlier than expected over a million dollars in damage and the reason the perpetrators gave was u.s. military involvement in lebanon and granada in 1988 the fbi rested and charged seven men and women for the execution of the blast all were either members of the weather underground or at some length to it some were closely associated with a main 19 communist organization some then pleaded deals and were eventually charged with other crimes some others were paroled and one of them is still on the lamb paroled under who under whom under whom now rosenberg who was pardoned by clinton as was another leader of the group she was supposed to serve 58 years didn't even come close she's chairman of the board of thousand currents the deep pocketed funder of left wing causes including black lives and mac mark the vin

and these radical marxist movements responsible for violence in this country they've all come together to focus on tomorrow they cannot make the case that president trump authorized a violent attack against the capital building or as ted cruis now puts it a attack by domestic terrorists i suppose they cannot make that case so they're trying to make the case that it's a dereliction of duty by the president they've covered up nancy polosi's role they will not release documents texts emails they will not subpoena her records they will not compel her testimony under penalty of criminal indictment and the media of course are absolutely silent on this point to what extent are the media and the democrat party and these radical groups responsible responsible for the violence that has taken place in this country who is it that's pushing critical race theory a racist marxist ideology who is it that is pushing segregation who is it that covers that for a hunter Biden while going after the trump children who is it that promotes russia collusion and russia collusion as many tributaries to it violations of the vice-a-law illegal felonious leaks the media participation the lawnering of money to create a dossier the unequal justice that has applied to certain individuals was SWAT teams included but not other individuals who who triggered funded and launched what is the greatest attack in my view on the republic the phony oversight committees in congress run by one party the lies that were repeatedly told to the american people about president trump and russia the use of the fbi and the intelligence agencies the use of the white house including the oval office the democrat national committee the hillary clinton campaign the phony experts who are brought on television programs who call white people racists day in and day out day in and day out the phony experts they bring on tv to call president trump and his supporters hit larryin stalinists so forth and so on the media where you cannot tell the difference between the news and the opinion writers and the opinion speakers which have decided to destroy their entire profession such as it was to advance an ideology and to advance the cause of a party who is it that unleash the war against police officers with brazen lies by marxists like black lives matter a group celebrated by the corporatists by professional athletes by esp n celebrated by the democrat party millions of dollars poured into their coffers they haven't done a damn thing for black people and never will a marxist movement that embraces critical race theory and pushes their agenda these corporatists Comcast they own nbc and msmbc msmbc the home of joy read and other individuals who are flat out racist some bigots homophobes and anti-semithes who are given voice because they're radical leftists or they're professors or they're members of congress or they're members of particular ethnicity cnn which spends 90 percent of its time advancing the cause of the democrat party trashing the fox news network trashing its viewers with phony reporters and journalists all of whom are former democrats who've worked in politics look at the sunday shows there's not a dime's worth a difference between them how can that be same mindset same lack of morals same lack of values the attack on the american system the attack on american values the attack on people as a result of their race white people the attack on people who are holding deeply to their faith evangelicals orthodox jews open season open season and at the same time the american people are put down the same time they're put down they have no say on what's taking place in this country if a department of justice led by a man who unleashes the fbi in the domestic terrorism unit the national security unit the us attorney's office the criminal division the civil rights division against parents protesting at school board meeting us against the teachers unions against critical race theory against the destruction the destruction of the family structure with a transgender movement then lee's federal law enforcement which is colluding with the national school board associations and the teachers unions and anybody else who opposes parent involvement and what their kids are learning you have a woman who was promoted by the new york times the so-called 1619 project who spews her racism and her hate for this country who says she doesn't understand why parents should have any say in education after all they're not experts they're not experts you have a democrat party that spent two and a half years working with the media one in the same to try and reverse the 2016 election first deny the winner then try to destroy the winner two phony impeachments one phony criminal investigation multiple phony coup efforts a federal bureaucracy utterly under control starting with the federal bureau of investigation you have people in this country who work hard and pay taxes who are told they don't work hard enough and they don't pay enough taxes while they watch people they subsidize on the dole not working receiving funds not contributing to society as bernie sanders pushes his welfare state communist model on the nation with the with the the aggressive support of the democrat party and the use of language that republican legislatures that are trying to to return to some kind of semblance of a rational election system where they can actually determine if votes are legitimate or not called Jim Crow the democrat party using Jim Crow against republicans isn't that ironic well the democrat party and their media thugs and mouthpieces are pushing an agenda they call it voting rights which has nothing to do with voting rights and everything to do with the permanent empowerment of the democrat party in a one party state that same party destroying the filibuster to get whatever it can get that same party trying to destroy the independence of the judiciary because it demands conformity it demands power it demands allegiance that same party working with big tech to shut down all debate all debate that does not conform to the message of the current democrat party government with a democrat party period you have one of these robber barons in the name of zuckerberg who poured over four hundred million dollars into the last race to effectively elect democrats and joe biden under the radar he comes under no scrutiny whatsoever none none you have hundreds of millions in dark money unreported funds being used to back mark a lies who is a reprobate lawyer who has spent years trying to change the election process to ensure that democrats win and when there's any pushback against any of this whether it's parents at school board meetings whether it's taxpayers whether it's talk show hosts whether it's individuals on fox news whether it's authors any pushback whatsoever it has to be crushed these same people who hate this country are now trying to define january sixth the same people who celebrate it or accept it we've been denied the violence of the riots that cost over two billion dollars in damage directly resulting in the lost lives of dozens of people that involve the the harming the battery of thousands and thousands of law enforcement police officers that caused arnichy and trauma that was clearly an effort to overthrow this government there's no commission investigating any of it the FBI is applying most of its resources to january six black lives matter is celebrated at the mba in the nfl it's celebrated with certain streets in washington dc in new york city and around the country despite its allegiance and its funding support from individuals including those who are part of the weather underground who actually blew up the capital building the pentagon the state department and went back again at the capital building the media lie about january six we all saw it we all know there were some violent thugs who deserve to be prosecuted for their attacks on the cops in the building but we also know there weren't a thousand of them we also know there weren't half a million of them we also know there weren't eight hundred thousand of them that we also know that president trump had nothing to do with it and you know how i know that ladies and gentlemen it would have been leaked because this committee is leaking everything to their favorite radical media sources and why are we to believe the media why are we to believe the democrat party and their surrogates do they have the best interest of you and mine and the truth in mind the democrat party has been an evil evil party overall an evil entity with its support of slavery and segregation its support of the clan and lynching even way up into the 1960s and late and early 70s elements of the democrat party had to be put down and so black people and other minorities in this country could enjoy the right to vote an semblance of equality and today they still reject americanism as they embrace Marxism and the media this would be the same media the new york times they covered up the holocaust and whose main reporter in berlin was a supporter of hitler they covered up the slaughter of the Ukrainians by stalin whose main reporter in moscow was a supporter of stalin and covered up the real intentions of castro whose main reporter was a castro supporter that new york time thank you"
