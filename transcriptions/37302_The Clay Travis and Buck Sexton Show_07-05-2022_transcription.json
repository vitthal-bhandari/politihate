The virus that causes shingles is sleeping in 99% of people over 50. It's lying dormant, waiting and it could reactivate at any time. And while not everyone at risk will develop shingles, it strikes as a painful blistering rash that can last for weeks. When you're not at risk for shingles, it's time to wake up because shingles could wake up in you. If you're over 50, talk to your doctor or pharmacist about shingles prevention. Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Welcome in everybody to the Thursday edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show. We are racked and stacked just to give you sense of where this is going today. We have Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin joining us on the program. Dana Perino of Fox News. She's fantastic. Everybody likes Dana Perino. She is fantastic. Everyone loves Dana Perino. Yeah. Cash Patel, friend of mine former senior Trump administration, national security official with an exclusive for us that has to do with whether we'll actually ever get to the truth of the Russia collusion lies. Cash was the acting chief of staff for the secretary of defense in the Trump administration. We'll be joining us later on the program too. We've also got more on the economy. Rough day in the stock market. Clay, how you doing over there, buddy? You all right? We're going to have to do six hours of radio a day. I'm getting roughed up in the market right now. It's not good. Yeah, not well. As we speak, by the way, the Dow is down over a thousand points, which is not a good day. By the way, Buck, the one thing you could point to if you are a Biden supporter is that the stock market has not been a disaster if you're a but. So much for that one. I knew smug Democrats a year ago right around now were saying, oh, this Biden economy is not going to be good because the stock, you know, and they were making jokes because the stock market was actually doing pretty well so much for that one. Oh, and also inflation at the highest. It's been in 40 years. So we'll talk about the economy more on the border crisis. The climate advisor to clay will discuss that just to give you a sense of some people know there are things that really set me off. People who speak on their phones in public places on speakerphone like there's no one else there like I'm in a crowded restaurant. I'm just going to speak up. I lose my mind. Like I definitely don't handle that well. But people who in government think that endless regulations and harassment in this case around appliances is a good idea. You know, your refrigerator has to be compliant with 50 new rules or else. Yeah, we'll talk about that. But I want to start with with a basic premise here. And it is one that I think is going to have a major effect and Clay and I have been discussing this on air with you and and off air a lot, a major effect on the midterm election. But we got to make sure everyone's clear on it. The Democrats have betrayed kids. They've made decisions that have really hurt kids all across the country. Now we can and we will continue to talk about the issue of abortion, Roe versus Wade and the decades long moral stain on our country from that. I'm actually not even speaking about that specifically right now. That certainly comes into the equation. So they've betrayed kids with the indoctrination of them from CRT as we know and trans identity agenda for very young kids. And now Clay, the one that I think is the most because people are going to argue on those a whole lot, right? So that's what I mean by we'll continue to talk about those issues. We'll can you talk about abortion. We'll continue to talk about the fight for life and also the fight for non indoctrination of kids in school. This piece in the New York Times, you and I are both reading this this morning on school closures is absolutely devastating because this is no longer in the realm of, oh, we're going to make an argument. They're going to make an argument. This is now we have the data. We have studies. We have test scores. We have results. And the and the quick summary of this is Democrats overwhelmingly push for and put aside, I might even talk about the second semester you could call it of 2020. I'll, I'll give that one a pass for people were scared. It was early. We didn't know as much starting in the fall of 2020 when Florida was open fall of 2020 going into that election. And then certainly in 2021, we had more than enough data to know the following things were true. Children were at no real risk from COVID. Children were not a major source of spread of COVID. Children were going to be dramatically harmed socially, developmentally by this, by the school closures. Democrat enclaves, Democrat, blue cities and states were much worse off with this than ever were everywhere else. Clay, top to bottom school closures were wrong and disastrous and the Democrats need to be made to own this. Yeah, if I could go back in time, Buck and get Trump to focus on one thing that I think was wildly underplayed in the 2020 presidential election, he should have gone all in on every school needs to be back open. And I'm fortunate because I live in a red state in a red county in a red state. My kids went back to school in early August of 2020 with no issues. But the New York Times finally getting around to covering this after two years reading it this morning. We talked about this book and I've known and been talking about it really since the summer of 2020 because I talked to a bunch of different teachers who were in disadvantaged schools. However, you want to quantify it and they were talking about they had kids who were studying for AP exams and they said, well, we'll just go remote in the in the summer. We'll be able to talk to everybody that way. And I was talking to an AP history teacher at actually a wedding and he was discussing the fact that his kids were having to drive to McDonald's parking lots and sit in the McDonald's parking lot to be able to get on Wi-Fi. And that was if they had access to being able to get to the McDonald's. And what rapidly should have become crystal clear to anyone out there was one remote learning is an oxymoron. It doesn't actually work. And two, even for remote learning, it is a privileged process to have a laptop and a workable Wi-Fi and an adult supervisory figure who can get you on the computer. And so the party of equity, I mean, it's astounding irony. The party that claimed that it was so focused on equity in the wake of George Floyd and abandoned equality ended up with the least equitable policy in the 21st century and in most of our lives. And young minority underprivileged kids overwhelmingly bore the brunt of schools not being open. And this is a quote from Thomas Kane who wrote a massive Harvard study on the futility of remote learning. He said, first of all, the data showed that low income students in particular black and Latino students fell farther behind over the past two years relative to students who are high income, white or Asian. And here's a direct quote from Thomas Kane. This will probably be the largest increase in educational, educational inequity in a generation. Democrats caused that and their teachers unions and their politicians and everybody who helped to make this policy happen. Buck, this is why this election has to be a reckoning. There have to be consequences for the biggest public policy failure of our lives, most of us, or what's the point of an election at all? There has to be a red wave to punish these people. There are two areas that I want to make sure that we don't forget either in all of this, but sure, you and I sat here together for many months talking about how as soon as they look at the numbers, you're going to find out. I mean, high poverty schools, they said this and this is in the Harvard University study. I think that you were referencing Clay from that New York Times piece, almost 14 weeks of learning loss from remote. It's almost like kids just weren't in school for a third of the school year, let's call it, right? I mean, roughly. Beyond that or whatever the actual week's out up to, beyond that, the whole premise of this was that there would be a tendon benefit, right? That there was so it was weird because everyone knew this was going to be bad for kids at some level. It was worse than the Lib said it would be. It was worse than the Democrats said it would be, but they also said, well, this is a necessary thing for safety. We're the serious people. We need better filters in school. They had they've had huge sums of money have gone toward COVID, you know, COVID proofing and COVID assistance in the school system. I'd be very curious to know what that money was actually spent on, but the part of this that's so that's so hard bring, we have the data on learning loss, which is catastrophic for particularly low income, black and Latino students, young students who for whom the school system is so essential. So the learning loss was already behind Buck. Let's be clear about that. They were already behind. And then we just made it so much worse as a country. So it was worse than anticipated by the Democrats. And then on top of this, the benefit of doing this was zero. That's the part that everyone has to the school closures did not save any lives. The school closures did not stop COVID did not flatten the curve, did not protect children from getting COVID. This was all a self inflicted wound. And some of us saw it. And the Democrats shouted us down and stomped their feet and the teachers union thugs mobilized and the commissar Randy Wine Garden push for this. They were as wrong as can be on all counts. Clay. Yeah. And this is where we need you moms. We talk about the suburban moms and how many of you are swinging voters as a group. This is where we need you to mobilize. I mean this, there need to be severe consequences. These teachers unions and these democratic politicians, they made you in addition to the fact that a lot of you have jobs and have responsibilities that you rely on school to help you. They made you wear all of these hats and they told you you were doing it to protect the safety of kids and they were a hundred percent wrong. What should happen when somebody gives you advice and is 100% wrong and your children suffer as a result from it? There have to be consequences. And that's why moms out there, the suburban mom community in particular, you guys need to be talking. You need to be grabbing some of these clips from this show. You need to be sharing some of these articles. You were lied to and the people who lied to you are now saying things, Buck. Like, oh, how could we have ever known that this was going to happen? Well, we didn't know it was going to be this bad. Those are lies by the summer of 2020. Buck you and I know because we were arguing this, the data was abundantly clear. Kids needed to be back in school. Look at what Ron DeSantis did. Look at what a lot of red state governors did in terms of getting their kids back in school in August and September of 2020. And if your kids were not back in school, it's because Democrat politicians failed you. They didn't look at the data and there have to be consequences. This is the entire purpose of a democracy. We reward or punish politicians based on the judgment and the decisions that they make and overwhelmingly blue city, blue states, Democrat politicians and the teacher union cronies that they worked with failed all of America's kids. So can I just say to your point about this, Clay, I, one thing I do like about Twitter for us is that we get to create, we have created an archive of what we thought at different times. People don't have to take, you know, take our word for they can go back and look, it's on the internet. You can just Google it. You don't even have to be on Twitter. So I just need to check to see on August 14th of 2020, ABC news, right? Big important news organization tweeted this. The US attempt to reopen schools has turned into a slow motion train wreck with at least 2,400 students and staff infected with COVID-19. 2,400 people got COVID who cares, right? It was crazy. I responded to this. I'm not an epidemiologist. I'm not a doctor. I put this out. This is less than one in 20,000 public school students in America for everybody out there who isn't a lockdown hysteric. 99.99% of infected students will barely have symptoms. If any ABC news is a joke. You knew this. I knew this. We were saying this summer, 2020, why didn't the Democrats know this? They did. They did. And they should have if they didn't. And buck to your point on the tweets that you were sending out then. I don't know how I could have been anymore clear. I was intentionally taking pictures. People can go back and look in the early August of 2020 of my kids going to school. And look, every parent knows that kids matter more than anything. So the way that I would say, not only am I telling you that all kids need to be back in school, I'm taking my own kids to school. I'm walking them to school this morning in early August in 2020 because it's important for kids to be back in school. I'm not just telling you this. I'm living it with my own life and there need to be in last year buck right after we started. We're coming up on the one year anniversary of of Clay and Buck. We appreciate everybody listening. But I went and spoke over the mask mandate, which was a further failure of Democrat politicians. Mask made no difference when they finally opened back up schools and let your kids go to school. Do you know what they made them do for over a year and still in some cities in America right now, kids are being forced to wear masks. You know what the data overwhelmingly shows about kids wearing masks doesn't protect anyone. And it leads to worse educational outcomes because kids can't communicate or understand particularly young kids. And so I get I get still so fired up about this because I am still so furious that our politicians did this to our kids. I don't know when I'm ever going to get over it. But the only way I think you get over a failure like this is a reckoning of an election, which is almost exactly six months from now. Suburban moms listen to us grab this clip, share all this data, talk to your friends. And make a reality of the red wave of holding Democrats responsible for the consequences of their actions. Speaking of consequences of actions, by the way, Buck, inflation continues to soar. Overall interest rates are going up.

We were talking about JD Vance and the impact that he had winning that hotly contested overall battle. How about turnout? Buck and turnout increased by 13% since the 2018 midterms in Ohio. They had Republicans did nearly 700,000 more primary voters than Democrats. Why is that significant? It's about enthusiasm. And I know it was a real battle on the Republican side in the Senate, but Democrats only got 32% of the overall vote in Ohio. I mean, I just think about this. If someone told me, hey, you have to go stand in voting and a voting line for six hours. But if you vote, you don't ever have to wear a mask again anywhere.

Biden had kind of a doozy of a moment yesterday. It's, I don't know, at some point you feel like you're caught between, is it more that what is the bigger fraud? And I think you could argue this in a lot of directions. Joe Biden is of sound mind as a function of age and cognitive deterioration to be the president. Is that the bigger fraud? That Joe Biden is an honest, just, you know, lives down the street. Good guy Amtrak Joe. He's actually kind of a jerk or that Joe Biden is smart enough, particularly on legal issues as somebody who was a lawyer and then a senator for 40 years to actually have something worthwhile to say on important matters of law, constitutionality, jurisprudence, you name it. I don't know which is the bigger fraud. You can argue that in any of those realms, I think there's a, there's been a constant media campaign of dare I say disinformation, Clay, to try to convince people that things are true about Joe Biden that are just not. And this is one of those moments where he put a whole bunch of things in together. And maybe, maybe Clay can give us a little bit of your legal analysis of Joe's legal analysis because I don't even think Joe knows what he was trying to say on this one. Here's the president on that Roe v. Wade leak. Oh, and by the way, what he calls the MAGA crowds. The idea that somehow that there is no right of privacy, what happens if you have a state change the law saying that children who are LGBTQ campaign classrooms with other children? Is that legit under the way the decision is written? What are the next things that are going to be attacked? Because this MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that's existed in American history. Can I just say, I mean, I know that he went back and said in recent history, I think after that, but the MAGA crowd, I guess by that he means the Republican party. He's trying to tell us this is the most extreme Republican party because finally the Supreme Court has weighed in on what is obviously the correct constitutional and they haven't even made the decision official. The pro life movement and the conservative platform has been the pro life movement for decades and decades now. So there's nothing so should be surprising with this. But Clay, can you explain to me, what does he even talk, keeping LGBTQ kids out of school? Like what does he even what does he think he's saying? I don't even know. And this goes again to why I question his mental faculties to such a degree. If he wants to fear monger based on this opinion, that is hard because as we said, Alito in his opinion specifically says that he's not going to go after other things. For instance, if you really wanted to fear monger here and maybe Joe Biden will eventually fear monger better than he did there, you wouldn't say gay kids are going to get pulled out of the classroom. You would say something like, Oh, next they're going to take away your birth control. Something like 90% of Americans believe that birth control is fine for people to use. I am one of them. Chances are that many of you also agree with that. What is clear here from Joe Biden's arguments is he hasn't read the opinion himself, which is an indictment because if you're going to be commenting on this certainly as the president of the United States, you should read the draft opinion. And his argument doesn't make any sense there. And then to go on and say that the Maga crowd is the most extreme in American history. Let's think for a minute about some of the things that have existed political party wise in American history. And also think about what the Maga crowd believes in secure borders, respect for police officers, putting America first, finding people with good secure safe jobs, including people in manufacturing industries that have lost their jobs overseas, giving people the ability to put America first, raising wages, black, white, Asian, Hispanic, two levels that we haven't seen in modern history, trying to call that. And I saw where he's trying to label it the ultra Magas or something. They're trying to label the clear attempt here is a desperate ploy to make Donald Trump a figure in the midterm elections to drive up Democrat turnout. But here's the problem, Buck. That's the exact same campaign that Terry McAuliffe ran in Virginia. And Glenn Youngkin soundly defeated Terry McAuliffe. Do you remember that Buck? We talked about this last fall when they were bringing in all the heavy hitters, Barack Obama, Kamala Harris, if I remember coming across the Potomac river, showing up for those rallies with Terry McAuliffe saying how bad things would be if Republicans took back control of the old dominion there. And they tried to make Donald Trump a figure in that election. And you know what happened? It didn't remotely work because he wasn't on the ballot. That's now a sign of desperation. Six months out, I believe that's ultimately what Joe Biden is trying to do. But he's doing it in a ham-handed fashion because let's be honest, he's got dementia. I was reading in that political article. You and I were talking about earlier the fact that he may run in 2024, but they said many of the rooms they can't use at the White House to do public events because they can't fit his teleprompter in it. They can't have this man in that article. I'm a guy who likes a big TV, I got to say. In New York, sometimes you get that flat screen and it can be tough to get it up the stairs in your walk up or whatever. But when the teleprompter is too big for the president, that's not good. I'm going to read that quote from Politico at some point in the show, but it's talking about the fact that we may have a Trump Biden rematch. And to me, what Biden is trying to do is draw Trump in as a figure in this election. The problem is Trump's not on the ballot. It might work in 2024. And it's certainly something that will be much debated over the next couple of years who the Republican nominee should be and whether 82 year old Joe Biden can run. But I mean, he is reading these attacks off of a teleprompter buck and they're still nonsensical. He can't even deliver them. And more important, they're just lies. And let's also remember, not only you have, you have two things that I think are a huge challenge for the Democrat brand right now, because I know we're talking about Biden a lot. And it's the midterms that are going to determine the house, the Senate and different state races, Biden's not on the ballot. But he's the leader of the Democrat party right now. He is the president. It is the Biden regime. And you look at two things that are huge problem. We talk a lot about the results, which is the most important thing. Same way results are the most important single part of the discussion. I think about school shutdowns, right? Because we don't have to get into the oh, but philosophically. No, no. You go down the schools, you hurt kids and the COVID issue was irrelevant for the kids because they either got COVID elsewhere. It didn't matter. The Biden administration, we look at the results, but also look at the promises for a moment. You remember this clay in New York City? I mean, it was embarrassing. I'll be honest, it was embarrassing. People were driving around and it was like World War when they finally announced for Biden. It was like World War two had just ended the the aboliance, the joy, the happiness in the streets. My gosh, you know, as though it was the end of dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria, all of a sudden we were coming together in a way. This is the Democrats. Obviously voted for Biden. That was good. United says a country and normalcy return. Clay, they pushed to fire huge numbers of people from their jobs for not getting a shot that most of those people didn't even need. Yes. Thousands of people, tens of thousands of people, military teachers, workers in the all different sorts of government jobs lost their employment for a shot that they didn't need. I'm just saying that they promised to unite the country steady hand adults in the room competency. And so when you look at the promise and now the results, I mean, the gap is enormous, right? I mean, you know, they promised me filet mignon and as side of bernes sauce with some asparagus. I haven't even launched them. Obviously hungry. That's what I'm having when Hunter gets indicted. Oh, yeah? You're going to go with the wagyu there, fancy man. We'll see how it goes. Yeah, I think whatever the most expensive steak version we can find anywhere, but I like the sauce. You can even I'll even let you get to the blue, the blue cheese crust on top. Or rather, I'll get it because Hunter's not getting indicted. But my point here is they shut up with a bunch of rotten eggs. Have you ever actually seen rotten eggs? It's happening once or twice. Very gross. Like the actual results of administration versus what they promised that gap is enormous. And I think that really factors into the psychology that we'll see going into the election. I really do. Because the promise wasn't, you know, we're in rough times and we're, you know, it's going to be tough going forward. All I can offer you is blood, toil, tears and sweat. It was we're going to unite the country. It's going to be awesome. Going to be a booming economy. Joe Biden's going to be so great. Joe Biden's an imbecile. Amen. And we'll talk more about that as we continue to roll. By the way, our buddy Ron Johnson, Senator from Wisconsin, Dana Perino from Fox News and Cosh Patel, formerly from the Trump administration, all still to come in the next couple of hours. But we've got a new sponsor. I'm really excited about looking forward to incorporating in my life. It's called chalk and it's not spelled away. It sounds so play close attention to me. CHO Q.

It's your honest Buck Section Show. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us. We roll through the Thursday edition of the program. And Buck, I hate to even have to say this. Even after we just teed off on how bad remote schooling was in the failures of blue state governors and blue state Democrat politicians and certainly their allies in the teachers' unions, I got a text during the last commercial break that one of my friends from law school who lives in the San Francisco area, her kids have to wear masks again. They brought masks back in California. I know we got people listening all over the country whose kids are still having to go to school in masks. And to me, it just further epitomizes. I thought your point was a go in Buck. I flew this past week. I was down in Orlando with my kids. And I can't tell you how much better it felt in the airport to have no one wearing a mask. Now I can't speak for what every other airport is like, but in Nashville and in Orlando, which were the airports that I traveled in, nobody had masks on. I mean, virtually no, a 98, 99% no mask wearing. And to your point, Buck, if you had to go stand in line for six hours, but you knew that your kids would never have to wear a mask in school again. And they currently are having to do so. That's a small price to pay. I would sign up to do that in a heartbeat. I would go stand in line for hours right now. If you just told me I would never have to wear a mask again. The people who can make this happen, Buck, are the suburban moms. Because a lot of you out there, yes, we want you to vote. But the people who are swing voters turn an election from a 50 50 proposition, which many of our elections these days are, to make it a run at 60 40. And those suburban women are the ones that can drive the bus here. And I think we got a couple of women calling in who want to talk about this, right? I do. We've got Kate in Cleveland, Ohio. Kate, what's on your mind? Oh, hi. Hi. Hello. Yes, you're on air. I was one of those swing voters you're talking about. I'm a mom of three kids. Thankfully, we live in a conservative suburb of Cleveland that was made evident on our recent school board elections, which you guys have a lot to. And our school board and superintendent got our kids back to school as soon as possible. But make no mistake, March 2020, till the end of that school year was miserable for our children and for my husband and me. In March of 2020, our director of the Ohio Department of Health, Dr. Amy Acton, an unelected official was given the power to close schools, stores, and even our May elections. One of the quotes was something along the lines of, we suspect there are at least 100,000 people in Ohio walking around with this virus. And they don't even know. So all I could think was, well, then who cares? Who on earth cares? I can't, I still, I'm so angry and I am still not recovering over it. These liberal politicians, they damaged my kids and I will not forget. How old are your kids? So at that time, I had an eighth grader, a sixth grader and eighth or greater. Okay, so you're similar to the ages of my kids and I'm curious. When I finish the show today, I'll go pick up my first grader at school and there'll be tons, it's me and a lot of moms oftentimes because I have a little bit of a different schedule. So, and a lot of the moms listen to the show where they talk and they're obviously my neighborhood super fired up. I'm curious, you stay, you live in suburban Cleveland. What are the conversations like in your experience, Kate, with you and other moms? How many other swing voters are still angry about this? What sort of vibe do you get in Ohio? I'm getting, well, as evidenced by JD Vance, winning here in the, yeah, I'm getting the idea that people are pretty darn angry. It's key. You know, I still try to wrap my head around it and I think, how could this have happened? How could you have kept children out of school? Yeah, I mean, I think just to give you sense, Kate, I don't have kids working on it. I don't have kids. And if somebody, if I had children though at this point, then somebody was saying that they were going to mask my kid up and make them eat their lunch outside, I would react to that the same way that someone's saying in a school system, sorry, we had to just like take the paddle to your kid because he was late today. You know what I mean? I viewed as a buss. Yes. I think Kate, thanks for the call. And I would just say there are millions of kids out there. And if you think your voice doesn't matter, you're oftentimes a hundred billion percent wrong. And what other thing I've seen with a lot of people, Buck, and even the Saturday Night Live skit that we've played on here, remember, initially people were nervous to say, hey, I don't know about masking. I don't know about the COVID shots. As moms are talking more and more, you're finding out that your voice is actually the majority and you need to drive this election bus. You guys are the difference makers. So we, we, based on the 2020 election, state by state, if you look at it, there are enough people listening to this show right now in states like Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, that just the people listening right now went out there and got one more person that they know to vote against these lunatic Democrats. That red wave is going to be glorious. We'll be surfing on it together. Hang 10. Amen. And again, I want everybody to vote, but the suburban moms, you guys that we're talking to right now, you are the difference makers.
