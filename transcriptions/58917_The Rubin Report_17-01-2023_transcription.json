    "text": " sway to post fake news is for people to watch outlets like MSNBC where you report real news all the time. People, I'm Dave Rubin. This is the Rubin Report. It is January 17th, 2023. We are live streaming as always on Rumble and YouTube. If you have not subscribed at rumble.com slash Rubin Report, we go ahead and do that. Things are looking good across the board on the show. Our numbers have just been phenomenal lately. I think that's a reflection of trying to tell the truth around here. And you guys getting more engaged and more involved and sharing the videos and all that good stuff. So we appreciate that. And as always, we do a post game show where you can correct me, question me, throw thoughts at me and much more at rubinreport.locals.com. I think today is going to be our biggest show ever. I have more paper than I think I've ever had in my hand right now. You may be looking at this code. It's not a lot of paper. And you know, I know these days, if you don't have a lot of something, it's okay automatically, right? Joe Biden, it's only a small amount of documents. This may seem like a small amount of documents to you, but I'd say this is about 15 pages. Normally we do the show in about seven pages. We have a jam packed information laid in show using multimedia. I'm talking about video and other such things. And it's dense. And I think it's relevant and interesting to everything going on in the world. So I want you to buckle in today. I know that may sound like I'm overstating it. Dave, you're really setting yourself up for failure here by really telling us this is going to be a big, great show today. But that's how good I feel about the show. Also, Phoenix was a little worried right before we started that the show is so good. It's so edgy. It's so packed with truth that government agents could come in and take us away right after this. So if it's the last show, I also want to just say, I've enjoyed this. Thank you for watching. And you know, good luck with all that. The theme of the show today is how the left and the globalists and the machine, the matrix, whatever you want to call it, their influence, which seems like it's everywhere, right? It just feels like it is in every portion of your life, no matter which way you look, locking you down and COVID and injecting you and now coming for gas stoves and they want more of your money and they want you to eat bugs and they don't want you to drive cars, all of that stuff. We are going to lay out the case that it is more of a product of their infrastructure, that they have built a system that makes it seem that many of us are convinced of their ideas as opposed to their ideological persuasion, as opposed to having the right ideas on their side. And those of us that are not NPCs, that are not non-playable characters, those of us with a flicker of thought, those of us who want people to be free and make choices for themselves, we could actually learn a thing or two. From looking at them and seeing their tactics. And I think there are three things that we can do. And that's what I'm going to be laying out in the course of this next hour. So we have to repel their bad ideas, right? That's why we try to expose their bad ideas. You have to be able to look at what they're doing and repel them, right? Really just say, no, no, no, no, no, no, we ain't going for that shit. We have to replicate some of their infrastructure because you have to give the devil his do. They built institutions that then turned on us, whether they're education institutions or scientific medical institutions, etc, etc. And then we have to go on the office because enough of just reacting, that's what we do. We react because most of us have lives and we have families and we're doing other stuff and then they just keep marching because they are devoted to the endless destruction of all things good. But perhaps it is time for us to go on offense. So that is what we will be laying out today. So let's start with what's going on in a remote village known as Davos. This is where the World Economic Forum, a group of unelected elites from countries all over the world get together with about 5,000 armed security guards. They all fly in on their private planes while they tell you that they're going to be taking away your modes of travel. And they talk about how they can rejigger the world in the image which they like, which unfortunately is often in conflict with human freedom and flourishing. But let's get a little bit more from what's going on over at the WEF in Davos from our friends at the Daily Wire. Lawmakers, business leaders and academics participating in the World Economic Forum will descend upon the small ski town of Davos, Switzerland this week to discuss a variety of policy proposals that entail greater coordination between government and corporate actors. The organization which German economist Klaus Schwab has chaired for the past five decades is a leading proponent of stakeholder capitalism, an approach to investing that says executives must consider the needs of communities and other parties in addition to shareholders. The World Economic Forum is convening during January for the first time since the lockdown induced recession. This year's conference theme is cooperation in a fragmented world which involves how we can tackle the numerous and interlinked challenges the world is facing and find solutions through public private cooperation according to a press release. Beyond the more than 1,400 business leaders scheduled to attend the conference, executives expected to speak or participate in panel events include Microsoft CEO Sataya Nadella, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Moderna CEO Stefan Bonsell. Hundreds of world leaders including German Chancellor Olaf Scholes, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska and Canadian Finance Minister Chrisia Freeland will also attend the conference. Schwab has garnered worldwide notoriety for suggesting that lockdown induced recession presents an opportunity for elites to create craft a great reset of the planet's economic and social systems. The three components of the plan are governments guaranteeing fairer outcomes in the marketplace, channeling investments towards equality and sustainability efforts and using medical technology to address health and social changes. I know that was a lot of reading there, I hope you were paying attention. But basically all of the stuff that a couple years ago there were some crazy people on the computer machine talking about these conspiracy theories of a group of elites who get together every year to figure out how governments are going to work together against the needs of the people but they'll do it in the guise of being good to everybody. It all turned out to be true. It all turned out to be true. That is what they do. They do. What you could argue is a fascistic tactic. Governments and corporations working together to figure out how they can take more from you and give more to themselves. Do not be under the illusion my friends for one moment that these people care about you at all. They will fly on their private planes while they tell you you can't be in your gas car. They will eat their filet mignon, their wagu a5 filet mignon while they tell you you have to eat bugs and they do a whole bunch and they are planning a whole bunch of other weird stuff. We're going to get to that in the course of this show. But the World Economic Conference, World Economic Forum Conference began in Davos and they brought out Klaus Schwab. If you've seen Klaus Schwab, we've talked about him a bit on the show, he's the emperor Palpatine of this operation. This is Schwab Palpatine from Planet Naboo. People thought he was a good guy. Turned out to be the most evil dude in the galaxy. He opened the conference and he's a little concerned actually and this is actually good. Bear with me here. This is actually pretty good. He is concerned that people are saying mean things about the people over in Davos. Take a look. Operation in the fragmented world. At the beginning of this year, we are confronted with unprecedented and multiple challenges. We need to overcome the most critical fragmentation. And the most critical fragmentation has been those who take a constructive attitude and those who are just bystanders, observers, and even go into the negative, critical, and confrontational attitude. So this is good. What's happening right now because we still have some degree of a free internet. It's probably less a degree of a free internet than we all think and we all know about the government collusion related to Russia files and COVID and all of those things. But he's opening the conference by saying, hey, we're under attack. People don't seem to really like us. And that really is the truth. I made a tweet yesterday. I took a look at the World Economic Forum's Twitter account. Their Twitter account has 4.3 million followers. That's a pretty significant number of followers. Their average tweet gets about 20 or 30 retweets. Mathematically, I'm not a mathematician. I'm not a statistician. But that's almost impossible. 4.3 million people signed up to watch their stuff and virtually everybody ignores them. I've got like a million, two, a million, three followers and all my stuff gets in the thousands and I'm obviously shadow band, right? So it's like there's proof in the pudding. They also, one of the things you can do on Twitter, this is a little insider baseball, but these things are important just in the way we communicate these days, you can actually shut off your comments on Twitter, meaning that if you normally, if I tweet something, I put it out there and then I get hundreds, sometimes thousands of people responding to what I say, there's a button you can click or a dial you can slide that actually shuts off the comments. They shut off the comments on all of their tweets because every time they tweet something, people were going after them and saying you're a bunch of feeble lizard people and other such factual information. So they are worried that they are getting criticism. They are worried that there are people who are not happy with this idea of a one world government and this is pretty damn good. They are on their heels a little bit, but who else is there and what else are they talking about? Well, John Kerry is there and you may remember John Kerry. John Kerry failed presidential candidate and I would say really a sham of a human who over the last 10 years or so of his career has basically taken a private plane all over the world while telling us that, again, we should not be on these planes. We should barely be on any planes and we should watch out for cars we're driving and he does this while making millions and millions of dollars. He also married Teresa Heinz Kerry, so he married into Big Ketchup. Did you guys know that? He married into the Big Ketchup money. Okay, not Hans Ketchup. I'm talking about Heinz. How many ingredients? 52, whatever it is, 57. Okay, that's John Kerry's cash cow. Okay, and I'm pretty sure he's injecting it in his face also. Anyway, he goes around the world and he tells governments what they can do and what they can't do and that the United States will foot the bill on climate and all of this stuff, but listen to this speech. It's about 40 seconds of his opening remarks and he really thinks that he is God, that he is God hanging out with other gods and that they are here to save the world. And when you stop and think about it, it's pretty extraordinary that we select group of human beings because of whatever touched us at some point in our lives are able to sit in a room and come together and actually talk about saving the planet. I mean, it's so almost extraterrestrial to think about, quote, saving the planet. And if you said that to most people, most people, they think you're just a crazy tree hugging, lefty, liberal, you know, do good or whatever. Record, I do think you're crazy, lefty, tree hugging, do good, whatever. I could come up with a couple more adjectives, but do you see these people, these self-righteous, oh, moralist boons? Look at us. We were touched by something. I'm pretty sure we know what they're touching, but they were touched by something and that something gave them extra terrestrial passwords to sit in a room with other people and talk about saving the world. They're so great. Oh, I'm busting into my Al Gore accident already because we got an Al Gore video coming up. So Al Gore, may remember Al Gore also failed presidential candidate who has run around and made millions and millions of dollars making people think that the sky is falling. Al Gore also gave a talk. Now, you're going to see this video of Al Gore. If you haven't seen Al Gore lately, you're going to think this is a man wearing an Al Gore suit, but we confirm this is actually video of Al Gore. Take a look. Enough already, enough. And I don't want to get sidetracked onto what needs to happen, but we need to scale up climate finance, but we need desperately to scale down anti-climate finance. And we are still subsidizing the burning of fossil fuels globally at a rate 42 times larger than the subsidies for the shift toward renewables, NEVs, etc. We need new leadership at the World Bank. We need them to scale up the leverage and vastly increase the amounts that are committed, and we need to rein in the anti-climate activities of the fossil industry. Oh, they need to rein in those activities of those of us who want gas stove. So do you see how these things are all connected? And yes, that actually is Al Gore, apparently not wearing a fat suit. That's just what's happened to him. It looks like he's filled with jelly. You'd think you'd be cutting down on the Eaton if you really cared about the environment, right? You'd think you'd be doing that Al Gore. Al Gore, by the way, if you want to talk about grifters and charlatans, please Google this. Al Gore, when he left the White House as Bill Clinton's VP, he started a cable channel called Current TV that some of you may remember. It was a complete failure of a cable channel. It was going to be like a lefty socialist sort of Bernie Sanders, new media cable news channel, like to compete with CNN and MSNBC and Fox, etc. Using all of his connections as vice president, he was able to get on all the cable channels. So you could get on Comcast, you could get on Direct TV, etc. That's the hard part of building a cable channel, right? Because you have to have all of the connections. So he leveraged his connections as vice president to get on all the cable channels. He creates a failure of a network. The network never made money. The programming was awful. Nobody was watching. Then you know what he did? Al Gore, Google this, please Google this. He sold Current TV, which was worth nothing except that it had access to the cable channels. It had nothing that anyone was buying. Nobody was buying the programming. Nobody was buying any of the stuff that they had created. He sold it for $500 million to Qatar. Yeah, he sold it to Al Jazeera, which is obviously state sponsored media from Qatar. Qatar, if I'm not mistaken, is the number two exporter of fossil fuels. How bizarre that Al Gore did that? By the way, Glenn Beck, this was at the beginning of the blaze. Glenn Beck tried to buy Current TV. He wanted to get blaze on all of those channels. Al Gore said no to Glenn Beck because he's a mean, scary capitalist and sold it to the number two exporter of fossil fuels Qatar in the world. So Al Gore, fat suit, jelly, Al Gore is not a good man. Speaking of not a good man, here is one of the heroes of the world economic form. If you've got Klaus Schwab is Palpatine. This guy, I would say, is more of a, it's not a Darth Vader. What would he be here? This Hariri looks maybe sort of a boba-fat. Yeah, there's a little bit of a bounty hunter situation with this guy. So this is Yuval Noah Harai, or Hariri, and he is very interested in the way humans behave and how we can change, how we behave, and how we think, and how we learn, and government must be in charge of all of those things. Maybe the most important quality to survive and flourish in the 21st century is to have mental flexibility. Not just to keep learning and changing again and again, also to keep letting go as virtual reality improves. And you know, with all the talk of the metaverse and so forth that we'll discuss later on, increasingly it's likely that there will be many more activities shifting from the physical biological world that we know into a new reality, a virtual reality, which has different physical and biological laws, even the laws of physics there are different. So whether you want to interact socially there, or maybe you have a job in the virtual reality, in the metaverse, or maybe you design, you have a new job designing fashion, designing shirts for virtual reality, because people want to look good there, you need to forget how physics and light and gravity works here, we can't do it alone. Like placing all... You can't do it alone or individuals can't do it alone. Individuals can't do it alone. It's too much for an individual to do just by themselves. We'll probably have... we'll require organizations, governments to step in to make sure that people are not left behind, you know, just retraining people. We will have to see more government support. I really hope you guys were following that because this is seriously twisted, evil stuff. What he is talking about there is perhaps an inevitability that we will all end up in this digital world in the future. That might be the part of humanity, the stage of humanity that we're at. I will grant him that. The entropy of what's going on in the digital world, and the push towards that is so powerful that he might be right, we all end up there. So what is there? And when we talk about the metaverse, many of you probably saw the movie Ready Player One. It was a great book and then it was a movie by Steven Spielberg about maybe 10 years ago or so. You absolutely, absolutely should see it if you have not seen it. But this idea, this is what Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of these technocrats have been pushing on us, that we are going to wear, you know, the oculus, you're going to wear this device over your eyes and you will live in essence. This is idiocracy. You will live in a digital universe where somehow your body will survive. I mean, this is also the matrix, the matrix, the human body was the battery for the digital world. You still needed the battery, right? Watch the matrix if you haven't seen it again. That's when Neo's wake up is realizing that he's just the battery. Humans are just the battery for the digital thing. These guys want us all to live in the metaverse. What they want is us to be wearing this thing somehow will be fed so the battery will continue, right? We'll eat our bug goo or whatever it is, but we will barely live here, right? We will barely live in the reality of reality that humans have been living in for a long time. Now, why would they want us in the metaverse all time? And in the metaverse, if you watch Ready Player One or if you just think about it, in the metaverse, you can be whatever you want. You can be a giant monster, you can be a rich athlete, you can be a porn star, you can be whatever you want and you can constantly be changing. And that's why he's saying the laws of physics don't matter in the metaverse because they're going to be able to constantly be rewriting reality and anything that's imaginable will be happening there. Look, I'm a sci-fi guy. There is something cool about all of that. But the real reason they want you there is what he said at the end and that they're going to have to control you. We're going to have to control. We're going to have to work with governments to make sure people are going to have to make that shift to this thing. What if you don't want to make the shift to this thing? What if you like your family and you don't want to dress up like an ogre in a virtual land, right? And dance with a four-eyed robot. What if you're just old school? Why would they want to push you there? Well, do you think maybe they'd want to push you there because they would basically control every facet of your mind, right? They would control what you spend and when you spend it. And oh, you said some bad thing about the WEF. I guess we're going to have to freeze their bank account. Do you see how this is all linked to what's been going on in the world? Do I seem like a crazy conspiracy theorist or are they telling us? They are literally telling us the plan right in front of ourselves. So, okay, we got all that. So you can see it. This left-wing globalist and the reason I call it left-wing is because it's centralized power, right? It's top-down power. I like bottom-up power, right? I like on the ground you make decisions for yourself and then have loose structures above us so that you can live freely. That would be better to me. They like central power. Tell you what to do. You're going to have to live in the metaverse and if you don't, we'll probably call you a white supremacist and a bunch more. So what else are they planning? Because they're planning all sorts of economic things. They're planning, you know, the things that you're going to have to strap on your head and a whole bunch more. Well, obviously a lot of this is going to be related to medicine and pharma. I don't know if you remember, but they also put this COVID hoax on us over the last couple years and got people to do all sorts of crazy things. So here is a video produced by the World Economic Forum and then you'll see a professor talking about it where they're talking about how mRNA vaccines will give the ability for them to write a new code for life. This, my friends, is Benad. Speaking, we're talking about improving biology and redesigning organisms for beneficial purposes. It's going to allow us to not just edit genomes, but also and importantly, write a new code for life. We'll have right level permissions. We already started to see some of that this year. COVID-19 vaccines, they make use of engineered code in the form of messenger RNA. What's on the horizon are diminished reality glasses that look very much like what I'm wearing. That would allow you to remove things from your point of view, whether that's garbage or other people. And dystopian now. The thing about being in dystopia, if you watch any dystopian movie is the people don't realize they're in dystopia till the end. Then they have to blow up a whole lot of stuff. I'm talking about this stuff now, so we don't have to blow up a whole bunch of stuff. What they want to do here, and you can now see, because again, they're telling us this was all related to COVID. Get a whole bunch of people, literally hundreds of millions of people all over the world to inject themselves with our experimental mRNA vaccine, which then we can use some of the technology of that to rewrite their gene sequencing, to literally change the genes in people. And then what else can you do? Oh, and then she talked about diminished reality glasses, which is obviously connected to the to the metaverse. So you're going to put on these glasses and oh, if you don't like that person, you're not going to see them. Well, I'm pretty sure you're still going to feel it when they punch you in the face. When you walk right, oh, you don't like seeing garbage, you're not going to see garbage. This is Brave New World. Read the book. I remember read, I read Brave New World. I was in sixth grade. Did you ever read Brave New World? Yeah, I mean, uh, it's happening, man. It's happening right now. So what else are they doing related to our bodies? I always thought it was my body, my choice, but no. Here is video. This is from back in September where the World Economic Forum had another conference. This is Albert Borla. He's the Pfizer CEO. This guy should absolutely be in jail. He is a criminal and an evil MFer talking about how we're going to swallow microchips with technology in them. And somehow that's going to be good for, I guess, his bottom line. Even if you make the greatest drug or the greatest wearable, there's no guarantee that the patient is going to take the drug, wear the device. So how are you thinking about technology to engage the patient? Yeah. Again, maybe I will use an example. I think it's fascinating what's happening in this field right now. I mean, FDA approved the first electronic pill, if I can call it like that. So it is a basically biological chip that it is in the tablet. And once we take the tablet, and dissolve into your stomach, send a signal that you took the tablet. So imagine the applications of that compliance. The insurance companies to know that the medicines that patients should take, they do. So we'll just swallow a pill with some electric stuff in there. And that'll make sure we behave the way we want because you swallow that thing. And maybe you can get a boner, maybe not. Maybe you need another thing for that. Maybe your eyeballs dry up. Maybe you get the restless legs syndrome, the Jimmy hips. God, they're evil. But all right, let's just say, Dave, you're being a little of harvest or was a nice man. Pfizer is a good company. These people just want to help us. Obviously, they have a great track record when it comes to vaccinating people and some of the other things they've done. I mean, show us a video where what they've done works because don't be so negative. Stop being a negative. Nelly. Today, Pfizer reported its vaccine for kids five to 11 was more than 90% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID in clinical trials. Overwhelmingly voted in favor of recommending the vaccine, which Pfizer says is 91% effective at preventing severe infection. We have thoroughly reviewed all of the available safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data before recommending this vaccine for your child. Just minutes after the CDC approved the Pfizer children's vaccine last night, kids were rolling up their sleeves. I would not be concerned because this is shown now over a considerable period of time to be a highly effective and safe vaccine. We want to protect the children. For parents of young children unsettling news, new data from New York State shows the only COVID vaccine children five to 11 can take made by Pfizer offers almost no protection against infection. The vaccines effectiveness in that age group dropped from 68% in mid December to just 12% by the end of January. Just two weeks ago, Pfizer said it was postponing seeking FDA authorization for a vaccine for kids six months to four years old after trials showed it didn't work well. Now today's news about the vaccine for five to 11 year olds not being as effective. Pfizer says it's now evaluating a third dose for children five to 11 years old. And vaccine makers are already developing new formulas. You see what I did people that was the old bait and switch. You saw what I did. I thought I was tipping it off with my rather sarcastic intro to it. I was telling you that he was we were going to show you a video of him doing good stuff and it all turned out to be evil and rates of heart issues and all of the stuff. So why it's not only that none of these people have been fired, Borla should be should be shamed. He should be hiding somewhere in Argentina like a Nazi in 1947, right? But instead he's still in charge of stuff. Walensky, Fauci, these people should be shamed and never seen in civil society again. But instead they are plotting the future. They are plotting their next moves. And speaking of next moves, these things just seem to come. And we don't know what to do. That's what I'm saying. We're always reacting to them, right? Because we're trying to live our lives. And then every day you wake up and you're like, oh my God, now boys are girls. Now racism is cool again. Like it just never stops. And it's hitting everything. So we talked about it related to medicine and governments and technology. But the other way that they leak all of this stuff in, and this is probably the most pernicious way, is through entertainment, is through culture. That's why politics, as Andrew Breitbart said, is downstream from culture. You capture people's imaginations first through media and movies and television and video games and everything else. And then the political stuff is just sort of easy to get into their system because you've softened them up. So you may have seen this video. This is really nuts. Over the weekend was mis-universe. Okay, I don't really care for these things very much, but they had the mis-universe pageant. Mis-universe's new owner is a dude. The only thing is he's a dude who dresses up like a chick and has boobs and wears lipstick. But the person that I'm about to show you is mis-universe's new owner. And again, this is a dude dressed up as a chick, sort of like a Mrs. Doubtfire situation. Enjoy. The mis-universe organization from now on is going to be ran by women, owned by a twin woman. For all women. For all women. I am a robot. I am a dude chick robot. I am a woman. Feminism for everyone, even though I have a wang. Lordy, Lordy, Lordy. But it just keeps coming. And you can see how these things are all connected, right? The gender stuff. Like it's all just gross. What, how is that dude? And then the women. We could have showed you a much more extended version of it. All the way she's going, that the future is for women. Women will be in charge, even though she's not a woman. And then all the women stand up, oh my God, that's a woman, I guess, or something. But let's get to some more examples of the World Economic Forum influencing our institutions. What's happening over in the global energy sector? Well, we talked about Al Gore before, but here's a wild one. Here is a Scottish member of Parliament talking about how the era of private car use is over. On transport, second strategic transport project review published just two weeks ago confirms that the era of catering for unconstrained growth in private car use is well and truly over. The review follows the sustainable investment hierarchy, which aims to reduce the need to travel, and sustainably, and prioritises making basis of enhancing existing infrastructure before investing in new capacity. It's worldwide, guys. It is worldwide. It has infected governments everywhere. And just remember, that guy right there, the people at the World Economic Forum, they will never abide by the rules that they are going to set around you. They will drive in their luxury vehicles. They will fly in their private planes, and they will make sure you can do no such thing. They will have limits around you that they will not put around themselves. Again, this is dystopia. I think I watched one of the Hunger Game movies, but isn't this kind of like a Hunger Game situation? They live one way, everyone else lives another way. We're sort of in that. We're sort of in something like that. And what's happening right here? So we can move from Scotland, we can move right over here. And what's happening in the United States? Well, it's just suddenly out of nowhere. Everyone on the media started talking about how we have to get rid of gas stoves. And then what happens, because you know the way the media protects all of the bad ideas of the globalists and the left, then they put out people like Joe Scarborough, Joe Scarborough, who will always take every position on everything we've shown many videos about in the past. And what's he mocking? Is he mocking the people that are coming after your gas stove, the people who want to cook the way we've cooked for a long time, and you have a right to use gas, and that these idiots think that they can somehow make as they don't even know where electricity comes from. It's also stupid. But here's Joe Scarborough, instead of defending individual rights, instead of defending the autonomy of the United States, and our ability to cook as we please, he's upset with the Republicans who are making a big deal about it. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, this is this is this is an issue that you look and you want to see how politics gets crazy. You get one side gets like a small kernel of something. Half a kernel. And they put in the ground and they water it water, try to get it to grow. And so this gas stove thing, you get some bureaucrats saying something that has no power. And then suddenly you have Rhonda Sandis. So I'm going to protect your guests. And we're going to be talking about gas stoves gas. It's Yeah, you smug douche. Rhonda Sandis is going to protect our gas stoves. He's already talked about how we're going to keep that shit going right here in Florida. Joe Scarborough is worth $25 million. I don't begrudge anyone making money. I really do not. I don't like when charlatans and obvious grifters make a lot of money, but I don't begrudge him the 25 million. And that's his wife, by the way, he started banging his cohost a couple years ago, and then they got married to their credit. That's Mika Brzezinski and she's worth about 20 million. So they're worth about 50 million together. If you think for one second that they are going to give up their gas stove and they are going to give up their cars or whatever else, like you're an NPC. But I know you don't think that because you're watching this show. But these people, you see how they're aiming the wrong way. People want to come for more of your freedoms. They want to come for more of your stuff. And they're corporate. He is a corporate hack. His job is to mock the people who will defend the freedoms. That's what it is. If they're coming for a freedom, whether it's the Second Amendment, the First Amendment, whether they're coming for your ability to cook on a gas stove, he will always mock the people defending the freedoms. But let's continue. Because all of this stuff, now we've talked about sort of it at an energy front, we've talked about it at a gender front with Miss Universe. But of course, we have to talk about it from a racial front because, you know, racism is everywhere. And we must stop racism. Racism is very, very bad. Actually, racism is bad. The thing is that they're the racist. Well, you know what's going on over in San Francisco, which is a leftist. And I think you could argue globalist. It is a city that is a centralized one party city that has all the power to a couple people, the the foolish mayor of San Francisco, and then the clownish governor of California. Well, you know what's going on in San Francisco? Besides all the drugs, I know you know about the drugs, besides all the homelessness, the general state of decay, the impending zombie apocalypse, and all that. I know you know about all that stuff. They're proposing, let's show the headline. This is a good one. San Francisco's reparations committee proposes five million dollars to each black long time resident and total debt forgiveness. I would just like to say that I now identify as a black chick from San Francisco, a long time black chick from San Francisco. Okay, I am Shaniqua from San Francisco. I've lived in, what part of this town? I don't know much about San Francisco. I lived in the up there in the hill there near the near. I live next door to the full house house. Okay, Shaniqua, no, no, or I was a circle. I'm a circles aunt. And because they lived in San Francisco too, right? I think. Do they live in San Francisco? You see how stupid this all is? Anyway, so that's what San Francisco wants to do. A city that is in utter disrepair, a city run by buffoons with all of the ideas we've been talking about here and just endless progressive nonsense. Now they want to give five million dollars. How are you going to feel? First of all, they don't have any money, right? California doesn't have any extra money. All of the people that they want to tax to give the money to the long time black people that are there, the five million dollars at the debt forgiveness. They've all left. I know one guy there with some cash. He has a lot of cash, but he's got to get out soon. If you're watching, you know who you are. We'd love to have you here at Florida. Okay, guys, let's shift to the positive part about all this. The left wing actors and these lunatics who are peddling the world economic forum agenda, they are really stupid. And I mean that they're stupid and they have stupid ideas. Al Gore is not a smart person. He is a charlatan. John Kerry is not a smart person. He is a charlatan. These people have somehow attained power. That I grant them. And there is value in that. They have garnered an awful lot of power by manipulating information so that stupid people think they're smart. But they're not smart. Another guy that's not smart is the guy running the show right here, the guy who is being shown the door, even though he doesn't know it. Of course, you know who I'm talking about, Joe Biden. Joe Biden yesterday, of course, was MLK Day. Joe Biden gave a couple speeches and there were so many ridiculous things that he said, we had to cut a whole bunch of them because it was just like an endless, cavalcade of insanity from Joe Biden yesterday. Here he is basically saying that car insurance companies are racist. Give everybody a fair shot that lives there. The same thing. By the way, if you're living one of those neighborhoods and you have the same exact car I have in the other neighborhood, you pay more for your insurance than that size. No basis for it. None at all other than you're black and I'm white. Okay. So his argument is that Geico, progressive, well, progressive is probably racist. And the rest of these car insurance companies that when you, when they fill out a form, you fill out the form and I never put my race on anything. When I go to the doctor or anything else, it is seemingly irrelevant when I am going to the dermatologist, what race I am. Okay. I don't put any of that stuff. But their, his argument is that somehow car insurance companies, they look at black people and they go, you black, you're going to pay more in car insurance. It's not true. Now what he, if he was smart and Joe Biden is not smart, what he might want to address is that when there, when companies are looking into insurance, say house insurance, home insurance, right, that you're going to look at the area that a certain group of people live in and he Biden's, I'm going to try to make Biden's argument for him. His argument would be that there is more crime in black communities. So insurance companies then have to charge more for insurance because they know there's going to be more home break ins, something like that. Now that would make sense. An insurance company, they have people called actuaries. And what an actuary does is check risk, whether it's on home insurance or life insurance, et cetera, et cetera. They have to look at the risk. And then they can say, oh, this is a very high risk person or a high risk area. We have to charge them more of a premium. So that in case the house is broken into where the guy jumps off a cliff, because he's a thrill seeker, the, we're not getting screwed when we're doing the payouts. That's how this whole thing works. Now Biden could make some argument about that, that because there is more crime perhaps in certain black communities that his connection then is it's about the color of the skin. But here's the flaw in the argument. And I think I made his argument way better than he made it himself. The flaw in the argument is if you want to discuss why perhaps there is more crime in the inner city where there are more black people, you'd need only look at the policies of the Democrats for the past 50 years. You only have to look at the welfare state and you only have to look at the handouts and you only have to look at the intergenerational apartment buildings that people are stuck in because of subsidized housing that were all policies of the Democrats that then cause people to not go out there and get better jobs and fight for whatever it is that they can get on this earth. So I know Biden can't make that argument. If you want more on that argument, might I recommend Thomas Sowell or Larry Elder, that would be a pretty good start. Here's Biden in July of 2021. It's hard to remember back a year and a half ago. Basically saying that Facebook was killing people and the reason I'm linking all of these things together is to show that these people are not right. And it's not just that they're not right. They have lied all along. And then what happens is they get everything wrong and then finally reality catches up to them and then they have to lie about it. So here's Biden, July of 2021, Facebook's killing people because Facebook is spreading misinformation about the vaccines. What's your message to platforms like Facebook? There's killing people. I mean, it really, look, the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated and that's the middle of the killing people. All right. So to be clear, it was never a pandemic of the unvaccinated. We now know that vaccinated people are getting COVID at higher rates than unvaccinated people on top of the fact that the vaccines don't work. You can get and transmit COVID, but somehow Facebook was killing people. Right. So do you see the way they use fear and utter incompetence? Right. So I don't know if it was that he was just trying to scare the hell out of everybody or he just doesn't know what the hell he's talking about or he is also just a stooge of the machine that's above all of us. And what did the machine want? The machine wanted everybody vaxxed and you know why the machine wanted everybody vaxxed because they were testing out that mRNA stuff, which just go back to the beginning of this video. They have all sorts of other plans for it so that they can edit your genes and a whole bunch more. But how about a little more proof? Man, we nailed it today. How about a little more proof that they get everything wrong and then when reality smacks them in the face, then they start freaking out. Here is New York City Mayor Eric Adams. And you may remember Eric Adams is the guy who replaced true communist nutbag, Bill de Blasio, who absolutely ruined New York City, the greatest city in the history of the world. Okay. If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. Well, now you just want to get the hell out of there. He took over for him and people said, well, you know, he is a Democrat, but he's not a crazy lunatic. Well, Eric Adams then said, we are a sanctuary city. So all sorts of people started coming from all parts of the world. They would get through our poorest border. They'd show up in New York City and they have turned New York City into a disgusting crime infested, pot smelling sewage filled crap factory. I did that with no teleprompter. Okay, people, this is all just coming out of my brain. Well, then what happens? It happens for long enough. All your productive people, they start leaving your city, your city is a dump. And then you start realizing that we can't handle all of these people in our sanctuary city. And we don't want them anymore. Eric Adams. Our cities are being undermined and we don't deserve this. My list don't deserve this. And the people who live in the cities don't deserve this. We expect more from our national leaders to address this issue in a real way. We learned today which very informative. That's why it was important to come here. That they are web sites that are advertising that New York City basically streets are paying with gold. That there's all that employment that you automatically want to be living in in our chair. There's a conversation among those who are assigned in my silencing to my who are given the false impression that you come to New York City, everything is fine. Eric, Eric, you were the one that called for New York City to be a sanctuary city. You were the one that said, Hey, come here. You were the one that actually tried to get some of the illegal immigrants to vote in elections, which would have been doubly illegal. You also support the president of the United States and the Democrat Party who are in charge of the border. They're the ones in charge right now. But what happens? All of your stupid lefty ideas come to your door. All of the good people leave your city, your city crumbles, and now it's a problem. Now it is a problem. So how is it, guys, that they are able to get everything wrong always cause a whole bunch of us to constantly have to react to their BS and then only when it fully comes to their door step, like it's happening to Eric Adams. Now might he wake up and go, Oh, it is a problem. We should have a border and being a sanctuary city actually makes no sense. And the lefty dingbats in Martha's Vineyard who are all for no human is illegal. But when three people or 30 people show up on Martha's Vineyard, help us. Help us. We're not a border town. We don't have that kind of infrastructure. Well, you know what? It's because of the idea infrastructure, basically that these clowns have bought because they have the infrastructure. They really do. So let's talk about that just a bit. Matt Gates, Congressman Matt Gates was on Tim Poole's podcast a couple days ago. And he talked a little bit about why the machine seems to churn out so many bad people. Why is it that people come from whatever district they come from, from all over the country, they come to DC and why does everything always seem worse after? Why do these people say one thing on the way in and then once they get here, seem to operate a completely different way. He says a lot of it has to do with Barack Obama and how the state and the deep state just grew under Obama. Take a look. And it really started with a lot of the Obama people like to say what you will about Obama. The guy was good at vertically integrating personnel in a lot of these agencies where the bureaucracy would bend to their will. Like if there is a fair critique of Trump, it's that he was this great visionary, but oftentimes the people that were two, three, four layers down were working against him. And he didn't roll into the presidency with this terrific rolladex of people that could go and operate at that level. Whereas Schiff, Obama, like these people were good at getting people in place to drive action and we should learn from that. That's super interesting. So here you have a full on Trump guy saying you got to give Obama credit. I don't like what he did, but he was able to do it. He stabbed this machine with all of the people who were going to get his stuff done. They were going to accomplish his goals. And then he's also critiquing his guy. He's as Trump can be. He's Trump town, but he's saying Trump actually, he had the right ideas, but he did not know how to do that. That is a legit criticism. It's a criticism that other people have levied as well, but it's interesting hearing it from a full on Trump guy. Gates continued and he started talking about how the infrastructure itself of DC, it advances the people, the actors who share that same left-wing ideology, that same centralization of power. Well, take a look. They're part of the prevailing way of thinking the national security state, the neo-conservative worldview. There's an entire infrastructure there to build out your career. They're endowed professorships. There are think tanks that are ready to give you six-figure jobs. There's a career progression of jobs on the hill. But if you think differently, you're kind of hunted. And you're hunted, canceled. They do everything to compromise you. And if that doesn't work, they try to destroy you. I want to blow your mind right now. So Matt Gates is considered by mainstream. He is considered far right, right? He's considered far right. Do you remember my interview way back when we've played this clip a couple of times and he's talked about it in many other interviews, my interview from a couple of years ago with Thomas Sowell. Thomas Sowell talked about how he was a Marxist and a socialist. And when he got his first government job right out of school, he went in and he started looking at the government programs and saying, boy, you know, we're looking at these government programs. We're looking at the money we put into these things and we're looking at the output. And it turns out these government programs don't work. And he brought that information. This is a very famous story. He brought that information to the higher government at the government. And he said, guys, you know, we put all these money into these communities and we're not helping anybody. Actually, it's quite the reverse. And they basically said, shut up. That's pretty much what they said. And that was one of, as Thomas Sowell describes himself, his key moments to waking up to what the government actually is, what the federal government actually is. It does not want to solve problems. It wants to keep expanding like a cancer. It wants to keep replicating and continuing and going and going and going. So it's interesting that Gates and Seoul are actually hitting on the same thing that this machine is not in the business of fixing things. It is in the business of making sure that it protects itself. He continued to talk about it here. I sort of referenced this before about what happens to these guys, you know, because this happens every now and again, every couple of years, you'll find some like great congressmen kind of saying all the right things, usually somewhere in the middle of the country. But then they get to DC and it seems like they can't get anything done. And Gates argues there's actually a technical infrastructure reason related to that. I think that like the most corrupt like foray into this is like freshman orientation. Because like you show up here, and I mean, you know, imagine showing up from Northwest Arkansas from like, you know, southern Mississippi. And you see the architecture of DC, they take you out to like the finest steakhouse, the best one you've ever had, and co located at your table are the lobbyists for the major special interests for the committees that you're interested that you want to serve on. So like I get here and they're like, Oh Gates, you want to be on the Armed Services Committee. Have you met these defense contractors? These are the key lobbyists that round up the defense money. And they put you with them from the very beginning. And you sort of get the joke that if you give your vote card to the leadership and your calendar to the lobby core, you just kind of get enveloped into a system that's there to nurture you and protect you and keep you out of harm's way. And all it costs you is your own belief set. And I don't think that's compromised so much as selling out now, you know, that so that is like step one. And that catches a whole lot of the people who get here. And then beyond that, if you kind of resist that system, then they do try to extort you, engage in anything they can do to compromise you, cancel you, find some joke that you liked on Instagram years ago that like doesn't fit with the mores of this time, find some email that you were on like the forward chain of. It's like some basis to say that you're a white supremacist. Kind of sounds right, doesn't it? Right? Like that should be thought of as our mainstream would spin it that that's conspiracy stuff. But it kind of seems right. You know, even if you were to look at the way that the mainstream media treats Matt Gaetz, that he's some kind of white supremacist and he's some kind of insurrectionist and all of that stuff. But actually, the system is in place for you to get to DC and be having dinner at Peter, Peter Lubbers in Brooklyn, but have dinner at Morton Steakhouse, you know, getting a real nice filet on the bone with the lobbyists that you're supposed to be ignoring actually if you cared about the interests of the people. So this is how the system works. But you might be saying Dave, this couldn't be happening for so long, right? I mean, this isn't something that the government's been doing for quite some time. Well, we went into the archives and yesterday was MLK Day and Martin Luther King, pretty good, right? I'd say pretty good track record. Liked by a lot of people. Did you know that it is a fact that the FBI admitted to lying about MLK being the communist so that they could spy on him? Did you know that? It's true videotape. And their activity to go after Dr. King didn't even see when he died because as Congress began to consider the question of whether or not Dr. King's birthday should be named and made a national holiday. The bureau developed plans to call in friendly congressmen for off the record briefings concerning King in the hopes that those congressmen could keep any such bill from being reported out of committee. A report was written for the director by his chief intelligence officer reporting that the Communist Party, in fact, for 40 years had been trying to control the Negro movement and that it had always failed and that its efforts in connection with the march on Washington were infinitesimal. This was not accepted by the director of the FBI. He found that thinking wrong, unacceptable, and said that it must be changed and it was changed. And then we find paper coming in in which the lower level people in the FBI apologize for having misunderstood matters and on they go with this effort to discredit and start they do the bugs on Dr. King. Well, that's pretty interesting that the FBI was involved in discrediting the greatest civil rights leader of our time, right? If you're wondering the church committee, so that was part of the church committee hearing and they were showing that on C-SPAN as part of the 45th, sorry, it was the 40th anniversary of the church committee. The church committee was a U.S. Senate select committee in 1975 that investigated abuses by the CIA, the national security agency, the federal bureau of investigation, the FBI, and the IRS. Doesn't it kind of seem like we could use another church committee right now, right? Like imagine if the new congressional Republicans who, as I've been saying, like they're showing some balls right now, imagine if they come in and said, hey, what has happened here related to COVID? What has happened here related to this Russia hoax? What has happened here related to trampling on the first amendment because of the collusion between big tech and government? What has happened here between potentially FBI and CIA involvement in January 6, like there's so much stuff. And the reason that we probably need something like the church committee right now is until someone is fired for some of this, until the executives stop getting bigger bonuses and golden parachutes and moving on up and the people who screwed over everybody, they should not be then at the World Economic Forum to figure out what the future things they can screw us up on. So we could use something like the church committee these days. Let's just show you a little bit more on this because this is wild. Did you know that the FBI actually tried to get Martin Luther King Jr. to kill himself? Yes, they did. It's fact. The bureau went so far as to mail anonymous letters to Dr. King and his wife, which were mailed shortly before he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and finishes with this suggestion. King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is. You have just 34 days in which to do it. This exact number has been selected for a specific reason. It has definite practical significance. It was 34 days before the award. You were done. I'd like to interrupt. That was taken by Dr. King to mean a suggestion for suicide. Was it not? That's our understanding. The document which was found is a draft of the letter which was the anonymous letter which was actually sent because they're ready to dispute that the letter did in fact come from the FBI. We've heard no dispute of that. So the FBI wrote an anonymous letter to Martin Luther King to scare him into committing suicide. We had a commission to deal with some of those things. And maybe, I'm actually, I'm curious, we need to do a show. Let's do a show, like a real show on the church commission and all the fallout post that. It would be really fascinating to know. But do you see what I'm trying to show you here? That there are times when things get exposed and things hopefully change a little bit. Maybe they didn't change enough and that led us to this where we're at 40 some odd years later. But there are moments when good people get involved. And one of the things that I am bullish on that I am hopeful for is that the Republicans have this little sliver to be more transparent to look into the right things. They're looking into China collusion. They're looking into big tech collusion. These things are happening right now. Maybe they will fail us but maybe there's a chance. But the only reason they'll do it is if we force them to do it, if we show them that, hey, if you guys act bravely and do the right thing, we'll support you. The best example of that is Rhonda Santhes in Florida. Obviously, he started doing the right thing. People started backing him up. He wins by the craziest landslide. Now has super majorities here in Florida and Florida is free and flourishing. But I think we can export that. So now I want to show you this is Matt Gaetz one more time. Talking on CNN with what's Smirconish's first name, I forgot, with this Smirconish guy. About why they should have more cameras in Congress, that we should have more transparency. And by the way, as we played a video last week, Kevin McCarthy, the new leader of the house, has said that they are going to open up the halls of Congress so that people can actually watch the debates. So there are good things happening. Take a look. Me that without C-SPAN cameras, we would not have seen you nearly attacked by Mike Rogers. Do you think that incident is an example of why some of your colleagues, they don't want full camera access? No, I think that the reason people have opposed our effort to democratize viewing of the house floors, because in many of the debates, no one's present and they want to maintain the fiction that that's actual legislating. And whenever there is sharp disagreement or discord or fiery debate on the floor or in committee, the camera always catches those moments. But there are also moments of great interpersonal warmth and collaboration and the forming of alliances that you might not normally see, whether it's myself talking to Ilhan Omar about war powers or Primmila Jayapal about big tech regulation or discussing floor strategy with AOC. I think the American people would be able to humanize Congress more if they saw more of our human interactions and not just the theater that's on display during much of the debate. Right, so good things happening here. And again, this is exactly what Kevin McCarthy has said he is going to do. Actually, one of the members in our locals community said, why don't we as a community take a trip to DC and we'll go. We'll go to a congressional hearing together and then we'll go to lunch and a whole bunch more. So we are absolutely going to do that. And I'll reach out to some of these guys. Maybe we can get a sit down a few minutes, a cup of coffee with McCarthy or gates or any of these people. And let's have the people start engaging the politicians instead of doing what they've been doing, which was ramped up severely by COVID, where they don't even have to show up in DC, they can just call in or text in their vote or whatever it might be. So okay, let's get to a little bit more on the action part. So part of the action is having a bit of transparency, having people actually see what's going on there. That would be pretty good. Another thing that we could do is actually have some consequences for the people that got us into all of this trouble related to all of these things that we've talked about related, you know, COVID, Russia, big tech, all of this stuff. Robert Malone, I've talked about him a bunch. We're interviewing him this week, right? I think or next week, next week, who is the you know, the inventor of mRNA technology owns more patents on mRNA technology than anybody. He's become very outspoken related to all of this about how we have to stop these people. Here he is talking about what we should do when it comes to world economic forum type leaders. From a belief system that says that nation state is an obsolete idea, and we have to have a one-world government that is basically a fusion of the interests of corporations and politics, global politics. And we got to start by finding out who they are, voting them out of office, making sure they are not part of our governments. Two notable characters here in the United States are governors instantly in Newso. Okay, we've got to out these people. We've got to force them to account for whether or not they're Americans or are they globalists. And if they're globalists, they got to get out. We've got to get rid of them. We've got to take back ownership of our country. If you believe in the Constitution, if you believe in the principles of free speech and personal autonomy, medical autonomy, and autonomy at every level, other level, it's time to fight. Or your children are going to live in basically a technofascism for the rest of their natural lives. Okay, you got to understand that is the guy who invented the mRNA technology that the WEF is now telling us they want to use to literally change your gene sequencing and do a whole bunch of other crazy stuff. But what does he say the answers are? The answers are that we should care about the nation state. We shouldn't care about one world government above all of us, right? One ring to rule the world. We should care about the validity of the United States of America as an entity that that can govern itself. Now, we don't have the right people in charge right now, but that was the idea and I think we can get back to it. And by the way, the people in France can govern themselves as they wish and the people in Japan can govern themselves as they see wish. He also talks, of course, about individual autonomy and medical autonomy and everything else. So what really is he pushing against? Well, let's flash back to the World Economic Forum. This is in 2018. Here is Klaus Schwab discussing their globalist agenda and then we're going to flash to, you may remember, a certain orange man who actually is defending the United States in a way that these people don't like very much. I believe that today we need to strike the right balance between the necessary rebuilding of national social contracts. And that's the same time strengthening our multilateral system. I'm here today to represent the interests of the American people. The world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America. I'm here to deliver a simple message. There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the United States. Regulation is stealth taxation. The U.S. like many other countries, unelected bureaucrats. And we have, believe me, we have them all over the place. And they've imposed crushing an anti-business and anti-worker regulations on our citizens with no vote, no legislative debate, and no real accountability. In America, those days are over. As President, the United States, I will always protect the interests of our country, our companies, and our workers. You really got that. So that's 2018. Middle of Trump's presidency. Schwab talks about the multilateral system. What he means is that the world governments should all be coordinating together. And it's his buddies who should all come up with the ideas that everybody should abide by. And then Trump gets on the same freaking stage with him and says, I am here for the American people. And America is going to lead again. Now it's unfortunate because Trump ain't president anymore. And this mentally muddled the fool that we've got in charge obviously does not care about America first or even America second or third. I'm not sure what he cares about. Something about a Corvette, I guess. Mainly. But the ideas that Donald Trump talked about right there and that he went to the World Economic Forum to push back against literally everyone there. It's not the most fun thing to do probably. You walk into a giant conference and everyone there hates you because they know you're the one guy who's going to stand up for his country. But you know what? Trump did that. And although the postmortem on Trump is obviously he lost the last election and who knows what will happen after that or subsequently who knows what will happen going forward. The ideas that he talked about individual sovereignty and people controlling their own borders and everything else that actually started getting exported. You may remember this video from a couple months ago. This is newly elected Italian Prime Minister Georgia Maloney giving an incredible acceptance speech when she was voted in as Prime Minister take a look. That's the spirit. That's the spirit. She as the Prime Minister, the incoming now Prime Minister of Italy, she is allowed to decide what's right for the people of Italy. And it has nothing to do with what Klaus Schwab and his friends want. Okay. That she cares about God and family and country and how she defines herself. They're always talking about how they can define you. What she's talking about there is how you can define you. I think it's what we're talking about here. Pretty good. She continued just a little bit more talking about nationalism and defending individual freedom. That is the spirit that we need. She knows why she's there. And by the way, when she got elected, you may remember the headlines. We showed a whole bunch of them here. She's the fascist. The far right has come to Italy. Does that seem kind of familiar? The type of stuff they used to say about Donald Trump for defending his country, for defending the American way of life, for defending ultimately the individual. The irony, of course, is that Donald Trump and Maloney right there, defending the idea of the individual. You're not, when you truly defend the individual, you not only defend the individual in your country, you defend the rights of individuals in other countries. These people love the collective. They love state power or corporate power or just power power. They love that and they love the collective because then no one's individuality matters. And that is what they are attacking more than anything else. But guys, we're about to wrap this thing up. This is officially our longest show ever. I'm kind of in the mood for Italian for lunch after that. Maybe we'll do a little pesto pasta something. How do we know it's working? Well, because I'm going to flash you back to where we were 70 minutes ago. Klaus Schwab opened the World Economic Forum sweating. He is nervous because people are pushing back. These people do not feel that people like them because people do not like them because for as long as we have a voice, as long as I have a voice and you have a voice and we have some semblance of a free internet, we can expose them, we can talk about what they're trying to do, we can vote in better people, we can live in better communities and all of that good stuff. And Klaus Schwab's worried about that. So here's just a portion of him saying that right from the beginning that we played. We need to overcome the most critical fragmentation. And the most critical fragmentation is between those who take a constructive attitude. And those who are just bystanders, observers, and even go into the negative critical and confrontational attitude. Yeah, dude. When it comes to you, I go into the negative and the critical attitude. I don't like you. I am never going to live under you. Nobody watching this is going to. And we're going to fight into the end.
