    "text": " Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. I wanna see. Hey. Hey. Hey. Yeah. Fuck up. Hey. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. With your best friend Sarah, your best friend Sarah. You know, I tweeted a few weeks ago asking for voicemails like I do every week and I added that people could like send in jingles for when I have Rory on to debate something. We have a difference of opinion on like Rory. He named this part of the show. My side of the albinies. Get it? Cause Rory rhymes with story, but then you do a little switcheroo. County's great when you have to explain it. My side of the albinies. So I was like, we need a jingle for this. You know? So anyway, we did get one submission and this is it. Rory's side of the story. Rory. Story. Rory. Rory. Rory. Rory. Rory. Rory. Rory. I mean, it's good, but it says Rory's side of the story and we want to call it Rory's side of the albinies. But, you know, someone did it played around for like a minute in garage band and made that. And it's what we're going to use if there isn't a better one that comes in. So I implore you. implore you. Listen, that submission is the best one of the ones submission we got. So we'll send it more because otherwise this is it. Which I'm not entirely against, but let's see what else you can come up with. Shall we? That's my official call to action. You know what? Let's just get into some voicemails. Boom. Hey, Sarah. This is Andrea. I wanted to ask you about that line from Take the Swaltz when your character Geraldine says to Marco, life has a cap in it and you don't run around like a crazy person trying to fill it. I love that line so, so much. I feel like as I've gotten older and I'm trying to sort of figure out my life, I've definitely recognized that there are certain gaps that, you know, I've had to just be learned to live with. But then that there are other gaps that, you know, like I need to work on trying to fill. And I'm just curious to know what your experience has been and how that line has resonated for you if it has at all. All right. Love the podcast. Thanks so much. Bye. Yeah. Thank you. That yeah, it was something like, you know, life has a gap in it. It just does. And you don't run around like a crazy person trying to fill it. That's what you said. And I trust you more than me. But that yeah, which I suppose could be inferred as a bid for complacency. But that's not how I I said more. I was like, you know, wherever you go, there you are, you know, if something's broken, you you can run away, but you'll still be, you know what I'm saying? Like, you can't run away from your shit. Because your shit is with you. It's in your pants. I'm not sure what I'm trying to say. You can't run away from your pants. You can only shed them. Wash yourself clean. And this is not this is not a good analogy. It's going terribly. I'm going to pull the rip cord on this ejection seat. Whatever. I'm not sure what Sarah Polly was trying to say through that part through my character. She's so brilliant. And you know, partly why she's brilliant is that it's it's interpretive, this stuff. It's it's something you can discuss later, 10 years later, in fact. All right, what else? Hi, Sarah, this is Jules from breath one. I love your hard cast so much. I want to see how are you so patient with assholes? You know what I mean? Like, there's so many people that I feel like you've, you know, been in corresponding within some way, whether it's like conservative people or people who are to sticks. And you seem so patient. And I just wanted to see, yeah, what's what are your tools and in dealing with Dick? Okay, thanks. Bye. I think that nobody, Dick or otherwise, responds to feeling judged or being condescended to in a fruitful way. No good comes from it. So if I'm being my best self, which I certainly am not always, I prefer to not converse with judgment or condescension because, you know, if you're actually hoping to change someone's view or open their mind, I know one thing that's not the way to go about it. That ain't gonna work. You know, no one thinks they're a supervillain. Even Marjorie Taylor Greene, I think doesn't think that even though she's clearly vaccinated and spreading anti-vax conspiracies and misinformation in order to cater to her base, which is gross. That woman is dark, dark aura there. But I got to believe that, you know, everyone thinks that they're doing what's right. Even if they have to do some convincing, you know, even if they have to convince themselves of it, you know, they find a way it's survival. I became friends with a woman on Twitter who is very right-wing. But she's really funny, which is, I find to be rare with people on the far right, really funny, you know, when she's talking about not political stuff. And we like each other. We just, we do not fuck with each other politically on there. We both like very hands off. I mean, she says stuff like I cannot believe sometimes, but we're just hands off. We keep it light. We go deep just about like life and private stuff like in direct messages, we do. And I care for her. And she's very hard headed about what she believes. And I'm not trying to change her. I don't think I even could. But, you know, if there was even a chance that she would be open to see the world through my eyes or something, it would be because I love her. I'm not saying that's, you know, across the board had to do it, but yeah. You know, Raj, we learned on the Hulu show, you can't change people's minds. This sounds crazy with facts, especially because we live in a time where there are no fat, where there's no baseline truth. We don't even agree on what the truth is. No, you can only change people through feelings. And that's the goddamn truth, Ruth. Here's some hats. Brooklyn and baby, there's no such thing as too much comfort.

I just wanted to share a situation that really grinded my gears recently. My father is 70. He's a retired physician and recently got into poetry writing, some of which he shares on Facebook. He recently shared a poem about sexual abuse he experienced while at Hebrew Academy in Long Island, probably in the late 50s, early 60s. And most people were really supportive of him coming out and sharing his story, except for the rabbi that bought Mitzvah and me who my parents kind of hear a worship who told my dad to take it down because any criticism of Jewish people was a criticism of Israel and we can't have any of that right now. And it really upset me because he's been dealing with this for his entire life and made me want to say mean things to this rabbi. But obviously I haven't. And I just wanted to hear your thoughts on it because you're just really so good at articulating things that are difficult. Anyway, love the podcast. I completely agree with you. I completely disagree with the rabbi. The rabbi is acting out of abject fear, which always leads to conservative choices and actions. And I get it. It takes so little for people to hate Jews. I understand that it's scary. You know, when the most recognizable names, and I know I say this all the time, or are Epstein and Weinstein, it's like it's scary for people where there are so few of us. That's, you know, not good. But sweeping stuff under the rug, that cannot be who we are. In my opinion, right? People are so blinded by their fear of anti-Semitism, they're willing to ignore terrible things. And the truth has to matter, especially in religion. But that's, that's the big dichotomy of religions. No, I just didn't think my people. I mean, sweeping shit under the rug like that, like out of fear of anti-Semitism, that has to be more of a self-fulfilling prophecy than a means to an end. You know, the justification of a means to an end when doing something unethical. It's just how people justify doing bad things, you know? It's a means to an end. I feel like that's very, I don't know, come on, Rabbi, this can't be who you are, can it? Is this who you are? You are operating out of fear. Fear is not brave. And your dad should be nothing but supported. And if it helps at all, I'm sure that whoever touched him is dead. So for someone that age who was a kid in the 50s to come out now and speak his truth is so much more important than worrying what that truth will mean for the greater Judea. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I support you in wanting to punch that Rabbi in the face. You know, there are some Jews. I always think of Jews as very progressive and, you know, righteous and allies. But you know, there are Jews who are very like Israel above all. And when the ends justify the means, then anything can be made okay. I mean, look at the Republicans. That's what's very Republican mindset in my opinion. We're cheating because we need this outcome. I don't know. I hope your dad doesn't take it down. I mean, to be shamed after all these years and how brave must it be for a man of that generation to talk about this and express himself? I mean, give me a break with this Rabbi. I ripped my sleeve, jazz singer style, to this Rabbi or what else? My name is Emily McKerson and I am based in Austin Texas. I just have a question for you. This is like such a tricky slash like typical discussion about like SWBs. What's SWB? So friends with Benesys. Oh, so right now I've been seeing someone for a couple of months and I just am having such a hard time with the concept of friends with Benesys. And I adore my partner. Like, I think he is wonderful and like we have such an amazing connection, but I can't help but look at other men. And I guess for me, like, it's just hard to like separate those two things, you know, caring for someone and having feelings but still attractive or attracted to other men. So like, for me, I'm just kind of curious on what you think about that topic of like, FOB, I say FOB, it sounds way cooler than FOB. I don't know what this person is necessarily talking about. She's talking about friends with benefits, but I don't know that her then she's calling him a partner. Are they friends with if he also thinks they're friends with benefits, then you're not doing anything wrong. If this is your partner, if this is your boyfriend, I'm not equipped to answer this. And I'm not, well, I'm not judging, but I am judging him maybe. I don't know. I mean, to be in a relationship and to be happy with it and to, you know, adore the person you're with and still have a wandering eye. I don't even know what that is. That's, I've seen that a lot actually the other way around. I have, you know, I've had comedian friends, guys who, who, you know, are with their girlfriend or their fiance, but are completely fucking women on the road. And in their minds, they go, well, it's, it's not cheating because it's not love. Oh, okay. Then tell your girlfriend. Tell your girlfriend about it. Then why are you leaving it her in the dark about the relationship she's half of? So that's how you sound to me. And, and I know that that behavior has nothing to do with the person you're cheating on or have wandering eyes from. I don't know what it is. Is it FOMO? I'm going to really speak her language. Now is it FOMO? You know, are you going to, are you just like overlook, just always looking over his shoulder, seeing if there's something better? I don't know. But look, relationships can take any shape. They can look anyway, but you have to be honest with the person you're with. Yes, I, in my, in my opinion, I just, I don't like the thought of being lied to. I can't imagine you would like that either. I can't tell you how many women I know who've wasted years of their lives based on lies from their partners. And so you're really breaking that glass ceiling by being a woman who's doing it. And by the way, that's, it's absolutely just as common. I'm sure. So I'm being sexist, I guess. But look, if you feel it's okay that you have a wandering eye, then you should be honest with your partner and say that you're wandering eye. Look, give him a chance to get out of that if he's not comfortable with it. That's someone else's whole life on this planet you're fucking with. I don't like it. I'm trying not to judge because it's something, you know, just because it's something I don't relate to. I, when I'm with someone, I, I have no sexuality with others. I just had that I close that off. I go into bromode. I'm not saying that that's right. But that's right. You know, I know what I know people that are so afraid of being alone that they stay with their person while they're looking for the next person. And I find that I'm going to use a very masculine word towards it. Week. I find it to week and it disgusts me. No, I don't know. Here's some ads. Canva.

I'm a huge fan of yours and I think you're really cool. You're a really cool person. I have a question. So why do we why do we all have to grow up and be adults and do adult things? Like I'm 32 years old and I'd like to think myself having my shit together according to whatever social standards but deep inside I think I just want to stay young and naive forever. I don't want to care about mortgage or kids or retirements or whatever that is. And I find myself just enjoy hanging out with younger friends sometimes 10 years younger than me. Is it wrong? Just refusing to grow up. And I mean I can't even count how many times I just dream about just quitting my job and go paint or surfing or just dreaming. What should I do? Well I don't know. Not wanting to grow up. I understand. I think there's a difference between not wanting to grow. You want to grow. Growing is like life ideally I think. But when you think of growing up you're thinking of like social norms and all these things and you don't have to adhere to that at all. I mean there's there is no one way to live life. There's absolutely no reason why you're supposed to want what other people want or do what other people do. But unless you're somehow independently wealthy or some come from money in some way you do need to find a way to support the life you want to live. But there are creative ways to do that. Sometimes you can make that work. If you don't like the job you have, work towards one you might enjoy more. Maximize your free time to paint or surf or do the things that you want to do. Maybe there's a way to make a living that way. I don't know. On the other side of that I will tell you I wake up every morning fully jazzed that I do not have to go to school ever again. But children mortgage you don't have to have those things. You don't have to subscribe to that. You do need to support yourself. You know some people live to work and maybe I'm one of those people because I love what I do and some people work to live meaning they get a job, whatever job that just lets them make the money that they need to live the life that they want to live. You don't have to have kids. You don't have to become cynical. No of course not. There's immense growth in having a or reigniting a childlike wonder. I don't think that's immature even. I think that's um brave and uh ideally it's how we're supposed to live our lives being open having wonder asking why those are good things. Those are real good things. You're gonna have to find balance but it's your life and it should be designed by you. That's a very mature thing to do by the way. You have to figure it out but you can do it. There's no one way to live life. Look I'm a comedian. You know you talk about having friends 10 years younger than you. I mean I have friends who are 20. I have friends who are in their 90s. I have a friend in his 90s who is exactly that he has this childlike wonder. He's always like blown away by new stuff he's learning. He runs every day. He's just you see why he's able to live so long and and he's so youthful in that way. He's um he's more youthful than people have his age because he has this this wonder in this joy. You know um I have a friend that made a really interesting choice actually. He travels the world but he settles for like two years at a time. Like the first place he went was Korea. He moved to Korea and he got a job you know teaching like English as a second language. He didn't want to just be a tourist. He wanted to move somewhere to live to have roots to have an apartment to have a gas bill to have a you know water bill etc. And to really like make roots and live somewhere for two years. And then he went to Indonesia and then he went you know he goes from place to place two years at a time. He gets a job just to support this life. And what a neat fucking way to experience the world. I'm gonna live vicariously vicariously through him a bit. And it's pretty neat. It's what he decided to do with his life. It adhered to no social norms. So there you go. Good luck. What else? Hi Sarah Liz here from Canada. I have worked in a male dominated industry my entire life. What's that like? Just not the one you're in. Um I would like to know one of the sketchiest situations that you've ever been in and how you dealt with it. That's it. Oh I wouldn't even know where to start. I told the story about the peanut the first penis I ever saw. My first road gig I was constantly sexually harassed by the owner of the club nonstop. Sitting with all his guy friends commenting on my body and my boobs like to each other in front of me. And it was it wasn't they weren't friends they were grown-ups and I was 19 and it just felt scary because you know grown-ups are supposed to be helping kids. You know it's just it's so gross. And the headliner hit on me too and it was it was pretty awful. You know I was a working comedian but I did not yet have the tools as a woman to protect myself and it's shitty. By the way both of those places they were dealing cocaine on the side. Coincidence I don't know but it really fits with the whole personality like the coke alcohol vibe is something I will now just will not be around. No fucking way and I can spot it from a mile away because I've had to be around it for so many years and it's fucking gross. But I mean there was no way this was going to keep me from being a comedian. No it was awful but it was it did not deter me. I mean they weren't even funny but they sure as fuck we're gatekeepers but I hope that a lot has changed I know still a lot hasn't. But yeah I couldn't possibly just pinpoint one you know so many so many gross situations it's it's sad that there are so many that it's just too much to filter through as Whitney Cummings said and I know I've quoted this before walking to your car is dangerous as a female comic as a woman you know as a but um you know what what our guy what our male counterparts do not ever have to realize or think about. Um anyway what else? Hey Sarah I've noticed in the last year and a half that I've developed some not so great habits just from the increased time alone and the worst of those habits or one of the worst of those habits is that I now use my my body or my the clothes on my body as napkins when I need food which is a really not a great habit to have even when you're not in isolation but um yeah I was just wondering if you've if you've kind of developed any weird habits from the increased alone time thanks love the podcast. Well I would say I've always spent long chunks of time alone. I uh I was built for quarantine I really was because I like spending long swaths of time alone and I like to talk to myself. I just feel like it's it's talking to myself helps me creatively because you initially you have to kind of push past the weirdness of talking out loud when you're alone in a room but now I'm really good at it I have been for years and you know Rory was at the house over the weekend but we did a lot of like would you say it's like parallel play or you know we just we we did we were working we were doing stuff our own shit separately for a lot of the time and I was washing dishes and uh completely forgot that he was there at all but also he was right there like he was lying on the couch but I didn't know and I had I've had this song in my head for weeks because it's a Bob Dylan song I don't know what it's called but it's Rory's alarm song you know like it so um it's always in my head so I was singing and it's like ooey we're gonna fly it was it ooey ride me high tomorrow's the day my ride is gonna come ooey we're gonna fly down into the easy chair and then I'm like singing it and I'm like doing variations and that are like old time he's singing and watching them dishes and I'm like down until the easy down until the easy down until the easy chair and all of a sudden I like hear this laughter and it's just I really completely thought I was alone and he was just like what are you doing but I just I don't think about it because I just I talk I sing out loud I just I sometimes it's just nonsense or you know I don't know that just um works for me but oh my gosh it's so they're definitely embarrassing when you see it through someone else's eyes like somebody saw me do it but and then I was like that brought me to going like because I was singing old timey and then I was going like you're a grand old flag you're a high flying flag and then I was just thinking of those lyrics like what is this like some flag sycophant like with some kind of flag hype man you're a grand old flag you're a you're a high flag it's like a trump hype man like hype men is that Jewish it's like someone saying like you're you're so tall you're a tall president you're a high flying president you're grand you're you're you know just such an odd I don't know it's just weird song to me all right you love flags you're the best president you're the tallest president you're a grand old flag and right flying I was looking up um Christmas songs that were written by Jews because you know I had five minutes and I'm doing these promos for a Christmas special thing and because I'm doing an animated show that's coming out early December I think for um called Santa Inc on HBO Max that is like the old timey claymation like old Christmas specials but it's like you like we say like pussy and continent um so we're doing these promos and anyway I was looking at Jews that wrote Christmas songs which literally every Christmas song you know on love is written by a Jew and I saw that Irving Berlin who wrote White Christmas I think um also wrote God bless America which just tickled me because like how many Jew haters love that song anyway how did I get here what was the question oh my old time he said being alone yeah I don't know I thrive alone but then it can yeah I can definitely go dark what else hey Sarah uh I am a 54 year old graduate student about to start in clinicals at a hospital I'm on my couch right now I start Monday it's so I'm so apprehensive because there's so much I have to now and do next week and I'm not a 20 year old like a lot of my classmates so I just feel completely stifled and my confidence is shaken this week I just wondered you do stand up you do all these amazing things where you come from within yourself with this creativity and I wondered if you could talk about your confidence and where you get it from and how you manage to you know delve deep and and get out there and not be stifled by it um I'm not always stifled I'm just having a bad day today thank you I'm a big fan I listen all the time thanks wow that's so freaking cool um I mean at first just like you should know the material and know all the like uh whatever doctor material medical stuff I'm sure you do besides that like you got this I don't know where would I get my confidence from I honestly I think it's just like um I'm not afraid of failing I mean I definitely always want to do great and want to be the funniest or you know I mean I have that but I I am not really afraid of failing I fail all the time and I do think that's a really good um I think that's ultimately a good quality to have but you know I'm gonna quote and I quote him all the time but Charlie Kaufman said the greatest thing he said don't be afraid of failure failure should be a badge of honor it means you risked failure and I just boy take that all the way to the bank I think that's rad and uh and that there's a lot to glean from it whether you're in a creative industry or not but yeah I also completely understand where you're at I mean every time I do stand up like all day I'm like oh god I would just want to cancel I don't want to go out tonight I can't do this I don't feel funny I have nothing new to say you know or I'm just or I'll be like anxious or just bon you know depressed or what just it's just um I don't know what it comes from but I fight it I fight it I fight it and I think the antidote is just preparing being prepared which I don't always do but when I do it's always worth it it shows so like be prepared which I think that you are and um take it one moment at a time you got this you're in the prime of your life that's what's key that's what you have over everyone else I mean you know look I've been a stand-up comic since I was 17 but what I do have that I think as analogous is that I've always lived in an apartment my whole life other than growing up in New Hampshire I've always lived in an apartment and I just moved into a house that's near like hiking and stuff and my dog and I we just assumed we were apartment dogs but here we are in like this next chapter and we're fucking hiking dogs we're mountain dogs every day we climb I literally I mean we literally climb but also like please take that figuratively because that sounds really smart I guess what what I'm saying is that what you bring to this is your lived experience and you can't learn that in a classroom you are in you're in a time of your life where you actually have the most to offer so I see this as a massive leg up and they will underestimate you good I love that there's kind of in a way nothing better than that you're gonna blow them away maybe you should binge that Patricia Heaton show um Carol second act get some pointers you know this like this is like um Rodney Dangerfield and back to school which is a reference only you will get of all the grad students you'll be with Ira what else hey Sarah um I was just wondering what kind of advice you would give to an addict who is about ready to check into a recovery center um yeah never done anything like this before so it's all new to me and how it's supposed to go um but I think you're hilarious you're gorgeous and you say a lot of really really stimulating mind stimulating things um so I was just curious what you might have to say to somebody in that situation thank you so much Sarah take care hey you may not feel very strong right now but what you're doing is really brave and I would say I know that this is scary as hell you're probably in a world right now where you feel like nobody around you understands you could possibly understand what you're going through and the ones who do understand are using and you can't be around them but the great news is that in rehab you're about to meet a lot of people that know exactly what you're going through and those people are going to be from all walks of life and you will make some of the best friends of your life and you can take that to the bank you know and the people who work there know exactly what you're about to experience and the people who are going there are going to be experiencing it with you so I'm excited for you I think you're going to do great call back when you're at let me know how it went what else hi Sarah it's Kelly you recently mentioned that when people make fun of you they imitate your addiction and I wanted to know who is your favorite impression of you out in the world also I once met you at a quinoa bowl place and it was the best celebrity encounter I ever had bye whoo I bet it was backyard bowls um I would say Melissa Vias and Yorka she's incredible and uh it's hard when you hear yourself because you don't necessarily hear it but I know she is good because I've heard her do everyone else and she's spot on incredible her uh her Kristen wig is so good and uh and then there's that girl who woman there's that woman that young woman who um does impressions just with her mouth and hers is good too she doesn't she's incredible that one's just like just with her lips I should know her name but I don't know it I she I actually like played it and then I said what she said as me and then I was like oh yeah I do that is that's right on there's a lot of good ones I'm very impressionable that's not what
