I am going to be at the Ron DeSantis Charlie Christ debate tonight, which is obviously a big contest here for the governor of Florida. We'll we'll talk a bit about some of that. Clay has got all the latest on the polling. We all need to keep calm and carry on and keep moving because things are looking good for the red things are looking good for the Republicans, but it is a long way from over friends until all the votes are counted. We do not celebrate. We do not get too excited, but we will look at that data. We'll look at how things are trending right now. What is going on across the country? Interesting news item from the last hour or so, just as a teaser here, we have the Biden DOJ announcing a one 30 Eastern time press conference on a national security issue could be much ado about nothing. Clay, let me just ask you before we got other things to break down, Biden speaking over the weekend on a number of issues and how these races are breaking down. We'll do that in a second. What are you feeling on the 130 DOJ press conference? What do you think if we had a menu of possibilities? What's what's the top? So I think what they will do is say that they have uncovered some sort of Russian or Iranian smear attempt for to influence our elections, which will then allow them to pivot back to the threats of our democracy and how dangerous it is. And as we sit here 15 days from the midterms, it will also give them a convenient excuse, because remember the whole Russia collusion lie was based on a few thousand dollars, I think of Russian Facebook ads that have been purchased, which for anyone who has ever bought ads in a digital context is virtually nothing. Two other possibilities floating around out there, I would say Buck one is this could involve the Elon Musk's potential purchase of Twitter. I think it would be aggressive to say something associated with that, but maybe they pause it, don't allow it to go forward based on finding state action that is occurring inside of Twitter's database. And then by the way, the other one would obviously be, and this would be a crazy hell, Mary, that they are saying something about the more a Lago investigation and Trump. I just find that to be stunning. I think it'll be the former. There's going to be a state actor who has been doing something to try to impact the election would be my bet. I mean, if they try, I don't, you know, I never, you never want to underestimate crazy and desperate. Crazy and desperate put together can bring about all kinds of obvious insanity. And I think the Democrats are very much in a position right now where they are getting desperate, where they are recognizing that this is their focus on two issues, democracy, which is absurd. That's the primary one. And abortion is a disastrous, they already realizing this. It's a disastrous policy. In fact, one trend that I noticed over the weekend, and I know you saw this too, in competitive places, competitive states, New York, Oregon, guess what's going on, everybody, all of a sudden with the midterms looming, there are some Democrats who are really changing their tune. We are two weeks away from election day. There's early voting underway, right? I mean, this is super late in the game. You have, you have two things going on. One, all of a sudden, Kathy Hochl, the governor of New York is saying, yeah, we're going to put a lot more cops on the subway because the subway is really not safe enough. And we take safety seriously. Oh, oh, hold on a second, Clay. Just a few days ago or a few weeks ago, the, I mean, the, the mayor of New York was saying, the subway's fine. It's just a perception issue. You mean to tell me that she realizes her job's on the line and now she's pro cop all of a sudden? What a shock. Yeah, that is not a surprise. And I think we're going to talk about this a little bit later, but I really have made this analogy for a while. But every time I look at the Democrat arguments, it feels to me, Buck, like Democrats are tanking for the overall number one draft pick in a sport. For those of you out there who are not big NBA or NFL fans who pay a lot of attention to this, typically the worst team gets the first pick. And if there's a really talented playmaker out there, a lot of times teams that are battle, say we want that number one pick. The difference is that actually makes sense, Buck, in the context of sports sometimes because you can get an elite transcendent player. It really feels like the incompetence here of the Biden White House has no payoff going forward other than abject misery and failure. And I have to point out to everybody what you bring up there tanking to get the number one pick is tied into the plot line of the fantastic movie Major League, which is about the Cleveland Indians. There you go. You got it right. Not to be confused with any other sports franchise that may or may not exist out there. Just make sure everyone gets that one right. And Clay, you also, you see that in New York. The subway has become, and I grew up in New York City. It's a symbol in the danger. It's a symbol of the danger. And the thing is because everybody really who's working and not able to work from home at some point, you've got to be on the subway. I mean, unless you're fortunate enough to live walking distance to work or you're a car commuter, if you're in New York City, you're going to be on the subway at some point. And millions, literally millions are on a day to day basis. I think it's two million riders a day, something like that. So or two million rides a day. So that's a huge indicator of what's going on here. All of a sudden at the last moment, Kathy Hochl, who's missed, oh, we're going to put up gun free zone signs in Times Square. That's going to protect you, which is idiocy. And we all know that. She's saying, we're going to put more cops on the subway. Mayor Eric Adams is also now saying we're going to put more cops on the subway. All of a sudden, what was fear mongering? All of a sudden, what for months Republicans have been saying is being adopted. And in some ways, the even more amazing one, Clay, I know you saw this was Ted Wheeler, who we give credit where it's due here. We're very honest. I have said many times that Bill de Blasio was the worst mayor in America, but I'd always throw in there, runner up Ted Wheeler of Portland. Like Portland's Ted Wheeler was a particular is a particularly awful mayor. And he has come out now to say that the, I think it's hundreds of unofficial, but established, homeless encampments in the city of Portland have got to go. He's finally come out and said, you know, we're not just going to allow this endless siege of homelessness against the city. Who are these people sounding like, Clay? They're sounding like you and me and their critics all of a sudden when people are going to start voting. Yeah. Well, this is what sanity versus insanity, what we've talked about for the run up to the midterms. And I think frankly, is going to be what we talk about as we get ready for the 2024 presidential election. A lot of times you can take away Democrat and Republican and just replace it with insane and sane. Many Democrat policies are actually insane. And here is the numbers coming out of Portland, uh, Bach, this is, uh, I'm reading our guys at Outkick got it put up. Um, 81% of residents of Portland believe that the George Floyd protest were disastrous for their city. I mean, think about how woke and left wing and filled with white liberals, a city like Portland is probably Portland, Bach. I think you'd probably agree was the woktopia, uh, for woke white people still a very white city. They all went in on the idea of America's and awful racist, deranged, fundamentally evil place. And now 81% of voters think the George Floyd protest were disastrous for the city. You might have seen the, the TV show, Portlandia, which was about that, about Portland as this, uh, pseudo idyllic debt, but it was like kind of a more than that thing, right? No, no, of course, but I'm, but I'm saying, you know, it would make jokes about how people before they could like eat it, you know, eat chicken nuggets, needed to know, well, well, what was the chickens name? What were the chickens aspirations in life? Did he have, you know, plenty of free roaming area and all that kind of stuff? It was, it was the distillation of lifestyle liberalism. But when it's, when it's about food and it's about, you know, handicrafts and things like that, that's all fun. Libs are good at that. Laughs are good at, you know, it's frustrating, but it's not like destroying the country. Right. But when you talk about public safety, when you talk about efficiency in government, when you talk about law and order, these ideas they have are in, are insane. I mean, that's, that's the only way you can say it. And I have to say as well, you know, come down here in, Fort Pierce, I'm at WPSL 1590 here and Florida just got it. And we got the DeSantis debate tonight. I'm going to be there against Charlie Chris. The Senate bill causeway, which you talked about last week has been, has been rebuilt. And it's really, I know it sounds like, Oh, well, how, how much of an achievement is that if you see what was washed away in the destruction and you see what it is now in two weeks, this is remarkable. I mean, it's a remarkable achievement in engineering, the first responders, the people that did this, but it is being overseen by Rhonda Santis flip, flip to the other side of the, of the page, Clay in California, Gavin Newsom has now said that the $1.3 million solo public toilet is such an embarrassment. And it was going to take three years to build it that this is unacceptable. California spends $1.3 million on and three years to build one public toilet. Okay. And in Florida, they can get disaster relief done to the, including a, a causeway. And I know it's a long process, a lot of rebuilding, but they can do projects like the rebuilding of the Senate bill causeway in two weeks. Yeah. Well, and not only that in California, we mentioned this, I think on the show buck, but the trillions of dollars they're spending on that, that railway, the train that basically is going from nowhere, it's supposed to go LA to San Francisco, right? And instead, it's going to go like not to either of them. And it's way over budget. And nobody's going to ride it. And it is to me an embodiment of the failure of a big government system when only one political party's involved that that train may truly be there may be flying cars by the time that train is finished. Like I'm not kidding. I mean, if you look at the projections, we'll boondog. It's going to be finished like next century. And this is just what, and you say, well, how, I think this is so important too. How is this possible? Because this all comes back to folks. Why is cost of living so high? Why is inflation so high? Why does everyone in America feel poorer and less certain of the future? There are reasons for this that tied directly to the Democrat party, to the decisions they've made, to the ideology that animates the Democrat party. And it's, it's unavoidable. Now, I mean, that's why there's this possible red wave, likely red wave that's going to happen now. I mean, Clay, the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department, when they were explaining how do you even spend like, honestly, how do you spend $1.3 million on one toilet? It was quote, cost of planning of permits of reviews of permits, of public outreach, of construction management for a toilet. That's how you spend $1.3 million. That is, this is a microcosm of the California public school system of the California public sector unions. Go down the list. They're destroying these states. It's also a perfect representation of people who don't understand business because there is no cost associated issues with something like this, right? Government is not typically very efficient. Lots of big companies are not efficient. But for any of you out there that have worked where profit is the motive, sooner or later somebody looks at the books and says we are spending way too much here. We talked about this last week, Buck. I really do believe that you could cut half of all federal employees in one fell swoop. And the overall efficiency of our federal government wouldn't change it all. Clay, we might have to gas up and get going with the clay and buck helicopter, which doesn't exist yet. But maybe one day and get our buddy Senator Ted Cruz, a quick exfiltration out of the view. Is he finally done over there? Because the clips, wow, does it go? Does it end at noon? The clips over there have been. Yeah, I literally was watching this. It's great. You got it. We'll tell you, Senator Cruz went into the, uh, the lion's den. And it is exactly what you expected. We'll get to some of that coming up here and also the latest polls. But it is important day and a day out to make sure you're prepared for whatever comes your way. That means taking inventory of how well you and your family are prepared for an emergency. It doesn't have to be something you're thinking about constantly, but a couple of times a year, take stock, take inventory, plan smartly. Believe me, it'll pay off the moment you need it. It's more than just making sure you have enough spare batteries. It's factoring in larger events that can affect us and our neighbors for days, perhaps weeks on end. Buying emergency food is a critical part of a preparedness plan. I have emergency food at home. So does clay, but you got to get it from a place where it's actually high quality food. It's going to last you for many years. And it's exactly what you need at a great price. That's what you get when you go to my Patriot supply. They've really fought this through. They know this business backwards and forwards. This is just something you need to have. It's like food insurance that you keep for yourself. Go to prepare with clay and buck.com. That's the website. Prepare with clay and buck.com. You'll save $250 off a three month emergency food kit from my Patriot supply. That's right. $250 off. Now is the time. Don't wait. Get your emergency food set up today. Prepare with clay and buck.com is the website. You'll save $250. Clay and Buck going strong here with all of you across the country joined as promised by Senate candidate in the great state of Arizona, Blake Masters. Mr. Masters, good to have you back on the show, sir. Always good to be with you. So you are ahead in some of the polling we have seen, which is fascinating because we heard Mr. astronaut Mark Kelly was unbeatable. Not seeming like that right now. Yeah, that turns out to be fake news. Most Arizona surprise surprise. They don't like a wide open southern border. They don't like illegal immigration or fentanyl or paying too much for gas or groceries. They don't like violent crime, which is surging ever since Mark Kelly took office. So people are going to vote for a change in a big way here in just two weeks. So Blake, appreciate you coming on. And for people out there in Arizona, obviously you've got a lot of big races that are taking place, including the governor's race. But I tweeted out, I think you saw it, I'd love to watch the gambling markets. And early last week for the first time in your campaign, you took the lead, in other words, where people are putting money down, it's neck and neck, basically dead even back and forth in both the polling and the gambling odds. Are you seeing on the ground a sort of an upswell in support for Republicans as you travel around the state of Arizona? Absolutely. Our grassroots has fired up. We are activated. I think people are excited. They feel the energy that they see the polling tightening up. And this is if you believe the polling, right? I think the honest pollsters, yeah, they have this race, you know, neck and neck right now. But the especially honest ones admit there's a lot of Republicans that are answering those calls. You know, why would you confess your political opinions to a stranger in an climate where you've got president Biden up on TV calling you a fascist threat to democracy, if you believe in the border wall, or if you want to support the police. So I even think the polls might be underestimating the support. But I can tell you on the ground anecdotally, people in Arizona are fired up for this chance to save our state and save our country. So the biggest issues in all the polling, and we're speaking of like masters who is running for Senate in Arizona, biggest issues are obvious. And it's it's clear in all the polling, right? It's it's economy border slash immigration immigration and crime. Those three in some version depends on whether they break down inflation and the economy in the separate things. But those three are the big three. How do you differ from Mark Kelly on those for the Arizonans who are listening right now who are thinking, I know Blake's new. What do you do differently? Or what would you do differently from Mark Kelly? I will actually try and succeed at securing the border. You know, Mark Kelly, he hens and haws and says, Oh, I've done all that one person. No, he's done nothing. He's voted in lockstep for Joe Biden's open borders policies. They really is that simple. He doesn't believe in a border. If the Mexican drug car tell terror, if they could vote in this election, 100% of them would vote for Mark Kelly, because he gives them everything they want. They don't want me in there. I'm actually going to secure the border. Mark Kelly also went along with all of Biden's crazy spending. They printed six trillion dollars and spent it in the last year. Well, that causes inflation when the government prints a trillion bucks and makes every dollar in your wallet worth less and less. Normal people understand that very well. And when we tell people, Hey, Mark Kelly pretends to stand up to Joe Biden, but that's fake. It's a lie. In DC, he rubber stamped spied into gender. He's caused this inflation. Get me in there. I will block Biden's demented spending and his crazy America last energy policies that have caused all this inflation. Right. It really is simple. If you like open borders and you like crime and you like inflation, there's a US Senate candidate for you in Arizona. His name's Mark Kelly. He's delivered all these problems. He'll make them worse if you give him any more time in office. But if you think you and your family deserve better, hey, vote for me. I'm the change. Blake, we watched your debate against Mark Kelly. And frankly, you eviscerated him. And at times, he seemed uncomfortable even with the fact that the debate was going on. I think you're only debating once. Is he basically now in that sort of Democrat hide in the basement election strategy? We know you're out everywhere all over the state. What is his strategy at this point in the wake of what was a devastating debate performance for him? Absolutely. He's hiding away in the basement. He rejected a one on one debate offer from CNN. Right. Jake Kapper was probably going to moderate that. Kapper throwing softballs at Mark Kelly. No, his team decided that was too dangerous. I'll debate anytime, anyplace anywhere. But after that debate that you watched, you see why Mark Kelly doesn't want to do it again. Right. His record's indefensible. And I wasn't going to let him get away with lying. So all he's doing now is hiding away. He's got a lot of money to run fancy TV ads, right? But he's got a lie. He's got a lie about me. It's landed me. And he has to lie about his own record. He's on people's phones. Speaking of the money, they're Blake, how much has he outspent you in this race and his allies compared to what you've been able to put into the race to get it even where you are right now? How much of a money monetary disadvantage have you had? I think Mark Kelly's raised about 60, 65 million. I've raised about 10 million. So all in, they've spent the Democrats have spent about 90 million propping Mark Kelly up and lying about me. And Republicans in our race, we've spent about 20 or 30. So we're getting outspent by a pretty heavy multiple. But again, the reason why we're going to win is we have the best message. All we have to do is tell the truth. And the truth is Mark Kelly, he promised to be independent. Oops, turns out he lied. And it hasn't worked. He's backed Biden's agenda. It's a failure. I'm going to go and block Biden, right? We're going to secure the border. And it turns out that's what people want, just common sense for Republican policies to stop this insanity. Like when you hear Nancy Pelosi, for example, trying to shift the conversation away from inflation, just because it's so bad for Democrats. And then you hear other Democrats, whether in the media or elected office saying, well, it's a global problem. Really Biden had nothing to do with it. You come from a finance background. How does that talking point? It's not Biden's fault. He had nothing to do with it. How does that strike you? Well, there are other complete morons, or they know exactly what they're doing. And they're lying to you, right? Biden caused this inflation. We know this because two years ago, what was inflation? It was like one and a half percent. He didn't even have to think about it, right? The economy was working. Well, Biden, the first thing he did was cancel the Keystone pipeline, right? He declared war on American energy. But what these geniuses think was going to happen to the price of energy when you declare war on oil and gas in a country that's mostly powered by oil and gas. They took gas from $2 to $6. Now they want a prize because it's that closer to $5 in the greater Phoenix Metro, mostly because Biden is, of course, selling out oil from our strategic petroleum reserve. But when they made energy expensive, they made everything in the economy expensive because literally everything takes energy to make or to move. So that's half the inflation. That's the left hook. And then the right hook was, again, what these geniuses think was going to happen. They printed $6 trillion in the last 21 months. And that just makes every dollar in your wallet work less and less. They caused this inflation. They took it from one and a half percent in Phoenix to 13%. And it's crushing people. It's destroying seniors' retirement. The Democrats caused this inflation. And if you want more of it, vote for Democrats this fall. Where's your folks go, Blake, to donate to help to help your campaign in his final stretch here last two weeks? Very simple. Just go to Blake Masters dot com, shipping five or 10 bucks. We can win this thing. Like Masters critical seed clay. Very winnable race. I think Blake Masters is going to get over the finish line in Arizona, Nevada with Adam Laxalt and also Herschel Walker. Those are the three best. There are others, but three best chances for Republican pickups. If you're listening to us in Arizona right now, it's a race we need to win. It's race the nation needs to win. Just a whole Joe Biden in check. We'll talk about that. And more as we finish out Monday edition. We promised that we would continue to update you all on those races, those political contests that are on the razor's edge could go either way. And our critical pickups for the GOP in this midterm, we have one of those candidates with us right now. Catalina Loft is with us. She is running in Illinois's 11th district, a dead heat, my friends DNC didn't see her coming. Democrat apparatus didn't realize what they were up against. Catalina is with us now. Thanks for joining again. Thanks for having me. So what are you going to do? Catalina, how are you going to convince this? Anybody in your district in this last stretch here that you a political newcomer are going to represent their interests best in the United States Congress. Yeah, well, we're exposing Bill Foster for who he truly is, which is a far less extremist progressive that has no business representing a district that is pretty moderate Republican at heart. We care about small business. We care about economic issues. We care about the fact that we have people in our district who are suffering right now because of the inflation crisis that has been there because of people like Bill Foster who have been spending our tax money and who have been spending billions of dollars of foreign aid when people in his own district suffer. So we are going to be showing our district and have over the last year now that we need real people who are going to fight for what they care about in Congress. You know, Bill Foster has been backed by Mike Madigan who was a corrupt recently indicted former speaker of the Illinois State House. Illinoisans are done with the corruption and they're ready for new people to represent them and I'm honored to be that person for the Illinois 11th district. Catalina, thanks for coming on. This is Clay. Buck and I both met you. Like we said, I think Buck's known you for a little while. I met you in Park City. And one of the things we've been trying to do on this show is bring a lot of new blood into this show. You've got a really dynamic background. You're young. You've got a lot of great energy. Introduce yourself to our audience and explain to them how you came while still in your twenties to be running, I believe, for this office. Yeah, so just a bit of background. You know, I was born and raised in the district from a in a very small town. My mother immigrated here from Latin America. You know, she she came to the United States to find freedom and opportunity. My dad was a small business owner here in Illinois. And you know, they taught me the values of hard work, liberty, and to love this country unapologetically. And I saw the rise of the far left, particularly these women and like AOC in the squad that fundamentally are trying to destroy not only our culture here in the United States, but also our economic system. And you know, I hope it's the stories of, you know, kids who have seen what poverty and struggle looks like. I would go and visit Latin America. And I saw what real struggle was. And to now see what they're trying to do here in our country, whether it's overtaxing us or the economic issues, you know, we really need to fight for what we care about here and bring back our values. My sister and I started our own company here in Illinois. And we also, I was a former appointee with the Department of Commerce. I was one of the youngest presidential appointees. And so I'm honored to now be back fighting for my hometown and making sure that we have better representation in Congress. So, Carolina, even though you are the daughter of immigrants, you are a Latina American, you are a young person with a remarkable career already. I'm assuming you've gotten like the Vanity Fair cover treatment, you know, the Beto treatment, where they're saying they're telling the stories about how wonderful or maybe not so much from the live media in your state of Illinois, you tell us. Oh, yes. Well, you know, Jill Biden calls me a unique breakfast taco. So we have that going for us. You know, it's, you know, it's not if anything they're afraid of us, the media included. They've been running nothing but negative articles. Anything that, you know, we do is incredibly sensationalized, whereas they try to pop up the opponent. And that's just exactly what they have always been. It's just now coming to light, right? All these Democrat progressives have always tried to sit there and say that they want more females, they want more diversity in Congress, they want more diversity in corporate America, in all this cultural appropriation. But here you have somebody who is diverse, who is the next generation, who is a female, and they will do everything to try to bring us down. And it just shows, we're not victims, but it just shows how much they have lied and how afraid they are when somebody who has a different opinion of them comes to the scene and challenges one of their own. Catalina, I'm guessing, because we talked to people all over the country that the things people in your district care about the most are the economy and inflation, the rise of crime. And also our wide open borders, maybe also still fired up about Prittsker shutting down schools as much as he did in Illinois as the governor, I would bet. When you see Joe Biden arguing that teenagers need to be able to have surgery to remove their genitals, 14 and 15 years old, it just feels so tone deaf to me. I feel like we're almost getting punked or pranked. That can be anything that your district cares about. Do you feel like Democrats are just whiffing on addressing any of the issues at all that the people in your district and this country care about? Right, they have a record to run on which has been nothing but destroying our economy. You know, JB Prittsker, we had some of the most tyrannical lockdowns in the country and he destroyed small businesses. We still have businesses that are still trying to recover. The supply chain issues were also a government induced a problem and our people are hurting. But that's exactly the issue is that they are so out of touch with the actual needs of the people that they will go and push their own agenda. In Illinois, for example, JB Prittsker required tampons in middle school boys' bathrooms, eight-year-old boys' bathrooms. They are trying to push the stuff. And I'm telling you though, it is getting mama bears involved because they see the gross agenda pushing by the far left and they are so livid of what's going on in the schools. But I will also say they're livid that these people are completely out of touch with the actual kitchen table issues, which is why we're so confident in our campaign because we have been on the ground every single day on this campaign. And we know what our people want. We know what we need to fight for in Congress. And Bill Foster is completely out of touch with his constituency. Not to mention he co-sponsored legislation to have biological males and female sports. That is on his agenda. How crazy is that, by the way, Catalina? In Illinois, this is the thing that people come up to me and talk about the most. This idea that boys can identify as girls and go play in girls' sports? It's absolutely ridiculous. And the more that we continue to play along with it, the more they're going to push, right? And it's time that we put our foot down and say, we need to go back to common sense. We need to go back to, again, what matters. And that's the economy that's closing the border. That's making sure that our crime rates are not through the roof as what's going on. In Chicago, all of that crime is being pushed out to the suburbs as well. These members have done absolutely nothing productive for the American people. And it's time we bring back servant leadership of people who want to be there and who want to listen and who want to fight for what matters. People like Bill Foster are not it. And that's why we're retiring him. For people that want to help out, Catalina, we know you're in a dead heat. We know you can win this one, but it's going to take everything that they've got in the last couple of weeks here. Where should they go? How can they help? Yes. Anyway, that people can be helpful, whether it's, you know, five, $10 or just spreading the word. It means a lot. Catalina for Congress dot com and Catalina Lao on all social media platforms.

You can get your money. You can get your money. You can get your money. Third hour, Clay and Buck starts right now. Yeah, Jim Jordan there laying it down. This election is about those issues. We have been saying it for months. The data reflects it. Early voting already underway in dozens of states, millions of votes have been cast. And there's going to be a whole lot, a whole lot of very close races, I think, that could break for the GOP and be a pretty crushing blow for the Democrats. In the meantime, we'll get into some of those in a moment. But we had told you that there was some DOJ announcement at 1.30 PM Eastern time. And I see here from the Washington Examiner, the big national security story that was announced was DOJ charges Chinese spies for obstructing Huawei investigation. Huawei is a big Chinese telecom company that's effectively an organ of the Chinese Communist Party as all companies are in China. Yeah, I just this to me is this clay meant to give because there were some talk. First of all, the big thing would be if they did anything about Mar-a-Lago, but they didn't. That's not happening. That would have been that would have been an interesting news day. Also the possibility of threats to election integrity. That was one of the reports that I saw that turned out to not be true, at least not yet. What is the is the purpose of reporting on or I should say of holding this conference today to give CNN and the New York Times, etc. Something to talk about other than Joe Biden saying that minors should have transgender surgery and anyone who stands in the way as a monster. I'm just I want to be clear. Like what possible this is a nothing burger among nothing burgers in this news cycle right now. I mean, this is not even a nothing burger with cheese. This is some really weak sauce. Why is this just the DOJ doesn't know what it's doing unless it's persecuting pro life activists? Like what's going on here? I mean, I'm even I'm struggling to even think because I thought they're trying to change the narrative, but I'm going to the New York Times website right now. And they are pretty much focusing on the new prime minister in in England. Rishi Sanak, who is now taking over there, by the way, for those of you who are obsessed with the prime minister situation. Buck, I was having fun with this last night. So I watched House of the Dragon season finale. No spoilers. I'm two episodes behind. So don't know. So you stuck with it because you were like, I'm not sure if I'm going to stick with this. Like, was it worth it? Just tell me that. Is the payoff worth it? Is it worth getting through? I mean, I'm going to watch season two, but I gave it overall. It'd be like, you know, solid. But anyway, so I think I think you'll be like, you'll probably my bet is you'll probably think of like me. It's a B or B minus when you finish the first season. So I'm watching that. And then, uh, over the weekend, we did we play the clip yet of Biden seeming to forget who Dr. Jill Biden was. I think we have that clip. Let's play that. I know we had the MSNBC clips of Biden stumbling and bumbling his way through so many different answers. The one that went viral that I saw early on Saturday before college football took over my entire Saturday, listen to, I believe we've got that cut of Biden getting interviewed and you can hear the interviewer get concerned. He's like, Oh, you know, it's like he's trying to wake him up. Listen to this, but it's my intention, my intention to run again. And we have time to make that decision. Dr Biden is for it. This president, oh, Dr Biden thinks that my wife thinks that that I know that we're that we're doing something very important. I mean, that sounds even worse just the audio buck. The video is bad because you can hear the interviewer feel as if he doesn't understand the question or he's not at all for something. I mean, honestly, the guy should be, you know, with the grandkids using crayons and feeding the ducks, like this is just crazy. And yet here he is doing this stuff, running the country. I mean, the leader of the free world, the most powerful position on the planet, deciding what legislation gets passed has the authority to effectively start a war if he decides to. I know not constitutionally, but we all know how that goes. And this is the guy. I mean, this is really what they've got right now. I mean, I think that for a lot of people, Clay, also the number one story on Fox right now, we've been, we knew that this was the truth. But I think that right before the election for Biden to come out and say that that transgender surgery for minors is something that no one can oppose without being to oppose it is to be a moral to oppose it is to be in the wrong. That is a that is just there's no way to sell that to a moderate. Okay, folks, this administration's out of its mind. It's not even sell it to a moderate buck. I just I'm surrounded by parents. You know, when you got young kids everywhere you go is a kid related event. Other parents are there. Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, this is something that I would say 90% of parents are opposed to the idea of kids being and let's reinforce exactly what this is, this gender reassignment surgery. So we've got record high inflation. We've got a wide open southern border with more criminals coming across by the data on the watch list. I think I saw Bill Malusian tweet this out earlier, nearly 100 known criminals slash watch list perpetrators have been caught, which is orders of magnitude more than it ever occurred before. So we have more violent perpetrators legitimately coming across the border than we've ever apprehended before. We certainly have got crime at its high for the 21st century. And this is important, I think, Buck, the Biden White House elected to have this person, this man who now identifies as a woman who has been a woman for only 10 months and is evidently popular on TikTok. They gave this person a can actually be a woman. Can we just be to clarify? Not actually a woman claims to be a woman, which is the whole central point. Yeah, a guy who only for the last 10 months has claimed to be a woman. I'm not even saying this is not even like a long term transgender activist active on TikTok. They gave an exclusive interview to this person with the president of the United States as part of their closing message for what Joe Biden represents. And Joe Biden said it's immoral to not allow 14 and 15 year olds to chop their genitals off. If you have a problem with that, you are an immoral person that he doesn't understand how you could even have that perspective. It blew my mind when I saw this last night come across my thread, Buck. And it's obviously also the case that the Democrats, and I know this, this would go in, you know, oh, talk radio. People get all fired up about things. And it's all fear, mongering, everything else. No, they really are coming for your kids, folks. I mean, not just with the school shutdowns and and all the destruction that that hath run, not just with wokeness and the general left wing bent of the schools all over the place. Clay, this stuff that they're doing. And we keep seeing more and more footage of this. We keep seeing it. It's happening over and over and over again, where they have these, these transgender shows, these drag shows, and they want children to be there. And this isn't a one off thing. This keeps happening. There was more footage of one over the weekend. And sometimes even, I forget where it was over the weekend. One of them was a taxpayer funded event. They want to have children at drag shows with adult men gyrating their, you know, nether regions in front of small children. And they want us to shut up about it and call us bigots when we say there's a problem. And, and this is, this is something that when Joe Biden is saying this, everybody, I want you to understand, this is from the top of the apparatus. This is not a fringe of the apparatus. The left, the Democrats are all in on this. They think this is the new civil rights struggle. They really believe this. And they insist that that we say that a man can be a woman. And their game that they've been playing clay is, oh, it's just one athlete. Well, as you know, because you and your team and I'll get covered this all the time, it's not just one athlete. It's happening all the time. It's happening all the time. It's happening in high schools happening in college happening pro Olympics. You name it. And now with the, with the drag shows and the gender transition clinics for kids, they are doing this and specifically targeting it at children. I mean, if a parent, if a parent brought a, a five year old to, you know, to some kind of like a cabaret show with, you know, with adult females doing the things that these adult males are doing, somehow everyone knows like that's really weird. That's really inappropriate. Like, like, there's a problem here, right? But when there's an adult male dressed as a woman with a wig and maybe massive fake implants and, and, you know, fish nets on, we're supposed to think that this is healthy and normal. And, but Clay, you and I both know this. If we go on Twitter and we call this out, there'll be blue check lives who are saying, you're so bigoted. What's wrong with you? Why, you know, you're, you're a hitler. This is from Biden. This is from the top. I saw it and I just, it is so tone deaf. The analogy I've used and I used it in the first hour again is it feels like they're tanking for the overall number one draft pick because I can't think of something that is more tone deaf that fewer, first of all, fewer people agree with, but also that it would be at the top of your list of, hey, we got to make our closing argument. Let's go make sure that kids get their genitals. Can I give you a troubling like that's what you want to say? A troubling, not counter to that, Clay, but, but possibility here, right? Is, yeah, sure, right now it looks like they're tanking in their minds. This is just phase one. They're already doing these drag shows and getting kids to come to them. Sure. Maybe it'll cost them this election, but you have to think like these lunatic activists who's been winning the last 20 years. What have they been able to get to at this point? They've already transformed society where you know the sports media better than anybody. What happens if you say a six foot tall man with, or you know, six foot five men with male genitalia shouldn't be competing against women in the following sports? Every single person in the sports world pretty much, right? Except for you says, you're a bigot. Look at what I know. See, this is a thing right now they've over reached, but they view the overreach as incrementalism toward the eventual goal. So this is why I think it's so important for us to confront it. Because what do they always do? Oh, why are you fixated on this? Why are you making culture wars? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I worry this just, it's just happened now that's North Carolina. You were telling me during the break book you saw the video on Instagram. There's a dude identifying as a girl in North Carolina high school athletics. We had this story up on out kick over the weekend. I'm not an expert on volleyball, but I watched the video on Saturday when my team was about to post it. This guy looks to be a full grown dude. Skyrockets has an incredible vertical up over the top of the net and smashes a spike that catches a girl in the face. The guy's coaches, women's volleyball said it's the hardest hit ball he's seen in 40 years of women's volleyball. Now the net is low earth. The guy's bigger, tougher, stronger, you know, than the girl would be. And she got hit in the face and she has got such a bad concussion that her season is over evidently. And all these other North Carolina schools said as a result, we're not playing against this team anymore. So when people are saying, and you're right, buck, they try and lecture you and say, Oh, this doesn't happen very much. It's happening. It's going to happen in your town. It's going to happen in your school district. It's going to happen in one of your girls competitions. This is insane madness and it has to end. And it is a inherently dishonest evasion. You'll see some of the guys on the left who like pretend that they're tough guys. You know, like, I'm an alpha male leftist, but they're like, whoa, this doesn't happen because they know they can't defend this. This doesn't happen that often. You'll see that you say it should never happen. It's the point. So say they say they say about people getting shoved in front of the the subway. It's like, so yeah, if it happens at all, it's in the vision. This should never happen. This should never occur. If you see that video, I actually just brought up to Clay a few moments ago. I hadn't seen it yet of the girl getting hit to face the volleyball. I mean, it first of all, I mean, it is vicious. And you wonder at what point. So if a girl gets paralyzed competing against a biological male with male genitalia, also known as a man, at that point, will people maybe realize that this is madness? At what point do the Democrat activists, including Joe Biden, who approves of this stuff, by the way, I mean, they've got, you know, silent generation Democrats who've been off as long as I've been alive, who are suddenly like, yeah, a guy can be a girl. Sure, that's that's real. That's a thing. At what point does it go too far? I think the answer is it never goes too far for them. This is just all about submission and submission to the will of the collective. If they can make you say that a man is a woman, Clay, they can make you say anything. Imagine you're the family of that girl, by the way, I would be. Oh, man, it would I would, I can't even say with the thought processes I would have about some guy smashing fund. That's my daughter. That's my sister smashing a volleyball into her face because he thinks he's a girl. Unacceptable. Not only that, Buck, where the hell are the title nine activists? Where are these supposed women, the feminists out there who want women to have the ability to compete on level playing fields? They're all cowards. They're allowing, look, we just said it in the CAA record, the greatest women swimmer of the year. It was a dude who decided to become a woman. They just remember there were feminists who were arguing that burka in Afghanistan was liberating. I mean, the feminist left in this country is an abject disgrace and actually involves more destruction and degradation of women than almost any other movement. We'll talk about that one another day. Guys, where are you getting your energy from? If your answer is coffee or an energy drink, there's an immediate short-term solution, but not an all day solution. You want something that works all day, actually, every day that puts you on a different level for guys. It's a lack of testosterone in your body that we need to address here.
