Do not use ColaGuard if you have had adenomas, have inflammatory bowel disease and certain hereditary syndromes or a personal or family history of colorectal cancer.

Jeanette's memoir, I'm glad my mom died. Welcome to the world into the story of Jeanette and all of the intense life experiences that molded her into the person she is today. But how does she manage all of the messy hard feelings she's feeling right now? In each episode of hard feelings, her new podcast with Lemonata Media, she'll tell you all about it. Jealousy, shame, social anxiety, she wants to laugh about it, cry about it, and work through it with you by her side. Why? These hard feelings are a big part of the human condition. They unite us all, but only once we're willing to face them. Hard feelings is out now, wherever you get your podcasts. Lemonata. Hey friends, it's Tuesday, December 13th, 2022. Welcome to The Interesting, where we break down the viral and very interesting news you might have missed. I'm V-Spear, and today we're talking money, money, money. Where do the billions of dollars for sports stadiums come from? And who's really profiting off those AI selfie generators? Plus, what's up with fandom? What drives us to care so much about industries and celebrities who have no idea who we are? And then we are joined by the fabulous Chief Communications Officer of GLAD, and my former classmate, Rich Ferrero. We're going to talk about everything he's seen and done for queer people in media over his extensive career. All that and more on today's The Interesting, from Lemonata Media. Let's be smart together. Okay friends, we're going to kick it off today with a little sports talk. I know, not my usual beat, but here we are, because today and tomorrow are the semi-finals of the World Cup. There's been a lot of talk about how much money Qatar spent on this year's World Cup. Contractors had to create completely new transit and lodging systems. They had to build seven stadiums from the ground up. They had to install powerful cooling systems because even in the winter, Qatar can still reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit. And as we know, this labor and these conditions led to the death of many migrant workers. Some estimates say that all this work clocked in at $200 billion dollars, and some other people say it may even be closer to $300 billion dollars. Even without the exact numbers, news outlets have resoundingly called this the most expensive World Cup ever. But countries spend a ton of money on sports every year, all year. So today, I want to talk about where pro teams spend their money and where it comes from, because it is a big business. One huge area of spending for sports, the salaries, we can't all be Christiano Ronaldo, who's reportedly about to make $200 million dollars a season. But in big US leagues like the NHL and the NBA, player salaries are still in the millions. Same goes for their coaches. These teams also have lots of other expenses. You got marketing, staff for games, equipment, uniforms. So who pays for it? Where does all this money come from? For one, corporate sponsors bring huge amounts of money in. In recent years, the NFL alone has been making well over a billion with a B dollars in sponsorships annually. And Spotify recently paid FC Barcelona to have its name splashed across their stadium and the soccer jerseys. $75 million dollars a year for that one. And we haven't even gotten into what the commercials cost. Timing of an ad determines the cost. But here are some of the specific price tags. In last year's NBA season, the insurance company State Farm paid $14 million dollars for ad spots. For Major League Baseball, ads can range from the thousands to the tens of thousands per commercial. Now, what's kind of always like confused me, right, is how we pay for all these services, like State Farm Insurance. And we keep our money in a bank, like Bank of America. And then those businesses get to use our money to invest in things, like putting their names on stadiums. And they don't even give us a discount on tickets. A family of four could spend up to $1,000 dollars to attend a single NFL game. And let's be honest, it's going to cost them more than that because you got to get yourself a snack, you need a beer, and you absolutely need that little helmet ice cream Sunday. That's a serotonin must have. Why even go to the game if you're not going to get the little helmet ice cream Sunday? And you know, we got to talk about the stadiums themselves. SoFi Stadium in California might be named after a personal finance company that also happens to make a ton of money off student loan servicing. But not even they had enough money to build the stadium alone. They still had to get $5 billion in funding from the owner of the LA Rams. Most of the highest level teams though, they play in venues that were at least partially funded by taxpayers. That's nuts, right? A private utility that's supported by the public. And we're not talking like chump change. Okay, it's very expensive. The new Buffalo Bill stadium will reportedly cost $1.4 billion to build with local and state taxes covering more than half of it. And they didn't even put a dome on the field. It snows like seven months out of the year here. And we're just going to have open skies on this billion dollar field. Now, you might not want to pay for any of this, especially 14 bucks every time you want to get a beer. But something comes over us and we love these teams. So many of us still cough up the money put on our jersey and our hat even get there early because sports are a business. But they're also kind of like a religion and a family. And we just can't help ourselves. Can we go bills? Simply put fans are wild, especially the bills mafia. And if you've never been a sports fan before, but you want to check out a team, you want to maybe become like a bandwagon fan, go ahead and check out my tick tock where I covered the bills game this past Sunday. And I teach you how to be a bandwagon fan. Here in bills country, we are always accepting new fans. But besides that, when it comes to fans working over fistfuls of cash to watch their favorite teams lose, look no further than Americans traveling to Qatar to cheer for the underwhelming US men's soccer team. Fans will do, wear and pay anything it seems for the teams they love, even if the team is not that good. And there's actually some science to this, the science of fan behavior. Now, sports fandom gets a lot of attention in this discourse, but there are obviously fans of lots of other things like fans, movie franchises, actors, Viking lore, and we all love to obsess over it. And there are a few things that explain why so many of us are fans of something. There's biological pleasure associated with feeling excited, laughing or winning a game. And as animals, we seek pleasure. Plus, there's a whole market of objects that serve to extend that high. Sports teams and sci-fi and bands all have merchandise, events, and spin-off content. That allows you to relive your emotional high over and over and over, or it at least tides you over until the next exciting event comes along. The psychologist and professor Lynn Zuberness has written a lot about the science of fandom for psychology today. She points to research that shows fandom has other benefits too. For one, she writes that Antissa...patient is a common and healthy part of fandom. Separate from experience itself, the anticipation can release hormones like dopamine. Over time, this positive emotional pattern can increase a person's well-being. So yeah, go ahead and look forward to Comic Con or VidCon or the hockey playoffs or whatever 23-minute TV showed episode you're waiting on. There's also the perk of finding community. Liking the same thing as a stranger creates what's called linked lives between the two of you. It's a commonality that can bridge differences, which is useful when forming relationships at any age. In the right amount, you can even feel community with the thing or character you're a fan of. That itself can buoy you through periods of isolation as long as you're clear that Will Byers is not actually your friend. The strength of that kind of one-sided connection has been studied for a long time. For decades, researchers have shown how hormones and fans can link up with the sport they're watching. Testosterone levels and the stands can increase in-step with the levels of the athletes. And testosterone is often released specifically when the fans experience challenges like a defeat or a close call in a game. Some folks might call this parasocial, a term that I really dislike. But for many of us, it feels real because it is real. The feelings we have about our favorite band or our favorite Tiktoker or the Buffalo Bills, they're strong and they're meaningful and that is real. NYU School of Professional Studies even teaches a class on the science of fandom. And now I'm starting to wonder if our politicians and political strategists didn't maybe take a page from the sports fan playbook. A lot of similarities here, guys. And while it's perfectly reasonable for me to deck my entire home in Bill's merch and make up excuses for why every game they lose wasn't their fault, I'm not so sure decking your home in Trump flags or wearing Biden's aviators or sporting one of Hillary's pants suits or god forbid one of Rick Santorum's sweater vests or making up conspiracy theories when your fantasy league political player loses is healthy. That said, go Bills. Who made your new profile pick? I've seen them. I know you did it. I mean, I can tell someone didn't take your new profile pick because I can see that one of your fingers is missing. And you've definitely never been to art basil. And I'm pretty sure most of you are not astronauts or lions or any of the other things that are showing up these days. There's been a lot of buzz lately about these kinds of images made using artificial intelligence. In recent years, there's been a lot of apps that use AI to create altered photos or avatars like face app and photo AI. And this year is no exception. There has been a surge of AI generated selfies posted on social media in the past few weeks, specifically from an app called lensa. But people are also sounding the alarm on the practice, especially as they learn more about how AI works. Now, before AI can spit out a visual, it has to observe a bunch of examples. Engineers are constantly training or feeding these algorithms on publicly available content. Think images posted to an artist website or museum archives, newspaper photos, and the contents of the billions of articles that are on the internet. It's pretty understandable that all kinds of creatives are upset with this practice. Some artists have pointed out obvious similarities between their own proprietary art, sometimes copyrighted art, and these AI generated portraits. Even if AI isn't ripping off one specific style, the understanding is that it stole the input that is now informing its output. It used real people's labor ideas and skill without crediting those people. Let's be honest though, a lot of AI generated art still kind of sucks. But this technology is always improving. An artist are wary of what it will be capable of in the future. Illustrators have already expressed deep concern that people will one day use AI to replicate their work instead of citing or buying it directly from them. If the technology gets better, that sounds pretty possible. And remember how it gets better? By looking at other people's art. It doesn't just come up with them out of thin air. It scans the composition and color palettes of real existing things. TechCrunch reported that Lenz's parent model in particular was trained on over two billion images from across the internet. And when it comes to algorithms that create the likeness of humans, where do you think they're getting all that? Maybe you're unmoved by the rights of artists. Maybe you feel a little differently about the thought of your own face being stolen. So when it comes to face-altering apps or voice generators, think about everything helping those along. It's your selfies on social media. All the audio of your voice on TikTok. Lenz says itself in its terms of use that you sign off on that the pictures you upload will be used to further improve the algorithm. You are paying them seven or 12 bucks and you are giving them your face, your likeness. The professor, Dr. Chanda Prescott Weinstein also pointed out how these AI products benefit financially. If you post any of the images that Lenz made for you, you give the company permission to use them in their advertising. So yeah, you don't want to be a free spokesperson for somebody else's business, right? We got to read the fine print here. And remember, you're not only making the computer stronger, you're putting yourself out there for strangers to use how they want. Okay, my friends, we cannot leave this show on an art is spooky note. So we're going to learn about something a little bit more fabulous now. Let's talk about the art of drag. Drag is the art of taking on an exaggerated form of gender. There are drag queens who imitate and celebrate femininity and drag kings who do the same for masculinity. There is nothing inherently sexual about drag. Your gender is just one of many ways that you may choose to express or define yourself. And drag is a fun way that people create a persona for the stage and can highlight parody or celebrate different things about being human. Creating your own character is a trademark of modern drag, but more generic drag has been part of performance for centuries. Beginning in the early 1600s in Japan, male performers started carrying out the tradition of kabuki in which they portrayed female characters through acting and dance. A little later in that same century, you could find tons of Englishmen performing as women in plays. This was all largely because women straight up weren't allowed to participate. So not the best circumstances, but we got some good art out of it. And did you know that the US military even has a long history of drag shows? Yes, sir. That is right. And while harpy daniels is the reigning sea queen of drag stars, a term lovingly given to active duty Navy sailors who perform in drag, you might be surprised to know that even Ronald Reagan loved to cabaret. Yes, old Ronnie starred in a 1943 feature film that aired all across the United States called This is the Army. It recreated drag performances and musical reviews often performed for the troops overseas. The music was by Irving Berlin and the film was the highest grossing musical film of all time until it was surpassed by White Christmas in 1954. And fun fact, all proceeds from the film about military drag reviews was donated to the Army emergency relief. Now I love some military propaganda art, but it is not the troops that are responsible for the success of drag. The author Frank D'Acaro has traced the more recent mainstreaming of drag to the 1980s and 90s in New York City. Several performers organized an event called wigstock and the visibility that it created pushed a wider movement into motion. This built on previous drag balls and ballroom culture that people of color began in the city in the 1970s. Wigs stock was held for almost two decades, ending in the early 2000s. Only a few years later, the drag queen RuPaul launched the reality competition show RuPaul's Drag Race and honestly, the rest is history. I would think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who doesn't know about RuPaul or Drag Race. The show is now gearing up for its 15th season. Drag Race in particular has lifted up drag performers into other professions and even further into the public consciousness. Former contestants have gone on comedy tours, have serialized TV shows, they've started their own businesses and modeling careers. Drag Race alum Shangela even made history by being the first contestant on Dancing with the Stars to perform in drag. When you look at all of this, how can you not be an awe? No listen, I hate that I have to address this, but of course we do. There's no evidence of drag performers being a harm to anyone and especially not to children. I mean, have you actually ever seen a drag queen story hour? They're the cutest things on earth and the books are like all about kindness and believing in yourself and loving yourself. If there's any good news, it's this. Despite attacks, there is no sign that the tradition of drag reviews and drag queen story hour is getting snuffed out. Mrs. Kasha Davis, who you'll remember from one of our first episodes, which aired back on June 17th, is still hosting her children's program, Imagination Station, which is like a Mr. Roger style educational show produced and filmed right here in Rochester, New York. And at a drag show in More County, North Carolina last week, performers took the stage despite a group of protesters gathered outside and they kept performing despite the power outage a few hours later. People attending the drag show just turned on their flashlights and they let them shine on the queens because after all, the show must go on. It can feel like we are alone sometimes as supporters or members of the LGBTQIA plus community, but we're not. We've got rich for rarer and the good folks at GLAD leading change in the media and providing guidance to some of your favorite companies to ensure this world is a safer, kinder, more rainbow-riffic place. We're going to catch up with Rich right after the break. This message is sponsored by ColaGuard. Hi, I'm Kate Bowler and you might know me from another Lemonade on media show called Everything Happens. If you listen to my show, you know that a lot of it is inspired by my experience with colon cancer. So of course, increasing awareness around colon cancer screening is really important to me. In case you didn't know, you should start screening at 45. And a great at-home option to screen for colon cancer is with ColaGuard. ColaGuard is the only FDA-approved non-invasive screening test that looks for both altered DNA and blood in your stool. You can use this test on your own time at home with none of the prep that's required for a standard colonoscopy. ColaGuard offers control of your colon cancer screening by screening how you want and when you want. In addition to the convenience and ease of use, it's also affordable. Most insured patients pay zero dollars. I really admire what ColaGuard is doing, creating an easy-to-use and accessible way for people to get screened. So if you're 45 or older and at average risk, ask your healthcare provider about screening for colon cancer with ColaGuard. You can also request a ColaGuard prescription today at colaGuard.com slash podcast. Do not use ColaGuard if you have had adenomas, have inflammatory bowel disease, and certain hereditary syndromes, or a personal or family history of cola rectal cancer. False positive and negative results may occur. Any positive result should be followed by a colonoscopy, not a replacement for colonoscopy in high-risk patients. ColaGuard is available by prescription only. Get your screenings, everyone. In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade. Since then, it's been a barrage of bad news. But behind the Bleak Headlines, there are people working to protect our right to control our future. The Defenders is a new 10-part series about the fight for freedom in a post- Roe America. Co-hosted by Samantha Bee and me, Gloria Riviera, the show will examine ways people are still accessing care from crossing state borders to self-managed abortion. You'll hear from activists, providers, and everyday people doing the work to expand reproductive freedom. We're here to tell you, anyone can become a defender. The Defenders is out now, wherever you get your podcasts. Friends, today we are talking to Rich Ferrero, who is the Chief Communications Officer at GLAD and Executive Producer of the GLAD Media Awards. GLAD is the world's largest LGBTQ plus media advocacy organization, working to increase media accountability and community engagement while ensuring authentic LGBTQ stories are seen, heard, and actualized. Rich, thank you so much for being here. The reunited. It feels so good. I know, for folks listening at home, you might not believe this, but Rich and I went to high school together. Just a few years ago, too. Just a few years ago. I know. It was so recent. What do you remember about high school? Like, were you out in high school? I was. Yeah. You were. It was me, you and Tom Semenetti. Those were the only gay people I know. Right. I felt like I was one of, if not the only outperson in high school. I remember I brought my boyfriend at the time to prom, and it was a thing. I had to have meetings with teachers, and everyone had to go on stage to buy their tickets for the prom. There was this hesitation, and this uncertainty of when I went up and wrote down the name John as my date's name, a guy's name, would they tell me the tickets? And there was uncertainty, I had to have meetings going into it. And then we did go, and it was a lovely time, but it was such a frightening time for me. And it didn't need to be. And it's a bit of a full circle moment, because I've worked with now young people who are in their own situations and cities around the country now through my work at GLAD, and gotten to help them to manage that and to get media attention and the public pressure. But it's like, we should have been able to just study and enjoy high school or go through normal teenage things, not have to worry about being LGBTQ like fighters from the get go. But I thought our high school at that time really diversity was not valued, diversity was not something discussed. I also remember in for graduation, they separated, they're very binary, which no school should be if they separate guys and girls on each side of the stage of graduation. And I didn't have a lot of friends who were guys. In fact, I didn't have any close friends. All my friends were like amazing allies who I'm still in touch with today. But I spoke with them and I said, I really want to sit with my friends. And I don't have a lot of guy friends. And the headmaster at the time said, how could it be you went through four years of school, and you didn't have more friends. And I told him, that's more the environment that you created, than I created. So that's more your problem. But in the end, they made me they did not allow me to sit where I wanted to. So I felt like there were these moments in high school where I was learning to find my voice as a queer activist. And it was something that I didn't seek out. But in order to live my life, I needed to do that. I think being gay, at least what I see, and we'll get more into this at a younger age is more accepted because of people like us who grew up and were like out and were, I mean, our age group honestly is the first young gay people I ever knew. And I didn't even know us until we were like in our mid 20s, right? Prior to that, it was like, I don't know, my mom's like older gay guy friends and whatnot. I got a message on Facebook a few years ago from someone who was younger than us went to the same high school, but saw me being out. And it was this amazing message about how it helped him come to terms with who he was. And I think that's what we have to do as queer people, like just by being visible, just by being out, that is helping our queer community. That's helping younger people. And one, like breaking down doors for like homophobe and transphobes and folks who don't support us and getting in their face. But two, just by being out, it shows like when you become Laverne Cox is this amazing phrase that I always use possibility models for people. And I think just by being out in high school, I was a possibility model. Like we were possibility models for future generations. Like you don't realize it until you're all that gets now. You don't. I know because I do remember like if I would see you in the hallway, I would be excited to see you and like you probably had no idea that I was like, Oh my God, it's okay for somebody. I mean, a few friends with them or I or there's something there, you know, when we were in high school, I used to just think as soon as I can move to New York City, I can be who I want to be. I can be myself, right? And I think a lot of queer kids and a lot of queer people had that idea too. Once I get out of my small town, once I get to New York City, there's going to be so many more people like me. That's what I'm going to thrive. I'm going to be able to be myself. And I wonder, are kids still having that dream of having to leave where they are to be who they are, or has the world become a little bit more kind, a little bit more opportunity? Yeah, I think that queer people in rural cities and rural spots of the US are claiming their right to exist where they are. There's an amazing book by Samantha Allen, an awesome author who's also trans, where she interviews people from around America. And then there's really great HBO show called We Are Here hosted by Shangela, Bob the Drag Queen and Eureka. And they go around to small towns, they find queer people there, and they have them participate in a drag event at the end of the episode. And you meet the people in their lives, but what's so important about this show is that these are queer people who are not only proud of being queer, but they're also proud of being from Selma, Alabama, or whatever the local town is. You should not take that pride away from those queer people, but it's about making an environment where they can thrive. And I think right now, in the last few years, there have been these disgusting and false and wrong narratives about queer people that many on the right wing are really driving forward. And the way to diffuse those narratives is just by being out, by being who you are, and showing the world that we're not threats to kids, we're not trying to change anything about your life, except maybe turn them on the damn hate. But we're just trying, we're just existing, and we're proud of being queer, but we're also proud of being from your local towns. It shouldn't have to be that you need refuge cities for queer people in America, and more and more. If you look at what's happening in states like Texas, families with trans youth are fleeing because they're not safe in their states. That's such a massive problem in the country today. And it's something that we all need to address, especially like elected officials. But they're seeing it still as like, well, queer people are threats. Well, there's nothing threatening about an amazing family with a 13 year old trans son in Texas. That family should not have to leave Texas because other people don't know, don't understand, and are ignorant to trans youth and issues facing trans youth. But right now they are. And I think that's, it's such a big issue that I think if fair minded Americans viewed it that way, instead of just viewing the disgusting talking points that are in political advertisements, they got to know trans people, the world would change. I've been a glad for almost 15 years. So I did a lot of work on marriage equality. And the the moment we're all flipped is when people started to realize, Oh, I know, I know gay and lesbian couples. I know that those guys, I like them. They're part of my family. Or when grandma's used to would suddenly realize, Oh, my grandsons, guy, I want him to have a husband. Like, once you get to know LGBTQ people, you come to understand the common humanity between us all. And that's what breaks down the fear tactics that many on the right wing try and move forward. And it's why I think our stories are one of the front lines to change. And I've seen that firsthand in my work at GLAD, because that's where our mission is rooted in. I have to tell you, as out and proud and working in this world as I am and have been for the last like 15, 20 years, I find myself getting overwhelmed when things like pride come around or something like that happens. And I feel like I'm probably not alone in this where I'm like, be gay, but just be safe gay, be happy gay, be don't rock the boat gay. And I know that that isn't exactly right. But I'm still in a place even in my journey where I'm so afraid, rich, I'm so afraid all the time that I'm going to be the wrong kind of gay, or I'm gonna or somebody's going to see something and it's they're going to be like, no, no, no. Now I've changed my mind about everything because I saw this one thing that scared me as a person who doesn't have a lot of experience with gay people, maybe in a town that doesn't have a lot of gay people in now. And now I don't believe it anymore. And I feel tricked. What do you say to folks who are scared to be out? Yeah, one, you can't hold back who you are. You should change who you are for the better of the queer movement or anything like that. Living your truth is what's going to help people. I think coming out, it's a super personal decision. You have to make sure when you do so, you're surrounded by love and support, because it's not easy and it should be on your terms. I can't believe the last week of my life, but I was on the ground in Colorado Springs, helping a lot of the survivors who were attacked at the club queue shooting. And our role there was around the media, because the reporters who descended into Colorado Springs were, for the most part, not all of them, but many of the national reporters were incredibly aggressive in dealing with these survivors who were dealing with the men's grief, showing up to their homes and calling them nonstop and asking probing questions. We got to play interference because we're an organization that works with the media. But a lot of the survivors felt this responsibility to be public with who they are to speak out. And I was like, your responsibility, you've already done that by being out in Colorado Springs. You don't owe anyone to be out there in national media unless you really want to. And if you think that it's what's in the cards for you, I think it's queer people. We feel this responsibility to fight for the next generation, to fight for queer rights. And a lot of it is done just by living your life, because when people get to know you, that today in America is an act of resistance to be out and queer. And proud of that, that in itself is activism. So, you know, as someone who works for an LGBTQ group, we do need your help. We need a lot of help. But you shouldn't have that responsibility or feel that you need to, because I think just by being out, you can help others in your in your own community. It's unfortunate that we even have to talk about this and that we're talking about it again. But as you just mentioned, there was recently a shooting at a queer nightclub in Colorado Springs, devastating, preventable tragedy and victimized a community that has already suffered so much. And the thing that I am hearing a lot from folks who are kind of like reflecting on what happened is there were straight people who died in the shooting as well. There were a lot of straight people in that club. Being a queer club does not mean that every single person in there is queer. The queer diaspora and the places that we occupy and the ways that we celebrate is a mix and mingle with all different types of identities. Now, when you got there and you and your team are with the community after this tragedy, how did you triage even like who to help first, how to kind of like harness back the narrative? Yeah. And you know, we were on the ground there. There were other groups like one Colorado, the statewide equality group, and then inside out youth services, which is based in Colorado Springs, Pike's Peak Pride and the owners of Club Q as well. So and P flag as well has a chapter near Colorado Springs. So there were other organizations there as well. There were also a lot of mental health counselors for the survivors. The city had stepped up to provide some of that counseling to the folks who needed it. Again, our job was around navigating the media on it. So it was a matter of speaking with the survivors, letting them know what happens when you do become a public person, some tips like locking down your personal social media channels, not picking up the phone if you don't recognize the number, and then really helping them because the media really wanted to hone in on the tragedy. And when I found out about Club Q is they are this beautiful, diverse to your point, queer and cis straight people, like beautiful family, like really close knit. This was not only a bar or a club, it was also a community center in a lot of ways. So I wanted to make sure that that story got told, not just the story of the horrific tragedy at the hands of an assault rifle, right? But I was like, how can we tell the story of queer people in Colorado Springs, which is a very conservative and you know, conservative is not a bad word. I'd say it's more anti LGBTQ in some parts of Colorado Springs than just conservative. But how can we tell the story of the community here, not just the tragedy, and then also connect it to the bigger issues in society that drives hate and discrimination against LGBTQ people. So last week we released a poll that cloud of queer Americans and 48% of the overall community, including 72% of trans people who responded say that the current political environment makes them feel for their public safety. Half of queer Americans fear for their public safety, and that is preventable. I am June Diane Rafeel, and I'm Jessica St. Clair. And we would like to invite you on a hilarious and heartfelt journey each week on the deep dive. From navigating the chaos of motherhood and family to exploring the depths of grief and loss, we are just two best friends who process life together and with you guys. Discover our secrets to finding joy amidst the madness and get ready for unfiltered conversations about life, love, and everything in between. And nails, we talk a lot about nails. Now, community is everything to us at the deep dive. We believe in the power of connection and the strength that comes from supporting one another, and we would love to have you with us. So be sure to join us every Wednesday on the deep dive from Lemonade Media wherever you get your podcasts. We'll get into how that one moment impacted their life today and whether I should get bangs again. Choice Words is out now wherever you get your podcasts. There's been this wave of anti-LGBTQ legislation that is fueling hatred, and it was like this past year there was a record set for state bills seeking to curtail LGBTQ rights. Talk about like... For 300. Yeah, what risks this truly presents for us? Yeah, and it's the bills. It's also the political language. Like we just finished a midterm election where trans youth were political pawns. They were treated as political pawns, and they were smeared and adds. Drag performers are also under attack, and these little high is about drag performers being threats to children and other. It works, and people are believing them. So it's on all of us, it's queer people to defend and to speak the truth. There were almost 125 either protests or attacks or threats of violence around drag performances this year. Almost 125, and it's in almost all 50 states. I was a publicist for RuPaul's Drag Race season eight. I've done a lot of work with the drag community and drag artists everywhere. The lies that are put out about drag performers, the lies that are put out about gender affirming care for trans youth, which has been deemed safe and necessary by every leading medical institution in the country and in the world, like the World Health Organization. These lies, this misinformation, it's infecting Americans who are not from the queer community. It's infecting them with fear against queer people and with hatred. I think it's being driven not only by politicians who are running on this because they know it's a way to get headlines and they are putting out political ads because they don't have things to say about how they can help you in a financial way, how you can help on the economic way or help protect you against guns so you can go to a Walmart and be safe. They think that by demonizing trans youth and drag performers and queer people, they can score political points. I think that we need to as a community respond really aggressively to those attacks and to call out the lies and misinformation. But the other party that I think is complicit in that is social media platforms, Twitter and meta, all of them. We do a report each year, a cloud called the social media safety index, where we grade them on LGBTQ safety. So it's about their content policies when it comes to anti LGBTQ hate harassment or threats of violence and then how much they're enforcing it. And guess what? They're not doing a great job and for enforcing it. And I've been one of the people who for years will flag content that is vile, that is just pure hatred. And it's been really disappointing to see across the board, many of those companies refuse to act and enforce their own policies. So all of the social media platforms in our report failed this year. A glad we're not afraid to call out companies when they're not doing good by the community. But then we also try and help them to pet her. So we're trying to consult with them year round with other organizations as well to do better because social media can be such a great place for queer people as we are now. We have community that I didn't have in high school, beyond some AOL chat rooms. But they need to do a better job of protecting us as well. One of the things that GLAD does is to sort of figure out are we being represented is inclusion, expanding representation and advertising and such and in television programming. But it has fallen behind a little bit, even with more people openly identifying as queer or as part of the LGBTQ plus community in some way. Can you talk a little bit about the visibility project you're working on? Yeah, yeah. And even TV and film, I think there's a long way to go too. So in TV, we do a report each year about the state of queer characters on television streaming cable. Over 600 queer characters at the start of this TV season. Amazing. But guess how many were trans? About 30. Well, I guess how many were non-binary, like single digits. These are identities that we need to humanize, that we need to tell more stories because then kind of takes the wind out of those anti-trans bills and the bills that target folks with different gender identities or expressions. Once they could say, oh, I know someone like that on TV or in my own personal life. So I think that the TV and film industry has a better job to do in terms of the diversity of queer representation, more trans and non-binary characters, more characters living with HIV. There were less than three characters living with HIV on TV, though it's still an issue facing queer Americans and others as well and more LGBTQ people of color because I think gone are the days where we can be defined by Mitchell and Cameron on modern family who did a lot of great work to educate folks out there. But that's not the queer community we are from all backgrounds. And I think that needs to be reflected not only for queer people to see ourselves represented because we know like I remember what it was like to watch queer spoken high school. I used to hide in my room and like try and make it so my mom didn't see that I was watching it. I know and I was watching but I'm a cheerleader because another one. Yeah, another classic movie. And in advertising our visibility project we launched it at the the World Economic Forum in Davos in early 2020 right before COVID. And we launched it because in advertising the representation is even lower. However, there's a lot of data that shows that the general public trust brands more than they trust media more than they trust politicians don't blame them and more than they trust any other kind of like NGOs or any other cultural institution they trust brands right now. So we said a glad well there's a lot of energy from brands you certainly see it during Pride Month everyone wants to throw a rainbow up on social media or have panel discussions for employees but we're like how can we bring that pride year round and advertising which is so pervasive like I think like if the whole world was watching Pose on FX it would be a different world for trans people right. But the whole world is not watching Pose or queer centered stories they are seeing brands though. So if we could work with the advertising industry to increase the number of queer people in brands in casual ways because we have families just like everyone else that could reach people and influence how they think and how they perceive the community. Now on TikTok the brand thing is everywhere right because when you're a TikToker the only way that you can monetize your channel is if you're taking ads in some form I as a political TikToker don't take ads because it's just not something that I think occurs to brands that like fits fits in but there is a trans woman who is doing exceptional with brands has more deals than any other trans woman honestly I can think of and that is Dylan Mulvaney who is new to the scene this year doing incredible work. I mean she is catching just all of the flack from every single possible angle she is just like out here on the tip of the spear in some ways when it comes to TikTok representation and working with brands she has deals with handpacks with Kate Spade with highly feminine traditionally highly feminine products and brands and she has gotten a ton of acclaim she does it well she's a wonderful actress she's a great brand model lovely person and then she gets Caitlyn Jenner who of course is a member of the community to so head on directly attack and degrade her and that makes other people think that it's okay to do that so how do we deal with some of the infighting in our community when it comes to opportunity and when it comes to presenting a cohesive positive narrative. Well I think when that infighting is rooted in hate and puts people in danger we have to call it out as a community which many organizations have done specifically with Caitlyn Jenner who when she first spoke out about being trans that Diane Sawyer interview was groundbreaking right it was the first time a lot of people in America met a trans woman and was so powerful and now the things that she says especially about trans youth about amazing trans women like Dylan like it's very harmful not to just those individuals but to the community as a whole and she repeats a lot of garbage talking points from anti-trans people that are not rooted in fact like if you think about trans youth and sports and some of the misinformation around that and I think with with Dylan like having her tell her story on TikTok like that could be life-saving for some young trans women around the country and around the world so I do hope that Dylan while she's facing disgusting and ugly hate also sees that she's helping a lot of people by telling her story and that there's value in that and that I'm very happy that brands are going to her and other trans people because trans people are family friendly like there are neighbors there are parts of our family so I think that it goes back to the visibility project a bit too the power of brands affirming the existence of trans people working with them standing by them that can go a long way in the consumers of those brands and the employees I have to tell you trans people are great influencers too trans and non-binary people I have spent so much money at Victoria's Secret and I have to tell the story I when I was young I was terrified of Victoria's Secret first of all when I was in my high femme days that was like everything I wore was like the shelf bra with the skinny tank top straps the early 2000s was a very disastrous time for all kinds of things in Victoria's Secret was at the center of my trauma and then as I sort of grew up I like vowed off of it I was like I will never buy Victoria's Secret again and then this year Victoria's Secret comes out with not one but two queer models one is Olivia Pontin who's their new version of an angel they don't have angels anymore but the new one of that incredible very out model the other one her their name is escaping me right now but was modeling on TikTok a new line of gender neutral clothing for Victoria's Secret I pulled my wife into the car we drove to the mall I was like I'm buying all of this stuff I'm buying every single thing that that person was wearing because I want Victoria's Secret to know that I am back baby I'm back and I've got adult money and I'm here spending because you're you're showing people I look great and I've got all my little matching sets now and what not and I bought women's clothing and so long and it just is a thing that to the point that it's important to kids it's important to adults it's important to older people too so often when we're talking about the future of things and how they're getting better we are talking about young people and how adaptable they are but older people are adaptable too and we're seeing so many folks that are coming out late in life and I'm so proud of them this is something that's big on TikTok too and has big support but tell me about folks who are coming out late in life like where can they find resources to find themselves represented yeah Sage is a really great organization services and advocacy for LGBT elders also looking into your local queer community center center link is a network of nearly 200 community centers around the country and they do have great support groups for queer people who come out later in life many of them do programming for those individuals and I think it's really finding a champion when you come out later in life and I've been that champion for some folks who've come out later in life so that you have someone to speak with so that as you're telling your friends and family who have known you for their whole life for your whole life about your authentic self you have camaraderie you have support to go to because they might not always respond great at first but you don't have to think about their response you have to think about living your life and being true to who you are but and I think also like going on the streamers and finding queer movies like we've worked really hard at GLAD to make sure that Netflix has an LGBTQ channel make sure Hulu does as well so that you can find yourself represented like I said we've got a long ways to go in terms of diversity of that representation but I think finding those queer stories of people living out and proud and living their best lives and being proud of who they are can be helpful for folks who come out later in life too and finding your local queer bars things like that finding community is what we do magically as queer people like a lot of us some of us have biological families birth families and then we have our chosen family that was what gave me hope on the ground in Colorado Springs is just how that chosen family of the club Q family how strong they were how diverse they were how there was so much love in between these folks before what happened in the shooting and how after and how they're still standing united and if you're listening you don't have to qualify your queerness for anyone okay if you were married to a man before and now you're not and you have children and now you're queer or now you're trans you just are that's okay it was all valid it's all valid and you don't owe anybody an explanation for how you identify now and you don't need to deal with anybody's crap being like well I don't see how it's possible see it Jerry see it because I'm living it rich you have an incredibly impressive track record and even a couple times now we've kind of just like touched on different places you've been but you have really been I mean witness to just queer history over the last 20 years what is that like for you like how are you personally doing as like kind of the queer historian of our generation really no there are many others as well like and and I think but you've been the publicist I mean you've been the strategist you've been behind the scenes essentially moving this forward oftentimes I still feel like that that high school kid who had to eat lunch in the bathroom sometimes because like kids in Chilton High School would throw french fries at me and garbage like that so um I think uh I'm driven by that though and I think I've gotten to meet such amazing people in the 15 years I've been at GLAD and the work that we've done here I've gotten to do major media moments and like when New York passed marriage I worked on some of the media around that when marriage equality moved forward nationwide to help put some media on that um I've gotten to work on um when the boy scouts ended their ban on queer people both scouts and um adults in scouting I was on the ground where they had this vote and it was a bunch of like old I'm guessing mostly cis straight white dudes and boy scout uniforms and a huge convention center in Texas and there I was with my you know rainbow gear ready to talk to the media about this vote when they ended the ban on queer youth and scouting but I think the media is such a powerful tool and it's how the world perceives us so what GLAD does and what's kept me here for so long and what drives me is that if we could get the media to tell our stories better and fairly and accurately and be that resource for them and to promote the queer stories that need telling the world that's going to change and I've seen that firsthand over the years I've gotten to do that and I've also got to meet like just amazing queer icons like Laverne Cox and I worked on a documentary with her and a team at MTV called Laverne Cox presents the T word and we won an Emmy award it was the first trans focused documentary to win an Emmy award in the daytime Emmys um meeting like people like Wilson Cruz who I grew up with like I remember watching my so-called life and then getting to work with him he was a staff member of GLAD and now of course he's on Star Trek and on every magazine cover and all over Instagram like looking buff and amazing but he's such like a an activist at heart and to learn from people like that about using your own voice and organizing others to use their voice and giving the microphone to those people I'm just happy that I have a microphone at GLAD and through other connections that I could give to people whose voices and whose stories are going to change that's what that's what's super exciting to me think about a moment in your life that changed you where one day you were yourself and then the next day poof you weren't I'm Stephanie Whittles wax host of the show last day and each week I sit down with a new guest to explore happy sad stories of transformation some last days are hopeful some are tragic but on the other side of every last day is a fresh start come laugh cry with us listen to last day wherever you get your podcasts have you ever had a question that you knew was important but you were just too afraid to ask it and start the conversation from lemonade media in partnership with the jed foundation comes I need to ask you something a new 10-part series that bridges the gap between the things we need to say and the words were afraid to hear each week trauma therapist dr. Monica band sits down with a young adult and an important person in their life to help facilitate tough conversations on mental health racism and more listen to I need to ask you something wherever you get your podcasts and tell me about the glad media awards this is a huge part of your work and like you said a huge part of like putting LGBTQ stories on a big platform what's the glad media awards been like it's yeah it's grown quite a bit and I grew up with award shows like I loved watching the Tony Awards and the Oscars and the speeches and all that next year I'll be the 34th annual glad media awards and it's um we hold ceremonies in New York and LA and are and I work with such an amazing staff a glad they're driven they're passionate they're queer they are ready to change the world um and they we select nominees in over 30 categories in English and Spanish um from Hollywood to news we just added a podcasting category this year um oh hey and it's all about queer representation that moves the needle and our goal with it is to recognize amazing queer content but also to raise the bar for what that queer content looks like because I also um I left glad and I went to um now paramount but then it was Viacom I worked on MTV and I've worked with a lot of entertainment companies I know the power of trophies to incentivize executives who are green lighting decisions about what programs are on the air and what programs they put out the same thing in newsrooms um so the glad media awards are this incentive for um queer content and we get to raise the bar so that each year it's not the modern family's winning though it did win in year one um when it was first introduced because it was quite groundbreaking to have a queer couple raising a child on broadcast TV at that time um but this year our award winners are focused on trans and non-binary stories so if we we get to tell the industry each year if you want to win a glad award which many of them do here's what you have to do you have to tell diverse stories you have to tell fair and accurate stories has to be organic too we're not asking for special stories we're just saying that queer people exist in the world so if you're telling the story of um whether it's the star tracks of the world or um programs about high school like the reboot of save by the bell has to include queer people today um and then we get to also give a stage to amazing um celebrities and um newsmakers so that they could speak out about queer issues. Glad Focus is so much unjoyful rhetoric which I really appreciate because it's just so often as a queer person you're met with like trauma, terribleness right or drama or scary stuff just trauma, discrimination and then it's like glad is this place that's like no we have to focus on queer joy and we're going to tell those stories why is it important for glad to take that approach when centering queer communities and their stories? Um it's fun it's real it is fun um queer joy is real and we are our community is we're joyful we're queer damn it so um sending that message at a time when it can be really dark of dark political and cultural time is necessary because we don't we're not defined by just by the discrimination that we faced and I think when we start to realize that and if we can mute some of the attacks and some of the hate that comes our way and focus on speaking to each other as a community that's how we're going to help a lot of young people and a lot of queer people who feel isolated as well um we also have a line of kids books that are really joyful with little b-books. I was just gonna ask about that yeah tell me about the books little b-books is a kids book publishing company and we have over a dozen now one stories of queer history so there's a little picture book about um Harvey Milk and some leaders in the LGBTQ movement over time and then really sweet stories about a young kid who has a little um trans brother and what that means for them because these things are happening it's not that we're driving an agenda it's like we're reflecting reality um there's a great story called Prince of Night which was our first book about a prince who falls in love with a knight and they defeat a dragon like just like any other kids books like yeah I know like I hope it gets made into a movie as well but um like I think just like other books and I was like a total bookworm and I was a child but queer youth deserve to see their stories represented also like parents who are queer who are raising children their families deserve to be to see themselves represented so my boss the head of glad Sarah K. Dallas she's married and she and her wife they have two kids and growing up there were no stories for them to read where the kids could see themselves um until the book publishing industry has made that a priority or is starting to um and they actually um Sarah K. in her wife Kristen um wrote a book called All Moms that was released this year just about all different types of parents um because that's changing and it's not anyone driving that the world is changing it's so important that the media reflects that and there are those who oppose that and where GLAD stands is we get to defend the media against those attacks is there an international component to this too are you working with people abroad is there a glad England a glad Australia is a glad global I wish um we're actually and we're a relatively small staff um so we're just a few dozen people some people think we're hundreds of staff members now it's just a few like hard working queer folks um who work day and night sometimes um but I always see our work as it has an international reach when we do there's an arm of glad that does behind the scenes consulting work on scripts and on casting and on um not only Hollywood but video games and um Spanish language press news media etc so that has a reach because film and TV and gaming is like America's largest cultural exports that can reach queer people even in some countries where being LGBTQ is still criminalized so I think our work has a big reach we also do trainings for activists so that they can learn how to do GLAD's media advocacy which is a unique brand of advocacy we're not we don't do direct services our work is to work with media um whether that social media companies news entertainment gaming and then to connect them with the right stories and to help those stories get told fairly and accurately so we train folks we train people in Australia as they fought for marriage equality a few years ago we've done trainings around the world even in countries where it's criminalized um to be LGBTQ to teach them how they can better work with the media and some of the best practices we have and some of the resources we have as well um we also work on some international events like the Olympics to drive queer inclusion and to talk about queer inclusion there and then the World Economic Forum in Davos which is where kind of all the heads of business and heads of state convene to talk about social justice issues and other economic issues etc but queer visibility was super low there and some queer leaders in corporate America and groups like GLAD have really worked together to raise queer visibility at business conferences around the world so that our issues can be there when they're talking about when needs to happen with gun violence and racial equity and gender equity and all of the other social issues that are talked about abortion like Black Lives Matter when they talk about those issues they need to talk about LGBTQ but it's not unless there are queer people pushing for that that they will you said in another interview that I was listening to that DEI diversity equity and inclusion is not a crisis response it is something that you have to do all year round for folks who maybe don't even know where to start like how do you even start to recognize where you can improve DEI in your world yeah especially if you're in your workplace I think it's an important spot even in schools and I think what I was speaking about there is that there are some companies that come in their crisis where their queer employees are saying why are you not speaking out about the don't say LGBTQ bill that's being moved forward or the bills that would ban gender affirming care for trans youth like why are you not speaking out on this and I think if you get to that point it's too late like right now is the time where if you work in DEI or if you're in a school or university where your where DEI is a priority like queer inclusion has to be year round and it's not just in those moments of crisis about speaking out about a certain bill or about an awful awful crime like like club Q I think real DEI is about holistic so what are your forms look like do are they are they safe and appropriate for non-binary people or trans people what is your demographic data look like are you counting LGBTQ people who feel comfortable to be counted are you properly resourcing them and then like in terms of brands a lot of them do a lot of work during Pride Month like we talked about but I always tell brands like in addition to this beautiful Pride campaign with a lot of cute rainbows like half a meeting in Pride Month about what you're going to do for queer people outside of Pride Month in terms of visibility how are you including queer people in Black History Month how are you including queer people and Mother's Day Father's Day or the holidays like my favorite ad ever was a Pantene ad which was the trans chorus of LA singing a nice holiday song and then you saw them each go home for the holidays and for some people that met home to their birth families for some people that met home to the LA LGBT Center because they were living there or their chosen families but it was this idea that like it was groundbreaking a lot of media attention because no one had thought to say oh yeah trans people celebrate the holidays too so it's like if you're a brand and you're thinking about LGBTQ visibility when you do it outside of Pride Month you get more of tension because it shouldn't be unexpected but it is today and the community sees you not only as marketing to us during Pride Month but as joining our movement and that means telling our stories year-round. What's next for GLAD what's on your vision board for 2023 and beyond? And hey we're still working with folks on the ground in Colorado Springs to think about some tributes to those lives lost and to the queer people who are now starting to organize on the ground there. We have a report coming out later this month about the state of inclusion or annual report the state of inclusion in film which we are really invisible on mainstream film still today like if you don't look at like the streamers if you're just going to the movie theaters so I think some some attention to change because we know those stories can educate so many people and then our biggest one of our biggest programs right now is social media advocacy where there's so much good stuff like yourself on social media but there's so much hate and harassment and misinformation and lies so how can we better build pressure for the social media companies to begin enforcing their own policies when it comes to trust and safety and I think we've seen through Colorado Springs and just various protests like protesting a pride festivals and drag queen story hours that what's happening on social media is trickling into real life and that's alarming it's frightening it's violent and the social media companies really need to step up so you'll see a lot from GLAD about calling on them to do that and we need all the help that we can get on that well I am certainly very glad to hear that and I am dedicated to being a part of that change and helping you so Rich we're sitting here you know two decades after we roamed those Shelton High School halls and have have led such unique strange lives to get to this point and I'm just feels very full circle to be sitting here with you again today but I want to know like if you could tell little Rich and little V maybe how it turned out what would you say to them you give me all the feels right now I felt really alone and I think a lot of queer people do and to tell them that there is this beautiful diverse community where you will find yourself and you will find your chosen family and that the world is going to change and it's going to change for the better I think in high school I never thought that I'd see a day where gay people could get married and now we're seeing that I think in high school trans visibility was so low we barely knew the word transgender and now we know we're meeting trans people we're seeing them live amazing and successful lives so knowing that as the future goes on the world gets better for queer people it's not easy it's a fight but if you can step up and be a part of that the world's going to change for the better and that other kids other young people won't have to go through the feelings of isolation the feelings of bullying that that you did so I think about that a lot I think about younger me in high school and I just it's what drives me to to go to work at GLAD every day I want to make sure that I'm doing my part to help people who are in that situation because it's avoidable and and I just want to tell them that they're loved and that queer people are amazing they are indeed and I would have loved to have hear that all those years ago and I'm so glad to hear it now rich it is such a pleasure to chat with you I'm sure we are gonna stay in touch we're now we're back in we're back in the fold baby yeah maybe show up high school will like invite us back to be keynote speakers for
