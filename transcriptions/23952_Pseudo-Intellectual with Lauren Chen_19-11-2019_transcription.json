    "text": " Hey guys, welcome back to the show. Today we're going to be talking about the latest ad to be released that makes most of us go, what the hell? Where are you thinking? First, to get started, let's just have a little bit of a chat about what the purpose of an ad even is. Why are these companies spending so much money to get these messages in front of audiences? If you would have asked a brand 10 years ago why they bothered with ads that tell you something along the lines of, oh, it's to inform people about our product. It's to tell them why our product is best and why they should spend their money with us instead of our competitors or it's to raise brand awareness. And sure, that's still probably what most brands would say today. However, to me at least, it feels like in 2019, more and more brands are instead seeing ads as a chance to let people know how progressive their marketing departments are. I mean, sure, ideally you talk about the product a little bit, at least mention it toward the end maybe. But you know what, even if you don't, it's not a big deal because the main point is the progressive message. It's really shocking to me just how many ads there are right now that don't actually feature products. And we're going to be doing a bit of a challenge together. We're going to be watching this one ad and seeing how long it takes them to actually mention the product or brand that they're supposed to be advertising for. But first, I do have a quick message from our sponsor Express VPN. And because we like to kick it old school on this show, the ad will actually be about the product. I know just crazy mind blowing stuff here. Recently, over 100 million people had their personal information stolen in a major data breach. Social security numbers, contact details, credit scores and more all taken from Capital One customers. And it's not just Capital One either. Equifax, Facebook, eBay, Uber, PlayStation and Yahoo have all leaked passwords, credit cards and bank numbers belonging to billions of users. That's why I use Express VPN. Express VPN is an app for your computer and phone that encrypts and secures your data. Because hey, if a breach can happen to Capital One, it can happen to you, right? I never go online without Express VPN. And if you care about your privacy and safety, you shouldn't either. Express VPN connects with just one click, it's lightning fast and costs less than $7 a month. So use my special link, ExpressVPN.com slash Lauren right now to arm yourself with an extra three months of Express VPN for free. Support the show and protect yourself. That's Express VPN.com slash Lauren for an extra three months free. Now I know you guys have seen the title of this video and you've likely already seen this ad circulating on social media. Let's pretend just for a second that you haven't. And let's try to guess what the ad is even for together. I think that'll be fun and also somewhat of a learning experience. And for all of our friends who are listening right now on one of the podcast platforms, I will also be describing what's happening in the video as the ad plays that and also the original ad had music in it and copyright issues. You know how it'd be. First up, we have what looks like a mother putting makeup on her teenage son, or at least that's how he was born. I doubt that's how he currently identifies based on the vibe I'm getting though. Next up, we have maybe an older sister putting a chest binder on a young, probably non binary identifying individual to, I guess, flatten breasts because that's the thing our culture does now. Now we have some dude putting on a blue wig. He's also wearing makeup and oh look, his grandma is there and they're holding hands. Now Granny's helping him lace up a corset and he's in lingerie with fish nests and thigh high boots. I don't know about you guys, but even as a biological female, a woman, my grandmother would not be all smiles trying to help me lace up into a boot war outfit. Like that just would not happen. Maybe other households are different. Maybe my family just isn't as progressive. But that would not be a thing. But anyway, are there any guesses as to what this ad could possibly be for? Maybe a hormone replacement therapy clinic, maybe a brand of boost days that comes in sizes that are suitable for individuals who are, I don't know, 6 foot 2 and weigh 250 pounds. Maybe a type of makeup that prevents the growth of 5 o'clock shadows. If you guess any of that, my mind would be right there with you but we would both be wrong. Let's keep watching. Now we have some little girls painting a heart on a pride flag because oh look, their sister is gay. She has a girlfriend. I don't know about you guys, but in a weird way, I find gay so quaint now, you know, so 2015. Things were simpler then. Now we have a mom saying goodbye to a non-binary son and the individual in the wig is all tarted up about to leave saying goodbye to his grandmother. Do we have any more guesses yet as to what we could possibly be encouraged to buy from watching this ad? Maybe a subscription to an LGBT interest magazine? Maybe Grindr Premium? Again, the answer is no. And by the way, we're about a minute into the ad right now and we still have no idea what the ad is even for so that's how you know it's effective advertising. Continuing, now we have two men holding hands in the back seat of a car, I think they're being driven by one of their fathers and they've just arrived at a pride parade. The father remains in the car and looks on lovingly as the two men disappear in the crowd. Although, you know, he could also just be an enthusiastic Uber driver wishing he was out there with them. Anyway, a caption on the screen reads, pride, what you feel when someone you love chooses to be free. And then it says, you're not alone. Again, really not a lot of products being mentioned here or any products at all, but I do quickly want to touch upon the idea that pride means letting someone you love be free or however they chose to word that. When it comes to freedom, don't get me wrong. I believe that freedom from government is a good thing, an important thing, even a human right. When it comes to freedom in social situations, ehh, I'm really not as big of a fan. Now before anyone freaks out, calm down. I'm not saying that the government should tell us what we can or cannot do socially. However, I also believe that just because we're free to do something doesn't mean we should. I mean, some people might say that you should be free to cheat on your wife, free to do a heck of a lot of drugs, free to sit around all day, doing nothing, free to let your health go. Which, I mean, I guess that's the freedom, sure, but that's not what I want for the people I love. My biggest hope for them is to be healthy and happy in leading a productive life and as adults, we know that doing whatever we want isn't always conducive to being happy, healthy and productive. Bit of a tangent, I know, but in any case, we are now over a minute and a half into this ad, I still have no idea what the heck I'm supposed to buy, so please add, tell us who sponsored you. Ah, and there you go. Sprite, the ad is for Sprite. You could have fooled me, but apparently it's for Sprite. Now when we were first talking about making this video, Liam, who produces this show, didn't want me mentioning Sprite at all. He didn't want them benefiting from hate clicks. There are some people out there who believe that any publicity is good publicity and that as long as people are talking about your brand, you've come out on top. Me, I disagree with that. I think in order to boycott something, you first have to know what that something is and I want everybody to know about Sprite. And I know what some of you are thinking, whoa, boycott isn't that a little extreme. Why are you so triggered just because there are gay and trans people in an ad? This doesn't need to be political, so they support gay and trans people. So what? You are absolutely kidding yourself if you don't think there's a political message in that ad. And you know what, I would love it if being gay or anything like that wasn't a political statement to be leveraged by corporations, but these activists have assured us time and time again that, hey, LGBT is a political identity. And although there are plenty of LGBT people out in the world who don't agree with that, don't believe that odds are that Sprite absolutely does. You really think brands are spending all of this money just to appeal to 2% of the population? I don't think so. They're trying to appeal to the progressive population. And all of them, they're sending a political message here to let the progressive people know that, hey, we're on your side. And I feel bad. I'm sorry for all of the gay people, the trans people whose identities have been co-opted by this rainbow corporatism, but this is the world that we live in now. And with this Sprite ad specifically, I do find the message especially repugnant. Did you notice the theme of trans individuals with parents in the commercial? Because I certainly did. We are living in an age where there are literal court battles happening over whether or not children can be pumped full of hormones. No, I don't think whoever made this ad is unaware of that reality, and I think there's a very real reason why parents and their trans children are featured so heavily in this God forsaken commercial. Maybe I'm overreacting here and you guys can let me know, but I for one am tired of the overt in window being shifted further and further left. Remember how mad people were at Home Depot when they found out that one of the founders supported Trump? Remember how mad people still are over Chick-fil-A for supporting Christian charities and the founders saying he believes in a traditional view of marriage? The left wants people to believe that those views supporting Trump and Christianity, those are outrageous, extreme, worthy of boycott, but trans everything? Well, that just makes sense. That's normal. That's the default position. That's what brands should be trying to embody actually. No, no, I'm sorry. No, I'm not going to be part of that. Maybe my reaction to this ad would be different if we weren't living in this crazy polarized world, but let's face it, we are. And before we go any further, I first want to tell you all about my friends over at Freedom Works. I've been working with them for about a year now and I've traveled across America with them and got to meet the amazing individuals in their grassroots network. These are everyday patriots who love America and the Constitution and aren't afraid to get active and make conservative change happen. If that sounds like you and you'd like to be a part of Freedom Works' conservative community, please text Lauren. That's my name, Lauren, to 52886 now. From fighting impeachment to undoing job killing regulations, Freedom Works does it all. They are the ones on the front lines fighting to make your voice heard in Washington and preserve your country for generations to come. Living in Canada, I've seen firsthand how harmful socialist policies can be to a country and trust me, that's something you don't want in America. But the only way you can directly save your country from the ravages of socialism is by getting active and staying involved. I always get people asking me how they can make a difference, how they can help out, how they can fight back. Well, I'm telling you now, text Lauren to 52886. That's my name, Lauren, to 52886 to join Freedom Works today. At this point, progressives have shown nothing but intolerance toward views like mine and frankly, I'm in a position now where I just really don't see why I should tolerate views like theirs. And I'm not saying I'm going to be cruel to progressives or try to deplatform progressives because let's face it, I'm still a better person than they are. Am I saying that I'm better than you? I guess I'm going a little further than you are. Yeah, I'm f***ing better than you. Okay, much better than you. You are garbage. Okay, if you get a rise out of attacking the powerless, you're garbage. And you can call me a social justice warrior, you can call me whatever the f*** you want. At this point, I don't give a s***. But I'm just not willing to live and let live with this kind of thing. No, I'm done with that. We have lost too much ground already. We need to do something. Alright, well, my little rant aside, we should probably discuss what the overall reception to this ad has been. Well, progressives predictably have loved it. Pink News writes that, quote, this viral sprite ad about LGBT families in Argentina will warm your heart. And out magazine says, sprites new LGBTQ plus ad will make you cry. The website LGBTQ nation announced that this commercial should be the standard for LGBTQ focused advertising. Um, sprite, I get that you want to pander to progressives here, but shouldn't audiences be excited about your product, not just on screen representation? Because I mean, these people do seem happy about the ad, but not really because sprite, they're happy because gay. And some people might say, hey, that's still a win though, because at least they're happy about a sprite ad. And maybe that'll stick to them, right? Sprite, happy, that connection. The thing is though, everyone else is confused, confused and angry, conf angry. As the Daily Wires Matt Walsh writes, one of the creepiest ads I've ever seen, powerful forces in our society are determined to push this nonsense onto your kids. Are you going to stand up and say something about it? Mr. Crowe Magnon 1215 wants to remind everybody that quote, this is a sprite commercial. Coca-Cola company owns Sprite. I am never buying Coca-Cola products ever again. Whew, those are some pole rising opinions, but I guess that's what you get. When you make your commercial political, why, why would they feel the need to make the commercial political? I don't get it. But finally, as Chad Felix green writes, the sprite ad is targeted toward parents to show them what good parents do with their LGBTQ kids. It's meant to shame them and tell them to stop questioning gender activism. If you love your kids, do what we tell you to. Thank you, Chad. This isn't just a pro-LGBT ad, like I said. This is a mostly pro, parents and grandparents should be super thrilled their children are trans ad. You guys can spend your money however you want, but I for one don't really feel like supporting a brand that virtue signals to us about how wonderful it is when grandmothers help their cross-dressing sons into a less-style lingerie with fishnet stockings. But at the same time, I will say that if any of you were on the fence about whether to boycott or not, this isn't the first ad like this that Sprite has actually put out. They've previously put out at least one other commercial in the You Are Not Alone series touching upon gay and trans identities. See, Sprite has a history of making commercials that have nothing to do with Sprite, but have everything to do with progressivism. And the thing is, I'm for corporate responsibility. I don't want brands to pollute. I like it when companies give back to charity, but I'm not actually looking for brands to sell me moral and political messages. That's just not the role that I want Sprite to have in my life. Ultimately, though, what is this all going to mean for Sprite and their business going forward? Well, it should be noted that this ad originated in Argentina where apparently people are super, super progressive, so I'm sure Sprite sales in Argentina will do just fine. However, now that this ad has blown up on social media, they may be in for some trouble internationally. I mean, the saying, get woke, go broke, exist for a reason, but I will say there are of course tons of brands that do go woke, but don't go broke. Starbucks and Nike are great examples of that. And never mind Sephora, the makeup company has gone super woke and no one seems to mind that. I grew up in a country where it's illegal to be gay. Not wearing any cute colors because it's not masculine or not wearing makeup because it's not masculine or not acceptable. Like, that to me sounds so boring. It feels really empowering for me to do something that my culture has always told me I can't do. That's why now everything that I do is right and loud and unapologetic. I'm screaming, I'm Egyptian and gay. However, on the other side of that, there is Gillette. I think we all remember that cancerous toxic masculinity ad they did and the backlash they received online for it. If you don't remember, here's a refresher. What I actually think she's trying to say. Making the same old excuses. Why is it all be boys? Why is it all be boys? But something finally channable. Wow, sweetie. Come on. To say the right thing. To act the right way. No, not cool, not cool. Some already are. But some is not enough. Some will treat each other with men. Because the boys watching today will be the men of tomorrow. Well for a while after that ad came out, it seemed like Gillette's sales were doing just fine. But as the post-millennial reports, after last quarter, Gillette suffered an $8 billion write down. Now of course we can't say whether that was all or even mostly due to that disastrous ad but I'm guessing it probably didn't help. In any case, I guess we'll just have to wait and see how this plays out for Sprite and as always, I would love to know what you guys think. Does this change your opinion of Sprite? Why or why not? And will you be boycotting them? Let me know but that's it for now. Thank you guys so much for tuning in and I'll see you next time."
