    "text": " Frankly gents, I don't even really know what to say about this conversation with such a powerful discussion from a man who has been through hell and back to fight for not only who he is as a man, but as a father of his children. His name is Greg Ellis, and although you may not recognize his name, you have definitely seen him on the silver screen. Today we talk about the true purpose of vulnerability, why social media should be called anti-social media, the crisis of meaning that modern society is facing, and also why fatherhood is in the crosshairs. You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. You embrace your fears and boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated, rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, what is going on today? My name is Ryan Mikler, and I am the host and the founder of the Order of Man podcast and movement. Welcome here. Welcome back. Glad you're with us. This is a powerful, powerful platform for having conversations with highly successful, incredible men in the field of academia, and athletics, and scholars, and New York Times best-selling authors, and warriors, and experts in every field, including my guest today. His name is Greg Ellis, who is an Emmy Award nominated actor, who I'm sure you've seen in some of his acting roles and career, which is 24 and Pirates of the Caribbean and so many others. So we're glad you're here. I'm glad you're tuning in. Make sure if you would, please leave that rating and review. It goes a very long way in promoting the visibility of what we're doing here and getting this information into the heads and hands of those men who need it. Just take a couple minutes, leave that rating and review. Again, it goes a very long way. Before I get into my introduction of Greg today, just want to make a quick mention. We're starting to cool off here a little bit in Maine, and maybe it's starting to cool off for you too, if not, I hope it does soon. If you're looking for new denim, new boots, then I would definitely check out Origin Maine. Now these guys are my neighbors. They're my friends. They're obviously the podcast sponsors, and everything they do is 100% sourced and made in America. If you're looking for American-made denim, American-made boots, I would highly recommend the Bison Boot. Then check it out at Origin Maine, the state mane, originmain.com, and use the code order. Again, originmain.com. Use the code order. All right, guys, let me introduce you to Greg. We only met recently, but we've had some incredibly powerful conversations about life and what it means to be a man and how the odds in pop culture are stacked. A lot of you guys know this, and unfortunately are intimately familiar with this are stacked against fathers. But Greg is an incredibly talented Emmy Award-nominated actor. He's a filmmaker. He's a coach. He's also the author of his latest book, The Respondent, exposing the cartel of family law. He's also become an incredibly powerful advocate for men who are desperately fighting to maintain their rights for their children. And although we didn't get into it as deep as on that subject as I would have liked, the conversation we did have is extremely, extremely powerful and great news, guys. We're also going to be recording a part two soon. That's going to finish up the conversation. So I hope you enjoy this one and walk away with some new perspectives that perhaps you haven't considered before. Mr. Greg Ellis, so excited to have you join me, man. I know you and I had a conversation what a couple of weeks ago. And we talked about doing this a couple of months down the road, but I had some open space and I'm like, let's get Greg on the podcast. I'm so excited to have this conversation today. Happy to be here. Thanks for having me, Ryan. Yeah. So before we hit record, we were talking about Maine and it sounds like you might be contemplating getting up here to the to the Northeast. Do you know where you are? Well, where am I at? You see, a couple of months ago, I hadn't even really, I mean, I'd heard the word Maine, but I didn't know anything about it. And then I visited, I have some friends out there, I visited, then I took a couple of friends out there and gosh, it's beautiful up there. It's almost like they're hidden secret state, you know, and it reminds me that we shouldn't talk about this. Let's not talk about Maine. In fact, let's rerecord. Start again. Take two. Welcome to the rock. Oh, hang on. This is your show going. That's right. Just moved to Hollywood, moved to California. And you know, your wildest dreams will come true. Stay away from Maine, stay away from Montana, stay away from the Northeast and just leave us alone. That's kind of how I am. Yeah. And to the entertainment industry, it's really easy. Office of work will come your way. You'll be a movie star in months. And you know, click on this link now. Call to action. All you have to do is become a server, you know, some bar restaurant there. And you know, the talent will find you. And then your dreams will be unlocked before you. That's right. Just as long as your dreams include constant and consistent rejection and an ever and ongoing search on the quest for value of oneself, which is not found through the job and the work and the celebration of the artist, it's found itself, capital S. You know, one thing, as I was thinking about and contemplating and researching what you've done is, I think that's the fairy tale is that, you know, if you just move to Hollywood and you just, you go be a server somewhere or you connect with the right person just by happenstance, that things will work out. But I mean, you've been in this game for your entire life. I mean, since you were a child. And so it's, I think that's a more realistic picture. And most people don't seem to understand that because we live in this immediate gratification society. Yeah. And I think that the end of time, but you make a good point, the entertainment business has changed as well. It's kind of morphed away from the traditional mainstream media and studio environment. There used to be pilot season and TV. There's no pilot season anymore, effectively, with the advent of new media and streaming services, social media or anti social media, as I call it sometimes. And everyone wants to be that instant gratification. Everyone's presenting the best version they can invent of themselves on apps like IG and Facebook and Twitter, etc, etc. And I think, you know, there's this constant need for the dopamine hits. It becomes an addiction. And I've talked about this before, you know, that addiction is like, it's like the reverse psychology of device dependency that's embedded in the algorithm of these social media platforms. So the more I think we can put down the device, not exercise from the eyes down and exercise from the neck up, as well as physical exercise, get outside and get into nature. I think that's the real reliever, you know, the natural world. Yeah, that's a powerful perspective. I use social media, you use social media. And I use it very deliberately and intentionally. I won't pretend to say that it doesn't get the best of me from time to time. It certainly does. But ultimately, it's a tool like a hammer would be a tool. And I try to use it as effectively as I possibly can to grow my business. But sometimes, you know, it's nice to put the hammer down and just be around your family and be around the activities and interest and people that you like. And I think there's a lost, a lost art in today's society. I think so too. I mean, you talk about what in the virtual hammer down, maybe that's the virtual hammer. It's like you put the virtual hammer down and pick up a real hammer. You know, see how you actually use that. I mean, I'm not really, I wouldn't call myself a skilled manual laborer. But there is an interest and a curiosity there of me to kind of within me to know more about, you know, how things work, how you put things together, you know, whether it be machines or whether it be houses or construction or I mean, that's kind of interesting. And yeah, I think this, this, what I've seen recently is, you know, I mentioned this at the start, the pandemic, you know, the what I was more afraid of was the panic, the mental health, the social isolation, the bad messages of social distancing when it should be physical distancing and social connectedness, you know, we're human beings, we need to be with each other. And I think the more that we can actually experience that in person experience, the better off we're going to be in a whole host of metrics, not least of which mental health. So you're talking about the physical hammer. And I think most of the men listening probably relate to that just because of what I've built over the past six years that we tend to pride ourselves on being physical in nature and being capable of using our hands and wielding tools to accomplish what we want to accomplish. I'm actually really curious on that subject about the art behind you. Is that your art? Or is that like, tell me about the art behind you? Because it's very, very interesting. Well, this piece over my left shoulder is called the crow. The crow has a lot of magical, mercurial meaning to me. And a friend of mine was kind enough, an artist friend of mine was kind enough to paint that, an artist known as Baby Girl Barrett. And the pieces of my right shot, the statues, they're a part of the collection by a French sculptor and artist called Mark von Chuguera. And they were part of the collection that he did. He really focuses on men in the male form and the embodiment of the male and what that means. I think one of the pieces behind is called the fall, the fall of man. Another piece of homo crucifixes. Actually, that's a piece that's off camera. So it's really just studying the fall and rise of man through the artistic sculpting, I guess, of the bronze. And the other piece over my right is it's actually by an artist called Mark Asatelli. And I was at his gallery. I had a couple of his pieces of art. And I was at gallery and I looked around everything. Nothing inspired me on that day. And as I was walking out, I saw this piece kind of, you know, down the side of the gallery. And I said, what's that? And like a lot of art, I think you look at a piece of art. And as long as you're not around the tofts and that, oh, isn't it just beautiful, the brushwork of the, you know, the eloquence of the, you know, which is fine. Everyone can interpret something from a piece of art. And I saw that piece and it's called Last Man Standing Still. And I see so much in that piece about the singularity of man and being able to reside in a loneness, that knowingness of a loneness, you talked about the physical realm, I think it's important as well, you know, we, we men are supposed to be stoic and the psychological like how strong we can be psychologically and physically. So I think it's that combination. So yeah, that kind of rounds up the artwork of what's what's behind me. Thank you for pointing that out. I'm always really interested because I have a lot of artwork that surrounds me. I'm going to just turn my camera right here. So I've got a very interesting piece right here. And I've got yeah, yeah, yeah, I've got poems and I've got pictures and I've got this crazy picture that I found here when I moved to Maine. You're gonna see my studio here. I don't know if I can turn this around. You can't really see it. Oh, there you can. This one right here. It says swing with a girl from Farmington, which is the area I'm from. And so my kids come in and they're like, what are they doing, dad? And I'm like, they're dancing. They're dancing. Don't worry about it. They're dancing. You can interpret so many different things. The picture was far away by the swing as in like, take a swing, have a go at swingers in swing dance or swingers and get a couple of partners and you know, have a little exchange. I mean, there's so many different, you know, I love the poetry as well and the philosophical as well. I mean, I love writing quotes that are a philosophical quote book and a poetry book. I think I've I'm going to bring out a couple more of those because I enjoy that kind of writing and surrounding myself with that kind of art. I think that's important. I'm just off camera as well as a library of books. I didn't read till I was about 48. I'm going to talk in books. And there's a great corpus of literature out there, particularly, I think, you know, there's some hidden gems and some obvious ones. And I love getting new ideas for books and exchanging ideas for books and reading. I think we learned so much from reading. Yeah, reading, but also conversations like this. I don't know that I think you and I have some very similar perspectives about life in general. We're going to get into that. But I also think there's a lot of differences like I don't consider myself necessarily an artistic person. I think if I were to consider myself on this spectrum, I would say I'm more pragmatic than artistic. And so I'm always very interested in getting other ideas and other concepts and other perspectives. And then what I found over the past six years is that I put myself in this box of being a man, I'm very pragmatic. I can swing a hammer. I can build things. And then I talk with gentlemen like yourself. And I think, okay, yeah, look, I'll be really frank with you, Greg. I used to make fun of the guys who did, you know, drama class in high school. And now that I look back on it, I'm like, words, did you call them? You may get in big trouble if you use. All right, I'm going to get in trouble. But I'm going to say it because this is important. I called them drama fags. Yeah. Yeah. And so but now I look at and think, maybe I actually would have enjoyed drama when I was in high school. If I was told, you know, I could have done that instead of being on the football team and being wrestling and being on the baseball team and priding myself on being this very athletic person, which there's value to, of course, there's value to being well rounded. I agree. And look, you know, it's commendable that you can, you know, and how refreshing we can actually talk about, you know, what words we used to use and how we used to behave at school. And when we were younger, I was, I was chatting with, I had an event with a guy yesterday, it'd be canceled by Google because he actually from Turkey. And he talked about how when he was younger, he really, he was anti-Semitic. And he had those thoughts. And he wrote a short story about that was almost a redemptive story. And then he lost his job and got canceled by Google, just for telling his redemptive story of how he used to be. So, you know, my, my story is kind of interesting in that, you know, I ended up going on to the stage, but at school, I was that jock. I mean, we don't use the word jock in England, but I was the, I was the captain of all the sports teams and, you know, won the trophies. And it was all about that. The field of sports saved me. I won't say that lightly. If it weren't for the grass and the sporting arena, if you will, I don't know what would have happened to me. And my two physical education teachers, Mr. Christian and Mr. Williams, who were amazing, taught us so much, not just about the tactics and the strategy and how to play games and how to be a team player, but really, really about discipline, you know, postponement gratification, you know, the, the, the importance of taking care and handling your business before you get to play. Right. Because we are getting to play a game. And I think there's, there's allegories that matter for, you know, the, the, this comparisons with, with our children, particularly we have boys and that, which we, you know, we, we have to learn that postponement gratification to take care, handle our business, do our work, and then have a bit of play time, you know, take a bit of time off, have a drink, have a cigar, whatever it may be that one does in one's recreation time. But sport was my lifesaver. I loved it, still do. I don't, I don't have the time to watch too much of it anymore, but I'm more of a player. I love, love playing sports. Yeah, I, I am very much in alignment with you with regards to sports. I played high school basketball and, and football and I wrestled and baseball and I had coaches and mentors coming to my life through the, the, the games that taught me about what it means to be a man. And I never really explored what I would say is more of the artistic side of things. So, I didn't know that about you. I just assumed it was always more of that artistic side. When did that change, when did you evolve for lack of a better term into expressing yourself through stage and performance, etc, etc. Well, yeah, I started at an early age. My interest was in, my mother was, was part of an amateur dramatic group and I started a group for kids in my hometown, my little village. So I joined that. So it was really outside of school. Not, not, not many people knew that I was doing it. There was a school drama group, but it was also connected with the, I think it was a very, very religious based, like the teacher who ran it was he, he ran the Christian education group and, and that didn't really appeal to me. I didn't want to do drama and learn about religion. And, and our school, I think was choices. We, we had to choose one or the other. And I think the choices you need to do drama or you do sport and sport was my love. So it's a very polarizing thing. Like you're either a jock or you're into drama and art and all that kind of stuff. Like there's no crossover. I will tell you, and I don't want to interject in what you're saying here, but we had one, one guy, one guy who he was a football player. He was an incredible football player, very good friend, close personal friend of mine. And he tried out for the school play and he got the part and everybody on the team made fun of them. Everybody on the football team made fun of them. And I made fun of them too, because you know, that was cool. But deep down inside, I was actually pretty inspired by that that he was willing to step out and put himself on stage and be uncomfortable and try new things and put himself out there. And interesting, the unadmintonous pretty inspired by that. They dualment and you wonder if you felt that however many other of the team and the members of the lads on your team felt more. And the tremendous amount of courage, I think, you know, Bren\u00e9 Brown talks about this, you know, vulnerability, you know, is courage personified. And the tremendous amount of courage that probably took for him to knowing, I'm sure he knew that he was going to get a little bit jibbering for a ribbing, as it's called, about doing that. And yeah, he still did. It reminds me of a great movie, Dead Poets Society. There's just so many wonderful lessons in that car paid DM, you know, still the day. And I think you seize the day. You hit on something here, which I think is, you know, it's about masculinity. What is as boys as we move through the systems, particularly our educational systems, you in the American system and me in the English educational system. One of the expectations that are put on us and placed on us by society, by our parents, our family of origin, what do we carry with us in terms of addictive behavior patterns, maybe inherited through our intergenerational DNA, which I don't think we can change. I think we can just become aware of. We can we can maybe influence the patterns of behavior and how we carry those through and how those early years affect what we do in the rest of our lives and how well we do it. And that self that self critiquing that message that we can we can we can say, I can do this. I can do anything. I talk to people who can't sing. And they say, oh, when I say people, they say they can't sing or they say they can't do something. Oh, I can't write poetry. Everyone can. Now, you may not be able to do it to up to a level where if you're comparing it to someone who's a professional, you know, but you can do it. Anyone can do anything they put their mind to. It's just a question of to what degree, what level, what we're comparing with. And it's everything's relative, isn't it? I like that word relative. You know, we we often compare ourselves to other people. And I fall into this trap, especially in the podcasting arena. I've been doing this for six years. And I thought to myself, you know, I want to be Joe Rogan or I want to be this guy or I want to be that guy. And these guys, you know, the more I get into it, the more I realize these like Joe Rogan, for example, you know, he spent 50 plus years in the public eye. Well, right. Do I have to think that just because I show up in the past five years, half decade, that I'm entitled to the to the same sort of results that he's been able to produce over decades and decades and decades of being in the public eye. It's very arrogant to believe that I'm entitled to something just because I want it. Yeah, I think the entitlement part of that is an interesting word. I think we can we can strive for success and we can use those, you know, yardsticks of people who inspire us or we aspire to. And I think a certain level of confidence or self-confidence, you know, that kind of brash internal monologue that says, yeah, I'm going to do this. I mean, I remember growing up, there was a couple of couple of teachers that I had. I didn't really have I had one, you know, who I would probably say was a mentor. But I couple of teachers who there's a Japanese world called Koyashi and Koyashi is someone who inspires you through negative, negative commentary or, you know, and these two teachers, they just came at me and they pounded me. Now, what happened was it wasn't like, you know, perhaps in, you know, in the military, where it's like grounding discipline into you through really tough, hard love quote unquote. They'd inspired me when I heard them both say, you know, you can't do this. You're not good enough. And I was just, I just remember always saying to myself, you watch me. Yeah, you think you went, you bet. I mean, it's say out loud, but it was internally, I was like, that was my internal kind of drive system that motivated amplified me to a degree in internal self-confidence to go, Oh, I'm doing this. And then it became about not about I'm doing this to show them. It was like, I'm doing this because I'm going to prove to me that I can achieve this goal and this purpose. And I think it's really important to have those goals and those those what sense of purpose and admission. And, you know, circling back to what you said, Ryan, about, you know, the differences between the artists, perhaps, you know, I'm an auto-dydact. So I'm self-taught really through experience. So I've learned my own kind of routines and schedules and habits and practices. You know, I talk about the craft in process, which, you know, if you, if it's a military endeavor, then there is going to be a strategy. There is going to be a plan. And you have to train and rehearse. The same is true if you're doing a musical or a show or a play, you know, there is a craft in process. It's probably more of an individual or starts from an individual place in terms of line learning and character breakdown and how you then immerse yourself in the rehearsal experience. And then there is the performance. And one doesn't know one can believe one's going to be successful, whatever we're using is a metric for success. But, you know, I think that's where I go to in art is the art in flow, really. It's that it's practicing, activating creative flow states, how to let go. So the imagination can effortlessly take over. And that's a trust in itself. That's to the degree where everything else dissipates. You become one almost like creator and universe, you know, it's that omniscience or oneness of being actively in the zone, you know, like, like Michael Jordan or a sport, you know, sports star who just in the zone isn't thinking. It's all reactive activity and trust. Love it. I love it. I mean, it's powerful. I think about the word that I choose to use to describe what I think you just said there is presence. You know, you're fully present. I'm fully present in this conversation. I'm not thinking about what my kids are doing. I'm not thinking about what bills I need to pay. I'm not thinking about what exercise I did or didn't do. I'm here. I'm with you. I'm present. I'm fully available. You know, one of the things though that I liked what you said is this, did you say koyashi or koyashi? How did you answer? Yeah, I think it's k-u-y-a-s-h-i and it may be i-i. Yeah, I'm going to look at that. I'm going to look at that. But you know, as I was going through that, and I don't like to swear on this podcast, I really don't. I try to keep my language on the up and up. But I think there's some mentality in men that if they embraced more, they'd be more successful. And at the risk of squaring here and offending some people, the mentality is fuck off. And what I mean by that is like, you don't think I can do it? F off, let me show you that I can do it. And I don't think generally women have that same mentality. I think they're more relational. I think they're more community-based, but men are inspired by challenge. Greg, you don't think I can do that? Let me show you. I can do that. And don't we even do that as friends? Like, hey, I bet I can do two flips and you can only do one. I bet I can jump 10 feet and you can only jump eight. And that F off mentality is popular culture in society would tell us that's not civil. And yet I think men thrive under that situation. I think that striving to be competitive, to do better. And yeah, I mean, I hear a lot that the F off or F you, which I think is really in that regard and that context, F you, I'm going to jump higher than you. I'm going to beat you. And that physical, competitive spirit that is, you know, it's there with women too, but I think it is more. I remember I read about this, the study that was done by Nikki Crick, who I think was a Minnesota psychology professor. And she talked about it was actually about violence and behavior, and the differences between men and women, and how men move to physical violence a lot faster. But that violence gets done faster too. So you want to go out, go out, go, boop, boop, boop, boop. And then like, and then three minutes later, you could be in the bar having a drink, you know, best of friends. Whereas women move to a form of relational behavioral intimidation or conflict, if you will, that she calls reputation savaging. So it's word of mouth. It's subtle. It's more of the, it's the gossip. It's the talking about the other person. And one thing about the groups at school, you know, for me, the boys, you know, there'd always be the flare ups and every day after school at the end of our street, which was a cul-de-sac, there was, there was always a fight. It was like literally who was going to fight today? It's at Choggsy against Catesy is it, you know, bulger against them, Cauvey. And there was always, there was a brick wall, and we'd always sit there. It's like the small gladiatorial arena for kids. And it was brutal sometimes. Whereas I think the groups of girls maybe, if we go by Nikki Crick's study, they were, you know, in their clicks and talking about each other in a fair, which can be just as painful and harmful. And maybe that's why men, you know, I don't know, we tend not to talk about our, I mean, this has talked about a lot these days, talk about our feelings. I think we fall victim to the canard that we can't, we have to be stoic, we have to man up, we have to be tough and tough at our, and I think there's real value to that. I do think we've lost a sense of the shulvaric, the gallantry of being a gentleman, remembering the word gentle in the word man, particularly when we're with women and dealing with children and girls and mothers and grandmothers and whatnot. But that sense that we can pair that with speaking with other men in particular about what we're feeling, what we're going through in a way that doesn't demean shame when men can be vulnerable, I think together and say, you know, God, man, I'm having a hard time today. I'm really sad that it's, you know, it's getting to me. I don't know what to do. And seek out a bit of mentorship. I think we've lost a lot of, I talk about the ships with my charity, Children, Parents United, allyships, friendships, relationships and mentorships. I think we need more of that mythopoetic in our society, particularly with the breakdown, as I see it, as the traditional family unit and the encouragement of vilifying or devaluing the male in the conversation in society, particularly the last few years, you know, toxic masculinity, all men bad, you know, believe all with all of that. I think we need to have a me to dialogue, not just a me to monologue. Good point. I want to shift gears into that in a minute, but I want to share an insight that I had last night because it's in alignment with what you're talking about here. I was, I was training Jiu Jitsu with, with somebody. His name is Keegan and he's young, he's 18 years old about ready to go to college and play the cross down in Massachusetts. And, you know, so we were training and he's younger than me and he's actually, frankly, less experienced than me in the world of Jiu Jitsu. And last night he got the better of me. And at first I was like, damn, I shouldn't have let him get the better of me. And I still believe that. But also, I was proud of him too. You know, now I, so we were training and he got the better of me and I had a tab because he submitted me. And, you know, there's just something about it where I just think, I just think more highly of them because he did that. You know, we didn't in a controlled environment, we had rules, some spoken, some unspoken rules about how we train together. And I just think more highly of him because he because he got the better of me. And not only do I think more highly of them, I also think more highly of myself because I was willing to put myself in the arena. But then I realized, okay, well, you know, like he got me. So what do I need to do to learn to get better to improve? And I think, again, generally speaking, women don't operate like this, but men do. And yet we don't create these environments. You use the word vulnerability. I've always been very hesitant to use that word because I think what popular culture interprets that as is just, you know, exposing all your weaknesses for the sake of exposing your weaknesses. I don't think that's the case. Same thing with safe spaces. No, what we want to do is we want to create environments where we can be real and truthful and work hard and push and challenge each other. But that's not what popular culture says. And I think it's a real detriment to society. Yeah, vulnerability is not and safe spaces. Safe spaces isn't a space to be vulnerable. Vulnerability is terrifying. It's particularly for men, it's terrifying. And to your point about, you know, you're, the jujitsu, I think, you know, you thought more highly of him because he thought more highly of himself because he'd beaten his mentor in that moment, which he knew that you appreciated. He knew it was real as well. You didn't just give him the victory. No, I never would. You know, it was authentic. So with that shared communal appreciation that lifted his spirits, and he now believes that he can beat you the next time. Now, the next time it's probably likely on percentages, he's not going to take you down. He's going to be the one that submits. But that lingering memory that he can do it because he's done it, he's experienced it, is really vital and really important. And, and I think that there's a lot of merit to that. And we're losing a lot of the meritocracy, particularly right now in our society with, in general, with helicopter parenting, with academia going, or all about, you know, I just saw a report the other day about English grades, you know, in higher education and how everyone's getting A's. Like literally everyone is getting A's. So they're now looking at the tests, finally, because after years they've made them so easy that everyone's getting A's to make them harder and to reset them. So why did you reset them in the first place? You know, we have to have an earned system of merit. You don't get the stripes on your on your on your on your chest or on your badge on your shoulder. They're earned. They're not given. And then you have a real sense of appreciation and accomplishment, I think, and accomplishing something is, you know, particularly in that world of jujitsu, which is, you know, it reminds me of that transmogrification that Jordan Hall talks about, that kind of you you actually become one with the other in terms of flow. So you're not fighting an opponent. You're kind of you're having to work with the energy in the space of their moves, activity, reactivity, it's sort of like a dance and a lot of choreography. I would imagine he says not knowing anything about jujitsu. I don't I'm not familiar. Did you say Jordan Hall? Yeah, he talks about anti fragility and transmogrification. So it's if you consider robustness, so that's the like the ability to resist a force while being what and where and how one is. So if I'm standing in front of you and you shove me really hard, I'm robust. So I remain unmoved. I mean, I may just falter a bit. So that's energy versus energy. And then resilience, if you consider resilience, the ability to respond to some force, your force, if you shove me out to what and how and where before the force was applied. So if you're standing in front of me and you shove me, if I'm resilient, I can return and I buckle up. I can return to the original position and disposition, right? Energy versus energy because energy is, you know, that emotional energy, if you will. So I'm back to my original disposition. Now, consider anti fragility. This time, when you shove me, I invent aikido or jujitsu. That's transmogrification is why I'm getting it. Yeah, no, it's interesting. I mean, I think about it, even when I go to class on just this micro scale of like, I'm not going to allow another man to exert his will upon me. And sometimes that means I need to resist. Sometimes that means that means I need to flow or transfer the energy. But one of the things that you said is you talked about this concept of competition. And I've thought about a lot about this lately. If you look at a football game, for example, or soccer or baseball or pick your sport, we tend to think of it in terms of competition. I'm competing against you. But really, if you scale back, it's actually, it's not really competition. It's more cooperation, because Greg, if you and I are going to compete against each other in whatever arena, well, we believe so much in the concept of cooperation that will actually bring a third party in and ensure that we abide by the rules. Right. So it's not like a referee or a referee or an umpire or whatever. Right. So we brings, we believe so much in cooperation and adherence to the rules that we agree upon that we're going to bring a third party in. And we're going to allow him to administer and make sure that we're following the rules. Like, I've agreed to that, you've agreed to that. And so it's not so much competition as much as it is cooperation. We're going to work together to improve ourselves. And today, you know, you might get the better of me. Tomorrow, I might get the better of you, but it's within a certain confined, it's within certain constraints that we've mutually agreed upon so that we can improve ourselves, not just compete against each other and prove who's the best, but how can I get better? Because Greg bested me or I bested you, etc, etc. Yeah, that makes me think of, you know, that cooperation or the rules setting and the standards and practices before you enter the pitch, that reminds me again, the parallel with the crafting process, the strategy, the planning, well, it has to be done in an orderly fashion that has to be made in and solve the rules. If they're evolving, if they're found to not work, or if it's a particular game in sport, like you mentioned, soccer, the rules of offside are always evolving and always being questioned. But once you're on the pitch, once you're on the field of play, there is an inherent understanding, I guess is where you're getting to, of cooperation in that we trust that each of us are going to abide by the rules and people will push the rules, they will break the rules if it's a boxing match, someone might bite in the air, someone might break someone's leg and attack all law, but there has to be that cooperation. I think about the pick up games that I played at soccer and that when we don't have a referee, we have to abide by a kind of cooperation in flux, if you will, because there isn't a linesman or referees assistant or referee to provide us with a whistle or to let us know that the rules have been transressed. But don't even check ourselves in that situation. Let's just take a pick up game of basketball or soccer or whatever it is. Like, even just a no holds barred pick up game, like street rules, there's still a line. Oh yeah. It's oftentimes it's unspoken, but there's still a line. And if somebody crosses it, everybody else says, bro, like you cross the line, like that's too much. And so we all hold each other accountable and hold each other and check, even if there's not some third party referee. Yeah. And what's interesting about that is personalities and character, who does the checking in the game? You know, is it the best player? Is it the most vocal? Is the most liked person, the most generally the guy who gets along with everyone? And what if there's someone who just does not agree? You know, the individual playing is like, you know, no, no, and it's and it's combative. That can take the game to a whole new level. But yeah, there is, there is something to the cooperation of competition and the strategy and the tactics and the rules and the playbook. And if you were by the rules, you know, it reminds me of Augustine of Hyponensis, who's an old philosopher. And he talked about war theory, just war theory is what it was called. And it was, it was, there was two concepts to it. It was the right to go to war and the right conduct in war, like moral responsibility. And I think that's what we're referring to when we talk about behavior on the field of play, particularly if there isn't a referee or an umpire and we're trusting ourselves in a pickup game, if you will, that has to be the right conduct. And that's a shared responsibility, I think. So to go back to who gets to determine the rules or who gets to enforce the rules, I you said, is it the most likable person, the most popular person, etc, etc. I think it's the most influential person. It's, it's, it might be the most assertive person. And that is an element of influence, right? Somebody who's asserted, for example, might be more influential. Somebody who's likable might be more influential. Somebody who's stronger physically might be more influential. But I think if we're to scale back and say, what is it really that that that men are looking to and who gets to enforce the rules, that's the most influential individual? And there's a lot of factors that go into that level of influence. Yeah, I think as well as, you know, the site, you know, is it the most quiet and silent person who's pragmatic and is more of a diplomat, the peacekeeper, because different situations call for different character traits, right? Sure. Certain people are going to have that more. I mean, the team analogy, you know, with, with the, you know, I, I automatically go to soccer and I think of the guy dribbles the ball. Well, that takes a tremendous amount of skill of the ball being of, then there's the big tool center forward who can head the ball, who can shoot from 40 yards and score. There's the free kick playmaker. There's, there's so many different aspects that go up to making the team. But yeah, that's a really interesting point you made about the different character traits that will, that will bring people together and at least find a commonality so that the game can keep going and progressing and moving forward in a positive way because sports is extremely enjoyable, very positive, sometimes challenging, sometimes extremely disappointing if we lose or our team loses. But wow, we feel the disappointment because there is such reward at winning the trophy and winning the game. It's the, you know, the ying yang, the push and pull the, we need that other to appreciate self. I'd look, I will say as a genuine American that I don't know that I relate to your, your soccer analogies as well as maybe I could or football analogies as you would call them. But I think we're in agreement with that for sure. That's an in genuine American. We can talk, we can talk about American football and ask it more to a message degree or hockey or, I mean, like, you know, Americans sports when I first, I mean, I first started watching American football years ago and the first thing I noticed was, wow, there's three teams playing on one team and then they go, these specialists and, you know, they all have like a long snapper. I'm like, is there a short snapper? You need so many different things. Special teams are like special, what makes them special? A special team within the team and then you can be on one particular team and play on another team. So you versatile, you can be a triple threat, if you will. So yeah, American sports is fascinating. I love American sports. I'll talk sports for hours. And vice versa, man, vice versa. If we just let go of our ego and pride, just a little bit, not too much, not too much, maintain some of that, but just a little bit, then we might be able to learn from some different cultures that are available to us. Yeah. And yeah, and similar, you just took me back to when I was 11 years old, playing on my soccer team or football team. And we were the best team in the league. And we got to the cup final, which everyone plays in the, you know, knock out stage, then you get to the final. And we were playing a team we'd beaten in the regular season, as you would call it in America. I think 11-0 and we became complacent and I would say I'd already picked up the trophy in my mind. And we lost one nil. We lost the league final. And that stayed with me for the rest of my life. That team was called Southport Amateurs, ironically. And that experience stayed with me. And then a friend of mine played professional tennis. His first Wimbledon tournament, he was playing a legendary play called Ivan Lindel. And I think it was the quarter finals. And he had three match points and he lost all three match points. And I remember asking, he did, after he did the press conference, I said, what happened? Three match points, he said, in my mind, I'd already won. As I was waiting to receive the ball, I was thinking about what I'd say at the press conference. I was thinking about who I might play in the next round in the semifinals. And I got ahead of myself. So I think that's a reminder as well to not get ahead of yourself, keep a little bit of humility. Yeah, beating once in a while, even though you don't plan on it by your 18 year old that you're mentoring in jujitsu. And, you know, tap yourself out. Oh, hang on a second. Let's have a word here. Look in the mirror. I'm not as great as I thought I was. I feel great. But I can still be great. But I'm not as great as always yesterday. I'm not getting any younger. Well, there's a weird thing in society today that says that you ought to feel good about your performance, regardless of how you performed. Right? Like, oh, you should just in the body positive moment, you should just be happy. You should be, you should embrace who you are. And it's like, you know, I hear that. And I think to be happy with you, who you are, doesn't mean be satisfied with less than you're capable of. And I think that's how a lot of people in modern society have interpreted it. I'm not as good as I could be. I could be. I could do these things. And I could be this, but I'm not going to do those things. So why don't I just embrace and be satisfied with where I currently am? Yeah, I think, um, look, maybe we replace happy with fulfilled. I like that word. That that is actually, I'm glad you said that. That is my word of, I don't like happy. Because I don't want to be happy. I want to be fulfilled. Happiness is the absence of conflict and strife and challenge. Fulfillment is the ability to deal with it effectively. Exactly. And I think it takes, um, it takes a little for psychological or philosophical work in terms of stoicism, um, to, to work through those moments. So if someone says, Oh, just, you just be happy with the weight that you are. Well, you can't tell someone or instruct someone to be happy. Um, happiness is fleeting. Um, and what does one know anyway? I mean, not getting too philosophical, but wisdom is knowing I am nothing. Uh, love is, is, is knowing I am everything. And in between the two, my life moves and it moves on a scale of which sometimes I can influence and other times I just have to surrender to and let go. And that sense of fulfillment, uh, how do I feel fulfilled? Um, can I find meaning? You know, I define meaning as everything happens for a reason we make up afterwards. And it's the week we make up afterwards part that's important. Um, purpose. Um, I think there's a crisis of meaning right now, particularly with, with, um, younger generations, particularly younger generations of boys. Um, because of the messaging that's being, that's being put out there because of our educational system that doesn't have, um, boy centric books, uh, boys need their imaginations to be sparked that's reduced, recessed time. Um, boys needs to be all go out and play. I mean, good grief. I think back to my school is if I wasn't able to go out and play, I, I'd have been in a terrible state. You know, we're supposed to send a kinetic, kinetic, frenetic energy of boys. It's just bubbling over. So sit still. We're still telling someone to calm down. That's the last thing we should tell someone who's feeling anxious or upset. And this notion that everyone gets a trophy. Everyone's a winner. I'm reminded of when I first, um, coached, uh, my, my oldest boy was five at the time, AOSO soccer and, um, Romeo Beckham, David Beckham, some was on the team as well. And at the time, David was the captain of England and Romeo went down in a tackle. And they're five years old. And it was this very, very bizarre coaching, um, soccer or 40 in a mirror, I have to tell you, because there's a lot of, you know, random, pointless yelling things from the sidelines, from parents. Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, and I don't know. The speech. That was me, by the way, if you hear it was me yelling from the sidelines, I guarantee you as me. Anyways, proceed. Well, I get it. I get, I get the enthusiasm. But what I, you know, when I spoke to my parents, the parents, the parents, the, the kids that I was coaching at the start of the season, every season was, look, your kids are just going to hear mindless screaming. So, you know, just simmer it down. Maybe, maybe if there's a goal or something to cheer or a poor, that it'd be great to hear that rush of excitement or vocal excitement then. And, you know, it's okay to clap at the other team or another player on the other team or anyone has a, does a great move or scores a great goal. But just one droning monotonous, it's kind of pointless. I forget that. Oh, yes, to Romeo Beckham. So he goes down and, you know, most of the parents will, oh, gosh, who was that usual? And I think mums have that more than dads as well. It's the nurturing of the mother and the matriarch compared to the risk reward of the patriarch. If you, if I'm allowed to even use the word patriarch, these guys are loud here. You're loud here. I can't you. And, and, and I, you know, I looked at David, who's his dad? And David just turned to me, went, he's all right, he'll run it off. All right. And the game continued. And sure enough, Romeo was on the floor. It was his knee kind of stroked. And then he got up, looked to the sidelines, that gave him a nod, like you're all right, some kind of look. And on with the game, he went, and that's the school of hard knocks. And we don't, we don't seem to be nurturing that these days, particularly in, in schools in our educational system. And, and I worry about our younger generations of boys because of that. That's not to say that, you know, I want everyone to experience what I had at school, which was, you know, I got, I got three attacked three times on my first day of high school. One was a sucker punch from behind as well. So it was a real kind of, you know, baptism of fire and survival in a very physical way. But in a way that kind of taught me, you know, I had to learn quick, the school of hard knocks. And when you get out there in the big, bad world, it's, it's not all safe spaces and feeling realms and, you know, everyone wins a trophy. You got to earn it. And there'll be disappointments and suffering and hard knocks. Many of them. And how you respond to that, I think is vital. Men, let me hit the pause button, the timeout button on the conversation with Greg and I real quick, each month, we cover a different topic inside of our exclusive brotherhood, the Iron Council. And for the month of September, we're going to be covering the concept of creating your new reality. And we're going to be using the book, the four agreements as our book of the month. So when you join the Iron Council, not only will you have access to the tools and resources and information that we make available, but you're also going to have access to the camaraderie and accountability and brotherhood that only comes, that only come from men who are banded together in the same mission. And that's all what we're doing here inside the Iron Council. So if you're ready to stop doing life alone and want to connect with over 900 now other high achieving motivated, ambitious men, then join us inside the Iron Council and immediately unlock access to everything you need to take your life to the next level. You can do that at order of man.com slash Iron Council. Again, that's order of man.com slash Iron Council. Do that right after the conversation. For now, I'll get back to it with Greg. You know, it's interesting you bring this up because there's this, there's this fascinating dichotomy between the masculine and the feminine, right? So when my child, for example, and I've got four kids, will fall off their bike. I've got my five year old who is the last to learn how to ride a bike. And he crashes, my wife will run to him and pick him up and quite literally kiss his knee and make sure he's okay. And I will not do that. In fact, I'm repulsed by that. And I will say, get your ass up. You're okay. Both of us, by the way, here's the interesting thing. Both of us are exhibiting love. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Like there's, but there's love in both responses. I say, get back up, get on, wipe off the pebbles and the dirt in your knee and get back on to my wife says, let me kiss your boo boo. Both are love. This is why it's so important that we have the feminine and the masculine working together to help raise our children the way they need to be raised. I completely agree. I mean, if you look at all the data and all the statistics and all the evidence out there, children who are raised with biological mother and biological father have a better chance in nearly every metric, well, every metric in life. And, you know, when you, the difference, I think when you talk about the differences between mothering and fathering, okay, so fatherhood, I think, is vital for boys in many regards, not least of which, what I mentioned earlier, postponement gratification. So, so that boys can become self competent at being able to discern between the tasks they need to complete, whether it be homework or whatever else or chores, before doing the things they want to do. And if you think of that as an internal risk reward value system, if you will, that you're instilling in your children or your child or your boy or whatever, as they're growing, that's kind of like the the right of passage, if you will, of some of the that that internal financial belief system or principles. And I think when fathers are engaged with with their sons, there is that that is the major difference for me is that mom will nurture in terms of bringing in close to breast and tending to, are you okay and tend to the wound and make sure that tears are dried and whereas dad, and I think this is necessary, will will kind of be that the nature of the patriarch and the father is to push more of that risk reward like yeah, get up in the trees, let's climb the brat and do it together. And if you fall, you know, you might break an arm, you might break a leg, but all men, you know, we have to have that risk reward. And and I think that I've seen waning in recent years. And when boundaries are important to, I mean, you know, when boys girls and boys, you know, we all need, you know, talked about vulnerability earlier on, it's no good just spilling all of your vulnerable self out. You have to have boundaries and know the difference between privacy and secrets and emotional boundaries, intellectual boundaries, physical boundaries, all of the different forms of boundaries. And why do boys need to learn boundaries? Well, because they experience that they can't manipulate a better deal with dad. I think they kids love to play mom and dad off against each other. And mom because of the nurturing aspect, well, I'm speaking generally here, will may give in whereas dad, you know, it's harder that you know, dads, I think, you know, coming together with with mom to instill some form of discipline and parental influence in a very masculine way. And I do think that boys who who are raised either predominantly by dads or at least equally with with moms become more purpose driven, more goal oriented. They're able to discern the needs from their wants and are less likely to have challenges on focus because purpose and goals and missions need focus and refocusing. And yeah, roughhousing as well. I mean, I think about roughhousing and the that physical nature. I think that's a vital experience for boys to learn about healthy boundaries. So it engenders that sense of empathy of self and other for you know, if you're roughhousing as a little boy with another lad and you go too far, you overstep the boundary, the you experience the tears or the upset or the anger or the retribution from the other boy. And I think I think children, particularly boys who learn more of that at a young age or at least go through that with with dads present, much more likely as they get older to have friends and less like likely to become depressed and withdrawn. And that requires competitiveness. It requires the assertiveness. It requires physical aggression. It requires because it's fun. And that's dad star parenting, I think, and guiding boys through that disciplined experience. I think it's a necessary component in balancing the psyche of the young male and stills a sense of agency and sovereignty. And and helps create that value system that's healthy and more balanced, well balanced with with the nurturing aspects that I think we men have to have too that maybe perhaps come more from MOB is in the matriarch and that more assertive, I'm a leader, I'm going to take risks and be successful quote unquote that comes from the the patriarch. I'm really glad that you're talking about this concept of of balance here because I think that there is this interesting phenomenon and I've experienced over the past six years because of the work I do and I have a lot of women who listen to this podcast who will message me and say, well, you know, women can be strong too. And they can. And they can. And exactly. And and and what I share and what you share and what we talk about as men and fathers and and and males who want to lift up our future generations isn't at odds with what femininity is. It isn't at odds with like this is not a competition. I think my wife is one of the strongest women I know that said she doesn't raise our kids the way that I raise my kids. And it's important that our children have strength from both the feminine and masculine. And they're not going to get a whole lot of empathy and kindness and compassion necessarily from me relative to what they're going to get from their mother. But neither one of them means that one of us is less weak or excuse me less strong and more weak. It just means that we're coming at it from a different angle. And I'm really discouraged about general society in that women have generally been conditioned to believe through this feminist movement over the past 40 years that you need to behave like men in order to be equal. No, you don't at all. You need to be women. You need to be strong and assertive and nurturing and supportive and motherly and and ladylike. And there's a level of strength that comes with that too. You don't need to be a man to be strong. I absolutely agree with you. I think the conversation about feminism, I've mentioned this before feminism, we don't talk about the balance of masculism a lot. And when we do when men do, we may be charged like you've experienced with the group. Well, women can be too well. Okay, no one's saying that right now. We're talking about men. Okay. As women we'll talk about women and women will talk about being women with other women. So we can have those those singular conversations with men and women and we can come together in a coed conversation just like sports. That's not a problem. And talking about these issues, it doesn't need to be done in a silo and it doesn't need to be done without nuance. So feminism, you talked about feminism the last 40 years. I believe it's important to talk about, you know, the different forms or schools of feminism. So there's equality feminism or factual feminism or what Helen Pluckrose likes to call empowerment feminism. And that is noble. I agree with that. That's that's a really strong brand or form or ideology of feminism that I get behind. I stand behind. I'm championing women. In all its different forms, it's the other side, the other break off branch of femme, third and fourth wave feminism where it is the extreme side of things. That's right. The post modern progressive extreme feminism that wants to diminish the father and the male that wants to say everything is extreme. Believe all women, not not listen to women that says, you know, that doesn't believe in the value of the father, that doesn't believe that women should stay home, have agency if they want to and be a homemaker or a housewife, as it used to be called in England. And doesn't believe it's an individual choice for a woman because we've fought so hard over the years to get the vote and get this and get that. Well, that's great. But ultimately, it's an individual choice, just like it is for individual men and individual women. And, you know, that's the partnership and the union of a marriage or a partnership in making those determinations decisions together and finding out a plan, a strategy that works for you and actually illuminates and really challenges and inspires and brings out the best of both because that's really what we want, isn't it? We don't want to be discouraging men. What a discouraging message. I mean, you know, women can be that too. Well, yeah, okay, they can, but right for them, should they? Should they? Should they? Well, you know, maybe that's a conversation for, you know, I'm not a woman. So I can comment on what I think about individual women. But I'm a man, you know, and I have two boys, two sons. So that's, that's, you know, really my, my experience and what I can really genuinely speak to and I can, I can explore and try and get some data and some research, you know, like particularly with, you know, when we hear all this messaging of, of, you know, toxic masculinity and smash the patriarchy and etc, etc. And all this signaling to the boys and we're doing away with the meritocracy and it's about equity of outcomes rather than equity or equality of opportunity. And I think masculinity to a degree is and has been targeted recently in fatherhood, I think lies in the bullseye. I think, you know, as a society, we've rightly opened up the institution of family and what that means to be more inclusive. You know, but I think the traditional role of a family patriarch has been severely denigrated, you know, for 30 years, the virtuous and binding thread that fathers have served as in our healthy western society as increasingly being pulled out of the modern tapestry thanks to this consistent drum beat of these third and fourth wave quote unquote modern feminists, pop culture stereotypes and probably the biggest culprit is our family law system. So yeah, having a nuanced conversation that that talks about the differences between feminism and the masculinism and then if we're focusing on feminism, the different kinds of feminism, historically how it evolved, what an individual thinks about that so much these days are here, you know, quite frankly, sexist language on one side, always man's planning. Well, okay, all right, so that's a man who's explaining something in a male way that's very stereotypical, very general and also quite negative. You know, should we have unsplaining, you know, we have toxic masculinity, should we have talked, I mean, equality should mean we talk about both, but I don't think, you know, demonizing man is not the solution. That's the problem. Period. Like what, what more can I say to that? I think you're completely right, you know, if we were to think about our conversation that we had earlier with with sports, you know, let's take American football, for example, a football player might think is a tight end that, well, you know, like I can block, I can snap a football. Yeah, sure. Nobody's, nobody's saying you can't. We're just, we're just questioning whether or not you should, whether or not maybe your attributes and your skill set and your, your qualities might be better served as a tight end, or a wide receiver or running back or a linebacker or a cornerback. It's not about whether or not you can. It's about whether or not your attributes and some of those that are inherent and some of those are developed, but whether or not your attributes could be used in better situations. And so I look at my wife and I think my wife is lovely. She's beautiful. And that's not just her physical presence. It's her emotional and spiritual presence. She's beautiful. And so should she be the one to tell my son, hey, suck it up. Be a man. No, she could say that. But she shouldn't be the one who says that. I should be the one who says that. And there's some situations like we hear these things about traditional gender roles of like, well, you know, traditional, they're outdated. Well, no, they're actually not outdated. They're, they're biological constructs. And they're supported societally because they work. And only until the relative ease of modernity, have we even been able to have the luxury of calling into question what quote unquote traditional gender roles are? It's a good it's a nice luxury, but it's going to create its own set of problems. Well, I think that's what we're seeing, you know, it's not that it's outdated. These traditional roles aren't outdated. They evolve. You know, it's like science. It's emergent truths that evolve over time when we test push back. We have dialectic, we have a thesis. And anti thesis. And then we get to the synthesis, but we don't stop at the synthesis of where we arrive at with the emergent truth. We keep asking, we keep questioning and questing for better questions. I mean, that's really where it's out for me, I think, is asking the meaningful questions of the answers that we receive. And how we can be fulfilled, how we can be more. And that I think is the fulfillment of wisdom, right? So it's a bit of an abstract term, but the concept of wisdom, you know, isn't that mysterious? Being wise, you know, attempting to live and die well is as good as leading, I guess, when I say leading, I don't mean you're leading other people, but you're leading as good a life as possible within the troubled conditions of existence. And they are troubled. And the goal of wisdom, I think, is fulfillment and how we can get there. And it's not that she your wife shouldn't be saying this, or you should shouldn't be saying this. You typically find that naturally she's not going to and you are. That's just the differences. There are innate inherent differences biologically. And it's become a little confused and confusing. As we've, and in a lot of respects, rightfully and positively evolved the gender roles. But I think we have to keep having that conversation and participation within that. That doesn't say all x is bad and all y is bad. And, you know, agree to be disagreeable at times. And really look at what the data is telling us, what the research is telling us, what are personal experiences, informers of. And, you know, talking about boys in school and college, I mean, you just have to look at the data. 60% of college undergraduate degrees are earned by women. Brilliant. Like you can champion the women who great. Of course. Then we can still go, okay. So boys, boys are lagging behind an education. 37% more women goes graduate school. 52% of doctorates are earned by women. And on top of those numbers like that, we're going to boys are hearing these messages that they're toxic day in day out. And we really have to, you know, if women and mothers can champion girls and daughters, then we can champion boys, a father's mentors, right? I mean, that's okay to have that conversation. In fact, it's not okay. It's necessary. It's really necessary. You know, you use the word confusing. It's confusing. But like, I don't know if it is. I really don't think it is. I don't think it's confusing for a man who is listening to his podcast, or even a man who doesn't listen to this podcast to know inherently and instinctively what he should be doing. I don't think it's inherently confusing for a woman who wants to be a great mother, who wants to be a great woman, who wants to be strong, who wants to raise their kids in righteousness. I don't think it's that confusing. And yet we're bombarded with these messages from social media and from pop culture who say, you're not good enough, you're not doing it right, you're not doing this, you're not doing that, you're not as good as a woman, you're not as good as a man. We have to reject these ideas because that's what confuses and conflates the situation. Yeah, I think we have to amplify the voices of the quote unquote good man, the good fathers, the strong mentors, the leaders, the quiet ones, the local heroes, all of the builders, the laborers, the, you know, all of that. But we also as well have to have to empower and champion the voices, those noble equality feminists, factual feminists, empowerment feminists who want the best for women, but not at the expense of men. I like it. Oh, boys, right. So really championing those sets of people and calling out sometimes, you know, I was reticent to do this for quite a while, you know, I kept hearing toxic masculinity. Well, the answer isn't to just fight fire with fire and talk. Why aren't we talking about toxic femininity and cornmeal? Once in a while, we do need to push back. We do need to push back on this, this narrative and the misinterpretation of individual stories, whether it be in mainstream media or as I call it, antisocial media and stand up, speak out, particularly in this cancel culture that has this public opinion of guilty to approve and more guilty and say, no, you know, and speak off of people strangers and people in academia and sports people are in many different walks of life because eventually it's common for you, you know, identity politics eventually devours itself, but it's going to, you know, it's going to and has been, you know, grabbing a lot of people on the way and and having a little bit of, you know, moral fiber, I think, to challenge the moral hypocrisy of our times. There's so much moral hypocrisy out there. And who's leading the conversation? Why are we talking about this again day after day after day? Why are you forcing me to see things through a lens, your prism, which is negatively negative kaleidoscope, if you will, of darkness and the worst in humanity. And people say what they hate and what they stand against. And rather than, what do you love? What do you stand for? And, you know, at times I will call out, particularly people who make false allegations. I think we have, I think victimhood has become the new social currency. The economy is booming. And I think we need to get back to a little bit more of self-reliance and personal responsibility. And the more we can take on, the more we can lean into that portal of responsibility, better. And I think it's an early age learned experience, particularly again with boys and men who we need the assertiveness and that aggressiveness and that physicality, fighting wars, going into burning buildings. I don't care who it is in terms of quote unquote equality. If I'm, you know, if I'm lying in a burning building, I just want them the strongest, most courageous person to come and get me. And my God, I mean, don't we all when it comes to it? Nice to see you. Right. I mean, I watched this video the other day and it was, you know, a little meme or whatever video and some, some female trainer had, had her, she was an alligator trainer. No way. I understood it. And she got her arm bitten by an alligator and he was doing that alligator death roll or whatever. I can't imagine what was going through her mind is like, Oh, no, no, no, I don't want to be rescued by a man. Like, I just want to be rescued. I don't care who it is. Not quite as dangerous or rescuing, but you know, I've got on a plane a couple of times and I'm always wanting to be looking at this, you know, as someone who's who's not as physically strong together, those bags in the overhead compartment could be pretty heavy. And so I'm always, you know, I'm going to look at to offer and help out. And I, you know, I think that's being a gentleman. But this one first I read out, obviously, can I can I help you with that? Excuse me, do you need a hand with that? I don't need help from a man. Well, hang on. Are there any I want to call out to the, you know, get on the intercom. If there are any ladies 175 pounds, I really work out in good physical condition, please come to the front and help with this. So that's what has come down the sector. I'm probably a misogynist for offering the help, you know, I can't believe you. I can't believe it's the same thing with the door is like, I don't open a door because I think a woman is incapable. I just open a door because I think it's a risk. By the way, I also open doors for men. I don't exclusively open the door for women. Like, right. Staying in a table when I'm at, you know, I'm at the dinner table. I stand when a woman stands or comes back to sit and that's that's learned behavior. I didn't learn all that growing up. That's something that I chose to reinsti or instill in myself. And you know, I've been laughed at. I mean, I stood at the table. I've had to say, you know, a guy, there's been a lot of couples and a guy, what are you doing? I'm just standing as a market respect for the late just respond. Oh, really making us all look, look bad. And like, I'm not, no, there's no judgment on you whatsoever. This is just a personal choice. And, and there really wasn't, you know, it's not. I'm not going to apologize for your uncomfortability. As you try to slay me with a whip covered put down in front of everyone at the table. I'm just going to stay my course. Do what I do walking on the, you know, on the traffic side of the street when with a lady on the inside. I mean, these are, these are things to me that are like, you know, obvious, but they're not off. They weren't obvious to me, go on because I didn't know about them. Yeah. Well, and also they shouldn't be, you know, I was walking with my daughter and she was, we were in the parking lot of Walmart. And my daughter's, she's, she's going to be eight years old. And I said, Hey, hey, I'm just come over here on the other side. And she says, that's right, dad, because it is a man always walks on the outside. Mm. And she wouldn't inherently know that. How would she know that? Right. Other than what I taught her, right? And she doesn't think that she's incapable of it. She doesn't think I think less of her. She just thinks, Oh, here's, here's a man who happens to be my father who respects me, right? Who honors me, who cares about me, period, end of story, nothing else other than that. And if, and if she grows up and she's with a man who doesn't walk on the outside, if you will, she, she might question it. She might ask him. And that's okay too. But rather than the strident nature of, you know, growing into a kind of the fourth wave feminist is like, I don't want to even be walking with a man. And if I am walking a man, I don't need to walk on the outside. And then she was raining and there's a splash and a puddle and she gets soaking wet. Well, you know, I'd rather be soaking wet than the man. I'm like, just stop with the nonsense. Just, yeah, chill, take it easy. You know, you don't have to be on a social justice campaign for equality every single day. And if you are, you need to look yourself in the mirror and see, you know, some of the hypocrisy, that, you know, the equality movement quote unquote comes out with because it is a bit, it's laughable sometimes. I, you know, Greg, I have so many questions. And I've only done this once or twice, but I just think we need to have a part two, because you got a book over your right shoulder called the respondent. We need to talk about that. We need to talk about family court and family law. We need to talk about it. Yeah. And so we need to do a part two. We're going to release this. We're going to get to this gap, this out to the guys. They're going to love what we're talking about. And we just need to do a part two if you're open for that. Absolutely. I'd be happy to. Yeah. I mean, I thought, honestly, I thought we'd get to it quicker than we did. But like, we've been talking us about so much good stuff here. I'm like, well, I'm not going to detract from what we're talking about to get to that. Like this is good stuff too. So we definitely need to do a part two. Oh, yeah. Happy to. It's actually really enjoyable because it's not, you know, like you mentioned early on being in the present, being in the now moment, you know, not worrying about with it. That's when time flies and you've, I know it's like when you're hosting a podcast, a little bit of a clock and you go, hang on a second. We've gone, we've gone longer than, yeah, perfectly fine. I've really enjoyed our conversation. I'd be happy to come back for a part two. I talk about the respondent in my book and anything else you'd like to talk about. Do you want to share with us really quickly just how to connect with you so the guys can get primed for the conversation I think we'll have in the next two to three weeks, part two to this discussion here? Yeah, sure. My, the, the real Greg Ellis.com is kind of the hub and home for information about me. But my main focus right now is the respondent.com that will have information about my book, the respondent exposing the cartel of family law, introduction by Johnny Depp, forward by Alec Baldwin. And we can talk more about that. And it's got information about my nonprofit, the charitable extension of the respondent, CPU, which stands for Children and Parents United. And yeah, that's really the, you know, the usual social media channels, you know, Twitter and Facebook and blah, blah, blah, okay, you don't come in hits, but don't do it too long. You need to put the phone down. Thank you. Ten to that device dependency. But yeah, the respondent.com realgragallist.com, they're the two websites I would suggest and everything kind of flows out from there. Excellent. We're going to sync it all up for the guys. And of course you and I are going to stay in touch. So guys, if you're listening to this right now and you want more of the conversation we're having, know that part two is going to be coming out in a week or two or three weeks. And I've got a list of questions. I never make questions ahead of time, but based on our conversation, I've got, you may have noticed me putting my head down. I'm not checking my phone. I'm writing notes. So I've got a bunch of other questions that I need to ask you and I'm looking forward to part two. Greg, thanks for joining us today, man. I really appreciate your insight. Right. Right. Beyond and I'll end with one question for you that might tee up something in the book or some of what I talk about in the book, which country do you think is the world leader and children growing up in single parent households? Single parent households. I mean, I would say, I would say the U.S. I would say our country. Correct. And the next question will be why, but we can talk about that the next time that we get to like that. Amanda, T your, your T now, but a little teaser there. It's like you've been a Hollywood, you know, how to put those teasers out there. Well, it's important because, you know, every day in our family law system, a divorce court's 4000 children lose a parent. That's every single day. 4000 children lose a parent. And I've explored some other reasons why and we can, we can, we can talk about it's not, not necessarily all just about that because my harrowing dystopian story is part of the respondent and many other men and many other fathers have been through, you know, tens of thousands have been through similar and families and children. And so I'm trying to, I'm trying to be of service. I'm trying to put something good back into the world. And yeah, we'll do a part two. I'm rambling. Yeah, I feel like, I mean, this is a great discussion. So don't take this the wrong way. But I feel like I may have failed the guys because quite honestly, we've never had a discussion about family courts and family law. And I know that there are 1000 literally you're talking about 4000 children a day. There are 1000s of men who are losing their sons and daughters. Great. There is. This is a conversation we've had. We need to have this. So like it's imperative that we do the follow up conversation. I think so too. There are so many, so, so many harrowing stuff. I mean, I get emails now after the book came out, I get so many emails a day where people sharing their stories. I mean, you know, harrowing stories, you know, people who've been serving in the military, who come back, you know, men who come back and they will talk about the details of stories like this, but they are suddenly homeless and unable to see their families. And personal examples of that. Right. And there are reasons for this. And I think it's the conversation that we haven't been having. I think many people in organizations and movements have been talking about this as I've found out recently after my book came out for decades. But there hasn't been the multimedia conversation and voices amplified to actually discuss why it's happening, who's incentivized, you know, the family little cartel that I talk about in the book is a $60 billion a year industry. There is legalized child trafficking going on, kidnapping of chill. I mean, it's harrowing when you get into it. Do you think it's a national health emergency? Maybe you're in a mental health or physical health emergency, but nobody seems to be talking about and caring about unless you're actually you find yourself in the system. So what I'm trying to do is get this this conversation going and really talk about these, because I think it affects all of us if we actually stop for a moment. We all know someone who's had a relationship breakdown or divorced parents or we're divorced or we know someone who's divorced or being through the divorce trap and the zero sum game of divorce court. And it's all really when I looked at the reason why there's one reason I wrote a book and I'm going to stop in a moment because I know there's part two coming up was I needed to. I didn't want to. I needed to. There aren't there weren't any books to help me as a man and a father get through when my personal crisis suddenly hit in a moment, literally in a moment. I went from beautiful life kids in a private school, country, like the life I had earned the privilege life that I'd earned to within eight hours, I was homeless almost destitute and being used as a human toilet while I was incarcerated. So we can talk about that the next time. We're going to hit on all of it. It's so, so important. And I know the guys are going to resonate. I appreciate you. I appreciate your work. This is going to sound stupid, but take it forward. It's worth my kids and I are going to watch Pirates tonight. And I'm going to say, I got to talk with Greg today and they're going to be so excited about it. So thank you. Well, I appreciate you. I appreciate what you do on this on this show and everything that you've been doing. I appreciate your wife because without her, you'd have a harder time being here and probably wouldn't enjoy it as much. Just had to say that. And yeah, thank you. And in terms of Pirates, you know, you've got to be the best podcast driver I've ever seen. How's that for you live from the line from the right? I'm going to save that. I'm going to save that and show that to me. He's got to be the best podcaster I've ever seen. Perfect. I love it. I love it. All right, brother, I appreciate you. You and I are going to stay in touch. We're going to do this follow up in a week or two and we'll go from there. So thank you very much. Sounds great. Thanks, Ryan. Be well. All right, guys, there you go. My conversation with the one and only Greg Ellis. I was so glad that I was introduced to Greg and so fortunate that we were able to have this conversation. As I said, to kick this thing off, we are going to be doing a part two. So I want you to stay tuned. I want you to subscribe, leave the ratings and reviews because when part two comes out in the next several weeks, which is going to be more geared towards the other part of this conversation, which is father's rights and the family court system and how it might be stacked against men. This is something you're going to want to tune into, whether it's personally impacting you or somebody you know, or maybe you aren't in this position, but you need to be equipped and armed with the right information to make sure that you protect your rights. So we're definitely going to get into that as well. Connect with Greg on the socials. Connect with me on the socials. Take a screenshot. Let people know, shoot them a text screenshot and tag me and Greg on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, wherever you're doing your social media thing and let people know what you're listening to. Tell me what you liked about the show, what you didn't like, what you would like to hear more about. And we're going to cater these conversations we're having towards you. It's always been my goal to serve you as best I can. And hopefully this one did. I know it did for me. So guys, with that said, get after it, go out there, take action and become the man you are meant to be. Thank you for listening to the Order of Man podcast. You're ready to take charge of your life and be more of the man you were meant to be. We invite you to join the order at quarter of man.com."
