    "text": " Well, the woke revolutionaries on Twitter are gunning for James Lindsey. He's a mathematician. He's an academic prankster It's not quite the right word. He's brilliant James Lindsay Lindsay does not care He's moved beyond caring about academic radicals who bully anyone they disagree with and They disagree with most of us the last time we had James Lindsey on this podcast. He was a little different than he is now He still cared about trying to find a way to reason with the bullies of woke liberalism But his new book doesn't give me much hope that that's going to happen It is a groundbreaking book It's called cynical theories how activist scholarship made everything about race gender and identity and why this harms everyone This is a must-own book go out or just go online and order it right now You'll see why after this interview these days James is spending much of his time fighting the cult of critical theory Translating the language of the woke and math now into plain English in 1984 George Orwell wrote freedom is the freedom to say two plus two make four if that is granted all else follows in a world that is becoming more and more 1984 by the day James is a very brave man willing to stand up and say yeah, two plus two does not equal five So James I want to really concentrate on the book cynical theories Because I don't think people and we've talked about it before I don't think people really understand what's happening They're being duped by a lot of things And and really in a way You know in America it is always this way our Achilles heel is I think our willingness to just live and let live and you know just let people and I don't believe that but that's okay And we're in a different time now They've used that against us and now we're just at the very beginning of seeing how dangerous and literally deadly This will be Yep, that is this correct assessment. This is This is not a Ideology that we're looking at with everything going on as we saw the nurse say everything going on now This is not an ideology that can tolerate compromise, right? So live and let live requires a Acceptance that there will be compromise it requires Acceptance that there be forgiveness of mistakes and and that the people can work together and that our differences will be our strengths the e pluribus Unum founding concept the motto of the United States and As was outlined kind of ironically, you know going back into the the 40s with Karl Popper Outlining outlining the the paradox of tolerance When you are struck with genuine intolerance too much tolerance becomes a problem And so the question becomes of course, how do you tell when it's speech which should be you know protected universally people's beliefs people's matters of private conscience are their own but when the Popper says when they when they bring out the knives when they bring out the guns That's the point where you absolutely can't tolerate any longer and the question becomes in a realistic sense And there are different ways to analyze this What do you do in a society built on tolerance and plurality? What do you do? to deal with a genuinely intolerant ideology that won't compromise and that's the question that we're now facing Not in a theoretical way, but in a real way maybe for the first time since the late 1960s. I Think it's more serious in the 1960s because it there there doesn't seem to be any Anything that is strong standing against it. We still had some universities and some and some professors and scientists and everything else we had some churches that understood exactly what was going on we had a society that Was at the end of understanding the importance of the Constitution, but we we recognize the Constitution and we saw this this double-speak and or well-being kind of world coming from The Soviet Union we don't have any of that right we have nothing right the breaks have been taken off of the train and rolling down the hill that's where we are now and The the primary way that it's taken the breaks off of the train is by making things about matters of of identity in thus bigotry which are So sensitive for so many people that they would rather Just roll over and maybe even hand over the keys to their way of life then be caught up in association with bigotry and So this is this is the way that they figured out how to remove the breaks from the same kind of thing that was attempted in the 1960s There was a major summit for liberation as they call it in 1967. We saw the rollout of riots and violence through late 1967 and 1968 that was largely informed by Herbert Marcusa the neo-Marxist who started the so-called new left and He's the one that led the charge toward identity politics and now we've had 50 years of that line of thought ripening Plus as we document in in the book that you mentioned The adoption of post-modernism so that it no longer has any tether to the truth. It's all about Feelings so if somebody accuses somebody of bigotry or racism or sexism or homophobia or you name you name it There are so many that even Judith Butler one of their scholars called it that exasperated, etc If you accuse somebody of it, that's a wholly subjective determination and if you say where is the evidence that racism is happening say in our school in our institution at NASA You say where's the evidence that that erases is happening here? They say the evidence is my lived experience and that you think we need more evidence than that is just proof that you're racist And that it's actually a racist system to ask for evidence because it denies the realities of my lived experience and by having Moved the entire question into matters of lived experience on something as sensitive as bigotry in our society which tries to be open and tolerant and and pluralistic and welcoming and inclusive and diverse They've removed the breaks from the train that would drive the revolution So James I've been saying for a long time there's going to come a point where you won't recognize your country And some people found that during the Kavanaugh hearings where they were like wait wait wait, how is this happening? You know where is the evidence? I'm open-minded and if he's doing those kinds of things, but we don't just Convick somebody like that without anything and people thought the world was upside down. That was a year ago That's a Playground stay that's like McDonald's playground Compared to where we are right now. I can't even imagine 12 months from now Are you are you seeing any slowdown is there are there and we can get into these? I know you have a great answer for how to fight it, but are you seeing anything on the horizon? That makes you feel better that maybe we're gonna slow down on this I See a grassroots movement waking up and that is the most interesting and hopeful thing I also Am hearing from more and more people who are within business within industry within education within universities Within the nonprofit sector within the activist Sector that has pushed for many even progressive left changes in society all saying wait a minute. This has all gone too far I wrote an article a while back I guess two months ago called the woke breaking point and I Compelled people in that article to think for yourself Maybe if you're out there and you're listening and you're you're somewhat progressive or you think this is you know a movement that has the best interest of certain You know vulnerable people at heart and you have sympathies toward it You you need to wrestle with yourself and you need to take this to your friends and get your friends to wrestle with it and your family And anybody else that you can reach is that that supports it you have to wrestle with Where is the line that's too far? What does it look like and you have to understand that psychologically we have to see that line Before we cross it in order for this to be effective right because what happens is you know something happens It's we normally wouldn't tolerate Then we end up going and we get in a culture war on Twitter or whatever and we rationalize something unacceptable and So what is the so what is the line for you give me give me give me some I mean cross I crossed my line in In 2013 or so when I saw my intellectual heroes getting called sexist for things that had nothing to do with sexism And then that's when I realized something wrong was happening here You know when I asked questions, I got the academic literature Sociological they called it, but it's not actually sociological definition of systemic sexism then systemic racism I said well here. We have two definitions Why are we not trying to be clear? Why are we muddying the water and using these like they're interchangeable when they mean different things and for me that Was my breaking point and that was that was seven years ago Kavanaugh I actually heard from somebody yesterday that the Kavanaugh hearing was his breaking point when he saw that he said that That's it a lot of people Though not many on the left when Donald Trump was elected and we saw the emergence of a so-called hashtag resistance and we saw marches for abstract concepts like women and And with with no particular policy goals in mind with no pretty it's just a women's march Right for what to resist Donald Trump and his existence and then that particularly I've heard many people say the movement of quote Not my president where all of a sudden they duly elected president according to the Constitution was considered a legitimate right based on who he was that was a lot of people's breaking point the recent I've heard hundreds if not thousands of people that the recent, you know Month or two month long frockets on Twitter over whether two plus two equals four or five Was a lot of people's both breaking point whether it said okay if they're willing to throw out objective truths That's too far. Yeah, that's too far. So even basic mathematics science I shared a thing on on Twitter this morning It's actually old I've seen it before about a project to decolonize light saying that the way that we've studied light has been wholly from a scientific perspective and other perspectives on light aren't considered Legitimate as science and so we have to decolonize light and this is real. This was funded I think this is Canadian but it was funded by their government to To support this line of research and so when people see things like that or when they see Dr. Ibram Kendi the how to be anti-racist book author Getting invited to speak at NASA recently last week That was too far for some people when they see today Jack on Twitter announced that he's giving even Kendi and his Anti-racist policy Institute at Boston University ten million dollars That was some people's work breaking point a lot of times though It's going to be personal It'll be when somebody that they love gets fired gets canceled gets pilloried gets called a racist Legitimately like it was for me my intellectual heroes are called sexist when they weren't sexist and I said something's wrong here so It'll be something for everybody But people need to find out what it is and they need to get their friends to deal with it and say you know If they tear down a statue a lot of people should have said if they ever tear down a statue of George Washington, it's gone too far And a lot of people didn't and they tore down a statue George Washington and a lot of people rationalized it. Let me Let me tell you one of the more frightening things that I've done recently is Well, I was on vacation. I read 1984 again and I haven't I haven't read 1984 since I don't know I was in high school or whatever and I remember reading it then and it being a really good book, but you had to you had to kind of You know play into it and give it a little more credibility And you could think of when I read it you could think of the Soviet Union or whatever This thing read like a newspaper It read like today's newspaper in America and it was hair-raising Which brings me to the two plus two equals five You you you've released a Twitter storm That just I mean it became like a category five hurricane Where you were mocking two plus two equals five right mm-hmm that's right and you All of a sudden saw all of these people Backing that up and arguing that you're right two plus two isn't for That's right. It's even today while while I was waiting to sit down with you I was checking my Twitter and seeing that one of the most prestigious mathematicians in the world one of the most accomplished mathematicians in the world a fields medallist was still arguing about how two plus two doesn't always have to equal four and So this is happening all started where somebody had asked me to explain How would this ideology the the critical social justice or woke ideology think about something like two plus two? Would they say it's four? Would they say it's five? Would they say it's three? Would they say it's something else? And I said the answer is that it would say that is that they would say that it doesn't matter what two plus two equals but that we should be suspicious of The answer for because that's a hegemonic narrative that came from white supremacy and So I made this card that I put on Twitter I call him woke minis and I put the just little satirical quips and little pretty cards and I put him out on on Twitter and it said something to the effect of two plus two Equals four is a perspective in white Western mathematics that excludes other possible values or marginalizes other possible values maybe and so this Kind of just was funny and then somebody ended up tagging the creator of the 1619 project Nicole Hina Jones with it about a month later And then she tried to make fun of it by saying that I had used Arabic numerals for two and four and she said that's so damn Classic and she made fun of it. Well, this ends up within a few days it had tapped into this massive movement So this is actually not just a Twitter fight. It tapped into this massive movement to change our education in terms of ethnic studies This is already the law in Washington. It's already the law in California. It just passed in California When California now what they no longer are going to be teaching just history. They're now going to be teaching what they call her story Where they my head hurts H-E-R to H-X-R X-H-X-R story instead of history and so this is working its way into the education system of New York This is three of course very blue states, but it will go to others This is the objective to change our education system And so one of the reformers if we'll call them that one of these activists trying to change our education systems in Washington The secretary director of their program there tweeted Wow, you know somebody had gotten into the two plus two equals five thing and she said wow There's this line of attack against my ethnic studies program in Washington mathematics saying that it would mean two plus two equals five How can we turn this into a true statement? That's what she said How can we turn two plus two equals five into a true statement? And now that was at the very beginning of July here. We are in mid to late August and Ever since it's been raging for people to try to turn two plus two equals five into a true statement And the reason is because they want to and they've said this explicitly. I'm not just interpreting They want to undermine the idea of objectivity and mathematics so that you can't trust your own senses just like in 1984 You can't trust your own reason just like in 1984 You have to listen to them They will tell you what two plus two equals one it equals four when it doesn't equal four because two plus two equals doesn't matter But we should be suspicious of the white supremacist answer for you They want to set themselves up as the arbiters of what is true and false for everybody you need to read an article that I just read this morning in Forbes and it was Doing your own research maybe deadly and It was that no one even some scientists by themselves No one is qualified to give you the truth Unless you're an expert in that particular field and so that right people should no longer do their own homework No matter how hard you try You will never come up with the right answer because you don't know even the questions to ask that's the most In slaving idea, I think I've ever heard Yeah, it's a complete perversion of the idea of expertise Expertise is supposed to mean that somebody has studied the proper Methods of the proper material to be able to be more likely to render a correct opinion not because not that they automatically will Right and that everybody therefore must trust them The the liberal principle meaning philosophically liberal like our Constitution when you apply to knowledge is that we Have checking of each by each science works because anybody Anybody it could be some teenager in his basement fooling around with his chemistry set could overturn the biggest Nobel Prize winning Scientists by saying while the experiment says you made a mistake so you are correct this is the exact opposite of Of what leads us to truth what leads us to knowledge and what prevents us from falling Into the tyranny of people who I have on on twitter I've just started calling them our betters in a very sarcastic satirical way Oh, our betters have said this or betters think of us this way. This is what our betters say and I mean, you know me I'm not not exactly a right-wing populist, but this is This is this is the sentiment though that has to rise up from everybody Who's not already captured by this mindset is that these people are attempting to appoint themselves Philosopher kings who are going to rule us because they know better than us and that we we can't do the experiment for ourselves The other one that's when you were telling me about forbs I was thinking of how many things I've seen where they're trying to make homeschooling illegal Or now they're trying to with the with the coronavirus We're all having you know a lot of school is going to be virtual It's going to be via via the web and I just saw just saw an article Minutes ago that was talking about how a school system And I don't know where I'd have to actually look into it more closely But a school system is requiring parents to sign forms saying that they won't watch what the teachers are doing with the kids in their own homes and You know you had the guy at Harvard saying that homeschooling should be illegal The children are literally wards of the state and this therefore they need this state education And all of these people are now arguing that homeschooling is racist It's a way for racists to keep making racist children and to perpetuate the ideologies of white supremacy And there's a real threat that this could win. I keep hearing people say well if this keeps up on our schools I'm going to homeschool and I'm I keep thinking if if you don't fight back now that in a year that you won't You won't be able to homes won't have the yeah It'll be illegal You want to know the secret to staying sweat free this summer?

Oh, that's ridiculous I'm not alone in that. I've talked to some of the biggest Broadcasters and some of the biggest people on on youtube and uh online And they're all saying the same thing. I'm not sure we're going to be able to say things next year Right. Yeah, it's it's actually very concerning and there are very realistic mechanisms I don't think a lot of people we've been this is a problem we talk about in cynical theories is that a lot of people have become comfortable with liberalism Again in the not left right american politics, but the broad constitutional sense and so they don't Not only do they not have the ability to articulate clear defenses of what it is and and reasons that people should stand up for it They also have come to take it for granted and they can't think of how a system like ours could become illiberal Um even while while models for such things are happening in the world today. I mean social credit system. I don't understand the model I don't know how people don't see it happening here right now How are people still duped when people say oh what rights have you lost? Are you kidding me? Are you not seeing the handwriting? I feel like uh, uh, uh, Jew in germany who's like, I don't know. Maybe we should get out of here. No, there's nothing to worry about I mean, this is how it happens Uh, yeah, I've actually had the same feeling and the problem is is that all of the Western democracies of course not all of which exist in the west But all of the the advanced democracies in the world are going to be subjected to this. Yes to There it's like where you escape. Yeah, where can you go because this is um, this ideology is uniquely parasitic it is modeled to It is designed to model itself after whatever it attaches itself to so if it gets into the republican party It'll speak to republican party language and will twist the words twist the policies and and subvert That's actually the term that they use for their their activism subversion It will subvert the thing from within people say oh well, there's contracts or there's the constitution or there's the first amendment or there's this So there's that you change the word if you change the meanings of the words Then you change the contract without changing a single word in it You change the meaning of the words and the constitution doesn't mean the same thing anymore and it doesn't it doesn't protect you at all And so this is what's happening. So when we come back not to drag back to two plus two But this was one of the literal this is the main argument that's being made that two plus two doesn't always equal four Is that well if you change the meaning of two or if you change the meaning of plus or if you change the meaning of equals Or if you change the meaning of four One person even said explicitly now this isn't a person of any significance But one person even says it explicitly that if we just allowed the symbol to in the symbol four to mean completely different things Or the symbol five to mean completely different things Then two plus two equals five is a true statement automatically We just change the meaning of the symbols and then the new the statement is it means whatever they want it to mean But when this seems silly and funny or whatever But it's very serious because if you change the meaning of The words in the constitution the constitution now means something different And you have no protections left if you change the meaning of the words in your contracts Your contract means something different and now you can be held to something you never signed up for And this is a real threat and this is actually how this ideology operates because it's so Concerned with the power of language that it manipulates at that level and it's able to therefore enter into anything in Subvert the thing itself by changing the way that the language that that whether it's a community whether it's an organism It's a company whether it's a government whether it's an individual relationship how all of the language used by those people How that takes on meaning that all gets changed and then it has all the power by making you you think in its terms You know, I used to just think this was excuse the expression mental masturbation of you know of naming and necessity Salt Crip he wrote a wheel is only a wheel because we call it a wheel and I thought that's the biggest waste of time In my opinion. That's a useless philosophy for me, but that's really not useless anymore. They have found a way to make the naming and the necessity of naming really a powerful weapon That's right. So that's ultimately what we wrote cynical theories to track was how did that happen? Because we know that this and it was mental masturbation really had this this post-modern Idea of putting everything in the in the world of language. We take jock darida. We say Oh, he said all the words exist in discourses and discourses are kind of like webs of words where meaning is Connect, you know, the meaning of any one word is is actually defined in terms of its relationship to other words So if I say dog, we have to think things like animal. We might think canine. We might think carnivore or omnivore I guess for dogs We might think We also have to think plants because plants are not animals We have to think cat because a cat is an animal if it's not a dog We have to think in terms of things that that dogs are and are not so all of the words are in just in relationship to other words And meaning is completely deferred. You can't say dog and point to a dog and anybody actually understand you that was the point he was making and in the same token you can't Read a text and understand what the author intended You you can only understand the the the words in relationship to the other words on the paper And in terms of how those words mean something to you And so you you take that and that's his post structural deconstruction idea And so then you take that and you combine that with with Michelle Foucault Oh power works through everybody and power is generated by what we validate his knowledge and what we don't And to talk about truth and falsity misses the point that it's politics that decide what's true and politics that decide what's false And that constrains people and their potentialities of being and so you had all generation of That generation and a half of kind of worthless academics just doing this screwy stuff with language That didn't make any sense and as you said it's mental masturbation and then what happened is in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s a bunch of literally radical activists properly radical activists who wanted to change society in exactly the way that marks laid out Figured out how to use those rhetorical tricks to take apart everything they consider to be dominant in society while Safe guarding everything they decided to be their own interests And so they learned how to twist that post modern language game, which that's what they actually referred to as language games To their to their advantage for for real effective activism And so these people this handful of of Activists in the in a late 1980s and early 1990s who were deeply informed from the frankfort school of neo-Marxism The black feminists the radical feminists These these people who are deeply informed in in those regards figured out how to play post modern language games To remove the necessity of truth and falsity From their their their work at all they no longer had to be constrained by the truth They no longer had an obligation to tell the truth or to define the truth that will look for the truth or to communicate the truth In fact, they were able to recast and this is famously in a paper by I think her name was cali all over in 1989 That it was no longer a necessity to be concerned with true theories or false theories But only politically useful theories And so the idea of true and false following fukou became political the idea that meaning cannot be found By pointing to the world but only and how words relate to one another gave them language games They came from derida and the next thing you know these radical activists who were the same ones It rose up in the 60s that we were talking about earlier had the means to take the breaks Off the train and run it down the track anyway so james what is the I mean because it's it's you're just making Embosals out of people you're you're you're creating the situation that the soviet union had Where they couldn't grow crop they couldn't make a timepiece that could actually keep time And when you can't make a timepiece you really can't do a lot of things What is the goal of the people? I mean Are they just evil? How did they how do they see good coming out of this? So it's complicated. There are of course one the people who are more cognizant of how this is a very explicit kind of revolution in the way that you are talking about But I think the majority are sincere to be honest with you Most people don't agree with me on this but I do think that the majority of the even the scholars They're very sincere and they've been convinced by as south park put it by smelling their own farts for Now a very long time by getting too lost in the theories I mean we have that saying you know an idea so stupid and only an academic could believe it or something like that And so they they've convinced themselves that oppression really did come from the the system I hear people all the time who say that you know Well, I used to think about things this way and then I studied say critical race theory or I studied even marks marks His theory and then I had to learn to think in systems and now that I think in systems I see how it's the system itself that everything has to be torn down It's they believe that if they can get all of the problems out of the system if they can unmake the problematic system that The utopia is sure to follow that everything all the they they believe that the problems all the problems of society Come from the fact that dominant groups Create the problems. They've completely lost the lost all perspective of Of anything else and I think that the majority of the people doing this are in fact in some sense What would be called useful idiots? They don't realize that their theory is bad They don't realize that there's a giant non sequitur. It's the same non sequitur But in a different context that marks had marks laid out as great theory about the failures of liberal societies of capitalist societies And he wasn't wrong about everything obviously He was able to identify some real points in particular the groupishness of people And the way that society stratifies and sees themselves as class groups for marks or identity groups as we see it now And that this has real meaning for people and they But his belief was well, if you just wake everybody up to this Everything will be perfect and there was no Mechanism by which that was supposed to work. There was no actual economic theory that would explain how this is supposed to work out in practice And so then what you get is people who have to start denying the truth when it doesn't work Then to get increasingly brutal to force people to go along with it And then as you pointed out to make them dysfunctional to make them they don't have timepieces at work I talked to a systems expert if you want to talk about systemic things A systems expert recently who is telling me about his own research one of the things that he had done Uh years ago without any knowledge of this particular question Was what happens if you just desynchronize you say you have a functional organization You did a computer model and you just desynchronize people's clocks so that on average people are a little bit late to every meeting They're they missed deadlines by a little bit And then they're they built a slider on it. And so what happens is that the drop-off and productivity is not anywhere near As slow as you might think it is you slide that thing a little bit you desynchronize people a little bit You take their timepieces away a little bit and productivity drops off a cliff And he said you don't even have to go very far and actually the entire the productivity of the organization falls to zero Very very quickly and the the entity cannot function Just by desynchronizing people to a relatively small degree So when you talk about building timepieces that don't work or as we hear about it now You you can hear about decolonizing time Or you can hear people literally in the state of washington and then their government who are on video saying things like keeping to a schedule And a meeting agenda is literal white supremacy coming out of my mouth It is now a I think this it was on the I don't remember if it was on the list of smithsonian published or not But they had that horrendous list of things that were white supremacy But it's very common now to see punctuality is a vestige of white supremacy But if you remember to tell you falls apart. I remember I don't remember what city was in And I remember telling this story back then I used to do believe it or not at one point before the world got so serious. I was actually I did comedy and We went to this big You know fox theater or whatever it was in this southern city. I grew up in the pacific northwest So we didn't have the busing we didn't just we just didn't have that problem And so I didn't really understand it and I remember I walked up and I was talking to the sheriff of the town I think the mayor of the town was there and the person that was running the theater the general manager of the theater And I we were just chatted for a while and I said I gotta uh, I gotta go and uh, I looked at the theater manager and I said and we really like to start on time 8 o'clock 8 o'clock seated or not we start and they all laughed And one of them said well you're on colored standard time down here And I I couldn't even process it. I was like what color when and then I realized Oh my gosh. You're talking about black people here. I felt like I was in heat of the night or something This is yeah, this is exactly what the smisonian put out It was it was just reverse racism and that's what's happening now in california Where they're trying to take away that you can't discriminate based on race They believe now that The only way to reverse discrimination is to exact is to do that reverse Discrimination and discriminate against those who they say are racists This is just a progress that takes you back 400 years Right and so you can even we mentioned ebrum kendy The how to how to be an anti-racist guy who's now bestseller lists all over the place is speaking in nasa just got a huge grant from jack at twitter and Uh, he explicitly says in his book which many many people have been compelled to read now He explicitly says explicitly says that if if anti-discrimination creates unequal results Then it's racist and if discrimination creates more equal results than it's anti-racist And that's the impetus behind what's going on in california You have literally people saying we need to start discriminating And they can say it's some nice thing like oh well We just mean in something like affirmative action what you could say is a positive discrimination. We're gonna we're gonna We're going to discriminate in favor of certain groups to try to help them out but because I mean what does this turn into you know, there are only so many spots It's not to say that everything is zero sum But at some level this does require negative discrimination against other groups and you see this very vividly with the now It was at harvard and now there's a much bigger scandal about asians at yale And then yale comes out and just like yep, we're gonna keep doing it, you know, justice department whatever we're just gonna keep doing it and It's astonishing because there's now the I cringe to call intellectual, but there's now the intellectual architecture in place to justify the unmaking of One of the crowning achievements of american history, which is the civil rights act uh And it's like you said it's it's like you fell back into the heat of the night I felt the same way when I was watching the video of this meeting I mentioned in the washington state equity task force. So this is against state level This is not a legislative body. This is a administrative state level body That it has been installed it exists and they literally were talking about how if people you know Somebody came in late to the meeting we need to we need to pay attention like they would do in south africa and when you know this kind of slow Speech would do like in south africa. Hey, how's your family? Let's chat and catch up for 10 or 15 minutes Then we'll catch you up on what happened in the meeting and we'll delay everything 30 minutes You know, she said well, you know, we need to really work on kind of like south african time And it's just like holy crap What in the world is I mean I saw that in january. I was in a hotel And somebody sent it to me at you know, it's like 1230 and I had to give a talk in the next the next day And it's like I just couldn't stop watching this in boring administrative meeting I just stared at it for nearly an hour. I couldn't stop watching it Just aghast and that was in january and now it's like oh yeah, that's normal Uh, that's just how things are now and so What what what what? For instance in the book you talk about You know the fat theories. I think that's what's going fat studies That's just a thumbnail of fat studies here Okay, so yeah, the the book trace is just to kind of give a quick overview the the what postmodern philosophy is how it changed 1980s and 1990s as we spoke about and then it details a number of the specific branches of this new way of thinking new way of thought one of them is fat studies so fat studies is Is not what so I tell people about this a lot and they're like oh you mean people doing research into like obesity and health and oh no This is not what fat studies is fat studies if we give the thumbnail version is if you could imagine, you know almost the most You know Sketch comedy support group For fat people and then turn that into an academic theory That's what it is. It denies that the word it only uses the word obesity and scare quotes It denies that obesity is real. It calls it a medicalizing narrative that is used to uh induce fat phobia Which is a systemic hatred of fat people Just like homophobia. It's not the fear of fat people. It's a systemic hatred just like homophobia and That it encourages fat stigma and so obesity needs to be taken out of the consideration of the medical field Your doctor should not be allowed to tell you that obesity is linked to health conditions whatsoever It shouldn't be able to tell you that you're overweight because that assumes that there is a correct weight Which is a hegemonic discourse that excludes fat people from society and it is an entire effort to essentially remove any expectation that we would be able to talk about being overweight or Uh, the medical implications of being overweight in any realistic or scientific way. There's only talking about the ways in which uh people who are overweight are oppressed by a society who doesn't welcome them who doesn't accommodate them at every turn so airplane seats having a standard size for example is uh an example of fat phobia or hatred of fat people because The airplane seat having a standard size is not accommodating the fact that some people are larger and the fact that there are You know seat belt extensions implies that there's a there's an accurate size You know a proper size and so that's humiliating to have to get a seat belt extension And so it's a further way to to embarrass and stigmatize fat people So fat studies is it is is a way to stop Studying anything to do with being overweight in a realistic way and to turn it into something like a um support group on steroids that believes the society literally hates fat people and is out to get them at every turn and needs to rearrange itself completely to accommodate uh obesity and to pretend that it doesn't have uh health associated risks So I was having dinner with Vince Vaughn about 10 years ago and um who we were just talking about Our backs. I have a bad back. He has a bad back and the conversation just kind of meandered into that and uh He said, you know, I just I just got my back fixed. I she said I've never felt better Uh, he said, you know, my wife was always giving me her theories and you know why my back was bad And he said I didn't listen and and he said so I went and I went to all these doctors He said I finally tried acupuncture. He said if you try to acupuncture and I said, yeah, it didn't work for me He said well it did for me. He said I went to this old Chinese guy in Chicago And he said I you know took my clothes off and I'm laying down and he said this guy is just ancient He said I felt like I was in China And he said he came up and he said, you know, they put him in your ears right on the ear in the ears And he said so they were poking the pins and he was poking the pins in the ears and he said the Chinese guy said you fat And he said I realized my problem was I was overweight And so I lost weight So his version of acupuncture working was him just having somebody else say what his wife had been saying Your fat lose some weight and you'll feel better your back will feel better The point of this is is all of these studies Are dangerous They are telling I mean you tell me if you create a world where glen back is Every right and he should feel good about going to have him more ice cream I will have more ice cream because you're just enabling me to have more ice cream In my case, I bring my fatness on because I'm lazy. I don't like to work out You you have a doctor stop telling me to work out. You have a doctor stop telling me. Hey, stop eating that stuff It's bad for your your blood pressure. You're killing people. You're killing people It's it's like this these theories and these Critical studies it's like a death cult It is in certain regards within fat studies and disability studies in particular that there Direct health implications direct health implications so we can talk about And it causes us to deny as well like for and I don't know if you've heard of this I'm sure you have the people who say they're born handicapped and they're born with only one arm But they have both arms and in Canada they were debating on whether or not doctors should amputate arms Perfectly good arms. No, man. That's a psychiatric issue. You have two arms That's right and it gets very literally psychiatric as well because within disability studies for example, there there is a diseases like depression which can end in suicide are often characterized as Identities and they talk about the depressed community and the depressed identity With the capital D and so at that point you no longer try to treat depression You try to lean into your depression and you try to make your depression part of who you are And most importantly because these are critical studies Just like with fat studies and this is part of why they deny medical intervention But also here and just with everything else you're supposed to turn your identity into a political A site of political activism a political identity So we heard that with the 1619 project woman nakol henna jones where she tweeted about people being politically black Isn't the same as in being racially black we have politically fat one of the things when we did our Our grieven studies fake papers. We wrote fat bodybuilding and it was based off of reading in the fat studies Literature somebody who said that it takes time to build a fat body It takes even more time to build a politicized fat body and I thought that's just the funniest thing i've ever read in my life And so that's where fat bodybuilding came from and so but this is true though So now you're supposed to adopt your identity as a means of politics that old saying the personal is political is taken to the absolute extreme and the point is to do radical Identity politics where you claim that the system is hurting people with my identity the evening. It's an extreme example, but it's true this actually Within fat studies for example, and it also shows up in disability studies The doctors encouraging people to lose weight or if we invented a weight loss pill of course every pharmaceutical company in the world would love to invent this That causes people to get to their their ideal weight if they just take this pill within fat studies the such an invention or even the advice of doctors is Is construed as encouraging a fat genocide? Because it would make it so there are no fat identities any longer you see this with the impetus to cure Certain um disabilities most frequently deafness It's a deaf genocide to to give people say cochlear implants or other implants that would allow them to hear when they're deaf And so this is this very warped mindset where the identity politics and the the cultural identity of Everything becomes the most important factor and reality becomes basically irrelevant So James I You know, I think you were really nervous when the first time you came on my my program because I mean you could You could say a lot of things about me and and people have said those things Um, but they're all most of them are cartoon characters and and uh and inaccurate But the one thing that is true about me is I'm a I'm a very religious man I'm open-minded and I'm not trying to preach my religion and you know, you know, I I know great atheists um And I in the last couple of years I've tried to maybe five years I've tried to stop using the word evil because it's it's such a powerful word and uh means a lot of different things to a lot of different people And I think we've just gotten so cavalier with that with that word um However If you just categorize evil as just destructive intentionally destructive to the wellness of A species a planet whatever I can't find another word to describe this. I mean I just that's right. It's just evil So I as you know, I'm not a particularly religious man, right? But I have many religious friends Some of them are are very significant religious people and I listened to them very seriously I want to understand how their faith informs that thinking how it informs their life I want to understand it on those terms And I do agree that the word evil applies and so it's it's one thing Where there's the intentional desire to tear apart and destroy and that is evil. There's another thing where the Where where a person has given into self-centered envy To such a degree that they'll destroy anything so that other people can't have something that they don't have That's also evil. And so I see this in a very kind of spiritual way uh that This movement is I mean scratch the surface and you find that envy. It's always there somebody has something that I don't Right and the desire to The the so I don't want to get too theological seeing as I've just set myself up as not No, but the truth is but the truth is that there are a few features of of the character of satan or of the deceiver that That it is the temptation to obsessing about the self and then to turn that to Not to oh, how do I improve myself? But how do I tear down that which is against me that that's a very Spiritual way to see evil and that's present here. It is a deep Focus inward on the self in a negative way and then projecting it onto the world and then the second way and I think this is very important is that um They seek justice but in not to again get too theological, but the bible justice is paired with mercy Right and that's what makes god righteous and good right and this is justice with the opposite of mercy There is no forgiveness. There is no mercy. There is just what they consider to be justice. It's french revolutionary justice It's right and when you combine that with the manipulation of language and you remember that the point of the character of satan is the deceiver And so the people are are deceiving you with with their I mean, it's just all there that I I don't Subscribe to the theology myself, but I understand the archetypes that it's speaking to and it's all there and to consider this to be Evil is as as I think we've spoken about once before I don't like to use that word But this is what this is it this this is what evil looks like And there are other kinds of evil in the world, but this is one and here it is so um What does this society look like and how long do you think it takes us to get to I mean it it never stops eating I mean it's a it will eat itself. So eventually it destroys itself Um, but when does it get to a place of real oppressive power to where we would recognize it as the former Soviet union or you know the the Nazis or whatever How far away are we from that? What has to happen? It's very difficult to say how far but the first instance where a significant institution that we truly depend upon like our food supply chain Collapses that's where it starts to recognize to look like that very quickly Of course if people were better students of history and I don't want to set myself up like I am a great student of history They would recognize that the riots that we're seeing in the cities mirror Incidents in previous revolutions. Yeah, uh, and so they were a cultural revolution of china The cultural revolution of china is is I mean this is where you add add mous Objective was to destroy the four old the old culture had to be completely removed And that's exactly what you see now is the status quo Do you even see everybody who's you know, okay boomer? Everybody's a dinosaur. We're gonna watch the dinosaurs die and it was led by the youth who now turned into the red guard Right and he printed his little red book and it had all of the little communist sayings and amalice sayings And this is what you're seeing in all of us anti-racist literature Uh the same kinds of the same kinds of thought stopping and revolution driving aphorisms like white silence is violence Uh, these these these are the exact kinds of things, you know white complicity now. There's brown complicity uh, these these kinds of ideas are are have a strong historical precedent in the the cultural revolution of china and so I don't I I don't know how to answer your question for how do you how do you recognize it? How will people recognize it because I already see it and I can't not see it at this point And I don't know how other people can't see it But what what will I mean? I have a few Points if we talked about woke breaking points earlier that I think will be unambiguous for large segments of the population Um one would be the collapse of a major necessary institution That we actually depend upon for our livelihoods. Um like whether that's banks the economy. Yeah Yeah, banks the economy the food supply chain. I mean we almost saw that early on with some some Shutting down all of the the meatpacking plants with with the covid 19. So I think the shutting down of the banks is is I believe it's it could happen between now and spring easily might take longer than that But it could happen tomorrow could happen You know, that's the thing It could happen very soon and it's very difficult to make predictions about how soon that will be but There are certain things another sign And I don't know what form this will take as far as getting people's attention I predicted from the first Moments of the riots breaking out in minneapolis after george floyd died I predicted that The sign that would tell the majority of the public that it's time to wake up would be one of two things It would either be literal marches on the suburbs where they're trying to do, you know, the disruptive nonsense There in people's homes or and this was the more poignant one police officers swinging from trees and literal lynching and those things I think would actually Wake people off. No, I the neighbors is already happening There were two neighborhoods. Yeah, yeah two neighbors. Well, then I then they're three Because this week I've seen two different neighborhoods where they are literally Marching and saying in the middle of night wake up white people wake up. We're here for it Another one I saw was the this poor family was just out barbecuing and white family and this group Was just talking about how they're going to take their house and their racists and And the kids were just standing there and I thought how How do you how do you feel comfortable how much longer? Do Americans stand by and take it? So one of the things that people need to understand about the ideology and This was directly from a teaching education conference, but it also comes out of a myriad of their literature There is actually a statement. There's a concept within their their literature called white comfort And they say that the idea of white comfort is that white people are comfortable with a racial status quo and the next follow-up line is Therefore anything that maintains white comfort is suspect So this idea of going around and doing that to make people uncomfortable is core to the ideology and so it will continue anything that makes white people feel comfortable is suspect and This is this I mean this was this is from robin d' angelow who's Now one of the most recognized figures in our culture This is literally one of her ideas and so this is what's going to continue and so my question, you know is actually A when do we decide that this is enough and B how do we decide that it is enough and hopefully we decide through the law And not through vigilante action and that's where I actually have the most fear That I really do hope and you know There's a trick here that's being played and it's that you know that they've laid this story For so long that trump is a fascist That he's he's an outright fascist. He's going to take control. He's never going to give up the presidency It's going to be you know, whatever all these things that they say and he's a dictator and so on and so forth And so many people that lean left of center believe this That we can't even have the police show up to arson Or to riots or to the physical beating of a person almost to death on the street We can't even have the police show up because they'll cry. Uh the the force of the state is cracking down On peaceful protesters says there this is this is fascism in action trumps finally and enacting his fascism and people believe it But people believe it that right there is is the issue the the problem with that is is Again, it's two plus two equals five. We're being asked to deny what we see You know, they've made trump into this fascist and and quite honestly, you know before he was president I you know, I was like something goes wrong. This guy could turn into a dictator or like that But he has resisted Every single call for taking over situations COVID everything he could they were Encouraging him to do it. The left was encouraging and the states the left states are becoming much more Fascistic and they're denying that that's what fascism is Uh and and protecting the protecting Just the the average store owner You know or the or the neighborhood That's now fascist to the left and to the democrats Yeah, they it's it's just like two plus two equals five in two ways one is the Demand that we deny the reality that we can see with our own eyes the other is um The manipulation of language two plus two does equal five if we just change what five means And so or if we change what plus means or if we change what equals means and so here Uh, there's a completely different definition of fascism the which if you look into it the definition of fascism That's an operation is a state that functions That's it it has police it has order it has You know expectations that people will follow rules that's fascism and that can be traced again to the same thinkers Uh tracing back into the 1960s in particular these same thinkers Are laid down these ideas and they've been festering for 50 or so years and have turned into this You do something where you have the social justice dictionary Um, but I think is really really important because there's all these new words And everybody seems to speak them overnight all of a sudden everybody's saying this new word and you're like what? What when did that happen? What what does that word mean? um Uh, and I want to go through uh, I want to go through a few of them Uh with you because I I intentionally did not um Mereed the definition of these words, uh because I want to see if I can get anywhere even close and I don't think I can um medicalizing That is like mansplaining Except to by a medical professional That's actually fairly close Medicalizing is to turn an issue that should not be thought of in medical terms into uh medical a medical issue And so you could think of a real example and that there's a real debate around for example addiction should addiction be treated as a social Issue should it be treated as a medical issue? Is it a disease? Is it what kind of a problem is it right and so to just say well We're just going to give people methadone and send them home or whatever That would be medicalizing the issue and in the thus missing the nuance And so there's a real use of this word and then there's the use as we as we actually mentioned in fat studies and disability studies Where saying somebody is depressed and treating that as a medical issue or somebody's overweight and treating that as a medical issue They say that it turns this into a a medical issue when it's really not a medical issue And should not be treated as a medical issue and then they assert further that this is an an example of the application of hegemonic power where we believe scientific discourses and don't believe Non-scientific discourses and this constrains people and hurts them so responsible eyes that is The saying that something is responsible that is part of the fascist state or the the the white culture or You're close again. So to Again, this is a term that has a real a real legitimate use The term in its legitimate use means to make a person responsible for something That previously some other entity often the state took care of so if uh Social security went away To respond to lies you have now responsible eyes right the elderly right but Where we hear these ideas like victim blaming so somebody has a sexual assault happened to them and we say somebody were to reply Oh, what was she wearing right that makes her responsible for something that shouldn't have happened So the way that the critical social justice ideology sees it is Anything that the system should not be allowing that we then say somebody should take responsibility for so a more realistic situation is When when maybe on college campuses, maybe just in broader society We recommend women self-defense classes women learn how to learn to use a gun You know get your carry permit learn a little basic martial arts so that you can can be rape safe That would Responsible eyes the woman now she has to do this extra thing that she wouldn't have otherwise had to do and if rape just didn't exist Because the system didn't allow rape to exist. She wouldn't have to do it So you've responsibleized her you've given her responsibility in her life where she shouldn't have to have responsibility I have to tell you and again Back to evil everything this preaches is against Everything that we learned was good. It's the exact opposite Don't have responsibility. You don't have responsibility My I grew up in a world where take responsibility for your own life pull yourself You you can the world can throw manure on you all the time But how you react to it is what is going to make the Determining it will be the determining factor in your life That's no longer that's nonsense. That's that's white Power Well, I mean to give you an explicit example of that you're already hearing People suggesting and I've heard several people email me about this say even in the context of their therapy sessions where they've been raped And they have post-traumatic stress over their actual Rape and they're dealing with it and then their therapist tries to point out to them You know, they're saying they're raped by a black man This is a true story somebody sent me and they were discussing it with their therapist and the context of therapy and the therapist said Well, you have to think about the way systemic racism shaped those Those people's lives and so maybe they aren't fully responsible for what they did and you shouldn't put responsibility on them that would Responsibleize them you see it with these new movements now I don't know if you've seen just in the last few days the idea of considering crime as a social construct crime doesn't really exist And if you understood the systems of poverty the systems of racism the systems of bigotry Then you would understand why people say break into homes and steal things or loot a store or you know, whatever else And so these people can't be held responsible. We saw that literally with the looting that followed george floyd's death people were saying well, look at the Systemic racism they can't be held responsible for the material conditions of their lives So obviously they're going to turn to these kinds of actions or they're going to turn to crime because they can't be held responsible So saying no what you need to actually be responsible and not loot a target You need to be responsible and not shoot people that was also under this within the context here of race Would also count as responsibleizing people and so this taps into literally the defund the police in the prison abolition movements Saying that those people can't be held responsible because racism is what made them into criminals and the calling them criminals applies a Straight out of fucot a disciplinary term to them that is Socially constructed and unfair and meant to just control their black and brown bodies This is literally the way they use language and think about the world So the other the other things are genocide exclusion science fascism identity I thought I could like genocide, I mean Trying to kill everybody of a certain race That's not how it's that's not what that is anymore Well, it's that and it's also the idea that you would in some way wipe out a Cultural identity so say for example That you were to encourage all fat people to lose weight. There are no fat people. There's no fat identity That's a fat genocide or you were to cure deafness That's a deaf genocide because there are no deaf people in no deaf culture or if you were to say Teach say that you have a hypothesis like we see in critical race theory that science is white supremacist So you were to encourage black people to think scientifically that would take them out of their whatever black cultural context or maybe it's south african You know we can talk about those actually a movement there called science must fall That said that science was a colonizing way of thinking that was displacing traditional knowledge And so it would be a genocide of those cultures to teach them to think scientifically Because those cultures would no longer exist the way that they did previous part is that is savage all of that I mean part of that is we should have some conversation. I have a daughter with cerebral palsy I wouldn't wish that on anybody However She's changed me. She's changed she is a remarkable individual because she has it It is a heavy cross that tears my heart out almost on a daily basis But should we reverse all uh You know birth or genetic defects. I mean I As a dad, I say yes as somebody who looks at issues and it's a way to you Make you or the people around you better if you if you adapt to it I say no I mean so we should have that conversation, but it's we don't have these conversations. They just happen right I don't think it helps the conversation So, I mean that there's a simple line where as so long as somebody is sound enough of mind to have power of attorney over themselves They should be allowed to make those decisions if somebody's deaf and wants to remain deaf even in light of a technology They shouldn't right forced correct to take it and if they want to to lean into that culture around being deaf That's perfectly acceptable and there's a lot of strength and there's a lot of wisdom There's a lot of opportunity to learn and learn more about each other in the world in that And so it can be made into an individual choice But turning it into a collective choice and then to shame people say if say there was some magic treatment that could Change your your daughter's cerebral palsy and it were to come along and you you brought it to her and said well What do you think and she was like I? Want that? I? Definitely want that? There's nowhere in the universe that it can possibly be right to try to shame her for wanting that But if she also said, you know, I like who I am. I don't want that There's all it's not inappropriate to shame them that way either There's only what's appropriate is to give them make the most informed choice possible which means getting to the bottom of objective truths about the situation and then Conveying those truths to people and then letting them make up their own minds That's that's the line. That's what we grew up with. That's the line that actually works And when you start thinking in terms of collectives like that she would be betraying that disabled community right by Using a different life force right that's horrific horrific Let me then when you do this with theory. That's not even real. I mean, it's even worse. So Let me let me just leave you with some Kipling here. I'd love to get your thoughts on this Kipling wrote a a poem called the gods of the copybook headings. It's one of my favorite poems and I He wrote it after the progressives and the Fabian socialist Really moved on world war one and they tried to make this utopia in Europe and it just led all these deaths and And he wrote it as a warning for future generations And it's the gods of the copybook headings are the things that we knew were true You know, you would write, you know, water will wet fire will burn. God is good and you would copy those for your your penmanship and Let me let me just uh, let me just pick it up in the middle With the hopes that our world is built on that they were utterly out of touch They denied the moon was stilton. They denied she was even Dutch They denied that wishes were horses. They denied that pigs had wings So we worship the gods of the market who promised us all of these beautiful things When the kambrian measures were forming they promised perpetual peace They swore if we gave them our weapons that the wars of the tribes would cease But when we disarmed they sold us and delivered us bound to our foe And the gods of the copybook heading said stick to the devil you know On the first feminine sandstones we were promised promised the fuller life Which started by loving our neighbor and ended by loving his wife Till our women had no more children and the men had lost their reason in faith And the gods of the copybook heading said the wages of sin is death In the carboniferous epic we were promised abundance for all by robbing selected peter to pay for collective paul But though we had plenty of money there was nothing our money could buy And the gods of the copybook headings said if you do not work you will die Then the gods of the market tumbled and their smooth tongue wizards withdrew And the hearts of the menist were humbled and began to believe it was true That all is not golden that glitters and two and two do make four And the gods of the copybook headings limped up to explain it once more As it will be in the future it was at the birth of man There are only four things certain since social progress began That the dog returns to his vomit and the sau returns to its mire And the burnt fool's bandage finger goes wobbling back to the fire And after this is accomplished and the brave new world begins When all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins As surely as water will wet us As surely as fire will burn The gods of the copybook headings with terror and slaughter return Yeah That's uh Oddly prophetic. Yeah, it is Is it and very hard to find i've only found it in one book They've done everything they could to erase this poem I think is You know the in your book You talk about the solution and It's it is the solution it is the common sense solution Um, it is the solution we all have been taught and now seemingly are rejecting Is it going to take terror and slaughter To return to those things? One hopes not and I don't think that it has gone that far yet Um, and we hope that that Doesn't come about but people actually do have to understand what's happening The the reason that that poem seems prophetic. It's not prophetic. It understands It understands the dynamics of a certain thing and when that thing is put into practice the what What is going to go? It's it's the theme of the poem that which is going to come from that is what is going to come of that And so there's no prophecy there and uh, is also of course a reminder that that reality Is going to bat last and it you you can't Manipulate the situation to get away from the reliable consequences of bad theory. So we are in a Crucial moment and I mean that literally in the sense of a crooks a point an inflection point in history Where if the if people can quickly begin to understand What is happening? What this ideology actually is Of social justice anti-racism diversity. These all sound great The branding is awesome black lives matter branding is perfect If you can look inside the box and realize wait a minute. This is Definitely not What we're signing up for These good things that it the the the glitter of the the not gold is is Not what's really going on here and people are willing to say No Things that work Are not inherently racist things that work are not inherently sexist Society functioning is not actually fascist. This is Lunacy and we're not going to play by these rules. We're not going to keep being rolled by this We're not going to have to keep giving into this and the mob on twitter will not make us Then maybe there's a chance that we can avoid The catastrophe that that we really don't Want to have come as the reset Um a few people have died. I don't think that it's necessary that any more die But we have to remember What principles you know people need to I I've gone back and read a little bit again of the federalist papers People need to go read this people need to understand the constitution They need to understand the declaration of independence They need to understand the basic principles of how checking of each by each and accepting the fact that when you lose the argument because the experiment said That your hypothesis was wrong That that's okay and actually good when people start to remember how we built ourselves out of medievalism Clawing our way 500 years out of medievalism and then they can see that this theory leads to medievalism again rooted in Something like ethnic Gnosticism They can then decide no We're staying with modernity. We're not going back to to a medieval system We're not giving in to to these little petty dictators and their fiefdoms Uh, and we can avoid the violence that will come if they keep pushing. I don't want to take this amazing conversation and Turn it political or especially leave it political. Um, so you answer this question any way you want Um I've heard people say all the time. Uh, it doesn't make a difference who you vote for. They're all the same Um You know, I'm hearing it's all kinds of stuff does Does it matter and you don't have to get into who but does it matter Who wins in this election? Will that will this election Change things For the good or for the worse? I You can't suddenly see no good options in this election. I see no good options Uh, it will matter and it will matter Either way and I think that um, we have to hope That enough people realize that we are now on a train that is barreling down the tracks and about to shoot off the edge of the cliff To realize that we have to not invest as deeply in The outcome of the election as we are likely to culturally that said I'm very worried In particular and I say this as a lifelong liberal who does not want to be political I'm very worried about what will happen if biden wins the selection. I'm very worried about it because I see No, I don't see breaks on the train anywhere, but I see the accelerator pedal Yeah, over there and I don't necessarily even see it in biden himself. I just I don't I don't see it in the architecture around him Yeah, and the fact that the that most of this ideology operates administratively, which is why in some sense it matters And in some sense it doesn't because even under trump Even under any other president if some you know rogue third candidate were to come into the situation And sweep up all of the electoral votes somehow by you know some active of thought experience magic The administration underneath is still the Level of like kind of middle management, which is still pretty big at the federal government is where most of these changes are taking place And unless that gets straightened out There's there's nothing Good down this road that said As much as I hate to say it one of the two candidates seems to put up resistance and one of the two candidates seems to accelerate that process And I'm horrified. I'm horrified because I feel like I can vote for neither James I I can't thank you enough for being honest and brave and Just being who you were meant to be and I'm not Slinking away in the darkness. Um, these are the times that Produce the men and women that eventually civilizations build statues to remember because While they're afraid And while they may know that no good is probably going to come from my standing up They do it anyway and you make a big difference and uh, I'm I'm I don't know if you feel the same way But I consider you a friend and I'm honored to be your friend And I feel that way about you for sure Glenn I I said it many times before I don't agree with you on many things But I would love it if you were my next door neighbor. Yeah me too. Me too. We'd have a we'd have great conversations Thank you. Uh, the name of the book is cynical theories How activist scholarship made everything about race gender and identity and why this harms everybody It's uh by Helen pluck rose and James linsey James. Thank you Thanks, Glenn. Goodbye Just a reminder, I'd love you to rate and subscribe to the podcast and pass us on to a friend so it can be discovered by other people You"
