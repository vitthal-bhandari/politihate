    "text": " Hey podcast today. I don't know kind of a passionate one wouldn't you say Stu? Yeah, yeah, I I thought so have you have you said a word today on the stage? They just keep blabbing and blabbing and blabbing. I got a lot to get off my chest. You love this podcast But it's brought you by relief factor look if you're in pain get out of pain get out of pain Oh, yeah, you've tried probably everything under the Sun to get out of pain You've gone to doctor after doctor. You don't have anything that'll work for you I've been there brother, and I didn't think this would work for me. It's relief factor my wife made me order it Relief factor three week quick start 1995. It's a trial pack Hundreds of thousands of people have ordered it and about 70% of them go on to order more and that's me because I'm out of pain relief factor calm call 800 the number four relief 800 four relief or relief factor calm here's a podcast You're listening to the best of the men back program yesterday I Got a phone call I Want you to know that you're gonna see very few posts from me or any of your blaze family in your Facebook news feed moving forward and You deserve to know why? Tucker Carlson had the the release of the January 6 footage And I spoke to Tucker Carlson and I posted and we posted the video to Facebook so you could see it in case you missed Well yesterday We got a a a note on our page This contains partly false information checked by independent fact checkers See why? So Then we got a notice partially false information and a post shared by your Page contains same information as a post check by independent fact checkers It may have small differences, but the fact checkers had political facts They information about the post shared by Glenn Beck is partially false to stop the spread of face news We've added a notice to your post Okay, fine Well Man, we started talking about it. We started looking into it and Here's what they the propagandist Tell us is a fake post They sent us a warning Several said that my page is now going to be reduced in distribution because of this false information What is false? In the video stew you lying liar how you lie all the time? We discussed the the curious case of Ray Epps The man who was seen egging on the January 6th January 6 protesters. He did it the night before He did it the day of He was seen on videotape doing it. He was seen whispering in the ear of somebody Just before that somebody went and pushed back the police He then wrote a note to his nephew saying I orchestrated it I orchestrated it he was on the top five most wanted list and then suddenly Everything's okay, and the New York Times writes this glowing piece about how Ray Epps is just He's a good guy and everybody needs to leave him alone what Okay, so we brought this up we brought this up But the lying hacks at PolitiFact admitted that yes, Epps did send the text however It's mostly false. Why? Because Ray Epps testified to the January 6 committee that he didn't really mean it Oh I didn't oh, thank goodness you've let me know that You know, it's weird is I remember if anybody would post that Glen Beck isn't a racist They would probably fact check that because you know I was a racist for saying on television That I thought Obama was a racist. However Even though my career and everything else was smeared by these lying fatheads And they still smear me today on this Even though I said the very next Sentence no, that's not right It don't mean that I just mean he seems to have some okay, I Said no He's not a racist. That's not right. But did I get a break for that? But Ray Epps a guy who's on the FBI Most wanted list whose scene doing all the things that are illegal inciting violence that's illegal inciting violence they just take his word for it Ha and that doesn't raise anybody's eyebrows nobody's like oh no No, no, no, we know so much about Ray Epps. He's a good guy. Wait wasn't he like one of the big I don't know grand dragons or whatever it is for oath keepers Haven't you smeared oath keepers and said they are the worst they're worse than Donald Trump Okay, but he was running it and Yet you believe that he didn't mean it. Oh, okay. What? That's why I said yesterday When they said all you have to do is issue a correction and take it back and we'll Get rid of all of the penalties all of them and you're you'll be allowed to be read by your people and it will be great I said go screw yourself. I Am not changing my opinion. I am not changing the facts Those are the facts You let the American people decide if they should take ray Epps at his word or not What the January 6th committee which yesterday admitted that they hadn't watched the tapes They're going to be the arbiter of truth now government is the arbiter of truth Do you know why we have a first amendment? It's not so I can say things, you know out on the street corner It's so I can question what's going on in Washington That is that is not just my right. It is my duty to question the government Something's not right These people are no more than propagandists Liars malignant despicable liars So when I was given the option of the correction I said no no but then Blaze The blaze was notified that Well, that'll affect more than just you Glenn Facebook says they have to take me I have to hit all I mean they're gonna they're gonna have to hit Steve Dase too What why why why did Steve what does Steve have to do it? Well y'all work together at the blaze so? Everybody is gonna have to pay that price and so I said to the blaze Well, I know where I stand but I don't want everybody else to pay the price So you do whatever you want and they laughed oh We're telling them to go to hell. I just wanted you to know Okay, all right We are the media they are drowning The next thing that you're gonna see them do mark my words They are going to try to get government money to keep their head above water They're not going to be able to make it anymore There are more people listening to me on my radio show Then they're watching cable news right now That's insanity That is a national cable network that is in 95% of the homes Nobody's watching it Thus with nobody watching they can't sell advertising and Without advertising they can't pay the bills, but we're so darn important. I'm telling you you watch They will start getting money from the government and Then you'll be able to trust them for sure because Everybody questions the person who's giving them money to stay alive We Are in the battle of good and evil truth and lies There is no neutral anymore either you fight for the truth or you enable lies We're about to go into some of our biggest battles we've ever had and I've had big battles I Would like to ask you to become a blaze TV subscriber today You are truly the lifeblood of everything we do without you We are at the complete mercy of big tech We are at the complete mercy that someone will throw us a bone and give us a break I Don't want to hand out I want equal justice I want my first amendment rights not just as I'm gonna use this word because the the head of the San Francisco enquirer we had an argument about it. He insisted I was a journalist I said no, I'm a commentator.

You're always trying to shove your god down my throat, you know, so okay Jesus did this Jesus did that whatever keep it yourself, man. You have no right to put that in schools Are you putting that in schools man? It's called separation of church instead hello During a recorded appropriations and budget meeting Democrat Oklahoma Oklahoma State Rep Regina Goodwin referred to the diversity equity and inclusion agenda as God What was she didn't mean it her comments were in response to house bill 2077 an education transparency bill introduced by Republicans Called Wells legislation would require Oklahoma Department of Education to allow parents now listen how crazy this gets allow parents Allow parents to review their schools curriculum on an online transparency portal Okay Now he's saying this is simple middle of the road common sense solutions let parents Find out exactly what's being taught in the schools so we can stop all this nonsense and Back and forth of what's being done? What's not? Let's just put it all on a portal for the parents Look at the oppression That would ruin the surprise surprise your kids a communist that would totally ruin it well He's not a communist she's a communist now. So there's two surprises. Yeah, there's also the gender reveal The bill would support parental rights to access review and comment upon curriculum instructional materials textbooks and library materials being used by the school district where the child attends She pushed back on the legislation calling it a very controversial bill. It would burden educators with government overreach Well, there it is It's very disturbing State superintendent unable to do with diversity equity and inclusion DEI is a deity Diversity equity and inclusion is God end quote I think I've heard about this Trinity thing, but I don't think it's what you think it is That's not that not that Trinity. Yeah, so there it is. It's a god. Are you not shoving your religion down my throat man? Now there also is a another story that I I felt I needed to bring to you today quoting a genderqueer shapeshifter Gave a professional development training session to educators within the Colorado school district detailing the do's and don'ts with language around trans identity and the importance of pronouns Now a lot of people might start discussing that I'd like to go back to the first three words a genderqueer shapeshifter Then gave a professional development training session I I mean, I don't know what genderqueer even means really I know Okay, old's You know, I get it I'm just an old guy and all these new fancy terms your genderqueer which has existed since the beginning of time We're just brave enough to come out and say yeah, I'm genderqueer in my days queer was an insult sorry By the way Glenn genderqueer a person whose gender identity does not correspond to conventional binary gender Distinctions, okay, or would that just be non binary? I know you are so what's the bigoted? Full of ignorance and hate the ignore. I will say in this yes I am full of ignorance the the genderqueer thing was not as disturbing to me as the third word right? shapeshifter right Well, I think what's happening is we're spending so much time on pronouns were forgetting about verbs and like regular nouns Could you just look up shapeshifter for me? What is the definition of the word? I think I know what it is but I'd like to know what a Shape shifter is that doesn't conform to usual binary sex now I could look at shapeshifter From a dictionary which is which says it is a person or being with the ability to change their physical format Will mostly in fantasy fiction or mythology however? I am seeing an lgbtq definition of shapeshifter. Okay. We should try that one Yes, sure. Let's say I want to learn Let's see shape Yeah, it's now then they won't give me it they won't let you in no, they're not letting me in Huh, what is the difference between non binary and genderqueer? We have that answer now. I don't need to know that I want to know what an lgbtq I two plus I I x y 9 7 8 u Is Defining as a shapeshifter. I mean, I've got a reddit thread I read a thread with this question. Are shapeshifters inherently trans or gender fluid? That's a great question a great idea. I don't know. I answer to it. Well, anyway, I just feel like the ads I will be served if I click on this for the next six months makes me just not that dedicated to something Have you been to blaze the blaze tv.com have you been there? Yes, I have already on a list so go ahead This one might take you off that list. Oh, he's open-minded Uh, anyway, the the name of this shapeshifter is sialene wellington a self-described genderqueer shapeshifter and artist of people Now I like to know what an artist of people is because In my day that would have been somebody that said hello clairies I Am an artist of people So I don't know what that means, but I'm glad they are doing professional training At some of our schools here in america that is Fantastic just fantastic so dei is god uh Genderqueer shapeshifters are giving professional trainings to our teachers Uh 3.2 million us children attend public schools that conceal students gender identities from the parents. Oh Okay, well that I mean is that so bad? I mean what are the odds? That's one of your kids, you know and screw the other people's kids It's only 3.2 remember when they said none of this was happening that doesn't exist There's no such thing as crt and dei Conspiracy theorists all and then it was oh, okay. Well, but it's not what they say it is Uh-huh then it was But it's not being taught in most schools We're down to 3 and a half million us Children are in a public school That's policy is to conceal the gender identity of the students to their parents Well, you're just a bigot Oh, so all the things you denied were even happening all the thing Now that we're there and and it's clear and everybody's like I I mean The teacher with a big bazumbas is the shop teacher now and I am it really it's not happening Well, it's happening, but you're just a bigot. Oh, okay. Okay. Why did you work so hard to say it wasn't happening Is it because you knew? all of america Needed to be kind of led to that water you needed to make it political So you could shut the brains down of half of the people in america. So you just had it This is a conspiracy from conspiracy. These hard right Lunatics who are trying to jam their religion and and they're they're Crazy anti government ideas and they're brainwashed people You needed to have that going for a while so we could argue about that and then eventually when you're like Of course, we've always been teaching this What of course gender neutral is something that's been around forever And half the population goes yes It's been around forever and you're a bigot if you're against it This totally new thing you just came up with has always been true And how many times are we supposed to believe that by the way? I do have shapeshifter? Okay, good because I've got another headline for you. Okay as many shapeshifters can change sex willingly So it starts wait wait wait wait as many shapeshifters can change sex willingly willingly They may jump the gender barrier to accommodate a lover Or just for a change of pace. I believe that's bisexual Okay, no Hold on. Okay. All right. Okay, because they may be able to shift to a form which is completely sexless or Can I just ask you does the the the weenie pop in like a belly button all of a sudden I mean is that what happens all of a sudden? Okay, it's gone. Mm-hmm And then what you take your finger and Blow on that like a balloon and pops back out and this is ridiculous They may be able to shift to a form which is completely sexless or has facets of both sexes. Can I tell you something? That's what I find so attractive, you know, something that's completely sexless I'm like because I I made love to a cardboard box last night that was so hot because it had no Identity whatsoever. Mm-hmm. I was like You're a square but I could make you kind of into a flat piece of nothing Or a square Or I could kind of bend the corners and make it into a circle. It was a shape shifter and we had sex all night Sounds uh sounds erotic. Yeah, doesn't it? Um, okay, try this one on for it. Do you have more? I'm gonna give you this last sentence, which I can't even comprehend. Okay Um, so after they say that the the be able to shift to a form which is completely sexless or has facets of both sexes Because of this it's it's somewhat common for shape shifters to be able to be willing to get it on with either sex especially This is the especially part especially if their sexuality Is tied to their current sex. I have no idea what that means It's this kind of ignorance that we set this country back for And yeah hundreds of years. Maybe we should set the country back. Didn't you say something about default settings earlier on the show? Yes, it did. It's time to unplug it and plug it back in restore to factory settings I'd like that just to be you know, I would really like that to be a campaign slogan for the GOP, you know GOP headquarters I would Have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in? All right, uh Last last headline and I'm gonna give you a time. I'm gonna give you the headline and then you explain it to me Sex positive fat activist Says man men with rape kink Should be able to pay to drug consenting women To drug consent consenting women women are consenting to the drugging and the sex and the rape okay? Because well no the men have a rape kink so I you decide I don't know I want to know what a sex positive fat activist is first. Maybe we could start there In 60 seconds. It's hard to improve on perfection Hahaha, but we're doing it as a country, aren't we? We are reimagining everything and it is working out. I mean look at the test results so far the best of the bread back program Bill O'Reilly is with us now. Hi bill. How are you? I'm just finishing up writing killing the witches. So I'm annoyed. It's hard work back. I know I know Writing a book is hard. I know you know we have a quite an extensive Library on Salem if you you want to check anything or No, thank you. I wish I had known that beforehand, but I think we've got it all down and just smoothing it out So glenbeck will enjoy it. I will hate to disprove anything though. I need to do that So bill o'Reilly from bill O'Reilly dot com is on with us once killing the witches come out September 26 just some time for halloween. You know, we're gonna scare all the kids. Okay. Um, I want to talk to you Um, I want to talk to you about What's happening with tucker karleson. Did you watch the reports this week? Yes and your thoughts well I I come at it differently than uh, mr. karleson or the Corporate media that's trying to destroy him and fox news I'm pretty much a fact-based guy So my analysis of the january 6 Capital intrusion is non-political has nothing to do with ideology and that separates me from almost everyone including tucker karles So I start with 150 police officers being hurt on that day That's that's where that's ground zero for me. All right. So that defines the riot then as a violent event Even though most of the 2500 who trespassed into the capital were not violent Right. It's exactly the same thing that happened in the george floyd riots. Thank you mostly peaceful Yeah, most of the demonstrators Um were not violent. However, the level of violence was halation. Yes, it was They didn't they didn't burn a city down But it was inexcusable awful Hylacious whatever term you want to get those people should go to jail. Okay, 7,000 people had to go to the hospital During the george floyd riots, right 7,000 right 2 billion plus and insured property damage those are claims This is in the george floyd 95% of those arrested in douse, philadelphia, usan and l.a Had the charges dropped and some of them were bailed out by Kamala Harris, right and her her group organization So we don't know because it's all local if anybody Served time in prison for these riots. Okay. So those are the facts And they were misreported By the corporate media Because the corporate media sympathized With the protesters, okay The famous thing was the uh cnn reporter stand in front of the burning building going a it's mostly peaceful but Buildings right right right okay So then you go into the capital situation you have the same thing but not on that's a massive level where you have Some americans who believe this was not that bad This capital riot was not that bad and when you say that when you say that Um, it wasn't in comparison to blm, but I didn't want either of them. They both are bad Yes, but there's like different hook toward the capital riot Because that Injured the united states worldwide Okay, so did the so did the floyd riots to some extent, but not like that So that all the enemies of america She so I use that correct say oh look at this country. This this country is out of control their own people Don't like their government the propaganda anti american stuff and that will go down in history Okay, so wait wait, we agree we agree all that stuff we agree Now let's talk about the tapes the tapes that don't have any sound that the january six committee added sound to be more powerful And the three cases that uh tucker carlson showed ray apse he lied to the committee And and he's part of oath keepers why was he just excused and a puff piece going to the new york times the uh the guy with the horns the shaman uh, you know, it's it's It's hyperbole to say he was on a tour, but they weren't Deescalating him he was in the midst of nine police officers at one point And they did open the doors tried to get into the lock senate door and then moved around and opened the door for him to go in That what why what did he do exactly? That uh warrants four years. I just like to know Well, I mean, I think his lawyer and we try to contact his lawyer by the way who blew us off completely so i'm not real sympathetic um to him the lawyer I think that Could be absolutely appealed to a federal judge today And said The shaman was denied due process because this tape was not allowed to be introduced and it shows He was not violent That uh capital police officers and they were trying to de-intensify the situation no doubt about that They didn't think that he was a danger. So why is he serving four years? So and I think he could get out of jail today If that petition were made by a responsible attorney, which I don't think he had so here's built Here's the here's the thing I think this story is important not because of what happened on that day with the violence Okay, I want and you want the left ones everybody wants the people that were violent To go to jail What I want to know is Why did they escort this guy into the senate? Why who are ray eps? Where's the pipe bomber? Where are these people that we can't seem to find yet? We can find people in Alaska that were walking on the mall that day Um, well, and you don't have subpoena power back so you're not gonna be able to answer All right, but what I'm saying is this should be the question on every person's mind in america I don't disagree with that right. So what is it gonna take to get them there? Or are we just so locked in our positions that nothing's gonna change? well, something may change if Biden and his administration lose in 24, but not until then Because the attorney general is corrupt. We've gone over this Merrick garland is going to selectively prosecute based on ideology and politics. That's what the man is going to do 10 years ago bill anybody can do While he holds power 10 years ago if I would have told you Just of the revelations that we have found from whistleblowers Just this week about the justice department and fbi Would you have believed that that would be true? It is an american tragedy That the chief law enforcement apparatus in his country the fbi is a corrupt agency now And they're the guy who oversees it is worse than they are The attorney general and he was almost a supreme court justice But the democratic party does not care. I mean this january 6th committee was as um partisan And useless It was just stunning. They didn't want to know anything other than trump did it right? They didn't want to know anything else one more one more one more thing on this the committee releases this josh holly Video That is stunning bill Would you not fire? Anyone who brought you that video represented it the way it did and then you find out that it's That that's not the case. No, they they cut the video To show that holly running but they didn't have all the other right so here's my question on this Why would they do something this petty if it's the most important thing hey holly and and and that committee was run by shift and uh What's her name from Wyoming? chaney, I mean I hate him But this just goes to show you that the american people now have to step back and they can't they don't have any Anybody with a brain knows we don't have confidence in our law enforcement apparatus at the federal level Okay, they they're not Doing the job it is insane whether it's twitter Whether it's uh enforcing the law Equally which you're compelled to do by the constitution. They're not doing it It's all politicized now and it goes all the way back to komi and Underbiden who doesn't even know this is happening by the way, but didn't even know it's going on Crazy read my message of the day on bill o'riley.com today. All right. I mean the man does not know What is happening day to day in this country?
