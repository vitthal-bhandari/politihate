Discover the new 5 now. BMW.com.sg All right, let's do this. How are you? What the fuckers? What the fuck buddies? What the fuck nicks? How's it going? Are you okay? Welcome to my podcast. This is WTF. My name is Mark Merrin. How's that? How are you? Welcome. Welcome to the show. My name is Mark. The show is called WTF with Mark Merrin. Many of you saw that I reposted the Gilbert Godfrey episode from 2012 and I'll tell you man, it's a rare thing in any field. It's a rare thing in people that you really meet somebody who is one of a kind, like truly one of a kind. Like there's nobody like that guy. I mean, people are unique. Yeah, and some people have personalities right. Maybe I'm talking just in my field. I don't know. I don't think so. But the thing you got to appreciate about Gilbert, whether you liked it or not, or whether you thought it was a gimmick or not, or whether it wasn't for you, is that there was nobody like Gilbert Godfrey. True original, one of a kind. And I would say New Yorker. I would put that on him. He came out of that cauldron and you know who he is and well, you knew who he was. But there was no one like him. True, true original comedic talent. He'll be missed. He was a good guy. That said, I'm out here in the world plying my comedy wares. I'm tonight. I'm in Terrytown, New York at the Terrytown musical tomorrow. I'll be in Providence. That's Friday. Providence, Rhode Island, the Columbus Theater. This Saturday, I'll be in Boston at the Wilbur for two shows. And then I'll end up in Portland, Maine at the State Theater on Sunday, April 17th. And then the next weekend, I'm at the Moon Tower Comedy Festival in Austin, Austin, Texas, Friday, April 22nd. And I've got upcoming shows in Madison, Milwaukee, Chicago, Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., and a lot more. And I'll be adding some as well. So you can go to wtfpod.com slash tour for ticket links and other info. And look, a couple of things I need to remind people of because of I'm not going to blame anybody for anything. But the first one you know, because of parasocial relationships or people thinking they know me or have a connection to me that makes them vulnerable to catfishing, I guess it's called. There's if you follow me on Instagram or on Twitter, there is only one handle. There's only one account on each of those at Mark Marin at M.A.R.C. M.A.R.O.N. for both Twitter and Instagram. If anything else comes at you from Instagram, someone messages you. Mark Marin 456, Mark Marin official, Mark Marin authentic, Mark Marin 789, Mark Marin the official page. It's not me. Don't don't interact. Don't send them money. Don't give them your address. Don't sleep with them. Because it's not me. I would think that you would know that by the time you got to wherever you were going. And I don't believe that's what they're after. I don't know. Or maybe the lead up is enough for you. And you're like, well, I don't know the I thought it was Mark Marin. I might as well just go ahead and go through with this. There is no there's only one account on both of those. And I'm not on Facebook. There's a fan page here. I don't have much to do with it. Okay. The other thing buying tickets for shows go to wtfpod.com slash tour. Don't Google Mark Marin Portland, Maine or Mark Marin, Boston, because you're going to get scalper sites. I do not charge $300 for a ticket or get them at the box office. That's the only way you can guarantee they're not scalpers. And I think some of these scalpers buy up tickets and try to sell them. I'm the wrong guy to do that too. So they're just going to be stuck with tickets and I'm going to be stuck with empty seats. But make sure you're at the theater's site or the appropriate place to buy the tickets. All right. Just so you I'm not, I don't want you to get priced out of something that I'm not pricing you out of. Okay. That said, Harvey Fierstein is here. Harvey Fierstein is here. And I read his memoir. I was better last night and I have a lot to say about it. But let me put that on hold of for a minute. I just wanted to make sure that you knew he was here. So Paige Stark, who has been an LA musician for years and she had a band or it has a band to shocky Miyaki. I met her through, I don't know how I met her. I think she sent me some records or her people did. But anyways, we we've been playing together a bit and she wanted to do, she wanted me to be on this record with her. And I don't know what the benefit is for, but I'll talk about it when it happens. But the idea was to find Los Angeles songs. And I just didn't want to do all the any of the normal ones. So I was poking around a bit and we found this song by Arthur Lee in love. And it's called Sign DC. And it's this sort of dope heroin song kind of dirgy dark thing. And I just recorded it in a studio. Very exciting playing guitar, singing, playing some harmonica. Not great. Not great on the harmonica. Pretty sloppy. I'm pretty good at the explosive slop. I think that'll be the name of my record, explosive slop. I guess that's kind of gross. It's kind of like kind of scatty. But so that that happened. It was very exciting. Now, okay, let's talk about Harvey. Can we talk about Harvey? I don't always read the books, but I needed to read the harvies. I didn't anticipate reading at all. But I couldn't put it down. It's a great book. Okay, it's a great book. Now, Harvey, Firestein, you know him from torch song trilogy from La Cajah fall. You know him from a hairspray, the theatrical production, you may know him from fiddler on the roof. You might know him from Mrs. Doubtfire and some of his acting roles. He's been a gay activist for a long time. But he's Harvey Firestein. He's Harvey Firestein. He's a single, a force of nature. Harvey is now. I got to be honest with you. Now, I'm not coming out. But I can't deny a past and present fascination with the lives that the generation of gay men that Harvey is from had. And you know, to be honest, there was a guy that had a profound influence on my life from that generation, Professor Gary or Gell. Now, I don't know what happened to Gary. I believe he passed away. And it's sad that I don't know that because I didn't really stay in touch with him because I don't know that the relationship we had was particularly appropriate or whether I'm comfortable with it in retrospect, but not unlike many of the male mentors I've taken on in my life, whether they be, you know, bullies or abusive or sexually compelled. You know, I walk away from them, particularly with, with, with Gary and particularly with Sam, Kenneson. These are people that had a profound influence on my life. I don't know why I was kind of a let loose in the world looking for father figures, but I was, I had a dad, but he wasn't that present. And when he was, he was kind of explosive and boundaryless. Oh, I think we just answered the question. That's why. But nonetheless, Gary was a big, tall gay man with a handlebar mustache, who always were, you know, jeans that were very tight and like had a lot of cock showing and a suit and a little bow tie. And he taught philosophy, the guy. And I took an existentialism class in college. I guess it was probably my sophomore year of college. And I didn't know anything about anything. I was kind of nebulous identity wise. I always had my anger and my intensity and I think my sense of humor, but you know, things weren't going great for me sexually when I was younger. But I guess I had some juice. I had that young dude juice, but I wasn't, you know, I didn't, I didn't have much game, we should say. So Gary, he was this big dude who had a big presence. He used to be a lawyer, a Wall Street lawyer come from a family of New York real estate, a bit of New York real estate and a hardware store. But nonetheless, I all remember that his, his family, his mother's family once owned the building, the Carnegie deli was in, but he was very charismatic guy, charismatic teacher. I didn't know anything about existentialism. I'm not sure I do now. I don't think the papers I wrote made any sense. I don't think I really wrapped my brain around it. But I was taken with a professor or gal because I want, I want to be like that guy to have that kind of intelligence and that kind of wit and that kind of presence. You know, I was aspirational. So I guess I, you know, I showed up at class kind of eager and I don't know if it was misread. I'm not sure I knew what I was putting out necessarily, but you know, we went out to lunch and we sort of became friends in retrospect. And I think even at the time, I think he had a pretty big crush on me. But I loved hearing the stories. That generation of gay men have the greatest stories. Why wouldn't I be fascinated with, you know, just fucking in the bushes? Why wouldn't I be fascinated with, you know, guys walking around in drag? Why wouldn't I be fascinated with leather? You know, dudes wearing the leather? You know, I saw cruising when I was in high school. I had no idea what that was. I did not feel gay, but I did feel sort of like, man, this is a fucking life. These dudes know who they are. And that is true. They did know who they were. But I just always found it fascinating. The lifestyle of the guys that defined the gay community at that time when it needed definition. And part of that definition came explicitly from the sexuality because they had to, you know, plant themselves like that up against a very repressive world when Stonewall happened. And when, you know, they had to say, you know, fuck you, we're here. And this is what we are. This is who we are. This is what we do. The whole thing was just electric to me. Though I didn't want cock. Now I'm not saying I didn't make out with a guy or two at different points in time, maybe a stage true party. I'm not going to deny or confirm that. But nonetheless, you know, Gary became sort of a mentor, but not really a mentor, uh, uh, academically, but just lifestyle wise, he was the guy, the first guy I knew that kind of taught himself how to cook. We, you know, he'd have dinner parties. I'd be over there. We'd go over there for dinner. Me and my girlfriends went over there for dinner at different times. And just a guy that was very capable and sophisticated, like classical music, which I never took to. But just the way he owned space and was, uh, you know, a good cook, a good rack and tour, you know, something seemed to be elevated in terms of his understanding of things owned a building. I don't know. He was a powerful presence in my life. And I remember one time I stayed at their house. He was living with a guy named Michael. They were a good couple, great age appropriate, couple of old gay dudes. I don't know if I was doing comedy. I don't know what era it was, but he was with one Michael and they came. I don't want to tell him. I've told this on stage before. Maybe I haven't in a long time, but I'll tell it to you. Um, so they come home and they're all leathered up. They're all like the chaps and they got the jackets and the wearing hats and their shit faced. The two of them, uh, Gary and Mike, uh, Michael, Michael, who is the bottom. And, um, they're just drunk and I was sitting there at the table, you know, I had, and I was, uh, reading, I don't know what I was doing, but they came home drunk and I'm sitting there and I'm just staying at the house. And, uh, Michael just, you know, he gets on his knees and Gary's standing right there and he's like, just pee on my face. And I'm like, and, you know, I'm not comfortable with this and Gary's like, I'm sorry. We're going to go to bed and Michael's like, please just, just pee on my face. I'm like, I don't, I don't want, I don't want pee on your face. And this went on for a minute and, um, but there was a moment there where I'm, I, and this is a self judgment and also, you know, it might be a little bit homophobic, but if this is homophobic, what I'm telling you right now, I'll, I'll own it because there was a moment there. It's like, why don't you just pee on his face? I mean, it wouldn't make you gay, peeing on a guy's face. You're just peeing on a guy's face. I mean, you could have that experience. I did think that, but I chose not to, but, um, but then he asked me, so I want you to just pee in a cup and leave it for me. I'm like, that doesn't sound fun. I'm not doing that. Then eventually they went to bed, but good stories, exciting life. And Harvey's book, you know, goes all the way back, you know, to obviously he was to the fifties, but you know, he was there through all of it through the Warhol stuff, through the experimental gay theater, through the drag, through, uh, Stonewall and on and beyond. And he started in a very kind of crazy late sixties, early seventies, gay theater scene, experimental theater scene. I knew none of this. I knew him as a mainstream guy. I knew him as the guy that kind of mainstream drag for a mass consumption. I knew him as a character, but I, you know, his story is great and entertaining. And he's of this generation of gay men that they're not that many around anymore. These stories are rarely told shamelessly in the circles I run in, which are small, but it was great. It was a great book and it's a great story. And he, he, he, I just, I love an old shameless gay man who will tell those dirty stories. That said, Harvey showed up and, uh, and I sat him down and we had this conversation, uh, his new book, which I highly recommend because I enjoyed it, is, uh, I was better last night, a memoir. So this is me talking to Harvey Fierstein. If you don't know Harvey, you're gonna know him pretty quick. Bmw.com.sg You want to work hands? Want to work headphones? Don't be able to hear you. There you go. It's becoming a problem. I, I, I turned it to NPR when I put these on. You do? Yeah. Yeah. Hello. The price of, the price of soybeans will be the comforting. It hasn't been a good year for rain. The comforting tones of Harvey Fierstein. Exactly. I'm here to make sure you don't think the world is ending. Get some rest. Get some. Is the world ending? Seems like it, right? How you feeling about it? I'm gonna go with it. Yeah. Yeah. You've had your time. Exactly. It's, it's the next adventure. You know, I, I'm gonna turn 70 in June. 70. Yeah. 70 in June. I've been dead twice. Yeah. So, yeah. Not all that. But it seems like the next one will be for longer. I won't know. I know. I think about it more as I get older. Obviously. How old are you now? 58. I'm not that old, but I think about it. Yeah, you're old. Well, I mean, television land, you're old. I know. What is it? What, I mean, they, they, they, they're like 25, 26. They don't give a flag. I don't even know. I don't know who anyone is anymore. I can't. I mean, that's what I noticed happening is that like, you think you're part of it. Yeah. And then all of a sudden you're like, who the fuck are these people? Yeah, no, I, well, I have a, I have a way around that. Oh, yeah? What is it? Take an icon status. Why can't just, you know, decide that? Well, I'll, yeah. Now, but the first time somebody calls you something like that, a legend. Yes. Just embrace it. And then you don't have to know who anybody is. My mother could never remember anybody's name. Yeah. So everyone was darling. Yeah. Hello, Johnny. Hello, Johnny. This woman from Brooklyn. Hello, Johnny. Yeah. So I, so I picked that up rather early and call everybody cookie. Oh, that's good. Cookie. And where's cookie? I like pal. You like pal? Well, I mean, it's kind of, you know, pro, you have working class. It's better than guys. Hey, guys, fellas. What's up, fellas? You fellas are not enough fellas. Definitely not in my world. Fellas in my world is, is like, you've already pulled down this zipper. But cookie is fine. I like cookie. Cookie means I could fuck you. Yeah, I could not talk to you. It doesn't matter. You're cooking. It's not once you say, hey, cookie, it's, it's on them to have to do what you're going to do. Yeah, you've complimented them in some way. Who doesn't like a cookie? That's right. Everybody likes a cookie. Absolutely. So I read the whole book. Oh my God. You're the one. I am. I'm going to do that someday. Well, I actually had to read it for the audible. But I read the whole, yeah, oh, yeah, that's a process, isn't it? Yeah. When you be, oh, how many breaks did you have to take? Well, they told me it would take three days. Yeah. Because I'm so just like, it took me six. Oh, really? That's right. Well, it took me five days and I went back for a day of pickups. I, I don't, you know, I don't always read the books, but like I wanted to at least browse the book because I'm not a huge theater guy, but I know you because you're an icon. And thank you, cookie. And that's my mother would say, thank you, Joe. You're welcome. But, but I ended up reading the whole thing. It's great. It's beautifully written and it's, it's engaging. And it's like you thoughtful. I mean, it's not like you didn't just, you didn't, you didn't just, you know, do the thing. You didn't, you got into it. And you, you, you were real parts of yourself. And I think, I think what happens when I've written things is it felt to me like you were learning about yourself as you wrote about yourself. Yeah, maybe. Well, as I said, I just surely reclaims advice. Yeah, she's written like nine of these. I know. Who the fuck better listen to them? One for each life. Well, no, I think she said many more lives than that. She got bored. Yeah. You know how that cookie is. So, um, she said, let memory be your guide. Right. Let memory be the editor. Right. Um, there may be other books down the line. Yeah. But follow the line of your, of your memory. Yeah. As it takes you through this. And I said, I worry less about myself because I'm the one who decided to do this. Yeah. So it's okay to tell any story I want to tell about myself. Yeah. But how do I handle telling stories about other people? Sure. Especially the dead ones. Yeah. Especially the ones who died in their 20s and their teens who will never get to tell this story. Yeah. And I have this responsibility of telling this story. And she said, once again, let your memory be your guide. You're never, when you're writing a book like this, you're never really writing about anybody else. You're always writing about yourself. Yeah. And how they affected you. Right. So it's really the opposite of what I actually do for a living. Because when you write a play or maybe whatever, it's bad writing if the audience can figure out which one is you. Right. Right. You need to be writing your characters. You need to be true to your character. Yeah. And you know, then there are a lot of bad writers. We're in Hollywood now. It's not really a secret here. It's a lot of, it's a lot of really famous writers who are absolutely awful. Sure. Who only write one character and everybody else just gives them lines, feeds them lines so they can be the hero. That used to be called television. It is still called television. I can still name the name. Uh huh. And they're still the most successful people. Yeah. That's not good. Right. Yeah. And and so this was the opposite. Right. This all of a sudden was, I don't want to hear anybody's voice but yours. And when you're doing that, you have to have a certain amount of fuck it. I'm just going to tell the truth. Yeah. I mean, I, I mean, my experience with it and writing about my father once he read it in the book, it wasn't good. It wasn't I. No, it wasn't healing. It was healing for me maybe. But like he took a person and then I had a question myself, my intentions. You know, did I do this out of spite? I mean, it is the truth. But is it necessary? Well, I had a couple of people like that in the book. Yeah. One was Arthur Lawrence. He's dead. But Arthur was the kind of person that's that's my pants. Oh, you. Okay. So as long as it's me, I keep trying to turn everything off. And I should have. Do you have a sensor? Is it is in a medical condition with your pants right now? It says the cookies are done. Look at this picture of Charlie. Charlie Chaplin. And it's me. It looks like me. It does drive like you. You know, that's wait. That's Mansoor Verdu. Is that what it was called? Yeah, it's a French. Okay. So I'm going to put it on airplane mode. Okay. Good. That turns everything off. That should do God. Yeah. Now we're flying. Now we're flying. So yeah. Where was we? Oh, yeah. So when I was writing about Arthur Lawrence, who's a mean son of a bitch. Yeah. I also knew that Arthur had a real understanding of the truth. Yeah. And I knew that he in the long run wouldn't mind if I told terrible stories about him because he knew they were true. Right. He was the kind of person that in legend, I have copied him in legend. Yeah. In his living room, he had a drum table with a tablecloth on it. Yeah. And a lovely lamp and surrounding the lovely lamp were little beautiful little frames. Each one very different. And each one had a photograph of a friend of his. Yeah. And when he was mad at you, he turned the picture around. So you'd go in and whoever's picture was not showing your way, he was pissed at. That's the kind of gent he was. So I didn't feel bad about writing bad stuff about him. What was his job as he a producer? He wrote West Side Story. Oh, that guy. Yeah. Yeah. He wrote Gypsy. Oh, there. He wrote Turning Point. See, it's not amazing that you had this experience with all these guys. That mean that you worked with them. Oh, are you kidding? Oh, I have had one of the greatest lives ever. That's why do you think I wrote a book? It comes through in the book. Let me ask you some why who decided to put the coming out story at the end. Well, thank you for ruining that for people about to read the book. Is that a spoiler? I'm not going to tell you. No, you're not going to tell. Sorry. The um, how to fight with with that with the interviewer who kept trying to tell. Say, could you please not tell us? Oh, nobody really loves this. Could you please not tell us? Right. I want them to get over how to get to know you down anyway. Yeah. Cookie. Yeah. As I was writing the book, it came to me. Yeah. That's where it belonged. Huh. Because of the reaction seen towards only again 40 years later. And your brother and my brother. And so the only, almost the only note my editor ever gave me. Yeah. He never rewrote sentences. He never asked for that. He asked a couple times fill this in a little bit more. But the only major note he ever gave me was move that that chapter to earlier in the book where where it happens. Uh huh. And I said, you're wrong. I said, I know this is theatrically the right place to put it. And I'm a theater writer. Right. So, that's where it stays. And I think, and I think it really hits people where it is. Why? I think so because it's not it's not by virtue of your denial or anything. But it's just unspoken throughout the entire thing because you have this great relationship with your mother. Right. But this is what's at the core of I think a lot of people's experience. Exactly. And that's just it in my mind. So many people admired my mother. Yeah. You know, she went out as I say, she for 30 years. Yeah. She and her friends delivered meals on wheels to people with AIDS. I mean, she was in our 80s delivering meals on wheels. So women who did unbelievable work in the world. And everyone thought because I wrote towards someone and all that, that we had the greatest relationship here in the world. And it always was a great relationship. Yeah. And so they would be jealous of that. And I would never tell the story really. And then the time came to actually tell the story. But my favorite story about my mother and being gay is still when she took my grandmother to see me in towards home. Can I tell that little story? Of course. So so so this is the first run. Yes. A yes. The original Broadway. The original Broadway run. I mean, we'd have done it off off probably. But we're on Broadway now. Right. My grandmother's in a home because she was a little violent. She used to try and beat my mother up with the cane. Yeah. But it was not cheating called her darling. Yeah. I called her granny goose. Yeah. So anyway, some my grandmother's in this home with my mother visit her almost every day. And she said, Jackie, what's going on here? All the nurses keep asking for who the hell is Harvey? They keep asking for his autograph. Why would I get a Harvey's autograph? Why do you give a Harvey's autograph? They seen him on TV. They read about him in the paper. Who the hell did Harvey become? Yeah. So she said, I need to take I need to take him. Who the hell did Harvey become? Well, you I mean, because that was Harvey. Yeah. Yeah. Of the weird kid at home that nobody ever thought would be able to make a living. Yeah. You know, he was artistic. Right. I just it was the polite word for gay back in the 50s. Yeah. In the 40s. He's he's he's gentlemanly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. That was yeah. We always had nice words. Wait, I guess the Jews had nice words. The Catholics immediately drove them into the priesthood. Yeah. He said, well, I certainly slept in that with enough of them. But he said, a New York television. Yeah. Said my favorite chapter. It was like one of those early morning of this book shows of this book reviewing the books. Yeah. And my favorite chapter starts out by Harvey saying, I certainly slept with my my my share of priests, but I've yet to bed a rabbi. And you hear the host of the show still off-camera going, oh my. Before he comes back to my favorite book. Oh my. So anyway, so my mother decides she's not going to take it to see the first act. Because in the first act of tortsong, I'm in drag. Right. And I get fucked up the ass for about 10 minutes of, you know, standing set stage. She figures there, maybe too much for grand news. So she said, so she times it out to get her there for act two, right, which all takes place in a giant bed. And then act three has the mother and all that. Yeah. But that'll be fine. So she gets in this with a stone, when I still was still was there. But that act, she's not in. Yeah. It's just the giant with the two couples, or day couple, and so they're sitting there in the audience and she's watching the show. And she's hard of hearing. And then the loudest voice that has ever been projected in a Broadway theater, she says, so obviously I'm a sensual. And my mother in a voice loud enough, my grandmother to hear her said, how should I know? I don't sleep with them. Did that get applause? Well, I just fell over. Yeah. I was like talking on stage and I just went boom. And laughter. You did? That's good. Yeah. Well, you have to lie. That's what life is about. I know. The thing about this though, that I didn't realize, and of course, you know, why would I? But for some reason, your life, and it sort of tracks the evolution of a lot of stuff, of theater, of drag, of gay culture, like you were there for all of it, and you've seen everything change, right? But I had no idea that, you know, in the 70s or in the late 60s, I'm sort of fascinated with that period in New York and nobody really talks about it. And you don't get any sense of it. You know, I watched the documentary around the velvet underground, but there's that whole world. But the gay world was kind of like, doesn't get enough representation culturally right now. Right. Well, it never does. Right. I mean, unless we tell it. Yeah, right. Nobody's going to tell. And you have to tell it. Yeah. And unfortunately, all those writers were so used to being in the closet. Yeah. And you want to tell those stories. Right. You know, I mean, but the velvet underground was a case. What's the case? I mean, I hung out with the velvet underground. Right. Mary Warnoff, who's like the head person in that documentary, she started. Right. We started. Because it was Warhol, of course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It replaced him. And Lou was Lou. Did you know Lou? I knew him a little bit. He was mad at me when he died, which was one of those funny things. Oh, really? We did a benefit together at town hall. Yeah. And nobody went over the material that we were going to do. Yeah. And so we both sang the same song. Which one? We sang Frank. It was about it was about it was about censorship. Yeah. And we both sang the folks on Frankie and John. Yeah. Frankie and Johnny were lovers. So he went on first and I went, Oh fuck, well, I'll just go out and say hello to the crowd. Yeah. Whatever. But and he sang his version. I said, Oh, I wasn't going to do this because Lou already sang this. But he didn't sing the right lyrics. He sang the cleaned up lyrics. I said, so Lou, this is for you. And I sang the non cleaned up lyrics. And it was pretty funny. Yeah. But he didn't. He didn't like it. So, okay. So you're a kid. How heterosexual. Was he heterosexual men do not like being one up, but he's like being complimented. But was he heterosexual? Yeah. He's fucking Laurie Anderson all those years. I guess so. I have a very early on. I mean, I mean, he had gotten, you know, shock therapy to drive the gay out of him by his family. You know, what I mean? He was he and Laurie. I mean, I don't know. There's no there's no black and white line. No, certainly. Yes. Not now. Yeah. Well, not there. Yeah. I mean, we may have hidden it. Well, I mean, culturally, though, there's a lot of discussion about the nonline. Well, I mean, but that's isn't that the most exciting thing going on now. Yeah. As good as the shit out of me. Why? The gender line. Yeah. The whole idea that we may at this point in our lives be redefining what is a man and what is a woman and it's very exciting. Yeah. Look, not very like is it for a seven year old person, Illinois. And I have to call you what? You want to be called they? Yeah. Why the fuck do you want to be called they? Yeah. And yet it's kind of exciting. Yeah. Um, I don't I don't necessarily want to see Broadway shows renamed, you know, like Golden Them. Yeah. Or my fair day. Yeah. Yeah. I have every love song translated, you know, all boy, girl, taken out and it's all they them. I'm not sure I like that. But but I still find it incredibly exciting because it's redefining who human beings are and can be, I guess, and can be. Yeah. Which of course is what frightens the other side. Yeah. I want to go back. I want to go back. Right. Give me America. Great again. Go, go, go. I don't want to change. I'll go, give my scrapbook. But there was no back really. That's the way there is no back. There's always a mythological place. There is no back. Death is back. Yeah. That's all that's there. But but in terms of that conversation, I mean, you know, you, you lived your life. You are who you are. You know, changing a pronoun is not going to change your experience. Yeah. But it does change how I relate to other people. Because as soon as you have to call somebody, they are them. Yeah. You do have to think about that. I'll tell you a quick story and know somebody who has two two gay men. Yeah. They have a son. Yeah. Who's 10 years old at home. Their son is he, him. Yeah. No problem at all. Right. They went to a parent teacher conference. Yeah. And found out at school, he prefers to be called they them. Uh huh. What do you think of that? I think it's fascinating. Yeah. Is he coming out in some way? Is he just do it? Is he just falling in with a group of other people? So he's doing it. A trend? Yeah. It's I think it's utterly fascinating. Had and I tried to think what I would have done then. And I don't know. People think of coming out as the act of telling other people. But that's not what coming out is. See yourself? Come here. When you're a little kid, yeah, you live in your family, whatever that family is. Yeah. And as you find your place in the world, that's my brother. That's my sister. That's my mother. That's my father. And you figure out where it is. You belong in that. Yeah. Well, a straight kid figures that out and goes, okay, that's right. I belong and they go on with their life. A gay kid says, that's right. No, wait, that's not where I belong. That's not right. And they go back and do it again. And they do it again. And they do the math over and over and over again until they finally say, it's not the right math that anybody else is giving me. Right. But it's the right math for me. And that's coming out. Right. And that's nothing to do with telling other people. There's nothing to do with even self acceptance. It's figuring it out in your own head. I don't fit into this. I don't fit into that, which is why I find the whole gender thing so interesting. It's interesting. Right. Because there is a there's a way to integrate. Is there? I don't know. I mean, that's what I'm saying. Isn't that fabulous? They may not be. There may not be a way to integrate. We may be, you know, I used to talk to Gloria Steinem about this all the time. She's a great love of the of the Native American idea of two spirit. Of male and female being existing in the same body. She has a great love of that. And I do too. But I know how exactly how it would work. And I'm not saying that they're giving us a way for it to work yet. But I find it fascinating. The reason I even started up in this thinking, as you know, because you read the book, I wrote a play called Casa Valentina. That sounded very interesting. Right. So Bob Balaban and a couple of others come to me with all these photographs of men in the 1950s up in a little cocaine place for the bungalow colony. Up on the Catskills. Where these heterosexual married men go up on weekends and dress in women's clothing. They believed they were heterosexual men that had a woman living inside them. They called it the woman within. They had their own magazines. They had their own political groups and all that. They thought this will make a great comedy. This will make a great. And I thought, yeah, you know, this is a lot fun. But when I sat down to read the papers and I read their political statements and I, there wasn't two of them that agreed on anything. Some of them wanted to dress up and pass as women. Others, it was about wearing the underwear. Never went out in public. Some it was about masturbation in women's clothing. Some it was about just looking in the mirror. Others, they was the photographs. Some swearing they were heterosexual would have sex with heterosexual men because I am a heterosexual woman. So I would, of course, have sex with heterosexual men. So in this little group that you would think would be totally homogenous, no one was alike. And I thought, is it a lie? And I've come to believe it is, that we teach children brotherhood, that we teach this idea that we're all the same. And we should accept each other all for being the same. That we're really all just human beings and it's just fine. That's never caused peace in this world. Sure. What about the idea that no one's the same? We're all magnificently different. We're all such individuals, a little of this, a little of that. And I will accept you for all of your differences and your uniqueness. Please accept me for my uniqueness. Let's stop trying to get ourselves into clumps because as soon as you put people in clumps, then there's a clump you're against. Yeah, you are clump against somebody else's tribe. But if you have no clump, then you can't war with anybody. I think it's a much smarter idea than the brotherhood idea. Sure. Well, because the brotherhood idea implies that there's something that everybody's the same and that it's easy to control that. Well, but as soon as you say it remains the same, everyone knows that they're not the same. So which one's on top? Yeah. And it becomes the white heterosexual male. Yeah. You know what Gloria Steinem and we had this band-loss writing a play called Bella Bella about Bella Abso. Yeah, are you going to put that up again? We hoped. I mean, it was just done out here somewhere. We were hoping to raise money for women running for office. But Gloria was wonderful enough to sit through rehearsal and give notes. Yeah. Because she knew where and she was there. Oh, yeah, she was there on that particular night. Yeah. It was writing about. The eve of the election. Yes, Shirley McLean. Shirley McLean was there by Thomas. Yeah. Lily Tomlin. They were all in the room. And everyone's still around, right? They're all still around. They all came to either see the show or even Hillary Clinton came to lend her support. It was wonderful. So I'm doing a scene in which I say, you know, well, as Bella Abso, well, the Hispanic vote will go this way and the Black vote will go this way and then women, well, as we all know, the women will vote the way their husbands tell them to. And Gloria stopped the rehearsal. She said, no. No. I thought we'd mean no. She said, white women. White women. Black women voted for Hillary. Yeah. Black women actually vote their own interest. So sudden. Okay. So I get up and I say, and the white women will vote the way their husbands know. They don't need to be told by their husbands to vote that way. Yeah. White women will vote the interests of the people who pay their bill. Right. And they know that innately? It's that. Yeah. She said it's built into the built into our society that women will vote for who pays the bills. Well, that's like, that's the big problem across the board is that our society is exclusionary and defers to, you know, white, you know, hetero patriarchal society, as opposed to the two spirit society or the Native American society, which of course was maternal. Yeah. The women were in charge. But like when you were when you were coming up in the, in like in New York in the 60s. Yeah. I mean, that there wasn't really a discussion about about any of this stuff. It was just all pretty wild. And there was a freedom that was afforded to people from this from from just the tone of the culture at that time. I mean, how, how crazy was it on the lower East side? Well, I got because I went to art school. Yes. I went to soon as I was done with junior high. Yeah. I grew up in the land of the honeymooners. Welcome back Carter. Sure. You're hanging around on the island. Where you been? Ben Center. Yeah. So that's the and then I got out of there and all of a sudden I was on 57th Street in Second Avenue with the bottles. Yeah. And there were men in Ben Ferkot. Yeah. And and this art community was living a three part life during the day or in the morning. I was this nice Jewish boy living at home. Then during the day I was going to school full time because I went through college. Yeah. And then at night I was in the counterculture. So, you know, we would have I tell the story all the time because it's it's one of those stories. I I've been history of our class. Yeah. And this year our teacher is lecturing us about an artist named Ray Johnson who's now creating this movement called the male art. Yeah. And he takes a letter or a postcard and he draws on it, mails it to another artist. They add to it. They mail it to somebody else and eventually comes back to him and that's the finished piece of artwork and he gets his whole lecture. That night I'm laying in bed and I said, Oh, you know what Ray? They they gave a lecture about you today. So that was the life I was living. Yeah. You know, I they were talking about 15. So they were they were talking about that life and I was living that life. I you know, whether I was working with the Warhol people or just hang out on the street or with the creators of the ridiculous theatrical movement. But this was not like this. What year were we talking 60s 70s 70s. So this wasn't a this is post hippie. This isn't peace and love. This is like, no, kind of aggressive avant-garde pushing the envelope. Yes. Yes. And the and the age difference at that time in that world that didn't seem to make much difference. Well indeed, because I can go into the bars. But what about the men? I mean, the men, some of these guys were old guys and you guys were young guys. Yeah. But they that was what was amazing. Yeah. Was other than a few petarists that that I really loved. Yeah. What are you going to do? We got to learn somewhere, right? Exactly. When I go to a GAA meeting the gay activists, they were not picking up the plus young boys. Yeah. They were they were teaching us. Yeah. They would take us the pink tea cup, which was a I remember that place was for breakfast, right? Yeah. Breakfast lunch. Yeah. It was a coffee shop. Where was it in the village? Yeah. I'm bleaker. I was painting pink. Yeah. I'm bleaker off of Christmas Street. Right. So they would take us the pink tea cup, but they wouldn't try and take us to a bar. Right. And they wouldn't try and have sex with us. Right. They were our parents. Like mentoring. They were exactly where they were mentoring us. And and you know, and then you get older, you do that for the next generation. That's why my book is dedicated to the radical fairies that flew before me. Yeah. And it's a history book in a lot of ways. But I guess my question is, the art scene and what became the activism scene, kind of it seemed a little different at first, but then it kind of came together. I mean, I think you were part of that, right? Yeah. But it was you know, nothing has such a clean, lovely line. You know, you had the Stonewall bar, right? Yeah. This bar, the drag queens hung out and and and hustlers and all that. And then building right next to it, the windows, you know, if you're looking at the bar, the windows upstairs to the left were the managing society. The managing society was a gay society that had been around since the 50s that believed if we wore black suits with white shirts, skinny black ties, that heterosexuals would accept us. So when Stonewall broke out, you had them screaming, shut up, listen to the cops, get back in the bar and all that. And drag queens saying, fuck you, Judy Garland died today and we're going to kick your fucking asses from bothering us. Yeah. And you know, an athlete came in a in a in a in a in a kick line. Yeah. It was not gay activists. Right. That believed in something and had ideals and all that. That's not how revolutions happen. Right. That's how they develop after after the the the anger builds up. Exactly. So that so that movement started in the 60s. Yeah. We then hit a strange sort of floaty period where where you still had the managing society trying to get our rights that way. You had the further left being, you know, we're we're queer and we're gonna get to getting your faces. Yeah. And then by 19, a one AIDS AIDS decimated our community, of course, but did some very important things which I rather didn't do but it but it did. I rather it didn't have to happen something like AIDS but it did. It's just the way the history works. Right. Sometimes the negative gives you positive. Yeah. Whenever you go to a gay of meeting like at the firehouse or whatever. Yeah. The first half hour was lesbians engaged fighting over who was going to speak first. Yeah. You must get a pick a guy or a woman speaking first and you'd waste a half fucking hour of this meeting just them fighting could not get along on anything. Men couldn't go into women's bars. Women couldn't go into men's bars. We did just did not like each other. But you were stuck together. We didn't know that. AIDS came along. We could no longer give blood. We're dying in hospitals. We need blood. heterosexuals will not give us blood. Yeah. Lesbian step in. They created something called blood sisters and many hundreds of thousands of lives were prolonged at least if not saved by the blood of lesbians. I mean physically. Yeah. And that was the end of the war between the two. We became lesbian and gay. Yeah. During that. No one knew who gay people were. We were something they talked about. We were vampires that only appeared at night. We weren't normal people. Yeah. We were AIDS hit. And there's a line in safe sex which says and suddenly we were everywhere where doctors and teachers and lawyers and priests and mothers and babies. Now they see us everywhere. Yeah. Hospitals classrooms obituaries. We were gay and now we're human. That was a huge change. All of a sudden we existed. Now did they run away from us? Did they turn that back on us? Did they wish we did all die? Maybe. But we were no longer deniable. We existed. Yeah. And that changed everything. Back in the wars we've we've now got this war we're fighting for our lives because because of AIDS and outcome these young people screaming for marriage equality. Yeah. And I was thinking what the fuck is wrong with you people. We have we have so much other work to do. We've got all this crap going on to take care of and you won't care about a fucking wedding cake. What is where are your values? Then I stopped myself and I said you know these are younger people than you and don't they have the right to define what the revolution should be. And so I shut my mouth and I went to work for them and they turned out to be right. These heterosexuals that thought we were out there to fuck their children. Yeah. Or steal their husbands. All of a sudden went oh they want insurance. Oh they want they want to get a mortgage. I understand that. Oh when their husband leaves them they want to get they want to get an alimony. I get that. And all of a sudden we won rights that we never would have won fought on any other battle. And now this generation coming back to where we started this whole conversation has brought up gender. Said we're now going to show you about gender at least question all of the roles of gender. Once again I don't understand it but I have lived enough history now to know follow the young people. It's their world. It's not our world. We should shut the fuck up. The role of an elder is not to tell you what to do. Even though people think that's what an elder is supposed to do. The role of an elder is to facilitate what young people want to do. That's the best thing we can do. So if I write my book it's not to say go live the life of Harvey. It's like this is how I got there. Now take it the next steps. And do you see like I understand we're saying socially and culturally and there's definitely a fight. It seems like right now we're in a more defined fight against what could become fascism than we ever have been. Right. But in terms of theater being vital and being important to this to the cultural evolution and language it seems like back in the 70s you know before drag was accepted and you were you know doing experimental stuff or being in a war hall movie but you know drag was part of that world but it was a freak show to everybody else. Right and now it's not. Well you but that was because of you. I know but look at RuPaul. No I know but with this. Look at RuPaul's Drag Race. I have a friend. But that but you because of me. Not me. Not about the whole bunch of my generation. Tore song but then Edna. I mean like a term black that I mean that made it fun for the entire world. Exactly. Yeah but so did so did Charles Nelson Riley. Though he would know he would. But that wasn't though he would. No he wasn't. Listen when I told my mother I had a date with Rock Hudson I thought she died. Did you? Yeah but that's a whole other story. But the point is. Yes. The point is that you look at RuPaul's Drag Race now. Those are not the same kind of drag queens we were. They are they are not. We were sexual deviance. We were. We were scary. Yeah. You know we were saying we are women and we are scary and we will scare the shit out of you. This is what in the 70s. In the 60s and 70s. We were experimental. We were in your face. We were. There was something very dangerous about us. What was the point? To be who we were in a world that was not going to let you. Okay. RuPaul's Drag Race. They're so fabulous. Yeah. They are wearing costumes. We could never afford they can do their makeup. And this is seen in Hollywood Lons book. You know who Holly was. One of the world drag queens. That loose angle. Yeah. You know Holly came from Miami F.L.A. that one. Yeah. Holly. So Holly was opening in a movie. A new all-home movie. Girl Flesh. Yeah. But she was in the tombs. She'd been arrested and they were going to let her out of the tombs in time to get to the opening. Yeah. And so she'd she'd never make up or any with her. She was in the men's section and she had to go to the Hollywood opening. So she took a colored magazine and she took Q-tips and she'd wet the Q-tips on her tongue. Yeah. And take the ink off the colors pictures and use that as to make makeup. Huh. To do the makeup. Yeah. That's not what what RuPaul drag queens do. Yeah. My friend Bianca Del Rio who's a stand-up comic. Sure. From from there. Cells out. Stadiums. Stadiums. The entire stadium. She don't sing. She don't dance. She's a stand-up insult comic. Yeah. That sells out stadium. Yeah. I know. I know some of those people. It's a different world. Yeah. Well another one from RuPaul's Drag Race in the West. Um who actually did me was played me on that when they just snatch game is playing my role in hairspray in the road company right now. So we made incredible progress where we go next. I don't know but we're not going backwards. We're not always moving forwards. Sure. And that's what's fun. But I mean that whole period this sort of sweaty angry wigs and makeup period in the 70s. And then the entire like the the the cultural change I guess it was most we aids but that whole world of gay sex that you write about it to me it's just like oh my god. I mean like it was just you just walking around fucking wherever you wanted and just like kind of the the insane electricity of that world I can't even imagine. Mark my love. Yeah. What? To really think we aren't still doing that. You really think I can't take you to Central Park now and show you people fucking in the rambles. Are they? Yeah of course the back of the rant. It's boys. Yeah. What do boys need to have sex? A finger that can pull down a zipper after that. Do we just let me go for pizza? Yeah. It's not boys and girls. Boys and girls takes work. You have to actually talk or something. This is boys and the whole the whole aim of having sex. Yeah. In that kind of kind. That kind of having sex is to have sex. It's not to make friends. Sure. Nobody's here to make friends. Yeah. People here to fuck. Yeah. Or or get a blowjob. Yeah. I gotta get back to work. My wife's waiting for me at work. She's then gonna give me a blowjob tonight. I'll get a blowjob here. Yeah. But no you think you would. I mean LA used to be. It's all back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Was there was there was big stars caught here in bathrooms and Hollywood one. Sure. I maybe. I guess I'm not paying as much attention. Yeah. Well. You probably have somebody who gives you blowjobs on a regular basis. I tried to. Yeah. But you know but if should you ever need one I'll send you a list of addresses. You can just stop by. I need to start that phase of my life. Exactly. Just stop by. I get a blowjob. It's time to go to the the shambles. The rambles. The rambles. But it's you. What there's no age on it. But penises don't have age on it. They don't wrinkle as bad as faces. I guess that's true. But I don't know if they work as good in the long run. Wow. They're pills. They're pills for that cookie. I'm so sorry you're 58. They're worried about that. Well I know. I'm not worried about it. I know they have pills. I'm okay. I'm. I'm. We're putting this out on this podcast. My pills is okay. Yeah. I can still open the zipper. I can do it. I can do it. Nick's a little work. A little more work. Well I'm bad. Thank you. I'm seeing you later. My Jones is coming down. So out of that world what drove because I know you write about in the book but torch on trilogy which defined you at that time and and also change theater and it changed the representation in theater and in in the culture. I mean that was something that was driven by you know an anger and a desperation to identify. It was. No Arnold that character of Arnold. Yeah. Which is the character I played. He was driven by growing up in the same family that his brother did. You know he grew up in the mother and a father and a brother and the brother was straight but he was dating. Yeah. And eventually who wanted to find somebody and have a child or whatever. Well Arnold was raised in the same home because he liked to suck dick means he didn't want a family or and you know what the rest understanding is there were gay people that thought I was saying we all have to do that. Yeah. But I was saying the choice should be ours. Right. The choice should be ours. And so you had Arnold who was trying to make this place. This make a statement that his life was of value and had the same values as as as his straight brother. Yeah. Um was seen as being frightening was seen by some as being revolution. It was seen as some as being a different kind of a statement. Yeah. Which is fine but I mean even even in the play Arnold says I don't want to greed be imitation of heterosexual marriage. I want whatever this is really supposed to be. Yeah. But I was attacked for by gay groups saying that you know he just wants to turn us into heterosexuals. I don't want to have children. I don't want to. Well I never had children. Believe me raising Matthew Broderick was enough. I didn't have to have children. My kids actually all went on to greatness. You have Patrick Dempsey and Matthew and Fisher Stevens and Fisher Stevens. I mean they're working a lot right now. Yeah he's working a lot. Yeah. But those are my kids. Yeah. Right. Well I mean but that's interesting that there's always this infighting to me that they have to judge the that every. But that's what happened when AIDS hit when AIDS hit there were those of us who screamed and yelled okay this is going to be up to us. Yeah. We had no we had no heterosexual ally. Right. We had one person. Yeah. Anthony Fauci recognized that name. Yeah. That's the only person we had. Yeah. We had Anthony Fauci and that was it. Um so we had nobody to guide us. We had to decide should we close the beds? Should we insist everybody use condoms? Should we? You know the same crap same kind of crap that you see going on with cold masks and we and and gay people laughing at it. Yeah. You fucking pieces of shit. If we had a little shot to take with a booster you don't think we were to take it off shot and go on with our life. You mean these big heterosexual guys are scared of getting a shot. You fucking cowardly little pieces of shit. That's what I look at them as pieces of shit. Yeah. These these ball players and all that. I don't want to be told what I do. You're scared to get a shot and just admit it. Fucking little faggot ass piece of crap. So anyway, I guess what you'd be very happy to have been able to get a shot. Sure. But we had the same arguments. Yeah. Should we should we insist everybody use condoms? We keep the bath houses open so we can give out condoms. We taught. These were community meetings. Community meetings and we had. Because this is a New York thing. I mean those the kind of the New York San Francisco LA. It was spreading all across the country. But like those gay centers were the bath culture existed and that culture was like known and people traveled there to do that. You had someone had to create sort of a government in a way. Right. At which of course you can't because there's no way to fight. For all who's going to be a lesbian or gay man. Told you we busy having that fight. We didn't have enough stuff to fight over. So you did but ultimately the decision was to get people to wear condoms. Yeah but many people didn't and they died. And now there's no cure for AIDS. And we've turned our community into a community of drug addicts. I mean I'm very glad people are taking PrEP and I'm very glad people have a drug to take the deal. They don't zero convert and that even if they have HIV in their blood they take a drug that keeps it from passing it on. I'm happy about that. But I'm not happy that they have to take a drug and I don't understand why we still haven't found a cure for AIDS. I still believe in my own naive way. I still believe the drug companies like it that way. They make more money. Of course they make no money in a cure. There's no money in a cure. But you really believe that there's not people working on it. Oh I know there's people working on it whether they found something or not. It's something different. We don't have anybody to ask. Sure. Do you ever have survivor's guilt? Of course. Yeah. I got three dead people in my backyard. Yeah. I think I don't have survivor's guilt. Yeah. Of course I do and I write about it in the book. Yeah. I'll tell you when I was recording the book. It wasn't when I was writing it. Writing it was fine. You're in that head and you're just telling the truth and you're just going down your road. Yeah. But when I had to read it back is when it started hitting me. When I hit that sentence that I sort of just described that said and then I had our sexual friends put their arms around us, gave us a hug, said we hope you do okay and they walked away very glad it didn't affect them and left us to die. And when I read that sentence left us to die, I actually stood up in the biker boat and left the building for an hour because I get, yeah. Yeah. That was a very hard truth to finally tell. And because of that time like you know people, their families had turned on them. So I mean I would say everybody but I mean I why do you have people in your backyard? I mean how did that unfold? The one to be there with me. But he didn't know they just wanted to be there with me. But Harry Melbourne had me on a show to advertise Bella Bella but he has two guests on and they didn't tell me who the other person was and I walk into the room and it's Peggy Noonan. And I just like looked at Harry who I didn't know at the time. I know him now. I know him now well enough to call him Cookie. And I sort of looked at him and he didn't understand. And because of the shape of the show we only had a couple of minutes and blah blah blah wasn't a discussion show. I had to be polite and be nice. All I wanted to do is slap that bitch. She wrote the speeches for Reagan where he never mentioned AIDS. She was part of that decision to have the President of the United States not even mention the word AIDS because they knew there was no cure. They knew there was no quick answer. They knew it was a losing political battle. Sure. So fuck the people dying. Yeah. Fuck Americans being sick. We don't we're not even going to talk about it. They can die on their own. She was and she was complicit. She was the she was the speech writer. You didn't say nothing to her? I just felt that couldn't so a couple of weeks ago. Are you asked me to be on the show again? I just did it the other day. Yeah. And yes. And I said if you stick with somebody like Peggy Noonan this time I'm not keeping quiet. He said no it'll be you alone. He said yeah you got to be careful about who you put me with. Yeah. Yeah. The days are might being quiet. Yeah. And I'm quiet when I have to sell something. Yeah. I was selling it. And I was telling you know I was also telling Bell Absolk story. Though the truth is Bella would have shot her mouth off. Bella wouldn't have sat there quiet. Right. That's for sure. Yeah. She would have been daughters. She would have sat there quiet. Yeah. So like it seems when I read the book that the way you learned how to create and I mean you work hard. I mean I don't understand how these books were but the half of this book is about you being confronted with material and making decisions on how that material should be staged and how the characters should act and how the plays should come together. And that's something you learned instinctively from just working because I don't understand how you know creating a book really works. I think I talked to Lin-Manuel Miranda about it. Like but when you did even the rema when you did La Cage or when you did any of these shows that you know that needed to be retooled. Is it just a sense of doing theater for a long time or? No. No. No. There is an art to it but it's a craft. It's a definitely craft. Yeah. And I learned I mean I had written a bunch of musicals first you know earlier experimental musicals like Freaky Pussy and Flappestock and Catables just don't know no better. It was Freaky Pussy you're gonna come back any time? I don't think so. But that's but that was a work of real political that was that was a political statement because heterosexuals were at that time gentrifying everything. Yeah. They were closing down little gay clubs and turning them into nice restaurants and all that. So this was my statement. I took a subway bathroom that a bunch of transvestite prostitutes were applying their trade-outs yeah during the winter. It's cold out on the street. Sure. So they're working in a subway bathroom and a couple comes along and turns it into a restaurant. Yeah. Called the Underground. All right. And there's nothing for these drag queens. They can't go to the police. Yeah. And so they have their own gay massata. Yeah. Of committing suicide. Oh really? Yeah. One by one they commit suicide. See that's some hardcore 70 satire. Absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely. You don't see that sharing more man. You do this. There are people still doing that kind of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Taylor Mack. You know Taylor Mack is here. Look up Taylor Mack still does. So you did musicals early on but then you learned the but then but that well no well as a craft for something different Arthur Lawrence who had written gypsy and then sex lawyers. I said when he came on to direct La Caj. Yeah. You couldn't help but learn. Sure. You know you got one of the true masters in front of me. And you were giving that job? Me and I had a job before him. Yeah. Yeah. So I was a co I was putting a room. I'm not even 30 and I put in a room with Arthur Lawrence who's written all this stuff. Yeah. And Jerry Herman. Who wrote me and I love Dolly. So that's it. I mean it's me. Yeah. Sitting there. If you fucking didn't think I soaked everything I could out of those two. It's crazy opportunities. Of course it's crazy. And life gives you those opportunities. That's my whole philosophy. My whole philosophy is say yes if you can. Say yes. You don't know. If somebody says to you let's go have coffee and you're reading a book. You say nah I'm gonna finish my book. Well you can finish your book. Life is not going to get any better or change. But if you get your ass up and go have coffee. Maybe nothing will happen there either or you might meet the love of your life or I might run it to somebody else who says let's go do something else. But it's only your life only gets better the times you say yes. Yeah. If you say no. Nothing can do nothing changes. Nothing changes. And so when I was young I said yes. And Lamama was so like at that place I always walk by it. I never understood completely the history of it until I read your book about Lamama. Like in that woman she took her you under her wing and what you do a lot of stuff. Right. And she only did it because she loved Paul Foster who was a gay playwright and Billy Hoffman there were a bunch of gay playwrights. She was a designer for the male and she was a designer for Macy's. Honk in both of the. She brought she brought the Moo Moo in from Hawaii. Remember the Moo Moo. Yeah. That was her movement. She made her money off the Moo Moo. She went downtown rented a space. She had a push cart. It was there forever. It's still there. It's still there. I just did a I just made a video for there. 60-something anniversary and I said a fucking I was there 52 of those years. Yeah. So, Lukaj was another like sort of defining play for everybody. Right. Absolutely. And then like what was your biggest success in your mind? You don't know. No, I couldn't care less. You know, I said to Robin Williams once I said I've done all this political work. I've written all this this stuff. I've done all this crap. And when I die, people are going to say, oh, he's the you play Robin Williams brother and mr. Doubtfire. That's not true. It is true. And it's and it's if you don't think how many of these things you think I do to sell a book, you know how many you're out on the book trail. I'm gonna sell some books. Exactly. I like the book. And when you and when you're selling books, there's not a single person that doesn't ask about Doubtfire. Really? Yeah. They're all that's about Robin. They all that's about Doubtfire. I barely remember that. You know, like, I know you live in the garage. Yeah, I know. I live in a garage. But I was more fascinated with this the idea. I've always been fascinated with the idea of the unity of the gay community and what come out of it to maintain their community. You know, that that sexuality and identification was the means by which they were able to survive was always fascinating to me. Right. And then and then one year I was on two world tour during my one man time world tour. And I think I said with a book. It's called This Is Not Gonna Be Pretty. Yeah. And we were in Dublin and we had the night off. And they said, what do you want to do? Like, we arrived in Dublin. We didn't work that first night. Yeah. And I said, well, let's go into town and go to a gay bar. Yeah. And they looked me and said, we don't have any gay bars. What do you mean? You know, I mean, gay bars, we got rid of anti gay laws years ago. So gay people go to straight bar. I mean, we're all mixed in together. I thought, with my community, what do you mean? My P I need my people. Oh, that generation's gone though, right? But but you need that generation as well, because when it comes to us being when we when we come under attack, there are 300 anti gay laws now coming down to the courts, 300. There are only 50 states and average of six anti gay laws per state. It's insanity. And the of the Santos. I don't know. He's going to Florida anymore. I know he's running for president on anti gay. Yeah. That's he found one that works. Well, come terrified. Yeah, I'm I'm not even gay. And I'm I'm a Jew. But I'm terrified of fascism. It seems real to me right now. Yeah, it is. And who's it coming from? Old white men. So we need the old somebody somebody said, I love I think was the thing was John Oliver. He showed a picture of Putin. Yeah. And just looked at it and said, if he was just four inches taller. He's funny. Well, but it's true. I know. He's yeah. He's an old guy wanting to be important again. And if he could just make the Soviet Union again, and he'll be remembered, I don't stop it. You've got hundreds of billions of dollars in gold in the base. I don't know what you got these two lovely daughters. Go. Yeah, take the rest of your life. Why do they keep working? Why do you have to murder? You have to murder thousands of innocent people to prove that just dick still works. Yeah. Go fuck thousands of people instead. I just I don't understand it on any level why people continue working. Oh, I guess if they've got if they've made it, come relax. I laugh when I watch some people that have been on the news show for like 40 years. And I think you haven't made enough yet. I know what he's still doing. Right. Go home. Right. Go go. And they say, oh, thank God it's Friday. Yeah. He could be Friday every day for you. You're not that good at this. Yeah. I don't know. I guess people don't know what the hell to do with himself. But that's what I mean about young people. Yeah. We don't make the room for young people to take over. And we really should. I agree. Okay. Let's talk about a TV. Do we have to go those soon? No. Okay. Because I've got, you know, I've got people waiting for me. Where? Me and Billy Eichner. Oh, okay. That'll be fun. That'll be fun. He's funny. Yeah, I just did. I just did. I watch on. I did. I'll cameo in his movie. Oh, yeah. I don't do movies. No more. I always say so we're not going to talk about. Tavia. Let's talk about. We talk about Tavia. We love Tavia. You do. Right. You loved it. You never thought that would happen. No. No. I love that part of the story. We were they were working on casting. Yeah. Look how's your fall production that I didn't want to happen. Yeah. They're working on casting that my friend Susan. And and she said, I got to leave because we're also casting. Fiddler on the roof. I revive a fiddler on the roof. And I said, Oh, I want to do that. And she said, what? You're going to play gold. And I sort of looked at her and you could see she got very embarrassed. Right. Cut to a year and a half later. Telephone rings that Susan on the phone. Just promise me you won't shave until we make this decision. I said, what are you talking about? Just promising you're not going to shave no matter what I say. Yeah. All right. I won't shave. She said, I want you to do Fiddler on the roof. I said, play gold. Why? Why can't I shave? I play gold. She said, not gold at Tavia. Yeah. And I and like everything in me just collapsed. Because this was a show I saw as a kid. We saw everything. Yeah. In those days, you can buy Broadway tickets for $3. Yeah. For $2.50. I have the stubs. My mother would buy every single show. My brother, my father, she and I would go sit the first row of the balcony. $10 for the family of four. And we saw everything. So I saw a bunch of nuns singing. I was ever alive. And I saw a bunch of orphan boys. Give me more. You know, I saw it all. And then one day, a bunch of Jews, they were Jews. They had sisters. Yeah. And they had they had keepers of their head. I went to fucking Jews. Because the Jews I know, right, Danny Kay, right, they all changed their name to being show business. Everybody talked about barber strikes and they said, Oh, she'll never be a star. Now with that nose, right, she have to get a nose job and they're going to have to change that name. So instead of changing the last name, she dropped the A out of the first name. Fuck you. Yeah. Anyway, so, so they meant a real lot to me. Yeah. To see Fiddler on the roof. And here I was being offered for the other roof. And I said, so I called Jack O'Brien, who directed hairspray. Yeah. And I said, Jack, what do I do? It's a very smart man. So he said, it's a very simple question. Said you either do it or spend the rest of your life saying, you know, they asked me to do it with people looking the other way, like, yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So, so then I went to the, I'm the last person to play Tavia with all three writers still alive. Right. The book writer, the composer and the lyricist. I insist that the three of them sit in a room and hear me sing the entire score. Just for confidence to make sure you could just because I didn't want them turning around saying, if I knew that's what he was going to sound like, I never would have allowed. Yeah. And so, and the three of them were always gorgeous to me. Yeah. And they approved my doing the show and I did it for well, over a year on Broadway, I couldn't stay longer because I was booked to go to Las Vegas to do hairspray again. Yeah. But then Topo, who did the movie, sure, was doing it on tour. Yeah. He got tired of doing it. And they called me and said, you want to do the American tour? And I said, yes, sure. Why not? And I did it for another year on tour. Did it make you like, you know, given the other roles you played in your life? What did that? How did it change you? So, the Minskoff theater, we are Lion King as now, is where we played. And you come out of that theater and there's a alley that's like an underpass and that stage, and that's where the audience waits for autographs. And I'm Wednesday matinees for whatever reason. That's when the Chasiddhi Jews come. So, you come out and there's a team of people waiting to get autographs. Yeah. And there's a bunch of Chasiddhi Jews there. And I looked down, I'm signing autographs, and there's a little boy with the payers wrapped around his ears and just staring up me with these saucer-like eyes. And I just said, are you okay? And he looked at me and said, are you really Jewish? And I just, of course, I burst out crying and I said, yeah, I'm Jewish. I'm really Jewish. And I signed his, and I signed his playable, and I thought, so there's a life I changed there. It's going to be the same as my seeing Jews on stage. Now, he's going to see Jews on stage. He's going to believe there's a place in the world. Whereas my greatest fear, I think, was that somebody was going to say, why could I get an openly gay man like you play Tavia? Which would be a ridiculous question. Anyway, what else would a man in those days do? They're going to announce, you know what? I can't feed the cows, and I can't do it. So, I'm going to put on a drag show in town. It's not the way it worked. You know, we're going to get married and have children no matter what. Right. So, it's just not the way it worked. So, because when Rosie O'Donnell came in to play my wife, I thought, now this is the perfect couple. This is the absolute perfect custody couple. That's beautiful. A gay man and a gay woman having five daughters. It's great. This is you. And, sobriety's good? Yes. Well, sobriety's rebirth. And I've been, it's been how long you been? 26. I'm 20. Let me 23. Wow. I was the same time. I did. I got sober in New York. Yeah. I went to the places. I did my time at Perry Street. He did. Yeah. I got sober in a small fictional town of Connecticut. Yeah. But I had already had five years of alanon. Oh, yeah. So, I knew what I was going to get into. But it really was a rebirth for me. And every day since it's been this new life. Yeah. It's kind of a minute. You still go to the things? On this, say, a beginner's meeting that I still go to. Yeah. I'm trying to find, like, I underlined two things in the book. I found a book to be, you know, inspirational and entertaining and touching. I loved it, man. Well, most, you know, most showbiz books. I don't, I like to, I don't like to think of it as showbiz book, but they start out with the, I went to the theater and I saw a guy in the studio and said, that's going to be me. But as you know, that was never going to be me. I never wanted to be an actor. I never want to be a writer. This is what life does if you say yes. This is it. My personality is simply too addictive. I don't love, I obsess. I don't share, I possess. I don't partner, I control. What more proof do you need than my confession to mourning the lives of San Frittany? I wonder if I have the capacity to heal. It's heavy, man. Like, you know yourself. I mean, this is the thing about sobriety that that's what you're going to, you know, the five years to get your mind back, all that. But eventually, you can't hide for myself anymore. No, no, this is hard stuff. Right. But that's why it makes it easier to write. Yeah. Because you've been there, you've had to do that to get sober. Yeah. But like those kind of like, I guess I'm up against that now in my own life about, you know, what do I want for the future and what, you know, we all that's that's the great part is if you're clean and you're sober, yeah, you can actually ask that question. Yeah. And you might be able to come up with an all new answer that never was before. But when I was using, I couldn't ask what I wanted to ask because I was just going to get more of the same. We have a self acceptance, the hardest part, you know, we are when you sober. I mean, that's it. Because the sadness of realization that like, I'm wired this way, right, and anything that I'm going to do to be happy is going to be against this wiring. I mean, the pain juice that I know that and other artists, right, that just felt they couldn't create unless they would. Well, that's crazy. Yeah. The nice part for me was I couldn't create anything if I was drunk. Whatever I typed out when I was drunk, I looked at the next day and went, don't bother. You wasting your time. You got more honest, right? It's over. Yeah. Yeah. But I knew where I was. I mean, I knew I was dying. I mean, I was dying. I was dying. I was easily dying. Drove into a fucking garage and ran the car. I was dying. Yeah, you tried to talk to myself. Ernest, we tried to do it. You were ready. Oh, yeah, I was done. I was done. As I say to people, people who really are done, they don't write notes. Yeah. They don't write notes because whatever you write in, know people who have that's wrong. It's not true. Right. So I bother arguing. But it didn't work. No, because I'm too stupid. I didn't, I mean, I literally did it wrong or I wouldn't be here. I did it wrong. Instead, I almost killed a dog. Instead of killing myself, I was killed. Well, I'm happy. I'm happy you're in case. I'm glad. Well, I've had a lovely time out here in Glen, Glen, Larry Glen Ross. Oh, come on. It's nice. It's lovely. It's California. Can I go to Depe? Am I Jews yet? Yeah, you can go back home to Connecticut and sit to my small, my small fictional county Connecticut. Say hi to Billy for me. Well, he's here in LA. Yeah, I know. Are you going to see him now, right? Yeah. Yeah. Nice talking to you, Harvey. Good church. Nice talking to you. Okay. That was, that was Harvey. All right, cookie. Okay, cookie. Okay. Harvey. Good book. It's called, that was better last night, a memoir. Get it wherever you get your books. Go to wtfpod.com slash tour for all the tour dates. And if anybody can give me any information about what happened to Gary or Gell, I'm sure he's passed. I'm pretty confident of that. But let me know. And if you know anything, tell me anything about that guy. He was a big part of my life. He gave me a book of photographs called legends by a guy who took pictures of stars. And I just remember in it, he says, become a legend or something like that. And for years, I was just sort of like, fuck, I'm not a legend yet. And disappoint Gary. I don't know if he lived long enough to know that I became a legend, because I'm a fucking legend. Here's some guitar. Boomer lives. Monkey and Fonda and cat angels everywhere."
