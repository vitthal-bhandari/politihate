    "text": " No other company in America personifies our history more than auto ordnance. They demonstrate this with their many patriotic themed firearms including the Trump one. Special Edition 1911. This is a truly gorgeous handgun. I was so proud to add to my collection and you will be too. Buy one now for yourself at galleryofguns.com. That is www.galloryofguns.com. Own a piece of history. Welcome dear friends to the man who danced with a very special guest and individual who's almost as hard to get on the show as President Trump. In fact he might be harder to get on the show than President Trump. He's a man who's reinvigorated one half of the political spectrum in just the last few years. I consider him a dear friend as well. And let me show you that being a man isn't just about you know, chopping down trees and taking out the trash. It's also about dealing with congenital liars. And this is how it's done. Most of you live in either New York or Washington. Like I do. The neighbors around me I'm sure would agree that Brett Kavanaugh should not be on the Supreme Court. When I talk to Americans in the red states or any other place besides this corridor or Hollywood when you talk to other Americans they have a much different impression of what's going on with the Supreme Court nominee. A responsible media should characterize and confirm. That's not right. That's not right Brian. Brian, that's not right. Brian that's not right. I just got a poll walking in here where 53% of the American people favor Judge Kavanaugh. You can't pick one poll and make it seem like that is where the American people are. Don't do that. Real clear politics looks at least all the polls. But you should say that the American people are split on this. Don't say the American people oppose them because that's what the Americans don't have credibility. The truth on CNN. I'm shocked. Who was the purveyor? Well, one of those people doesn't have a career anymore. The other one is flourishing more than ever. He's Matt Schlapp. He's the chair of the American Conservative Union. Never invited back with Brian. Oh, and you're surprised. Yeah, never invited back. That was like, don't tell the host that is poll. We got it like the numbers reversed. They don't want you back. Yeah, when I was on Addison Cooper's show for the first and last time I told him on air, look, I know it's tough that more people watch Scooby-Doo reruns on the Cartoon Network than CNN, which is just a fact. It is bad. You didn't take it well. This is our friend Chris Plant says, you want to get in trouble in this city? Tell the truth, right, Matt? Totally right. Okay. Welcome to the manhood hour. So much to discuss. I've got a raft of questions that I ask all of our guests. Let's start with the basic one. How serious if you had to diagnose, like from a medical perspective, how serious is the ideological assault on the concept of manhood in America? You can do Western civilization, Christendom, I know you're a man of faith. How bad is this situation, Matt? You know, you're saying health, I guess. You know, I've never had cancer, but they say stage four cancers, like, pretty serious. Dale Hudson, who is my co-author on a book I wrote about some of these topics, and he's a great golfer, I'm not. But he said, hey, what hole are we on? And I was like, I don't know, 16, 17. You know, we're at the tail end of this fight. We're either going to win it. If we win it, you know, there's a lot more holes to play if we don't win it. It's over. I'm not saying that because I'm a doom and gloomer. I'm saying that because you can't have like a main street retailer like Target, you know, hugging Satan. And even the tranny stuff, which is bad enough, but like hugging Satan as a part of the marketing of all of us. Will you just expand upon what you said in the green room earlier? Because this topic came up of transgenderism and the left's obsession with sex. And you made a very interesting point that kind of helps us to explain or understand that which cannot be understood. It's all a fantasy and a fiction, right? This idea that, oh, you're not satisfied with your gender. You're not sexually satisfied. So it will give you, you become a different gender. You'll screw up all your parts. And then you'll have the satisfaction and the cruel joke of these people that transition is there's really no sexual satisfaction. Now they destroy their sexual lives forever permanently. Right. I don't know how old you are, Sebastian. I'm 55. You know, it's hard enough to like not get up in the middle of the night and go to the bathroom. And I haven't had any kind of like crazy, complicated surgeries. So these people are like screwing with God's biology and every which way you can imagine. But sexually, if they believe that the number one goal of a human being is to be sexually satisfied, they're literally making it so that these children never can be. And the courageous ones like this young woman, Chloe and the other ones that are now speaking out over the fiction and the fraud and the lying associated with this, they're heroes to me. No, utterly, utterly. The D transition is like Chloe who I saw. I met for the first time in the green room at CPAC this year. Oh my gosh. The fact that this woman was so nervous to speak at your massive event, but she did it anyway because it was so important to her. But you missed the most important part of what you said earlier. So let's just paint this kind of Monty Pythonesque absurdity that the left's been telling us from the 60s, you know, sexual revolution, sexual satisfaction. And then the transgender thing comes up and says, well, if you want to be satisfied, you define who you are. That's lop off your sexual organs. You'll never have satisfaction in sex anyway. Tells you what about all of this? It's it's it tells me it's satanic. Tells you the complete illogic of it tells you this is the devil's word. Whenever there's a massive lie associated with something, the Prince of lies is behind it. But to me, like, you know, preacher talk from the TV, I probably wouldn't talk like this 20 years ago, but now I'm older and I've kind of seen what's going on. And we better talk like that and call things out or we're going to whiff and miss our moment. That point that you just made, I feel like that and I'm embarrassed because I talk now the way I heard fire and brimstone event. I'm a creator Catholic, you're a Catholic, but I speak now about these issues. Like I heard Evangelicals 30 years ago. I do too. They're coming after our children and I kind of say, calm down, calm down, but but they were right. They were right. And the thing is, is that we've all kind of soft petaled evil in society. We've called it tolerance acceptance and and the problem is with evil is evil isn't like pro choice, for instance. Evil doesn't say, oh, I'll respect Sebastian in his life and I'm just gonna, I'll evil just stay over here with the people that want to like wallow in evil. No, no, no, no, evil is like cancer. Evil is like pollution. It seeks to get into your life and to screw with your life. And so our accommodation with evil can't work. In the American experience was never to accommodate evil ever. The founders, you know, to a person, the religious people, they were God fearing people. And they understood the problem with slavery. Yes. They just knew they couldn't solve it and be independent. That's right. They had to solve it late. They understood it was bad. That's right. But they knew they had to solve it later. Even people like Thomas Jefferson from Virginia, you know, the most important southern state, they understood that as I like to say that the country was being born with a birth defect and they knew that birth defect could be cured one day. They knew they couldn't, their choice was no America and keep kings in charge, which was certainly not a good system for anyone, including slaves. The slavery was rampant. And they decided that they would try to set a country with a constitution that in the document they set it up so that you could repair the birth defect. What a beautiful thing. We forget. That was a declaration of independence from a king that gave you next to no rights unless you were a nobleman. Think about that. That was an amazing thing. And now we fast forward to today. There's more slavery today than there was at the founding of America. There's more human trafficking. There's more young people being sold into lives of bondage. Where are the voices of the progressives in the left? Where are those feminists when it comes to transgenderism? Where are they? Well, you know, there's more than you think. I mean, when I see what people like Billy Jean King, but ironically one of my former bosses in life, I ran a tennis team for her. Oh, no way. Yeah, yeah. Really interesting lady. I'm not sure if you've ever seen a lot of economic stuff than you'd ever imagine, but obviously not on these cultural questions. But you see these women, I'll take my mom. She's 82 years old. You've met her at CPAC. She was a fabulous tennis player. She was a tennis instructor. She was a nationally ranked, well, a women's tennis player. And you know, she was a basketball player. It was hard. She was a, you know, women did girls didn't get the gym. They didn't get the fields. They didn't, then they did through Title IX. And now they're watching it all get taken away. Yeah, but by the people who say they're there for the oppressed. Yeah, and this goes back, let's go back to this question that we raised earlier, this transition question. The idea that someone can change your gender, which you can't, you use this word to me when I got into some trouble on saying that they're all children of God, which I do believe, and I know you believe too, it's just that they're doing something God doesn't want. And you know, gender is immutable, you told me. And that's exactly right. Like this is a fiction that you can change. And now you can change the physical, you can change your physical impression of it. But here's the thing. The crazy thing about all of this, which is, those your ability, ends your ability to have children. Men can't have children. It all of this evil is destroying everything that's good. No flowers bloom. You know, no birth time comes out of this. Nothing good. And the lie about, oh, it's to save those who are contemplating suicide between 40 and 55% percent of those who transition attempt suicide. So even that is a lie. Oh my gosh, so much more to discuss.

If we have time, I'd love to talk about the flowering that you have caused at the American Conservative Union with CPAC, the place that patrons go every year to just recharge their batteries. So much of the political evolution in America of late. If you had to identify the center of gravity, where is this assault coming from when we look at the ideology, whether it's denying womanhood, attacking men as toxic, where's the most important locus of this? Is it the media? Is it Hollywood? Is it the teacher training colleges? Is it the radicals who became the professors? If you had to identify, you talked about stage four cancer. Where did the cancer begin or where is it metastasizing from the most in your opinion? Well, to me, the biggest shift is that, as I said earlier, I'm 55, I was a congressional staffer. Not that many decades ago, there was a time when roughly we would call it the business community, what a dumb term that is, but that's really what we called it. And the business community and the Republican Party had this uneasy but pretty tight relationship because business didn't care about culture. Business cared about getting rich. And Republicans liked most of that, but they also had value. So Republicans stood up for some value questions like the Bill of Rights and the right to life of the unborn child. So it wasn't a perfect relationship, but everything of business needed to get done from a financial standpoint if it was about deregulatory policy. The Republican Party was their party. So in the new gate-ridge era of 1994 on, it kind of started to get tight. And as soon as, you know, when we lost this battle over George Floyd and Black Lives Matter, why did we lose it? Because when we went on even conservative TV, they didn't really want to talk about Black Lives Matter. They want to talk about Antifa, right? Now, Antifa is a big problem and it's a real organization. This is not a fiction, but those protests were animated by Black Lives Matter and we funded all that. Well, that's all those Arabella group of George Soros funded nonprofits. But what was the next step? That next step was that when you had to go get money to run your business, you had to run over to Larry Fink and Jamie Diamond and some of these places. And then they wired it so that the only way you were going to get your financing for everything you wanted to get done. Now it's in everything we do, their private equity money. You had to sign on the dotted line to these anti-American, really hateful policies. And so that got all interwoven into business. And then when that, George Floyd thing happened and we didn't have the courage to say that Mitt Romney was marching for abortion when he marched with Black Lives Matter and that Black kids and Brown kids were being slaughtered in Chicago and other cities because Black Lives Matter defunded those cops and that they have blood on their hands. When we lost that fight and then they were able to force diversity officers into every fortune, 250 company. They all got a diversity officer and they're literally destroying these companies. Why do you think that Transvestite activist Dylan Mulvaney is getting all these contracts for these companies because they have a diversity officer there whose job it is to just jam this kind of policy into the boardroom. And now the boards have radicals on each one of their boards. So you see Disney doing this, you see Target doing this, you see Bud Light doing this. Here's the thing, they're all doing it Sebastian because after the George Floyd incident, even no matter what your opinions on whether that should have happened or not, the idea that he was a hero and the idea that Black Lives Matter was a good thing in society transformed our whole economics. And now we're dealing with the fact that it's taken enough time for that cancer to spread and to grow. I don't know how we get it back out other than saying you can't give them any of your money. I mean, you just can't, one of our daughters who loves going to Target, we had the conversation today. It's like we can't go there. I mean, this is the worst thing ever embracing Satan as a part of your marketing. I mean, you know, where does it go from here? I can't get much worse. This is the molten calf that Moses saw when he came down from the 10 commandments. This is Sodom and Gomorrah. This is nowhere. It's like the end of being able to have a civilization, if we keep being too quiet, now you're not quiet, I get it. I've been too quiet and I started to get more loud. And now that when I look in the eyes of my kids, my youngest is 11, like we better win this fight. As there's no place to go, there's no island that's remote enough, there's no yacht that will have enough supplies on it. Like we've got to cure this problem in America because Sebastian, we go overseas to the CPACs so you know, because we just came back from CPAC hungry. That Prime Minister Orban is a brave man. But if we don't get it done here in America, everyone in this world is screwed. Yeah, they're looking at us. I don't know about you, Eric. I think that is one of the most concise and best answers we've ever had to a question on this one. Really? I thought it was long. Dude, no, on a topic, this complicated, that was epic. We're going to make that viral because it's also opened my eyes that the role of the corporations. You know my wife Katie, she's working on a book right now on neo-Marxism in America. She asked me this question yesterday. You know that well because you've run this very successful organization. She asked me this question. I don't have the answer. Do these corporations that are either in bed with Satanists like Target or Coca-Cola and everyone else giving you? And in bed is exactly the right way to say that. Indeed. I mean, tell you. If you don't believe us, guys, look it up. If Satanist is the designer of the Target children's transgender bathing suit, yeah, it's actually the guy. And it's for children. It's this idea. Oh, no, no, the bathing suits and everything, that is complete BS. Or it's, you know, the Coca-Cola's and the IBM's giving millions to Black Lives Matter. Here's the question. Do they believe it? Do these corporations believe that? Yes, this is providing social justice. Or are they just being blackmailed the same way that, you know, Al Charlottean has been blackmailing organizations for 40 years. You know this as a Hungarian, Mercy knows this is a Cuban, Hungarian American, Cuban, American, I should say, formerly Hungarian, formerly Cuban is what her father would say. But these marks us always gain power with a slender majority, making the large majority feel like they can't say anything. So within the corporate structure, you have a white male executive who feels like he's powerless to push back because they'll get rid of him. So he shuts up, he allows the diversity officer and the HR director and the two troublemakers on their board to have their say on all those stuff that doesn't really impact the business. It's like all this stuff they don't really want to worry about anyway. And now all of that stuff is impacting every part of their business. And now these CEOs have to ask themselves, are they going to cut this out and get rid of those people? Or are they going to keep going along? Because if they keep going along, there won't be a white CEO left. You can see this. I'm not speaking up for white people, even though I am a white person obviously. But the idea that being white is a crime is insane. The idea that young white straight Christian boys can't get into a good school because they don't check any kind of box is insane. And that's where we've come to. Yeah. Yeah. And it won't just be the white CEOs. It won't be the corporations. Target has lost $7 billion in one week. 7 billion. And a lot of black and brown people are disgusted by their transgender policies. Well, not only that. Oh, sorry. Yeah.

Did you notice in the state of the union speech last month Biden doubled down on his spending plans, adding even more to the federal deficit that doesn't bode well for the value of your money. Sebastian Gorka here, Biden's disconnected view of the economy means there will be no meaningful steps taken to lessen inflation and lower interest rates. Your cash reserves and investments will be worth less, which is why I recommend calling veteran owned Midas Gold Group to look into safeguarding your wealth with the stability of gold while you still can. Gold traditionally holds its value when economies fail, guarding against the destruction of inflation and the ruin of a recession. Don't let Biden's misguided economy wipe you out. Talk with the good folks at Midas Gold Group. Go to MidasGoldGroup.com or call 855-322-Gold. That's 855-322-Gold. It's gold you can hold. Midas-Gold-Group.com-855-322-Gold.

We've asked VDH, former seals, Jack Carr, generals from Delta Force, and we always get different answers. What is the greatest influence on them in their understanding of manhood? Some have said they're dad, the football coach. We had one guy say it was fictional characters like Tom Clancy's Adventures like Jack Ryan. In your understanding of what it means to be a man who's shaped it over time. God, I love movies and I love all these cultural references. I'm going to give you an answer you've never, ever thought of, but the mother of God. I think she's someone, if you think about her, I've always felt close to her. I went to a college named after her. When I had troubles, I had a little bit of a tough childhood. When I had troubles as a child, I always felt like she was near me. I think one of the reasons why the Virgin Mary is such a woman of history, not just take the faith part of it. She raised Jesus Christ. She was the greatest man who ever walked on this earth. She wasn't trying to hold him back. She was trying to build him up. It was all about her son. Andrew Cana, she was the one who said, hey, that busy. She was his Jewish mama. She had an agenda of her own that he wanted to make sure that he paid attention to. She was probably no streaking violent. She was probably saying, Jesus, let's get this show on the road. But I think she has been someone for me that always was not a model to, hey Matt, be in drogenous. No, it was like you're here to be a son of God and to be a man. And being a man isn't just about being macho. It's about being tender and caring, but it is about showing courage. It is about being strong and it is about being a leader. I don't think that I come close to the league of what her son did, but I do want to make her proud. I was so looking forward to having you on this show because it's one of the things we've had a lot of snake eaters, tough guys, intellectuals, and not enough mention of faith in the manhood hour. And I knew you'd bring it. You already have and we're only halfway through. I'm curious. God created gender. You know, every Catholic church, this is one thing people don't think about. Every Catholic church you walk into, there's obviously Jesus on the crucifix. There's two other statues. This is the one part of centralized planning that's good that have to be on the altar. It's Mary, who's a woman and it's Joseph, who's a man or them together as the Holy Family. God, God wanted that mandated in his church for a reason because he knew one day we'd be fighting over gender and these roles. And he knew that this was a fight that we had to make. We'd have to make one day. And if you understand history, civilizations, just before they collapse, always question gender. They always go androgynous. Look at what happened to Rome. Look at what happened in Persia. There's always this. You've questioned the fundamentals and then everything. It turns into a foundation of sand. I'm curious when you talk about Mary being your influence, where did you find her? Was it in the Bible? Was it in somebody explaining to you her significance? Was it in the mass? When did you get to know her importance? Well, starting in about sixth grade, we moved to New Jersey and I started going to Catholic school. But I think the answer to that is I didn't find her. She found me. And that's been the most wonderful, beautiful story of my life, which is God found me. He knocked on the door. I haven't opened it, but he knocked on the door. I'm really happy he did. Well, we are too. We talked about Schlab, the chair of the American Conservative Union at conservative.org. I'm Sebastian Gorker.

Welcome back to The Manhood Hour with me, your host Sebastian Gorka and Maxchlab. Having so much fun here, time flies when you've got good guests. I love it when I meet our listeners, I go to these station events and they always say, great guest, Dr. G. Well, of course, there's people I want to talk to that I want to have discussions with and we're back with Maxchlab, this is The Manhood Hour. Now you've got girls, you're surrounded in a sea of estrogen. I do have a male dog. That's a one compensation. Right, right. That's a wise move, a wise move. Because you do live in the swamp and if you want a friend in DC get a dog as they say. But nevertheless, I'm going to ask you this question. It's mandatory for all of our guests in The Manhood Hour. If you were writing a curriculum for the young boys of America that started with the non-negotiable essentials, the prerequisites for what it means to be a man, what kinds of things would you put on there? What defines for you? Where would you start that discussion? With those who are being told, oh, that's going to do that. It's toxic. You're not a man unless you know how to treat a lady. We aren't even allowed to use the word lady. But you see these, I had some young men that stayed in the house the other day they were on, let's say a group from a college and they didn't know how to look at me in the eye, they didn't know how to shake my hand, they didn't know how to give a real handshake. I'm sure they're perfectly fine young men, but these are essentials. For my daughters, dating is kind of weird here in the swamp, parties, dances are kind of weird, but that's what I want to see. When a young man comes over to the house, you want him to be able to look you in the eye, call you by your name, give you a firm handshake, be able to remain looking in your eyes and telling you what you need to know. You know, young men, this is sad that I have to do this, but when a young man gives me a really solid handshake, I instantly tell them. I just say, that's a good handshake. That's right. And I shouldn't have to, but nowadays we do. Yeah, I think the other thing about, I'm going to say manhood, which is awfully important is we always say there's honor and dignity and work and Ronald Reagan said that and a lot of people we respect say that the Bible says that. But the other thing about a lot of these young men, they've never had a job. They don't know what it's like to have a tough boss. You know, I find with the people I manage at CPAC, it doesn't always go well. But a lot of times it does is I think a common denominator as young men haven't had a tough coach. You know, I had, I was in Razzi for a year. I was a competitive tennis player. I was a slow runner on the, you know, on the cross country, cross country team, not my sport. I hated cross country. I had coaches yell at me. I had coaches tell me to drop down and give them 10 push ups because I was too slow or whatever reason. I was in Razzi for a year as a cadet and got hollered at a lot by Sergeant Shuttleworth, his name was. And you know, as much as you hate those moments, it helps make you who you are. My tennis coach was my boss starting from the age of 12 and also taught me how to play tennis along with my mother. He yelled at me a lot. He's no longer with us. He yelled at me a lot. He taught me how to work my butt off when I worked for him. If I ever thought about sitting down in front of the boob tube, we didn't have phones back then or screwing around at all in that job. He would have given it to me. He talked fast. He gave me a list of things to do every day. I hated him a lot of days. But when I look back on my life, he helped shape a work ethic and a respect. When I worked at the country club at the tennis shop, I knew every member's name that would walk in that night. I greeted them by Dr. So-and-so, Mr. So-and-so, ma'am, sir, knew what, what, why they were there. This is a lost start. I'm walking to my club where I play tennis now. The young person barely looks up from their phone to even say hello. We got to stop this. We're not raising kids with the types of skills it takes to be able to run this country in a way that'll make it successful. And I think some of these basic things, you said, I'm trying to remember back to your question, but it's like, what are those fundamental things? If we can't do this stuff, how are we going to do more complicated things? Right. I spent, I had a peculiar school career. I went to the nuns for preschool one year. Korean nuns? I bet they were taught. No, no, no, it was, it was, it was, it was Sister Mary Margarita. She was Italian. I did a year with them. And then I went to a Benedictine school for 14 years. I was there longer than most of the staff had been there. But the only teacher, or the teacher that has made the greatest impression on me to this very day, and I can still see him in his tweet jacket with his master's black cloak was the toughest teacher. And he was the best. He was our Latin master. Mr. Mr. I don't know if you're still around. I'm just going to pay respect to him right now. It was Vernon Irons. Irons was his name. And he was tough as iron. But dude, did we learn, did we come over to that class? I had a Sister John Ellen Garrity taught me history throughout high school. I mean, you didn't want to take Sister John Ellen. She's not with us any longer. But people feared that little Irish none from Chicago. But you learned, right? You learned your history. Maybe you didn't learn. You were going to be in big trouble. So how about this? Cutting grass for the 60s in the neighborhood. I did a lot of that because we didn't have a lot of extra cash. And boy, if you cut the grass wrong or you hid the clippings under the shrub or you did, they caught it. And they, they, they hollered at you. And a young man who never gets hollered at. Yeah. Because all young men are getting more and more. It won't. And our young people are not ever hollered at by anyone. They're told they're lovely and they're perfect and they deserve a trophy. And this is, and they're all getting good grades because grades don't mean anything in a lot of these schools. It's like we're destroying the character of these people. And like an animal that you try to raise right as a puppy so that they're a great mature animal, kids, it's even more important. If you don't raise them right at a young age, they'll have these bad habits. They're whole life. And we have a society that's riddled with people with terrible habits and bad character. I have two more questions left. This is usually the last one, but I'm going to spring it on you now in all of these things. Are you an optimist or a pessimist when it comes to the future of manhood and masculinity and our civilization? Where do you stand? I'm not an optimist in any way, but I have hope. And a former prime minister of Australia explained that to me. I think that's exactly what I have to have hope. I believe it in my faith. But am I, am I just getting up here in the morning and sunny and optimistic about things held? No, I'm the opposite. I'm the opposite of the fact that I'm being affected by the path around, but I have to have hope that it can change. And I see it in the people that are doing good or all around me. All right. We're talking to a match lap. He's the chair of the American Conservative Union. He's the master of the amazing event that is CPAC. You've got to come if you have concerns. If you want to have hope, you got a CPAC, the biggest concerted convocation of its kind in the world. And you recharge your Patriots batteries. That's why it's being replicated across the planet from Asia to Europe to Australasia. You've got to find out more. Go to conservative.org. I'm Sebastian Gorka.

We'll be back with Match Lab on the manhood hour after these messages. Have you ever questioned the COVID-19 narrative? Is there more to the story? Well, the movie, The Real Antony Fauci Will Leave You Stunned.

The realantonyfauci movie.com. Welcome back to America First with me, Sebastian Walker and our manhood hour guest, Matchland. I chose this country. I think it's the greatest country on God's Green Earth. I don't think most Americans who are born here understand that properly, but I'm very disturbed by what I witnessed under COVID. I forgot where it came from, forgot how it was founded, the pioneer spirit, the go west young man that just said, yeah, Fauci, we'll shut down our businesses, we'll lose our livelihoods. And I'm also most disgusted at our churches, including my church, the Catholic church, your church. Talk to me about when it comes to manhood and just civilization in general, the role of courage and the role of those who have faith to be examples to others in these very, very trying times where we are surrounded by the work of the dark one. Well, we're taught from a young age to be respectful of the law. Even Donald Trump talked about law in order. And we have these confusing moments when the people who are supposed to be explaining what the law is and the experts that are supposed to be telling us how we can keep our babies safe are corrupted and they're lying. And that's what happened during all the COVID stuff. Every one of the major players during COVID has now written a book and said that we lied our asses off because we felt we needed to do it because we need to have an answer. I'm sorry. That doesn't, that's not even a good reason for a little white lie. A little white lie, a reason is I didn't want to hurt your feelings or it wasn't an opportune time to like kind of really tell the truth. Not that I had to look smart on the TV cameras and I had to have an answer. So I made it up and destroyed people's lives. You know, I have five kids. My daughters couldn't go to a dance to a football game. They couldn't go to any of their extracurricular activities. They were forced. They were imprisoned in our house Sebastian. And then we had the fight over the vaccine and it was, are you going to get it and are you not going to get it in our household? It was father says you're not getting it and mother agreed and but we had our rough moments, you know, colleges mandating it in schools mandating it. We had to do all the letters. And one of the children I had, I almost thought our relationship would never be the same. Came up to me two weeks ago and she said, dad, you showed leadership and you were right about the vaccine. And I said, and the masks. And I, you know, it was one of those moments where a man wanted to cry a bit because I was like, wow, I stood my ground. I led and the child realized over time that I was right to stand, even though she thought I was destroying everything she cared about. So we've had these moments, but we shouldn't have had to have them. No, just disgraceful. And for Dr. Fauci and the woman with the scarf, Dr. Birx, and for all the other people who lied to Trump and lied to all of us, I'm just sorry. I don't want to, it's not my judge job to judge them, but they have got, I don't know how they ever make up for the lives they destroyed. Really the lives, the people who died because the lives destroyed and the lives that they took. Yeah. All right, we need to continue this. God bless you for doing what you do, your whole team, mercy, the whole schlapp. I can't read to read. You say Katie's Katie's book. Oh, I know. I know it'll be out soon.

The father's brought forth upon this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. I know not what course others may take, but ask for me, give me liberty, or give me death. The world's one little note, no longer remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. I have a dream to do. And not what your country can do for you, as what you can do for your country. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall. I can hear you, the rest of the world hears you, and the people. And the people who knock these buildings down will hear all of us soon. And we will make America great again. This is America First with Sebastian Gorka. So, first things first to the American people. Washington is doing it again. While you were celebrating Memorial Day, all of our men and women who gave their lives for this great nation, and you were spending time with your family and your friends, this town was cutting another crap deal that's going to put you more in debt with no real changes whatsoever. So, the American people need to understand full and well. Do not listen to the talking points. Do not listen to the cool phrases that are being thrown out in commercials, on CNN or Fox or MSNBC, because Washington is lying again. This bill has no cap in raising the debt, just a date in the future. We have no idea what that number is going to look like. Some people are saying $4 trillion, some people are saying $3.5 trillion. This bill in year one might cut $12 billion if you just want to be generous. So, who here thinks is cool to cut $12 billion in exchange for $4 trillion? I don't think that's cool at all. Sounds like the same old excrement to me. That's Congressman Byron Donalds of Florida speaking on the steps of the Congress. I think the voices like his are multiplying. They are not satisfied with a deal that really isn't a deal and doesn't put a cap on anything. I know it's DC. I know it's technical. I know it's debt ceiling. But it's about you. It's about your family. It's about our shared future. So, we're going to talk about it today. We've got some amazing guests for you. Don't go anywhere. We've got the former Congressman from New York, Lee Zeldin. We've got my friend from Los Angeles, that warrior princess Jennifer Horn. We've got the one and only Jack Carr. Yeah, the US Navy Seal who wrote that number one bestseller and then TV show blockbuster, the terminal list, he'll be with us as well. Of course, you. The number here for you to sound off is 833-33-Gorker. That's 833-334-6752. We'll be talking about what happens when a former Trump employee or Trump supporter decides to go rogue. Seems like the latest one is Kaylee McEnany. I've got some advice for the likes of Kaylee and others who've chosen this path. We'll give you updates about what James Comey is doing. Why? Joe Scarborough. For two days in a row seems to be endorsing the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis. Latest news of Tara Reid. You won't believe what the Biden accuser has decided to do. And Ashley Babitt's mother arrested again in Washington, D.C. But first, here's a little reminder of how you play politics. How you do hardball with the swamp. From the winter of 2018, when a government shutdown was threatened, was looming, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi went to the White House and unusually the cameras were let in for their discussion with my former boss President Trump. And it did not go as Chuck Schumer expected. Do you remember this scene? Cut 12. Okay, good. You know what I'll say? Yes. If we don't get what we want, one way or the other, whether it's through you, through a military, through anything you want to call, I will shut down the government. Okay, fair enough. And I am proud and I'll tell you what, I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country. So I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it. The last time you shut it down, it didn't work. I will take the mantle of shutting down. And I'm going to shut it down for border security. But we believe you shouldn't shut it down. Why not? Why not? What happens if this mystical deadline Janet Yellen gave us of midnight tonight expires? What happens if we don't service our debt? What is China going to do? Not sell us the crap they sell us every single day? Is the world suddenly going to switch to the Chinese renminbi or the Iranian shekel? Are they going to say yes? The Russian ruble is our currency and we don't need America to pay back their debts. Really? I tell you right now, nothing is going to happen just as when government did shut down. Nobody noticed. Nobody who doesn't, as my friend Chris Plant says, suckle at the government deed. Those who aren't overpaid bureaucrats in DC, they didn't notice at all. In fact, if the government shut down for six weeks or six months, they wouldn't know the difference. So maybe it is time to play a little hard ball. I got this morning, I was listening to the latest coverage and seeing the hundreds of journalists breathlessly waiting outside the entrance to the speaker's office with their cameras, their microphones and their digital recorders waiting for somebody to appear to give them an update on negotiations. I thought, no, I've had enough. I don't buy. This isn't about Kevin per se. Kevin is an evil. He's not bad. He's not like Mitch McConnell. He's not a Mitt Romney. He's not an active saber. You can actually work with Kevin. We've seen that. But this deal, Kevin, is not the deal that we were promised. The idea that we're 31, almost 32 trillion trillion, even though we're trillion, when did billion become passe? When did that become a small rounding figure? And now we talk about trillions. Really? 32 trillion dollars. And you think it's a success to only add four trillion, no, billion, four more trillion to that. You think that, oh, it's the biggest cut in expenditure since what? Well, not before COVID because under COVID, under the cover of COVID, the Democrats wrote checks for billions and trillions of dollars. Money which hasn't even all been spent, and we can't even claw that back. And the one thing that everyone can relate to after what we saw being done to the Tea Party Patriots, to even Matt Taib, who dared to be the point person reporting on the Twitter files for Elon Musk on the censorship and targeting of conservatives. The day, the day he testified in Congress, the IRS knocked on his door, and we couldn't even get the 87,000 new agents. Do you realize that's more special forces sold? We have 60,000 special forces soldiers in America. All told, special operations, all of them. That's more than we have special operators. The ATF gets agents. And this deal is a success because we can't even stop that despite that being part of the deal. No, I'm done. I'm done. Kill the deal. Play hardball like President Trump. See who blinks first because I tell you what, it'll be that senile old man in the White House. I'm Sebastian Gorka. This is America First. We have a rollicking three hours for you today.
