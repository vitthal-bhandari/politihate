    "text": " Hi, it's Carol Markowitz. I'm so excited to launch my very own podcast. We'll talk to the biggest names and politics, news, entertainment, and get to the truth of the issues that affect your family and have some fun along the way. It's the Carol Markowitz Show, part of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Podcast Network. New episodes drop every Monday and Thursday on the iHeart Radio app, Apple Podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts. Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show Podcast. Third Hour of Clay and Buck starts right now. Everybody, thanks for being here with us. We had just mentioned at the end of the last hour this breaking news story that I think is going to certainly be factored into the discussion underway about law enforcement. Although I don't now that we have more of the details, it isn't going to be, I think, an inciting incident of the likes we have seen in other police involved shootings or police involved use of force, obviously, Tyree Nichols, and that abuse of police power has got everybody very focused on the issue right now across the country. But as Clay was pointing out, less focused than they would be, certainly from the media and Democrat party perspective, because all five of the officers involved in the fatal beating of Tyree Nichols were black. In California, police, and this is on video, and we can link to the daily mail story on clayunbuck.com. So you can easily see it. In California, an individual, there are two cops who are following a double amputee. So I mean, the visual is very, look, it's very upsetting. It's very troubling. This double amputee is trying to run away. And you know, he's missing his legs from below the knee. And he has a butcher knife in his hand. And the report is that he stabbed someone, although there was no further information on who he stabbed, and then was trying to get away from police in his wheelchair, and turns around with this butcher knife in his hand, the cops say that they were afraid he was going to throw the knife at them, and they opened fire and they killed this man, who had a butcher knife in his hand. It is also in the story that Anthony Lowe Jr, he's a 36 year old. The whole story is very, is just very sad. He's a father of two. It is also in the story that he lost his limbs. And there's no further information on the specifics from a previous encounter with law enforcement. So I don't know this is, I'm just going by what's reported in the daily mail here. But it seems this may be an individual based on the history and based on this exchange here in the streets, who is deeply psychologically troubled and a danger to people. That's when you're going around stabbing people with a butcher knife. So I think that Clay so far, the police use of force here law enforcement seems to be in Huntington Park, California seem to be standing behind this incident. It's under investigation. They're going to look at it. But this isn't in the same category of use of force certainly certainly anywhere near what we saw with with Tyree Nichols, because there is a threat. He did stab somebody. He wasn't complying. He turned with the knife, but he's on. I mean, I don't know what the particular terminology is, but he's basically running away on on, you know, he's disabled. He does make a motion. Look, and I'm watching the video too. And we'll see whether this turns into a larger issue. The knife is is a big knife, right? I mean, this is like, this is like buoy knife. It's not like it's a large butcher knife. We're like a chef's kitchen knife. It's big and razor. And you know, you can tell it's a big sharp knife. Yes, he's already stabbed someone. And in the in the video, as you watch it, he makes a motion with he's carrying it, I think in his, in what would be his right hand. And he kind of turns as if he is going to throw that knife, which is when the police officer start to pull their weapons. So I understand it's up on the, it's up on the front page of Daily Mail. You can watch, you can watch that video yourself. And the headline is killed on his stumps. Yes. What the headline is that they have right now. And so that's where I think there's going to be an emotional response to this. But clearly this guy is, is, you know, emotionally, psychologically on well, well, he was, he's, he passed away after being shot by these officers. He did not survive that that exchange. But you know, Clay, this is where, you know, you're seeing an incident here where this, you know, cops have to deal with very difficult stuff day to day. You know, you're dealing with somebody who stabbed people who has previous, a previous violent encounter with law enforcement. We don't have details on it yet, who is not complying, who has a, you know, anybody who understands about it, it's a little bit different in this case, because this individual has a, has a disability. But anybody who understands edge weapons knows if you are within 20 feet of somebody and you have an edge weapon, the chances are you'll be able to stab them even if they have a gun. So you know, and that's how they train you in law enforcement, how they trained us in the CIA, even you have to keep a perimeter of 20 feet. Because within that 20 feet, if somebody has an edge weapon, even if you shoot them, they're likely to be able to get that knife and bury it into you somewhere. So, and if you have it holstered, by the way, they'll probably stab you before you can even get a shot off. But coffee dealing with this stuff all the time in clay that, you know, we people talk about the, the mental health issue. And it's almost as though it's a throw away. There is a lot, you know, in the context of law enforcement and what we can do, there's a huge correlation between the drug abuse epidemic that's getting worse all the time, specifically fentanyl, but meth also methamphetamine and schizophrenia are very closely tied together or, or creating a situations of exacerbating existing mental health issues. And I view these issues as all tied in, you know, and I think law enforcement's having to deal with an epidemic, not just of drug use, but of extreme mental health issues that put people at risks, at risk day in and day out. Well, we saw the Paul Pelosi video, what, how quickly a near death experience could happen in that situation. For those of you who watched it, when it finally came out on Friday, we talked about it during the show Friday, as that video was released, how quickly the guy hit, even with police officers there, pulled that, pulled that hammer and hit the individual in the head. So, again, I think it is so imperative to have experienced what police have to experience at some point in your life before you actually render judgment. And I've said this for a long time, I think every lawyer who is doing anything in the criminal law system or even contemplating it should do a ride along with a cop on a night, right? Just see what the average things they have to deal with are, right? Because whenever one of these viral videos comes out, and I think this is important because certainly Twitter and social media in general amplify these viral videos, and doesn't mean that cops don't sometimes misbehave, certainly look at Tyree Nichols. But when you are able to see the full context of an of a interaction and know how it ends, it is a very different situation than being in the middle of that event yourself and not having an idea how it ends. So, when I watch this video that is up on the Daily Mail now of this individual getting shot, he's got a massive butcher knife, and he makes a motion as if he is going to throw that knife in the direction of the officers. When you have already stabbed someone and you are holding a massive butcher knife and you refuse demands from officers to drop the butcher knife, I don't have any judgment at all for an officer who decides that they have to shoot you, no matter who you are, right? I mean, because to your point, Buck, if you throw that massive butcher knife, like you could kill someone with it and you're clearly refusing to accept officer demands after already having assaulted someone so they know that you're violent and willing to use that weapon. And I just think that we, we ask in a lot of cases, we ask so much of cops. Let's put aside for a second, the Tyree-Nickel situation, that is fortunately rare, where it's just cops who are acting well outside of the boundaries of the law and decency. The reality by the numbers day in and day out of law enforcement across the country is they are put in very difficult situations and they're often really used as a front line mechanism to deal with extreme substance abuse, extreme mental health issues. You know, people who have suffered tremendous abuse themselves throughout their lives and now they're adults and now certain patterns are set, behaviors, a tendency to violence, and they're the ones that are supposed to just make everything okay. And if they don't do it perfectly, we jump on them right away. Again, I'm not talking about extreme crossing of the line. I'm talking about what is actually regularly happening, which is cops in very difficult circumstances being asked to do a lot and to do so perfectly. This is also why, you know, there are people that go around and they do this, they like to get into these filming police officers to see if they actually know whether they can ask for ID or not. It's very minor stuff, but they're basically trying to show that, you know, the cops aren't as constitutionally literate, perhaps, as some folks that want them to be on very minor, on the very basic issue of can you ask me for ID or not? Have I committed a crime or not? And they go down the list. You know, cops are under a lot of stress, a lot of strain, especially at high crime. You know, look, I'm not talking about somebody who's in a place where they haven't had a murder in 10 years or something, right? I mean, that's a different situation, but in major cities or in high crime areas. And I mean, I know that these two officers, you see this on this video, there was no part of them that showed up to work thinking that they would be in a position where they would have to choose whether or not they were going to shoot a double amputee in broad daylight on video who was running down the street with a butcher knife, you know, and there was no part of them that I can assure you afterwards thought anything other than what a horrible situation this is. People forget, I mean, if you have, if the cops end up using their service weapon in their jobs, they're going to go to mental health counseling. You know, this is something that's even an justified shooting. It will stay with those officers the rest of their lives. You know, even if you had no choice, it can be a traumatic experience for the officer as well. And I just think that with the wide open border, the flood of the streets, flood on the streets of Fentanyl and meth, and what that does, so much of the homelessness problem, Clay is tied directly to drug abuse. The drug abuse problem is tied directly to the spiraling criminality. The mental health crisis that I think you're seeing in cities across the country is tied to both the drug abuse and the criminality that comes from it. And then we throw cops out there in the cities, we say, fix it. You fix it. You deal with it. Who else is dealing with it? I know there are some nonprofits and things that are trying, but they're not called in when the guys waving the butcher knife around. Also, Buck, and I think this ties in with the five cops in Memphis. Who's willing to even do this job now? I don't think we talk enough about the number of guys out there and girls who are listening to us right now, who might have had 20 years in the police. And after George Floyd, they were thinking about retirement 25 years, they said, I'm out. I'm not dealing with this anymore. The lack of respect, the danger that I face. So they tap out. These every one of these communities, Minneapolis, I think is one of the hardest hit is having a massive amount of experienced police that are saying, I can't do this anymore. And who are the people that are willing to take these jobs? You don't get paid a great amount, right? You have your life under danger every single day. You aren't particularly well respected in many parts of the community you serve. And if you make a split second error in judgment during the course of your policing, you're getting examined with a fine tooth comb and you may go to prison for the rest of your life. How many people want to sign up for that job? I don't. I'm going to be honest with you. I there's no part of me that would be willing to be a cop right now. I appreciate and respect everybody who is. But how many people out there and that are 20 years old are thinking, Hey, I want to be a cop right now. I bet fewer than has ever existed in any of our lives. And so you're getting a pool of candidates that is probably weaker, which is going to lead to a worse performance on the job probably and poor relations in the community, which becomes a self fulfilling cycle. That's where I feel like we are. And the more we demean this job, the more difficult it becomes and the worse the candidates who are willing to do it. You know, Heather McDonald who wrote the war on cops. Yeah. And we should have her on because there are some if you want to look at data and you want to understand what's really happening, I think she's an excellent and fearless, which is necessary on these topics. Because remember, you have to be willing, this is about saving lives. So to make real change happen here for the better and to save lives, you have to willing to say things that care more about the lives saved and the disproportionate number of black lives that will be saved by better policies rooted in reality than the sensibilities of the left and the Democrat Party. Heather Heather said on a podcast about a year ago, she said there's a study done under the Obama administration in Philadelphia that found that black and Hispanic officers have a higher rate of what is called threat misperception, which means an officer mistakes somebody's cell phone for a gun and shoots. So the push, this is a quote, the push to diversify forces at the expense of some standards of recruiting is insane. End quote. And she's saying effectively the push to diversify police at the expense of skill set in any or of of of ability in any way can result in more violence, actually, more violence that is outside. So promoting people above their school, their skill set isn't just a problem of Joe Biden's administration. Yeah, my friends out there who like to spend time at the gun range, let me tell you, ammo super expensive, you already know that. I mean, you look at it, you know, price per round. Ammo is as expensive as eggs these days. That means it's tough to keep your skills sharp without breaking the bank. But there's a new way to train without all that expense. It's a great way to keep your skills sharp. It's called the Mantis X. The best shooters do the majority of their training by doing dry fire practice at home. That's what Mantis X is. It's a firearms training system that is no ammo all electronic. It lets you improve your shooting accuracy. It simply attaches to your firearm like a weapon light. You can use it at home or at the range for training instead of using expensive ammo. The Mantis X gives you data driven real time feedback on your technique and guides you through drills and courses. 15, I'm sorry, 94 pardon me, 94% of shooters improve within 20 minutes of using Mantis X. This product is now being used by US military and special forces. It is military grade technology at an affordable price. It is a must have for every gun owner. If you believe in your second amendment rights, you must act on your second amendment responsibility to be competent in your shooting. Get yours today. Mantis X dot com. That's M-A-N-T-I-S-X dot com. The torch of truth passed and still lit every day. The clay, Travis and bucks, extensive. Hi, it's Carol Markowitz.

Join me for the Carol Markowitz show new episodes dropping every Monday and Thursday on the iHeart Radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts. Welcome in Clay Travis, Buck Sexton show. Buck Victoria Azarinko, I'm not an expert in women's tennis, but she made the semifinals down in Australia and she gave one of the best answers I have seen any pro-athlete give when they were trying to ask her about Ukraine and Russia. Listen, does it frustrate you that, you know, particularly last night, for example, it was a clear sort of pro-Russian demonstration happening within the grounds of the tournament that these people are coming and using the Australian Open as a platform for these kind of demonstrations? So whatever the answer I'm going to give it to you right now, it's going to be turned whichever way you want to turn it to. And I don't know, are you covering politics? Yes, and I'm an athlete and you're asking me about things that maybe somebody says are in my control, but I don't believe that. So I don't know what you want me to answer. And if it's a provocative question, then you know, you can spin the story however you want. That's perfect. I mean, first of all, she's totally right in how she handled it from multiple perspectives. One is, I don't care what she thinks about that. She's a tennis player. Yes. They should be asking her about tennis. They should not be asking about geopolitics. This is a perfect example of athletes starting to understand that a lot of sports media and she's doing a press conference there right after a tennis match. And she gets asked about Ukraine, Russia, and whatever she says, she's right. The writer is going to spin it the way that they want. I just love that answer. I wish more athletes would give it. Small business owners are finally getting a break. They deserve if your business has five or more employees and you made it through COVID, you could be eligible to receive a payroll tax rebate of up to $26,000 per employee, not alone. No payback.

So we've seen a number of states start to take action on the issue of what the left calls gender affirming care for youth. But what I think is more properly called transgender hormone and surgeries for adolescents and for kids. And so this is a major issue that has gotten a lot of attention the last year or so. Some folks have done very good work in raising this because it's gone through the usual cycle when the left knows they're doing something that isn't going to play well with a majority of the American people, perhaps even 70 or 80% of the American people. They always start out by saying, that's not really happening. Why are you so focused on that? And then when it's clear it is happening, they say, why are you such a bigot? Why are you even talking about this issue? You have to think of it the way that we want you to. And so they've done that with with transgender surgery for kids. You know, out in Utah, the governor there just signed signed a bill put on his desk. This is Governor Spencer Cox that will ban youth. This is from the PBS right up of this clay from receiving gender affirming health care. That's the way they're presenting this. No, really what it will do is at least try to apply the breaks a little bit to giving teenagers 12, 13, 14 years old hormone blockers and perhaps even engage in or be given surgery that is supposed to change their their gender. And you know, I was really, really remarkable. I saw this. And I wanted everyone to hear it. It was Jordan Peterson who everyone knows Jordan Peterson. He does very, very good work. He's he's with the Daily Wire now. Here he is clay talking about something we discussed on the show, which was back in the Disney v. DeSantis, uh, throw down era. There was that Disney executive who spoke about having a transgender child and a pan separately, a pansexual child. This is what she was talking about. This is the head of creative content at Disney, one of the most storied content companies in all history, if not the most. And this is how Jordan Peterson did his analysis of that by the numbers. Listen, the chance you have a trans kid is one in 3000. And let's say the chance that you have pansexual kid is the same. So the joint probability that you have a trans kid and a pansexual kid is one in nine million. The odds that you're a pathological narcissist sacrificing your own children to the glorification of your compassion is eight million, 999,999 to one. So like, do you have a trans kid and a pansexual kid or are you a devouring mother? I think you nailed it. Clay. So well said. It is amazing how often the most far left wing inclusive, and I'm putting it in quotation marks, people end up with kids like this. And I think I've said this on the show before, but one, you can't get a tattoo in most states under the age of 18. That's because we decide that you are not of sound enough mind to decide to get a tattoo. How in the world can it be permissible to have gender reassignment surgery before you're 18? We won't even let you get a barbed wire tattoo legally on your arm. And we're going to let someone chop off your genitals, chop off your breast before the age of 18. I mean, that's madness. It's child abuse. And that should be the law of the land everywhere. And I give credit to Spencer Cox in Utah, the governor there for signing this. But this should be a law that every Republican governor in the country should sign. It's not remotely controversial. Also, if you are out there arguing that your child is gender non binary, and they are six or seven years old or even younger, that's child abuse too. No six year old knows what gender they are in terms of wanting to flip their gender. And my wife pointed this out, but I think it's important. We don't let six year olds pick their own meals, because if they could, they would eat birthday cake for every meal. Does the sound awful, by the way? And for a six year old, it sounds downright delectable. So if we don't let a six year old choose every meal they eat, and anyone who has raised a six year old knows that experience of saying before you can eat X, you've got to finish Y. It's a huge part of parenting. How can anyone justify this idea that a child should be able to pick their gender? It's not coming from the kid. It's coming from the parent who wants to feel special and inclusive. I think Jordan Peterson absolutely nailed that. And it's the fact that that Disney executive can brag to all of the other people in Los Angeles about how inclusive she is because her family is so is so inclusive itself. I don't even remember what is pansexual mean buck. You're attracted to everything. Yes. Every literally will sleep with anyone. And that's different than bisexual how. Um, because it includes intersex people. Bisexual, I believe relies on a gender normativity of cis gender individuals. Whereas if you're a pansexual, you will also include in your pan sexuality the possibility of an intersex individual who is non cis gender. I like that everybody. That's how it goes. That's a really your ability to to know all this is both impressive and troubling simultaneously. And I can't even keep up with all this terminology and and but in all honesty, like who cares? Right? Like why is this why is this in any way an obsession of the left? I think the answer is because there's so little else to fight for at this point that they just have to make up stuff. It's it's all just really, I think, by and large people who are very disturbed mentally and unhappy. And they think if they make a dramatic change in their life that it's somehow going to cure the deep well of darkness that they fill inside them. And I and I hate to have to say that. But doesn't it feel that way that there's this idea if you're 16 years old or 14 years old and you feel unhappy and unhealthy in your body. And that's totally common for many different adolescents out there. They feel as if they have to undertake some sort of radical transformation in order to attain happiness. And I feel almost certain that after this radical transformation in their lives, they don't feel very much different at all. And that to me is the ultimate tragedy of this is that's what they've convinced themselves and there's a cottage industry of people trying to tell them it's not normal to be uncomfortable when you're an adolescent. This will fix it. And most of the time it's a lie. And also you don't have to be an expert to know when people are lying to you. You can just think it through critically and come to the proper conclusion, which is that something is wrong in a situation that is outside of what would be your your expertise. As an I don't have to be a doctor to know that when I was thinking about having effectively clay an ankle reconstruction surgery about a decade ago, because my ankle is a total mess. They walk me through all kinds of possibilities. We might have to, you know, take the screws out again. We might you might get an infection. You might, you know, all the stuff, you know, doctors do this with any surgery. Like, look, if you're going to be under it's anesthesia, you know, it's rare, but bad things can they take you through all that. You'll notice that the moment anybody says, Hey, when you have top surgery as a as a female to become trans, you're actually going, you might have lifelong pain, numbness, all kinds of things, you know, might might it affect your your hormones, whatever the side effects may be. You're not even allowed to discuss just like we saw with the vaccines. Is it even possible there's a side effect shut up you anti science lunatic? You're not allowed to say that was we know, of course, there were side effects. They just suppressed them. Same thing is happening with transgender surgery for children. What are what are the long term effects of taking puberty blockers on bone density on go through a whole list of side effects? If you bring up those side effects, the progressive left, the Democrat base will say you're a bigot. That's all you that's all you really have to know to know something's up, right? This is about kids and their health. And we can't even know what the risk factors are. That's shut down tells you everything. I agree. And it should be a law. I mean, I'm glad Utah's got it now, but this should be the law of the land everywhere. All right. Look, families, you want to preserve your family memories for as long as you possibly can. You want to make sure that you are out there and able to whatever the great memories you have with your families, with your grandparents, with your great grandparents, with your own parents, whether they're on VHS tape, whether they're on eight millimeter slides, old photos.

Welcome back in Clay Travis, Buck Sexton Show, closing out shop here on the Tuesday edition of the program. Encourage all of you out there to go subscribe to the podcast. Make sure that you don't miss a single moment. We haven't mentioned this on the show yet today, Buck. So I figured we probably should. It's good news on some level, although it's crazy. Joe Biden yesterday evening announced that he would be ending our COVID emergency status, I believe on May the 11th of 2023. So almost three and a half years after the COVID emergency started in late January of 2020. If I remember correctly, it's hard to even remember now. We are getting to the point where Biden is finally willing to say, Hey, I'm not going to continue this now. The fallout, I believe of the COVID shots is just beginning. And there was an MSNBC host. And I believe we have the audio of this. This is Yasmin. And I'm going to try to pronounce her name right. Yasmin Voseoggion. And I might have just gotten that wrong a little bit, but she told viewers out there on MSNBC that she had gotten a severe case of myocarditis. I'm not even sure if you've heard this yet, Buck. This was her talking directly to the MSNBC audience from a cold. She's had all of her COVID shots and everything else. She said myocarditis as well as periocarditis all because she had a cold. Listen, I was diagnosed with pericarditis, inflammation of the lining of my heart brought on by a virus, a literal common cold. On January 4th, I was finally discharged after doctors drained the fluid around my heart. And I bounced out of the hospital with the hopes I was on the mend. But that was not the end. Three days later, I was readmitted when I felt a flutter in my heart and determined I had developed myocarditis, inflammation of the actual heart now. They ran a battery test, adjusted my meds and made sure nothing else was fueling what was happening. And in fact, in the end, it was still just the cold that was doing all of this that had caused all of this inflammation in and around my heart. I don't know her particular medical diagnosis, obviously, but doesn't it feel like there are an awful lot of people out there who are otherwise young and healthy, suddenly having heart issues that they're blaming on things that don't seem very likely? I mean, in my life, how many people in your 40s have you known in their 40s who are otherwise healthy? She said she was running seven miles every other day who suddenly get myocarditis or periocarditis. I think we could make this even simpler. It's going with your question. But until the era of COVID, who would even really honestly heard of myocarditis? Which I do think is fair too. Yeah, I think it's fair. Right. I mean, maybe, look, I'm sure there are a lot of people in the audience who are very squared away on all things medical and doctors and so forth. But I do think that there's something to that that we've had to learn what myocarditis is for a reason in the era of COVID. And I also would add to it, Clay, that the people who were supposed to be trustworthy have destroyed the public's trust when it comes to health and all issues related to COVID. And so when you've destroyed all trust, there are going to be people that take an approach of at a minimum cynicism, if not disbelief, to their pronouncements. So the more they claim things, for example, like you're more likely to get myocarditis from COVID than from the vaccine, more people say, well, that's not true. Why are you saying that? Because they can't trust these individuals. They just don't trust that they don't trust the consensus anymore. Yeah, I'm not sure there's ever been a time where institutions were less trusted in America than right now. And when I see that video and I shared it, you can go watch it yourself. I wonder how many people in the MSNBC audience even have their ears perk up and question, wait, is this really the cause? Is this really what's going on? And look, I hope things start to get better when this May 11th date gets here. I would point out that Joe Biden tried to justify his student loan waivers, his student loan erasure, even though it's not in erasure, it's just shifting the debt to the American public from the individual. He said one of the reasons why he was able to do that was because of the COVID emergency. So is he just acknowledging that that was a desperate ploy to try to get young people to vote for Democrats, even though he knew that there was no way it was going to stand constitutionally, just like the eviction moratorium, just like the COVID shot mandate. Think about how crazy that is, Buck January of 2020, we entered a COVID emergency state. I don't remember there being a lot of people who made arguments against it in January of 2020. It's taken us almost three and a half years to leave. I mean, kids could basically have graduated from college and been under the COVID emergency this entire time. That's indefensible. We can't ever allow something like this to happen again. Everybody who was saying at the beginning of the pandemic, I would put myself in this category. I know you would too. Slow down. This is crazy. And once they have this power, they will not want to relinquish it. Everyone who identified the authoritarian slippery slope that COVID presented was correct. All of it. It all happened as we thought it would. They stretched it out. They they abused the public trust. They abused power. All of it. It happened exactly as was anticipated, because when you understand the nature of power and how it corrupts, you understand how those in power will use it. And there's actually right now is laughing kind of dejectedly watching some of the Congress went men and women react to this declaration on the House floor. We are not being led by the smartest among us. And Congress is not sending us their best way. No, I know that probably doesn't stun a lot of you out there. But when the people that we are employing are as dumb as the argument Sheila Jackson Lee just made about COVID that I was watching. I am troubled. Like you could agree or disagree on a lot of issues. But we have so many dumb people that are in Congress right now. They literally don't have the mental faculties to be able to make legitimate arguments in an intelligent fashion. A lot of them don't. Fortunately, this show exists though. So people can hear smart stuff too. Hi, it's Carol Markowitz. I'm so excited to launch my very own podcast.
