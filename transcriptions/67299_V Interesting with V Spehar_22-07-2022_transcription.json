Jeanette's memoir, I'm Glad My Mom Died, welcomed the world into the story of Jeanette and all of the intense life experiences that molded her into the person she is today. But how does she manage all of the messy hard feelings she's feeling right now? In each episode of Hard Feelings, her new podcast with Lemonata Media, she'll tell you all about it. Jealousy, shame, social anxiety, she wants to laugh about it, cry about it, and work through it with you by her side. Why? These hard feelings are a big part of the human condition. They unite us all, but only once we're willing to face them. Hard feelings is out now, wherever you get your podcasts. Lemonata. I'm V-Spear. Welcome to The Interesting. As you know, on our Friday episodes, we dive a bit deeper into a topic that we're most curious about. And today, it's about monkey pox. There is so much mystery surrounding the new virus that's taking large metropolitan areas, like New York City, by storm. But what exactly is it? Well, if you're only listening to social media chatter and alarmist's right-wing commentators, you'd assume it was some sort of like sexually transmitted disease that is strictly affecting gay men. And while that population is disproportionately impacted by the current outbreak, they are not the only ones susceptible to transmission. Because the truth is, anyone can contract monkey pox, which is just a variant of small pox, which I thought we had eradicated like a century ago. So we're going to get into all of your questions on monkey pox. What is it? How do you get it? What do you do if you get it? And more. Joining me today to talk all about it are two medical professionals who, in addition to treating others, TikTok talked about their own personal experiences after contracting monkey pox. The first is Dr. John, a Chicago-based doctor who goes by at that gay doctor on TikTok, and Brian Thomas, a nurse living with HIV who posts content under the handle at PauseRN. Thank you both so much for being with me today. Thanks for having me. Thanks for having me. So I want to start off with, I have to be honest, I have really avoided the topic of another potential pandemic or epidemic. And I have really just ignored what's been going on with monkey pox. What is monkey pox? Yeah. So monkey pox is a viral illness that runs in the same family as a small pox virus. It's transmitted from close person to person contact via either exposure to active lesions that are on somebody or even respiratory droplets in prolonged exposure. And it presents with different symptoms in different people, but the majority of people experience some typical kind of viral illness stuff like fatigue and swollen lymph nodes or throats, stuff like that, followed by breaking out in this rash, which are these painful pox lesions that are located different places over the body and the hands on the face in the genital region. Dr. John, when you were in medical school, was monkey pox something that ever came up before? Absolutely not. We learned about the family of viruses that it is in because we learned about small pox, but when we learned about small pox, it was like, well, it's eradicated, so we don't really have to be stressing about it. So I did not learn about monkey pox at all. And yet here we are 2022, not eradicated unprecedented times. And Brian, as a travel nurse, when monkey pox first started getting talked about, what was the field training like? Did they say anything to you about it? Oh my God, no, there's still been no official like talk about it on my level as kind of like a bedside nurse. Like, there's been no like, at least both of the hospitals that I've worked at during this kind of like period where monkey pox have spent a thing, neither of them had put out any kind of like bulletin or any kind of like, Hey, this is on the rise. Maybe you should watch out for it. There's basically been nothing. Nothing. And how does that differ from like when COVID first started? Do you COVID they took more? Oh my God, you guys are laughing already like this. So when COVID first started, which was something we had never really seen before, right? Opposite reaction then. Yeah, COVID was, I mean, you know, I was I was at the bedside as in the ICU. So like, we were just like ramping up, I feel like for months before like it hit us. And it was every every single day, there was new email every single day. But not so much for monkey pox. There's some parallels in that like originally with COVID, it was so much like, Oh, if you didn't tropical China, like there's no worry about it. And that was like the messaging that we were getting at the beginning. And so patients were reaching out stressing about seeing it on the news. And I was like, you know, I mean, it doesn't really seem like a thing here. Obviously that changed pretty drastically. But monkey pox is now a thing here. And messaging is is gradually changing. But yeah, I mean, even when I was diagnosed as myself as a patient, as a doctor, I knew very little about it. And I am pretty good at keeping up on current medicine. So yeah, I mean, you're a doctor and you got monkey pox. And we're kind of having to both have the virus and try to self educate on how you were going to help people, right? Absolutely. Yeah, because like, as I was like, coming to the realization that I had it, I like first I was like, there's no way that I have this right like there was like, when I got it, the news was saying that there were four cases in the state of Illinois, which is where I live. So I was like, there's no way that I'm patient number five. But then just like, as it came to like, okay, I definitely have this as the symptoms were progressing, I was like, I need to tell other healthcare providers about this because like, if I don't know about it, they definitely don't know about it. And so I want to spread the message as much as I could. This is the thing we talk about sometimes with COVID, not to keep comparing them, but just like in terms of like the average person, what they might be thinking. It's two and a half years into COVID. And now that I say this out loud, of course, I'm going to get it. I've never got it. And I went to the White House Correspondence Dinner, which is a super spreader event. I was a VidCon. And there's something that I feel very grateful for, but also very afraid of, which is, did I get it? And I didn't know. Do symptoms not present themselves? Did I just never get sick? But I was a carrier. Is it possible with monkey pox that people could have the virus but not be manifesting symptoms? I genuinely don't know the answer to that question. The thing is like the testing for it is all lesion based, right? So there'd be no way to if you don't have the rash, then you can't really be tested. So we wouldn't be able to confirm that. So yeah, I am not 100% sure on that. The only reason I knew immediately when I first saw my first lesion is because I had seen Dr. John's video when he had monkey pox. And I was like, wow, just like anything. Like, wow, that's really crazy. I didn't think that this would affect anyone like me, but it's definitely still not going to happen to me. I'm going to go on vacation. And then as soon as I found I had a lesion, I was like, as a person who's reporting the news, I'm constantly told, don't be alarmist, don't scare people. This is a rare thing. This isn't going to happen. They're even really truly trying to suppress like how much communication we do around this. Never mind health professionals. Why do you think that might be? In my opinion, education is power. And the more we know about something, the more we can be more vigilant. I mean, understandably, people are tired and people are tired of hearing about COVID and hearing about things they cannot do. And even like a lot of people in the comments of my videos were like, oh, this is just the government imposing more lockdowns above. And it's like, no, like honestly, I am miserably sick. And I just don't want other people to get this. And so that was the point of my messaging. So yeah, I mean, I truly don't understand the logic behind not educating further about it, but it's frustrating. Do we know or have like a better guess at the rate at which it might be spreading in the US? I've seen there's a creator that I follow called Dr. Tiffany, who's been posting quite a bit about it. And she posted a graph that, and I'm not sure if it's due to suddenly more reporting or actually spread, but it is looking quite exponential growth in New York City, at least. I mean, of course, vaccine rollout has been absolutely horrendous, which is really, really upsetting. But I know in Toronto, they did like an excellent job with vaccine rollout. And it was like super accessible. And their cases are already like majorly on the downtrend, which is nice to see. But here, I mean, we were rising and rising as the day goes on in Chicago, like we already have over 100 cases. And that I was just diagnosed a few weeks ago. And that was when it was at five or six, you know. Right. And that's people who are willing to report it sticking on vaccine for a minute. Did they come up with a new vaccine for the monkeypox? Or is it one that already existed? So there are two that are targeted towards monkeypox. They have not been yet released in the United States at the moment. They're just using the smallpox vaccines, which is apparently able to provide up to 85% protection, which is great to hear. So just kind of going with that for the time being. I think we are close to getting the FDA to approve the monkeypox one to be sent here, which would be great. What group is most at risk right now for monkeypox and maybe should be prioritized? I mean, I think we know that gay and bisexual male identifying people are highest at risk right now. Right. And the, you know, I think it's just going to be most beneficial if we target that population. And I think there's been a lot of just uneven coverage in the media because of it. And I think at first people don't want to say that this is a gay disease and then turn around and say, but it's targeting the gay and bisexual population. But that's what we need to be able to say. And I think a lot of large media sources are afraid that it's going to come off as homophobic if they make that point. Whereas like from a public health standpoint, that's what we need to do. We need to get this information and these vaccinations to that target population the best that we possibly can. I know that there has been a lot, a lack of even just like information getting to the BIPOC community of gay and bisexual men that are people of color. There's been an equity in that just like access to that information as well. And you know, so we have to do better, you know, and there hasn't been so like the CDC just gave out these vaccinations to all these health departments and we're like here, dose them out however you'd like. And there's been no on no guidance on any kind of federal level. I'm like, hey, this is going to be the best way to roll out these vaccinations. And so it's up to every health department to kind of do whatever they think is right. And it's not going well. It's not going well. I do want to ask, when we say things like, this virus is predominantly affecting men who have intimate relations with other men. Oftentimes people are thinking it is a sex based disease or virus and it's not. In fact, I was talking with somebody recently who was saying, yeah, but you have to look, it was it was Hank Green. I was talking with Hank Green about why people get struck twice by lightning. And he was like, because if you get struck by lightning the first time, you are doing activities that make you more susceptible to being struck by lightning. So it's not that men who have intimate relations with men are more likely to get monkeypox. It's that men who have more intimate relationships with men put themselves in a circumstance by which the culture and the activities that they are doing involved more skin to skin contact. We're talking about just going swimming on Fire Island, just like being in the club, just the way dancing, like a lot of these activities that that this particular community involves in, you have some more skin to skin contact than just intimate contact. And that's something that we don't get in the news media. They just don't want to talk about the fact that like, a lot of times gay guys are shirtless and dancing. And like, that's really all that it is, you know? Yeah, I think, and that was an important messaging that I was trying to get out as well, especially during Pride Month is that like, it is absolutely, absolutely affecting gay men and men who have sex with men disproportionately. Like almost all of the cases are in that population. And this was occurring during a time when people are going to these big, large events where people are dancing and shirtless. And like, our culture is a very intimate culture. Like a lot of gay men say hello with kissing each other and a hug. Most straight people don't do that. You know, that's not just not really their culture. And so I was cautioning people because there was that concern about like this fine line between stigmatizing and actually letting people know what is risky of like, yes, the disease isn't asking you what's your sexual orientation before it affects you. But if you are like a lot of allies, go to these Pride events and they would be at risk if they were being in close intimate contact with other people. Of course, like, it's quite extensive contact. Like, it's not like you're just in an elevator with someone for 30 seconds and you're going to get it from them. Like you you have to it's seeming that you have to have quite close contact. But just like other things, like the flu is not sexually transmitted. But if you have sex with someone who has the flu, you're going to get the flu. Like that you're just close and you're sharing bodily fluids. And that that's how transmission of things occur. Both of you having had monkeypox, did it change your perception of the virus? I think it just like really brought it more to my attention because like, similar to what Brian was saying was that like, yeah, you were seeing it on the news and thinking like, Oh, this isn't seeming like it's going to be somewhat something that's going to affect me. And I think it was a blessing for me to have it so early because like I do have a large audience and like so many people were like, wow, like I can't believe that you have it. And it's making it seem so much more real. And it's making me like take this way more seriously and tons of my friends as well. And so like people have like, I've received an overwhelming amount of messages of people being like, I really want to get the vaccine because of you or like similar to Brian, like I realized I had it because of you. And so it just made me way make it feel so much more real. Yeah, it was like, because seeing it on a few news stories and then it did make it more real when I saw Dr. John's video and was like, wait, this actually is a real thing. I made a video about like, I feel like we're in like, crisis exhaustion, kind of like you were saying earlier and like, you know, COVID, we had killer bees, we had, you know, like every, everything under the sun. And you know, and now the news is telling us that like, a variant of smallpox essentially is back on the market. And I was just like, what is this is? And a lot of my followers have been commenting, like, Oh, this is just another thing. It's another sensationalist thing. And then once I actually got it, I went through those that cycle of feelings like, how is this possible? Did I really is it real? This is real. And now and that's when I did it was like, no, people need to know about this. And people need to know specifically about some intimate parts of this that are happening in the community. So I have no shame. Let me share about it. And we're going to hear more about that. We're going to take a quick break and we're going to hear all about what the experience of monkeypox was like and how we can help other people get a better understanding of it so that they could be less afraid, better informed, and hopefully stay safe. This message is sponsored by ColaGuard. Hi, I'm Kate Bowler, and you might know me from another lemonade on media show called Everything Happens. If you listen to my show, you know that a lot of it is inspired by my experience with colon cancer. So of course, increasing awareness around colon cancer screening is really important to me.

Okay, we are back with Dr. John and Brian, my favorite bedside nurse who are both ticktakers, of course, because you know, that's the world that I live in. It's such a beautiful neighborhood all of the time with no problems ever. Guys, right before we went to the break, we were talking about what the experience of having monkeypox is like, kind of like, Brian, maybe can you start by walking me through? I noticed that I had the lesion. What happened next? What was it like to live with it for those two weeks? Yeah, so I had a pretty textbook example of all of the symptoms. I got really tight, got really tired, malaise and I got a headache and a fever and chills. And then I started having these lesions. But what had not been kind of put in any of the resources that I read was some GI symptoms. And I started having really severe cramping and really severe constipation. And then it felt like my like anal rectal area was just in gorge and swollen. And that's when we realized that I had anal rectal tract lesions. And they and this is and when I I was like, you got it, I knew that it was possible to have them in your mouth and in your anal rectal area. But to this severity, there was no information about it. And yeah, so on top of having those symptoms and then having these kind of like sporadic lesions all over my body, which are like itchy and kind of annoying, but they're manageable. For like five days, I was in like excruciating abdominal pain that I had a heating pad. I could only eat soup. I had to take stool softeners to help me be able to pass my bowels. It was like really, really bad. And apparently, a large percentage of infections right now are experiencing these symptoms, which is like, I think, very disproportionate to what we have seen in previous monkeypox outbreaks before, because there have been monkeypox outbreaks before they just haven't been to this magnitude and of this nature, especially affecting one community. So yeah, these abdominal symptoms were horrible. They went away after about five days. And then the rest was like healing these like these body lesions and just waiting for them to heal. And that was just like annoying and boring. Yeah, still like five days of the pain that you're describing, I cannot imagine. And that has to add to the exhaustion on top of that, you're kind of like the isolation, the loneliness of being like, I can only really be the only person who cares for me because it's not like I can go to the hospital. They're not allowing that to happen. And having somebody come in would be dangerous to that person. Dr. John, what kind of long term damage could somebody be looking at if they have a severe case of monkeypox? Yeah, so I had a similar presentation to Brian as well in with the rectal pain. And to be honest, that's an important thing for people to know about because I had that before I had any of the lesions. And I just assumed I had a rectal STI. So I went and got like routine STI testing, just assuming that's why I was having the pain and did not know until I started to develop the rash that it was actually coming from the monkeypox. And it was terrible. Like really, my misfilling are about five days long. And so long term, I mean, we don't really know a whole lot. Like, of course, like, this is seeming like it's a different variant than the one that is happening in Africa, which has like a high death rate, which is obviously a reassuring thing for us to see that like we're not all at risk of dying from this. But there's such a wide range of severity. I mean, a ton of people have reached out to me since posting like from all over the world about what they're going through. And there are people that have hundreds of lesions, which are who are just in complete misery pain, like people have sent me photos of just like being covered. And then people who have five or six and get over it pretty quickly. So I would assume the people with the more severe ones are going to have like some inflammatory issues with their GI track long term stuff like that. But we'll kind of have to see like what comes of this with getting more research. Because that's what's rough about it is that there's not a lot of information on it at the moment. And so I was even trying to read like Google scholar while I was like waiting on my test results to like find out more and like getting anywhere. So so what you're saying is I don't know if my rear ends are going to look the same. Yeah, yeah. I mean, people like I have I have some scars of ones that I had like on my arms and like that. Yeah. So a lot of people don't look at their body. You know, and like they have not know if they're had their initial lesions on their butt. And then they went and sat on a public toilet seat for 20 minutes and then got up and someone else went in like that's scary. That's a concern. It could easily be misconstrued as an ingrown hair. You know, like that's what I originally thought mine were. Or like a bug bite. Like is it of course they evolved to look way like weirder but in early stages like you could confuse it for a lot of things. How do you treat the lesions? Like is there any guidance for that? Is it comparable to something somebody else might have experienced ever? So there is there is an oral treatment called teapox that is being offered for what they consider more severe cases, which there's not exactly a clear guideline as to what that means. But they are saying that if you have like a large amount of mucosal lesions, so whether that be in your mouth or in your rectum, because of course, that severely impacts people like if you can't eat or if you're having trouble going to the bathroom that bad, they will approve this treatment. You have to fill out like paperwork to get it approved. I myself just elected not to take it, but that's the mainstay of treatment. My provider prescribed me like a topical lidocaine ointment that I genuinely don't think did anything. I took it broken and I am hearing of people even taking like narcotics like opioid pain medications and it's still not really touching the pain. So it is kind of seeming like a kind of grit and baret type situation unfortunately. Geez, I mean, I am sitting here just like absolutely in shock. The producers are also texting me in shock because we had no idea. We did extensive prep for this. There is no information about those type of symptoms public truly anywhere. It's not going. It makes me so upset because I feel like people like this information needs to be out there. And I think it's people are just afraid to talk about butts. Sure. Yeah. And people are afraid to talk about these symptoms too. No one wants to talk about their inflamed butt or their GI symptoms, but it needs to be talked about because so many people I have had so many followers reach out to me. Every day there's someone new on my Instagram that's messaging me being like, hey, I saw your video about your anal rectil lesions. I'm having the same thing every day, every single day. And it's not out there for the general public. Right. And this symptom is not exclusive to gay men. I got a DM. I was talking about doing the monkeypox episode and I got a DM from a viewer who is a straight woman in Mississippi who went camping with her husband and she was saying how much extreme pain she was in. She didn't go into quite as much detail as she did, but she was saying similar kind of things. Now it was the first time I heard it. So I was like, oh, well, I guess maybe that's just her, but it's not. This is something I'm telling you, I'm going to get vaccinated like immediately after this because this is scary. These are the things that people need to know are real life implications of trying to kind of avoid talking about these things. We've talked a lot about the adult cases of monkeypox. Is this something that children are at risk for teenagers? Yeah, I mean, definitely, if it can be spread from person to person, if adults were to get it and be cuddling with their child on the couch, they could easily spread it to them. It's like we've touched on it, does not require sexual contact. It's just a body against body. And so kids are definitely at risk. I personally have not heard of many or any cases in the news of it affecting pediatric population, but there's nothing that is saying that they cannot get it. So be careful, you know, just when you're taking your kids out, like we said, there's going to be a vaccine in a couple of weeks, but definitely monitoring all of those safety precautions we took maybe with the beginning of COVID, just making sure the kids remain safe from this and understanding that this is something that can affect anyone. It's just the population that's coming forward and talking about their experience most right now happens to be men. In both of your cases, did you have to report it to your jobs and be working in healthcare? How did that go? Yeah, I mean, I didn't, nobody said that I had to, but I was close with my manager and I, because I ended up, I went to the ER when I had it because I was like something is very, very wrong with me. And so I just messaged her being like, hey, I'm in the hospital. I'm not sure what's going on. I'm going to keep you updated, but I won't be in the office for a while. And so I ended up, I also had COVID at the same time, which just- Oh my gosh, double whammy. Yeah, for a lot of time. So as soon as I spoke to the infectious disease doctor, and she was like, yes, it does seem like it is this. I just told her that that's what I think it is. And I didn't, I didn't even know how long I was not going to be able to work for. Thankfully, I was able to ship to telehealth. So I just like took two days off and then did my job from home, which was nice. But yeah, no real implications in the workplace. But a lot of people don't have that luxury to be able to do that. And that's an important thing that makes me want more people to be protected is that some people being off work for three weeks is like life ruining catastrophic. Yeah, it's yeah, it's life ending. Yeah. And Brian, you were between contracts when it happened to you, luckily, unluckily. Yeah, luckily, unluckily. I, you know, I, with contract work, so I just like let my agency know. And I had a contract already booked and ready to go within it was in about like two and a half weeks, which is probably around like the minimum suggested time that it takes these lesions to heal. And for me, it was like, I, you know, I couldn't afford to just cancel this contract and then wait and then not and then be out of work for another month. So I would just like, well, hopefully my body does what it needs to do. And luckily it did. I actually like got cleared for from the health department the day before I had to fly from to Los Angeles. But it was definitely, it was definitely a gamble. Can I ask what you so when you said clear about the health department, like, did someone schedule you to have like an exam or how did that happen? They they had me send them pictures of my lesions as they were healing. So like, I think on the like on the first day that I had been reported to the health department, they had me take a few pictures of lesions. And then a weekend, they had me take a picture and then right before I needed to go because they I told them like, hey, I really need to I have to fly on, you know, in two weeks. What do you think? And they're like, they were like, well, we don't know about that. And so then I sent them like kind of confirmatory pictures of the lesions to show them like, Hey, these have that they saw that they had scapped over and then that they had healed over. That's good to know because like a ton of people were asking me about the quarantine, you know, because with COVID, we're all being told this number of days, you know, and it's not like that with monkey pucks. And so that's a challenge. And like, literally, the only instruction I was given was you should remain not in contact with other people until all the lesions have crusted, fallen off and formed new skin underneath and healed. And it thankfully, I'm a doctor. And so I was like fairly confident that I was I didn't have like a follow up where somebody like did check to see. And that is kind of concerning because the general population, probably a lot of people are like, I don't know. Am I okay at this point? Can I go out and is this healthy skin? Is this not right? And like I even myself like gave myself some extra buffer days where my friends were like, I feel like you're being really hard on yourself. And I was like, I just don't want any percent of risk of like giving us to anyone. So I'm just yeah, they look better. I think so I'm just gonna stay home another few days to be extra sure. Dr. John, you're a good friend not wanting your friends to go through the butt crisis that you just described. I mean, we're just trying to prevent butt crisis here. Exactly that though, right? Like the public doesn't know, I would have no idea. I'm telling you as a person who like doesn't know and thinks they're doing the right thing, my reaction would be, well, I'll just put a really super secure band aid over it. And then the lesion won't be like in the air and then maybe I'll be okay. Folks should not do that if this is what they have. Yeah. Yeah, it's just not clear. Like I wish there could have been like a test to say like, okay, you're okay to be out in the wild, you know, and it's the same with like having anal rectilusions. So how do you know that those are completely healed? You know, like when is it okay to have sex again? And I like a major concern, you know, like obviously I'm a pretty sexually active person and I've made it a point to I'm probably going to abstain for up to like three or four more weeks because I really who knows who knows. I mean, I think there's also been a lot of there's no there's no information or guidance on how to take care of these lesions, right? Do you leave them open to air so they dry out? Do you keep them moist with some knee is foreign? Do you put something on it to like reduce scarring? Should you put calamine lotion on it? There's no guidance and no suggestion at least that I have found on how to like properly take care of these so that they heal as quickly as they possibly can. Yeah, I don't know of any information either. And people are asking me that all the time like my DMS are full of people like, what should I do? Which is like, honestly, I didn't really do anything. I kind of just waited. I tried not to touch them. I tried because they had that gnarly one on my hand that everyone was like, did you pop in? Like, no, I didn't pop in. I tried watching it too. All right, when we get back, we're going to talk about how stigma is playing a role in the ways that people are reporting the way they're gathering information and unfortunately revisit how the AIDS crisis was handled in the 80s and 90s and how we can do better this time. So we'll have all that right when we get back. In 2022, the US Supreme Court overturned Roe versus Wade. Since then, it's been a barrage of bad news. But behind the Bleak Headlines, there are people working to protect our right to control our future. The Defenders is a new 10 part series about the fight for freedom in a post- Roe America. Co-hosted by Samantha Bee and me, Gloria Riviera, the show will examine ways people are still accessing care from crossing state borders to self-managed abortion. You'll hear from activists, providers, and everyday people doing the work to expand reproductive freedom. We're here to tell you, anyone can become a defender. The Defenders is out now wherever you get your podcasts. Think about a moment in your life that changed you, where one day you were yourself and then the next day, poof, you weren't. I'm Stephanie Whittle's wax host of the show last day and each week I sit down with a new guest to explore happy sad stories of transformation. Some last days are hopeful, some are tragic, but on the other side of every last day is a fresh start. Come laugh cry with us. Listen to last day wherever you get your podcasts. Okay, we are back and we're going to get into now how stigma plays a role in not just how people are telling their stories, but how the government is continuing to ignore these stories and why we don't have any resources to help folks who are very ill. I want to ask you guys both, have you noticed similar language to the way that people are being described that have monkeypox, right? It came out that it's like, oh, this is a gay guy's disease and then immediately all the comparisons to HIV and AIDS came out and then, people were like, I don't ever want to say that I had it because I don't want people to think that I'm gay or I'm like promiscuous or I'm doing whatever. What are the conversations like offline in the community about monkeypox right now? Well, I think that any communicable disease has stigma, right? Sure. Even with COVID that affects the entire general population, you know, when, and I see it at the bedside where, you know, if someone doesn't get vaccinated or someone doesn't wear a mask, there's an understanding like that if they get this communicable disease that they deserved it somehow or they should have made better choices, right? And the same tracks for HIV and the, you know, in the AIDS crisis and even still to today, you know, I still get messages all the time about how, you know, I should have been more careful or I should have known or I deserved it. And the same is happening with monkeypox, you know, and when I became really public about it, you know, and I was, I'm very vocal about how I got it. I had it, you know, having casual sex at gay pride and the stigma in the comments just were, you know, just the same, you know, like, I should have known better. I'm a nurse. I should have known better. I deserve this, you know, like stuff like that. And that just like kind of perpetuates this, like you said, like, and I try to like, you know, tell people, like when other people see that, and they see how they're treating me, they're not going to get tested. They're not going to tell their partners, they're not going to be vigilant, they're going to hide it because they don't want other people to think that they are promiscuous or slutty, you know, or any of those things, you know, and then at the beginning of the media coverage of this, and still people are saying that, oh, it's only affecting gay men or this is a gay disease, right? And I try to stress that like, although it's predominantly affecting this community, when we say that it is just a gay or it is only affecting gay people or it is a gay disease, then people that aren't gay, if they have monkeypox, are going to be afraid of homophobia, if they become public about having monkeypox go get tested or tell any of their, you know, friends or loved ones, you know, it's just like this really vicious circle and it was exactly what happened with, you know, the AIDS crisis in the 80s and 90s, it's exactly what happened. And I actually is still happening with HIV, it still happens with HIV that, you know, people won't seek treatment if they have or they won't get tested because they're afraid that if they contract HIV, that they will be, you know, black sheep as gay or something. Exercise is, yeah. What can we do to break down the stigma around being positive, if you will, for monkeypox so that we can get some local government resources allocated towards research and vaccination? So great question. And I think that's a lot of what both Brian and I are trying to do is just talk about it and talk about how you can get it and how to protect yourself and make it more known because like he and I, like a lot of people are like he and I where we would post on the internet for millions of people to see that we got a disease. People are very uncomfortable talking about this kind of stuff and there is shame and stigma and I received a lot of hateful comments on my posts because of talking about having it and that is really unfortunate and it makes me understand why people don't share. And I think it's important part that he brought up about like getting like people thinking that oh if you have this, you're gay and then avoiding getting tested for it because then they're just going to be out in the community spreading it because if people do have a milder case where they just had six, seven lesions that were like looked weird spots, you could easily just like excuse that for oh like I got bug bites or something and like not get tested and then be out and about hugging your family and friends and that is an absolute nightmare. So just promoting the messaging about how it is spread. It is not from gay sex only. Yes, that is a one way that you can get it but close body to body contact so that people can understand that it can really be impacting anybody. And I do hope that like some of the people that you're referencing these like women that are coming down with it which I'm terrible to hear about but I hope that they are also telling their story so that it resonates because sometimes people need to see someone in their walk of life that is affected by something before it really hits home and the same happened with COVID you know like so many people are like oh this isn't real. This isn't real until a family member someone they knew was affected by it and then they start to understand it and take it more seriously. Have either of you got the monkeypox vaccine yet or no because you got the virus you didn't. Yeah I have not I will probably get it with it being so limited at the moment I'm allowing other people to get access to people. I do. It's better to go to someone that might not have a natural immunity like we do now. My um I will say so Baltimore was only allotted like 200 vaccinations during the original. 200? Yeah yeah for an entire city and it's not a big city but it's also not a little city. And obviously we're concerned that there's only 200 vaccination shots out there but were you concerned when you were in Baltimore about even the tourist population that's passing through not really. Um you know not not really yet so I was a third person in Maryland to be diagnosed and like at that point like it's probably a bigger problem now you know it's like yeah it's like rapidly we're rapidly you know getting more information. There are certain there are places like most places can't even test for my kipox right like there you have to go to specific labs I can actually test for it. And so I'm I you know I'm more concerned about you know the the population that once like we have people that want to get vaccinated our community is like health conscious we've lived through a plague before. We're like ready to combat this we're like ready to line up and get this vaccination and it's just not there. Um yeah we just need more resources we just we need it we need a you know a system to to give these vaccinations out we need a you know federal kind of um uh system on how to manufacture and distribute these and get them everywhere because people are ready for it. We've we've already lived through the AIDS crisis and our community has been shocked scarred and and and traumatized by that. That is so true well we we have to take just one more last break but we will have more with Dr. John and Nurse Brian right after this. It's me Sam B. Look I've made a lot of choices in my life joining the daily show Creating Full Frontal that one summer I got bangs I didn't say there were all good choices my next choice in life is starting this podcast with Lemonade Media it's called Choice Words and each week I'll be interviewing people I admire about the biggest decisions they've made in their lives we'll get into how that one moment impacted their life today and whether I should get bangs again Choice Words is out now wherever you get your podcasts. Hi I'm Elise Myers I'm a content creator and comedian you might know me from TikTok Why am I in your ears right now? Well that's a great question I would love to tell you. I have a new podcast called Funny Cause It's True on my show I'll be interviewing comedians pop culture icons and also just people I find really funny we'll be talking about the awkward moments that keep you awake at night because if you don't laugh you cry right okay funny because it's true out now wherever you get your podcasts. And we're back as you know oftentimes we think about things as so American right and that's the way the news goes that's the way the United States news goes anyway it's like America only all the time and we only talk about ourselves in this bubble but there are cases of monkey pucks that are breaking out in the UK and I just saw that India had their first case. Do you guys have any info on how this is spreading internationally? Yeah UK has a lot of cases. Spain has a lot of cases as well. As well was a big outbreak after Berlin Pride so to say yeah there's a lot of European countries that are being affected by Canada as well so it is not a US thing only. Of course the US is floundering in terms of vaccines which I'm not surprised about either but yeah it's really it's becoming a worldwide thing. Dr. John do you know how long they think that the virus can live outside the body on surfaces because I haven't gotten like a real answer. I haven't gotten a real answer either. I just read something that said more than 48 hours and I was like okay but until when though like what does what does that mean? Right. There's a lot more than 48 hours. Yeah more than 48 hours is forever to me that that's it. I mean more than like two hours is like you're probably somebody else is going to come in contact with that. I know because I didn't want anybody coming in my apartment for a long time because I was like I don't know like I was just like living in my monkeypox filth for 14 days not doing anything like it's my couch okay like I don't know it's scary. Is there anything from your guys medical training that would tell you like okay Lysol kills some virus is this something that when somebody doesn't have monkeypox anymore they could potentially do some sort of deep cleaning. There is an official and the my health department sent me an official list of uh uh soaps and sanitizers and cleaning supplies that are effective in killing the monkeypox fibers and uh yeah they sent me that information was like but like chlorox would kill it right and like yeah so that's what I used but they did there is a list out there that um gives you suggestions on cleaning supplies that will be effective in killing the virus but I mean you can't bleach your couch cushion right yeah we'll find that list we'll link to it in the show notes for sure any advice for folks as we're wrapping up our conversation here and I go home I go like absolutely scream into the void after this because I'm so scared now is there anything that we can tell folks to help encourage them to take this seriously yeah I mean just be vigilant I think that is the the best advice like so many people are asking me like is it okay to get a massage is it okay to do whatever and you know everything in life comes with risks so you kind of have to decide for yourself what is what activities for you are are with the risk um know that this is out there know that this is spreading know that there is a vaccine and we are every day getting better access to it and so hopefully it's very accessible within the next month or so so if you can be as safe as possible in the next little while that would be the best thing for you because I do not want anyone else to have to go through what both of us did I mean the butt stuff guys I agree I think they should have led with that if they led with monkey pucks will cause severe uncomfortability in your in your bathroom capabilities I would have taken a serious straight off like I already have GI problems as probably everyone who listens to this podcast does because most of us are millennials and gen X and like everybody's entire immune system is like destroyed by the years and years and years of stress I am not adding like anal fissures and lesions to that I can't add to the things you don't want to you don't know oh I've learned so much from y'all today I've had a lot of long-term HIV survivors reach out to me and say how triggering this the coverage of this has been for them because they lived through all these stories about oh you know so-and-so he has lesions I wonder how long he might have to live and it had it I think it's important for me to say right now that you know we have not seen mortality with this virus we have a vaccine that again is growing increasingly available and while it is can be a severe illness it is manageable uncomfortable but manageable and that's what makes this different from these other epidemics that we have seen and I think people need to be reassured that that you should be cautious about this you we we know how we can avoid this so avoid close contact and things like that and sometimes you make a choice that is weighing that risk and this is going to be more fulfilling for your life but I don't want to over frighten people about it because that's I think where we get this like this crisis exhaustion where people are just going to be like oh it's just another thing where people think everybody's gonna die blah blah blah yeah and we appreciate you for it it is not easy to talk about these things and I'm so glad that y'all were here with me today to just clear up some misconceptions and help us understand what's going on with monkeypox a little bit more you've both been such a light and a resource for people on TikTok and I will link in the show notes also where
