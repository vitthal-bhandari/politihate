    "text": " And now from the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN, the axe files with your host David Axelrod. There are a lot of great stories in American politics, but one of the best is the story of Senator Patty Murray, who had no inkling about a career in politics until politics encroached on the life of her and her family, and she decided to take action. I had a chance to sit down with Senator Murray, who is now the highest ranking woman in the United States Senate and the third ranking Democrat in the U.S. Senate. Earlier this week in Seattle, at the beginning of a very eventful week in our nation's capital. Senator Patty Murray, it's so good to be with you. You know, I've had lots of folks on this podcast who, even if they don't say it, you get the sense that they were thinking from the time that, maybe from birth, that they would might be a governor, a senator, a president of the United States. I think you probably can point to a few of your colleagues in the United States Senate who fit that description. But I am willing to bet back in the day in Bothell, Washington that you were not thinking that you would one day be the number three ranking Democrat in the United States Senate. Never, ever occurred to me, actually. Never. I mean, I grew up in a big family, seven kids, didn't have a lot. My dad ran a dime store on Main Street to Bothell, a thousand people in the town. My mother and dad always made us believe that we could achieve whatever we wanted to, but certainly politics, certainly not being in the United States Senate, ever occurred to me as something that I would go for. And talk to me a little bit about your folks. I know you say your dad ran this five-in-time store. I know your mom took care of you guys and looked after you guys. And then he got sick. Yeah. You know, we were a typical family then. Well, I don't know how typical they were seven kids in our family, several cats and dogs and what all. And I think, you know, we didn't have a lot. My dad had a pretty middle class, probably lower middle class job, ran a five and ten cents store in Bothell. But we never... He was a veteran of the war and came home and he'd been injured, but it wasn't a big part of our lives. And my mom stayed home and raised a sass. Actually most moms did at the time. And I think like a lot of people, they just thought, this is our life and nothing else is going to happen and we'll just plot along and things will go okay. Well, that wasn't the course that my family ran into. My dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when I was 15. But he displayed symptoms. Yeah. Was there a worry about him that led him to go and see a dog? You know, I remember it well. From the time I was an early teenager, my dad would fall down very easily. I remember one time he fell down and somebody walking towards us, looked at him and called them a drunk and my dad didn't drink. And so, you know, as a kid, you're kind of, this just doesn't feel good. But it was at a time when healthcare was expensive for families. They didn't go check it out. So, it took probably three or four years before they finally did and he got the diagnosis. And MS is not easy to diagnose. Certainly wasn't thin. So, it took a while. And you know, but that was life changing for our family. How did it change your family's life? Well, my dad worked for a bit, but not for very long. And he, the man who owned the store that he ran told them that he just wasn't capable of doing it anymore. So all of a sudden, my family, when I was a teenager, and again, I'm one of the older kids in my family, my sister is 13 years younger than I am. So, we ranged, a broad range. All of a sudden, he didn't have a job. And he didn't have an income. And my mom who'd stayed home, she'd had a few years of college, but quit to get married. And didn't have any skills, hadn't been working, had to all of a sudden take that responsibility of seven kids taking care of my dad, who was ill, and making sure we were all okay. It was rough. Let me ask you about the healthcare, because you mentioned that healthcare was expensive. Did you guys have insurance? How did you take care of all of seven kids? Well, we didn't go to the doctor very often. You didn't go to the doctor unless it was really bad. I remember my mom falling one time and breaking her ankle. She knew it was broken, but she didn't go to the doctor because they didn't have the money. And later on in my life, my mom limped badly because she'd had a broken ankle at one time and didn't get it taken care of. So healthcare wasn't something that was easily accessible or affordable, especially with a big family like that. And I think that's one of the reasons today I feel like it's something families should have. You shouldn't have to give up basic healthcare. My parents shouldn't have struggled. I remember when my parents, well, my dad, of course, had MS, and we were out of the house by then, but he didn't go to the doctor very often. And my mom had arthritis and then heart problems. And I distinctly remember my mom saying to me one time that they were crawling to Medicare. And I thought this isn't what my country should be about. I had a huge impact on me now, today, years later, when I never expected to be thinking about it again. Yeah. I want to, in a bit, we'll talk about what you're doing right now on that issue because you're going back as we speak to Washington to work on the healthcare issue yet again. Right. I know. But how did your mom deal with the burden that she suddenly had to assume? Well, my mom, a brave soul, and had to swallow her pride and courage and applied for welfare and food stamps that got her by for a few months and applied for school. Unfortunately, she got into a program at Lake Washington vocational tech school, which is what it was called at the time, and to get an accounting degree, which would be two years. And meantime, found a part-time job at another small store that she could put a little bit of food on the table. My dad was a veteran, so he got a little bit of money from the VA. And we struggled. I mean, since the time I was early teenage, or I worked at stores, I worked part-time, I worked in the summer, I worked Friday nights when everybody else wasn't so did all of my brothers and sisters because we all had to contribute. But it was a tough time because getting welfare is not easy when you are a prideful person. And when I hear people put down people on welfare today, I just think about the look in my mom's eyes when she had to go apply for that. But she needed it. You know what, that little bit of help got us back on our feet. My mom got her degree. She worked hard. We all pitched in, and she got her degree, got a job and was somehow able to get us all through school. All seven kids in my family went on to college and got their degrees. Yeah, that's amazing. Which is amazing. But we had a country who believed in investing in people. No matter who you are, what happened to you or where you come from. We all had work study programs that helped us get jobs. We all had Pell grants and student loans and the support we needed to make it through. And I look at families today who are struggling and I think my country has to be there for you. That's part of our obligation as a nation. And I look at those seven kids now, all adults, all giving back in various ways. I have four brothers from an attorney to a firefighter to Microsoft and genius innovator and sister who is a teacher and a brother who is a sports writer. I mean, we all contribute back to it. You got a whole community right there. We have a community right there and a United States Senator, by the way. But I wouldn't be here today. They wouldn't have those jobs today if our country hadn't been a support network for a family that hit some hard times. You got married to your college sweetheart and you had children, you were raising your children, you were working at a preschool program. Tell me what happened there because your entry sort of into the world of politics is a pretty unique story. Well, you know, I never envisioned being in politics, never thought about it. There were people who made decisions and I just wasn't quite aware of it until I had a family of my own, two small kids and they were enrolled in a co-op preschool program that we have here in the state of Washington that is partially subsidized by the state and the parents pay some tuition and it's run through the community colleges. It was a great program. I have a college degree, but I didn't know how to raise kids. So this parent education program was a great program, a preschool program and a parent education program so that you could learn alongside your kids about what's best for them and how to handle situations and all the things that go into parenting. And one day our instructor told us that the program was going to end and I was just like, why? You can't do this. This is obviously really a great program. And she said, well, the state legislature cut the funding. My first question is, well, who are they? And it turns out they were the- Did you even know who your legislator was at the time? No, I had no idea. I mean, I voted, but it wasn't a part of my consciousness. As I went through life, I knew there were people that made laws and things like that, but I didn't really focus on it. And when she said they did this, I thought, oh, well, they just don't know what they're doing. I just need to go tell them how great a program this is and they'll turn around tomorrow and put the money in. So I put my two kids in the car. They were one and three at the time. Drove 100 miles to Olympia with my two kids in the back car. State Capitol, have you ever been there before? Never been there before, ever. And drove in, parked my car and hauled these two little kids into the Capitol looking for somebody to talk to to say, you know, you've got this program, you can't cut. And I ran into people and told them my story, told them about the preschool. And finally, I had one person say, well, who you really need to talk to is this one senator that is in charge of this. And I asked who he was and they told me and I went to his office. I mean, okay, he's no different than me. I went to his office with my two kids and he kindly listened to me and then just looked right at me and said, you know, you can't make a difference. You're just a mom in tennis shoes, which I was. But that's not all I was. I was someone who cared about my community and my family. I cared about my country. I wanted this program and I thought that is so wrong. So what did you say and what did you think? I know what I would have said. I was mad. I was just, I mean, I put my two kids back in the car and I drove home for 100 miles saying, this guy is not going to get away with this. He just isn't. And I got home and I just started calling other parents whose kids had been in the program and they put me in touch with other parents. And this was pre-cell phones and pre-faxes and all those things that allow communication and I just started. For better and worse. Yeah, for better and worse. And people would say, oh, you know, there's a program like this in Moses Lake or in Vancouver Tacoma. I think I know a parent whose kid went here and pretty soon I had put together a list of over 13,000 wives and dads whose kids had been or were enrolled in this preschool program. And I organized tree charts and got people to be in charge of different legislative districts and we formed an organization. So you became an organizer by necessity. I think by anger is what I would say. They just could not get away with this because it was a put down to me that I couldn't make a difference because I was a mom in tennis shoes. But it was a put down to every single person in the state by saying you don't make a difference. You're not important. Well, I grew up believing that everybody is important and that we all contribute in different ways. And I thought our voices are just as important as she is. I don't care if you're a tall guy in a dark suit with a red tie and you look important or if you're just a mom in tennis shoes. You have a right to have a say. And that's what we did and we fought back. And you won. And it wasn't easy, but I will tell you, for the next three months, those state legislators did not have any hearings without a row of moms with little kids in the front staring at them. And they knew it. And we held rallies in Olympia with our kids. And finally, they overturned the procedure and reinstated the money. You know that story reminds me. I had a client years ago. You may have met John Street. He was the mayor of Philadelphia. But John started off as a housing rights organizer in North Philly. And he was leading a protest at City Hall. And he was trying to talk to a member of the city council. And as he was being carried out by the police, the councilman said, you want to talk to me, you get elected to the city council. And so John ran. I don't know if he ran against that guy or one of his allies, but he ran and won. And that's what prompted him to run for the city council. So organizing by anger. Organizing by anger and organizing by understanding what a democracy is. This isn't a them. This is us. What you described is really democracy at its best. You know, we saw a little of that, it seems to me, on the health care issue over this past period of time when your colleagues on the Republican side there were trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It seems to me, and you would know better than I, because you talk to all those folks all the time, that all of those people who showed up at town hall meetings had a profound impact on members. Absolutely. And you know, it wasn't that they just went to those town halls and said, don't vote this way. They told their personal stories. This is why this is important to me. This is what the impact will be. They made it real. They made it about America. That's why it was so powerful. It was who we are, our families, our stories, what we care about, what we believe in. They told very personal stories. Many of them courageously told personal stories, and it had an impact. I mean, there's been so many parallels between this year and what I feel like I did many years ago that got me started in politics, because when you're not paying attention, things happen to you. When you're paying attention and you go out and you get involved and you talk about what's important and what's real and tell a story, that's what changes the policies in this country. It made a difference for me then, and it made a difference in health care this year. And I'm just delighted, because that's what I think our forefathers wanted. Yeah. You know, I skipped over one part of your bio that I think is really meaningful and important, and that is the time you spent working at a VA hospital here in Seattle and in a mental health unit, a psych ward, essentially. That's right. Talk a little bit about that. So this is important for a number of reasons. People often say, what do I do right now if I want to run for office? And I think the question should be, what have you done that's made an impact and impression on you that makes you want to run for office? And what I did is- That's just so important. Because the question I always used to ask people when they come to me and say, I want to run for something, I always would say, why? Why do you want to run? And if they couldn't answer that question, my advice was always, I don't think you should. Yeah, exactly. Well, what happened to me at the VA was part of my life story that I never thought, well, this is going to get me into politics. But it's part that now that I am in politics, I think about every day. Because I was in college during the Vietnam War. And many people I knew were going to war, a very unpopular war. And unpopular when they came home, they were put down. Yeah. Veterans were put down. Period. And our history because those who served bore the brunt of the public anger about the policy. Yeah. So I was in college and volunteered to do my senior work at the Seattle VA. Because I just felt like I need to see what is happening to these people, that everybody's protesting, the real people. And I worked on the psychiatric ward. And it was powerful. I mean, I was dealing with young men and women, my age, coming home from Vietnam, mental health problems that had no names at the time. We didn't have PTSD. We didn't have the kinds of research. We had it. We just didn't know what it was. Right. And they were being put down for being veterans. And every one of these young people had such an impression on me that they had chosen or were sent to a war. Fought for a country, came home, and our country should have been there for them. They shouldn't have been on a locked ward. They shouldn't have been told they weren't important. We should be doing everything we can for them. And that had a huge impression on me. Because I saw a lot of people who didn't go to war, who were lucky that they didn't have to go to war. And they needed to be participating and taking care of the people it chose to go. One thing I wanted to thank you for was, you know, I have a lifelong or an adult lifelong relationship with epilepsy because I have a daughter who was born with it or nearly born with it, seven months old. My wife started a research foundation called Cure Citizens United with Research in Epilepsy. And you were involved in starting these epilepsy centers around the country to research epilepsy and work on epilepsy. On the epilepsy issue, it's important relative to these veterans because traumatic brain injuries are a leading cause of epilepsy. And I think one of the signature injuries of these two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are sadly traumatic brain injuries. And so we're going to see a lot of these cases. So you helped other generations, future generations of veterans by doing that. But on the mental health issue, what did you learn from that experience? Well I learned that these were not somebody else. These were real people. And they all had personal stories. And many of them felt really alone and couldn't deal with what was going on with them. And we didn't have a lot of research at the time that was really applied to mental health. And years later, when I was in the Senate, I never knew when I was working at the VA. I would ever be in a position to actually do things like this. It was right after the Gulf War that I went into the Senate. And I had noticed how many people were really being left behind. If you have a physical wound of war, you have a much greater chance of someone saying, thank you for your service, what can I do? Business saying, what can we do to help you? Then the mental health. But it is just as real, just as critical, is curable. And these people have as much right to the kind of care that everyone else does. So it's just been a passion of mine to make sure that they get the help and support that they need. Why do you think there's been such a spike in suicide rates among veterans? I think that a lot of them come home and feel like their lives have changed so dramatically. Their peer group that they left went off and went to college and are working in some high-tech company. They went off and served our country and they came home to a world that doesn't understand what they went through. They don't find a place for themselves. We have to work to make sure they have that place. The error that we made in Vietnam should not be repeated now. Where people come home, not spit on this time. We do a much better job of saying thank you. But they still don't feel like we understand what they went through and are really grateful for it, not just grateful like, thank you. But really making sure that they have the support they need to reintegrate in a good way. It is striking how different it is from the Vietnam era. You know, now you go to a ball game and at every ball game some veteran is honored and the crowd stands up as one. And cheers for them. But you also have a homeless population, many of whom are sadly veterans who people walk around, step over, some of them from our Vietnam era veterans. But we have a lot of work to do. I have to take a brief break and I'll be right back with Patty Murray. So let's get back to your story. You had this great success. You turned away the lunkhead who made the remark about the moms and tennis shoes. You obviously got a sense of empowerment from that and you decided to run for the local school board. Yeah. Well, I learned a really important lesson from that. You can sit at home and gripe about what happened to you or what happened to people around you or you can go out and find other people who feel passionate and work with them and change policies you don't agree with. And I found that I liked that path much better than yelling at the television or griping about it because I care about my neighborhood and my community and my state and my country. I want it to be a better place. And I found that you can make it a better place. You have to work hard. You got to bring a lot of people together and it isn't easy. But that's how you make a difference and that's what's important. And that's really what got me into politics. So after I got involved in that, my kids happened to be starting school at the time and I thought, well, who's making the decisions here? I saw what happened in the state legislature and I went to a school board meeting, all nice people, but none of them had kids in school. And I thought, well, who is speaking for me here? Who understands what moms and dads are going through today? They're nice. But who has that real? Who can sit at that board meeting and say, this is what's happening? And so I decided to run for the school board and ran against a really nice gentleman. Do you guys run in districts? We ran just schoolwide, Shoreline School District, the whole district. And I just started knocking on doors and talking to people and learning how to raise money the hard way by asking for it. We actually, the first fundraiser I ever did, you'll appreciate this, I told my husband, I just can't ask people for money to run for office because the people don't have money to give. So we held the garage sale and lost money because we ended up giving things away to people who needed it. So I realized that this was not going to work. He actually had to ask people to invest in you. That's a hard adjustment. Hard adjustment. Hard adjustment. But we worked hard and then sadly, just a few months before the election, the gentleman that I was running against found out that he had a terminal disease and wasn't going to live long. So I stepped back from running against him, ended up losing by 300 votes. And shortly after the election, he passed away and I was appointed to his seat because the school board members felt that I should replace him, which was really great. So that really started my political movement. I lost and I won by losing. But by showing basic human decency. I think that's part of it. Yeah. And I loved it. I loved being part of the process and being involved in the decisions. But I kept running into the state legislature that was making decisions that weren't supportive of schools. So I remember distinctly going down to Olympia one day as a school board member and looking down at the state Senate and thinking, oh my God, they're all bald heads. There's nobody. Not that that's a bad thing. But when the entire state Senate looks like that, then you say, who's speaking for me? Who's my voice? Who understands what's happening? And I think they need to hear a different kind of voice here. And I announced I was running against an incumbent. He'd been there for 15 years and everybody told me, there's no way you're going to beat him. And I ended up beating him because I worked hard. And similarly, you had one of those moments when you decided to run for the US Senate. Explain that. Well, after winning the state Senate seat, I loved being involved in the policy decisions and working issues through. Never dreamed that I'd go on from there. But I came home one weekend and watched the Clarence Thomas hearings on the TV and I just was stunned that this was my United States Senate. These were the people representing me. And I remember saying to some friends, there's nobody there saying what I would say. And I said that night, I'm going to have to run for the Senate because they need somebody to say what I would say. And nobody thought I had a chance. I mean, obviously. But hearing\u2014 Because you were running against an incumbent. That's correct. Now, was there anybody even\u2014did you have to go through a primary or were they just happy to have a candidate? No, no, no. There was a primary. There was several candidates in it, a congressman, a former state senator, and a number of people in the primary. But you know, I ran by working hard, by including people in my campaign. No one gave me a chance. In March of election year, running for the United States Senate, they did a poll and I was at 3%. I wasn't dissuaded. I knocked on doors. I called up all those moms and dads I'd met fighting for preschool programs years before. And I asked them to hold a coffee for me in their community just to talk to their friends and neighbors. And I think we stunned everybody when I won the primary. But I think a lot of people felt like I did. They had watched the Clarence Thomas hearings and they really felt like the United States Senate was not a representative of the entire country when it was missing voices like women. Yeah, you know, I'm from Chicago, obviously, Caramos-Lee-Bron, that year for much the same reason and ended up winning. But when you guys arrived there, how many women were actually in the Senate? Before we won in 1992, there were two women. When we won, we made it all the way to six women in the Senate. Yeah, what was that like? I guess you had had a little bit of an orientation because you had all those baldheaded guys in Washington state. I knew the room. You know, I think there was, because there was such attention on women running that year that we were actually given a real opportunity. I think many of the men in the Senate who'd never had to work with women in the Senate before were a little afraid of us. Like, are we going to be bomb throwers? And I think we proved ourselves. We sat down and we worked just like they did. We fought for our states. We did our homework. We knew the issues. And I think, I remember something that I think made a real difference. When I was one of the first debates we had in the Senate when I was elected was on family leave. Ted Kennedy was running the debate and there was a lot of numbers and the kinds of discussions that most men like to have with charts and graphs. And I came out on the floor of the Senate and I told the story of a friend of mine who lost her job because her son had been diagnosed with leukemia and was given only a few months to live. And her boss actually said to her, you're going to have to choose between being with your son or being at work. So I told that personal story of why we need family leave and why it was so important to me. And I remember distinctly walking off the Senate floor and I'd only been there a few months and one of the male senators said to me, we don't tell personal stories here. And I just said, wait a minute, how do you pass policies that work if there aren't real stories that are attached to it? And he came to me years later and he said, you know, you really made me change my mind. You worked on this issue in the state legislature as well. Yeah, it was one of the bills that I passed in our state legislature because of that same woman I just told you about. It had a real impact on me. And I fought very hard in our state Senate and got our first family leave bill passed. So it was stunning to me to come back to the United States Senate and the first bill we worked on with Ted Kennedy running the bill and passed the first national family leave about the law. What is it about, I mean, first of all, let me just say on my own behalf that I hate charts and graphs so I must be in touch with my families. I like stories better. But tell me what, now you have 20 women in the Senate, tell me what a difference that has made and how do you see, you say we do just what everybody else does. We represent our states and so on. Are there qualities that the women who have come to the Senate have brought without making gross sort of generalizations that have changed the nature of the Senate? I absolutely believe that. First of all, I think women come to politics to solve problems. And as you did, aren't us enamored with the well, let's have a big debate. Everybody wins, somebody loses and we all get to go home and do this again next year. We don't have time for that. We got to get home and take care of our kids and our families. We really come to solve problems. So I think we are better collaborators. I'm talking about today maybe 50 years from now it could be different. But I think women in politics tend to listen, find solutions and then work to get that done. And I've seen it many times. Now the women in the Senate, you gather, is that right? We do. On a regular basis, weekly basis or something. Yeah, we do. We've been doing that since. Republicans and Democrats. Republicans and Democrats. And it's such an important part of our lives because when I came in 1992, all six of us, Senator Barbara Mikulski, one of my heroes, said, you know, there isn't any playbook for how we do this. So I think that it would be helpful for us to get together. And we all agreed, all six of us, that we had a really important role. We needed to show women that they could do this job. And you can't not be supportive of each other because if any one of us failed, then we would all have failed. So we set up monthly dinners that we all came together and we had two rules. You could talk about anything, but you can't tell anybody what you talked about. And it's served us all these years. I think on my next five questions. Well, it's a great way to get to know people, to talk about the issues, to talk about the personal things that are often get lost in these really stressful times, and to really understand and know people about what makes them tick. What's important to them? What's their family like? What are their worries and concerns personally? Because then I think you can work with them better to find solutions. Has it translated into, you suggest that with the way you ended that last thought, but has it translated into tangible things that you can think of that would not have happened otherwise? It's hard to say it wouldn't happen to otherwise, but I do know we just had a health care debate in the country. Two women played a very large role there. Played a huge role. Colin's in Murkowski. And I think that they were able to talk with all of the women's senators about some of the things they cared about and what was important to them. I know what was important to them because they were telling us what was important to them. Yet they were shut out of the room. The Republican senators put 13 men in a room and said go figure out how to replace Obama. Let me ask you about that because just I'm asking you now, like a political person to a political person, what kind of strategy is that to, I mean, what are the optics of that? I was sort of stunned by it. I was completely stunned. I think the women Republican senators were stunned. And I think most of the people- Do you think they were excluded because the leader didn't think that they would be cooperative on the issue? I think the leader knew exactly what they wanted. Both Lisa and Susan made it very clear that they would not support a repeal of Obamacare that took away the funding for Planned Parenthood and millions of women in this country to get access to care they needed. And I think Mitch thought if he put them in the room that they would not be willing to go down a path that he wanted to go down. You've done very well more than most in a very rancorous partisan environment working with Republican colleagues and particularly Senator Alexander who you're the ranking member on the health education labor and what's, is it pensions? Yes, labor and pensions. Health, health education, labor and pensions. Was pensions added because it made for better acronym or- I think of all of those pensions is probably one we should be talking about a whole lot more. Yeah, so. Yeah. And you worked together on the no child left behind. You also worked with Speaker Ryan famously and came to a budget agreement. Talk to me about that process and those two and what it is about your relationship that allowed you to do what has thwarted so many people in Washington which is to find common ground. Well, let me talk about the budget deal with Paul Ryan because that remember came about because we had been going through chaos in our country over budget shutdowns and agreements that couldn't happen and nobody was talking to anybody. The government had been shut down for several weeks and it was just people were feeling like their country wasn't working. And we agreed to open government again and voted to have the two budget chairs of the House and Senate sit down and see if they could figure this out. That happened to be me and Paul Ryan. And I remember voting for it and thinking, oh boy. Okay. So I called Paul actually the next morning and right away and said, let's sit down and have breakfast. And we did and we did not talk about budget numbers, policies or anything. We took the time to learn who the other person was and what was important to them. And that basic respect and trust served us well throughout the entire difficult challenging process and allowed us to put it together a budget agreement when no one else could. I think that word respect needs to be returned to politics today. What do you think he is right now? Ryan, it seems like he is sort of buffeted. I mean, he was chairman of the budget committee then and now he's speaker of the House. And that is like the rocky shoals of legislating as John Boehner and others can speak to. How does Paul Ryan navigate the situation that he's in? You know, I do not envy him as current position. He is trying to run a House of Representatives with a group of Republicans whose only vote is no. And when you're in the majority, you actually have to pass things. So you need people to say yes, whether it's a budget or appropriations or policies, whatever it is. I think it's extremely challenging. I think he has the capability to listen, which is so important. But I think he has a challenging job trying to bring those people together to move things forward. And I wish him the best of luck. I do not agree with Paul Ryan on many policies, whether it's women's right to choose or whether it's Medicare policy and how he wants to restructure it. And numerous things. But I do respect the man. And I do want him to be successful. Why? Because I want my country to be successful. Let me ask you, the president apparently will know in a matter of hours, I guess, is going to punt the DACA program for the children of undocumented immigrants to the Congress. And essentially say we're going to end this program in six months, but if Congress wants to do something about it, they can't. Paul Ryan has urged them not to end the program and clearly is supportive of it. Can you, House and Senate, agree on this? Do you think there's enough support based on what you've seen and what you've heard from your colleagues to make permanent this exemption for the children of undocumented immigrants? Well, here's what my advice to Paul Ryan is. Follow your heart. He knows what's right to do here. He knows the impact this will have to children and families in our country, some 800,000 young people who came here, no no other country, no no other language, no no other family or home, and to tell them, sorry. And I think that if he follows his heart and tells his Republican caucus, those of you who can't vote with this, fine, but we're going to bring it to the floor and we're going to vote on it, he will get the votes for it. Because one of the obstacles in the past is this so-called haster rule, this notion that you have to have a majority of the majority in order to move a bill forward. A lot of things, including a health care fix for the Affordable Care Act, could have moved forward had Democrats been involved in that. But what about on your side? Do you think that I saw Orrin Hatch and some other Republicans? Orrin Hatch had told the president not to go forward with this policy, I think others. And I know that if they bring it up for a vote, that we will be able to permanently pass the policy. This is going to take leadership. You know what, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell's problem is not the votes on this. It's the leadership. You have to be willing to say, this is what's right for my country. Rather than, I'm worried if I bring this up, that I'll get voted out of my leadership position. People want leaders. They want people to speak from their heart. They want them to do the right thing. They don't want them to play politics. And I think we've got the votes if we have two leaders who will bring it up. What did you think of the president's decision? Assuming this is the president's decision and we're- I think it's appalling. I think it's stunning to me, truly. I have met so many young people who are contributing so much to our country. And- But isn't it, but let me ask you this. Wouldn't it be better when President Obama moved forward on DACA, he said this is a temporary patch because we need the Congress to act and others voted to do that some years ago. Wouldn't it be better if Congress actually went ahead and did that? I think it would be the right thing for Congress to do, but I am appalled that the president is using this as some kind of wedge issue campaign promise to his voters to get done rather than for the right reasons. He could have said or may say, I think this is the right policy. I told you that my heart says it's the right thing to say and do, but I want Congress to act and I would like them to act and show the country they're behind that. But to bully Congress and to do it, some kind of threat is really just the wrong way to do it. Well, by the time this podcast is heard, we will know the answer to that question, but the president will not have heard you. So if he does what you said, we'll have to give him credit for arriving at it on his phone. We're going to take a short break and we'll be right back with Senator Patty Murray. So I mentioned earlier that you're working with Senator Alexander on the healthcare issue and specifically the issue of healthcare exchanges. The Senate on the vote of three Republicans and all the Democrats rejected the repeal and replace approach that was being advanced. But it does leave open what happens to these healthcare exchanges, which rely on the subsidies that are part of the Affordable Care Act. And all over the country, we see these premiums going up. I saw one estimate that in your state they're going up some 23 percent or something and about half of it is attributed to anxiety on the part of the insurance companies that the Trump administration won't move forward on these subsidies. What is the state of play on this and what do you and Senator Alexander hope to do? Well, first of all, let me just say that, yes, we defeated the repeal effort in the Senate by three votes. But it was really defeated by the hundreds of thousands of Americans who stood up and fought against an irresponsible bill. So I give them credit. But what we have said all along when we passed Obamacare many years ago that this was the first step and we needed to continue to make sure that healthcare was affordable and accessible and to continue to find ways to do that. President Trump has taken a very different approach. He came into office to repeal Obamacare. Not sure why other than he liked the words repeal Obamacare. Well, it's very popular with his base. Yeah. Okay. So it was a campaign promise, not a policy. And without any meaning behind the words. And since he felt so passionate about that, he has used his office and his administration to actually sabotage Obamacare by threatening not to make the payments that are required to be made to insurance companies that help them pay for some of the sicker folks who have healthcare. Therefore, insurance companies are saying we're going to have to raise our rates because we don't know what's going to happen and they can't operate on uncertainty. They can't operate by a president who is threatening not to subsidize or make the CSR payments because they have to look at their bottom line and say, well, go under if he pulls out from paying these. So they are now raising their rates across the country. We're also seeing a number of what we're called bear counties where insurance companies we're not offering. Again, uncertainty is most often named as the reason for that. So what I have told the Marlach'sander, and I think many Republicans and Democrats agree is that we need to bring some stability to the marketplace so that we can make sure that we are working as hard as we can to lower the costs for people to be able to purchase insurance. Lamar and I have been talking over the last several weeks. We're going to start having hearings next week, assuring that those CSR payments are mandatory, that the administration can't just decide not to pay them is certainly part of that. And do you have a confidence that Senator McConnell, if your committee moves on that, that Senator McConnell will take it up on the floor? Well, I've had the opportunity to work with Lamar Alexander before. He and I took on the challenge of rewriting no child left behind when no one else could come up with a solution. And I think we have a respect for each other and an understanding that we have to work together and we have to obviously, neither one of us are going to love something at the end of the day, but we have to work through a policy. And then of course we have to work through the votes. Do I know what McConnell will do? Will he say yes to Lamar? I am hoping he will because I think the people of this country not only rejected repeal and replace, they said we want you to work together to solve the problems that are there in healthcare. I think Lamar recognizes that and I'm going into this discussion and challenge with him with respect. You know, it's an interesting point you make, which is that at the end of the day, neither of you will love the final product. That was true on your budget deal with Ryan. And you took some heat and and so did Ryan from the basis of your respective parties. It's called compromise. It's not very it's not very fashionable right now. It is not fashionable, but it is needed. It needs to be respected. We are a democracy. We are a country of a lot of different ideas. No one gets their way a hundred percent of the time. But if you bear keep in mind that the goal is to make things better, not to make it perfect. That's what has sustained us as a democracy for a very long time. And that's my job as a senator is to sustain that movement forward, fight for what I believe in, but at the end of the day, try and make it just a little better. I thoroughly embrace what you just said, but I think that in moments of absolute candor that many of your colleagues on both sides of the aisle and certainly in the House of Representatives would say, yeah, but my first obligation is to get reelected so that I can do those things. And I've got this rabid base. So there's only so much I can do. I mean, it seems like you butt up against that now more than ever. And it's a destructive impulse it feels like. The rabid base is important because they're fighting for basic policies that they want. You have to include them. You have to listen to them. You have to say what is their goal and fight for a goal. But you can't achieve 100%. And if we all just sit in our corners and fight with each other and say, you know, my way or the highway, we go nowhere as a country. And what we do is leave ourselves behind in a global economy. Another issue that apparently is going to come up or that the administration suggests they want to come up in Senator McConnell and Speaker Ryan is tax reform, not exactly clear whether it's going to be reform or simply tax cuts. But what's your sense of the likelihood of tax reform actually happening and will it be reform? So let's start with the basic process of this. If the Republicans move forward in the same way that they did to repeal Obamacare, vote for a budget that says we don't want any Democrats at the table. We're going to do this by ourselves and leave half the Senate out of the conversation. They're going to have a hard time getting the votes. And they're going to have a hard time having the public behind them. If they say we want to include Democrats, here are your ideas. You're not going to get everything. But actually listen to what we're talking about, which is not just tax cuts for wealthy, but actual tax reform that means middle class families who've had wages that have been stagnant for decades actually have an opportunity to get ahead. They'll find us willing to work with them and maybe pass something. But the words tax reform should not be a mislabel of a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. And some hope that things are going to trickle down in life will be better for people who are fighting so hard today to take care of their families. There really has been a genuine tax reform in this country for 30 years. And the last time it was done, it was done in the classic way, broadening the base and eliminating loopholes. Is that given the army, the failings of lobbyists that patrol your precincts over there? Is that possible today? Well, I remember my dad saying to me when I was 16 and I learned to drive, he said, with the keys comes the responsibility. Well that's where the Republican Party is today. They got the keys. They have the White House. They have the majorities in the House and Senate. What is the responsibility they want to take on? Do they want to jam through a partisan bill that gives tax breaks to corporations and multibillionaires? Or do they really want to reform the tax code? I think that's a huge question right now. I'm worried it's not what I want to see happen and I think the American people will fight back against it. By jamming it through, it would be part of a budget reconciliation. Yeah. You explain that. So going back to the repeal of Obamacare, what the Republicans did on the very first days we were in session in January is they passed what's called a budget reconciliation bill that uses an obscure process that allows them to pass something in the Senate with only 50 votes so it can't be filibustered. So it doesn't need any Democrats. And they made it very clear we're not going to have hearings. We're not going to have any discussions. We're not going to figure out what's out there. We're not going to listen to people. We're just going to write this in secret, 13 men. That didn't work. If they do that same thing, use a budget reconciliation process, pass a budget and go through the same thing without any hearings, discussion, bringing experts in, having everybody understand what this is going to be like at the end of the day. It's not going to be successful. What do you think the odds are of this happening and this happening this year? Look, I'd love to see tax reform that allowed American families to feel like they were going to be able to grow their wages again. That's a hard chore in a time when we have real challenges today. It's even worse when we have a Republican party who says, wait, we're just going to give tax breaks away to wealthy people and it's going to somehow trickle down to you and we're going to use obscure budget. The president says that he wants a big middle class tax cut as part of the- Words are important. Policy is real. I'll tell you right now, let's just back up a minute. He's talking about tax reform using some kind of obscure budget numbers to reconcile that what he's got is not going to be a big cost to our deficit and debt. At the same time we have North Korea, we have a country that is where people who voted for him want to know they've got the skills for the jobs in their communities where we have a huge disaster in Texas today that is obviously going to cost billions of dollars. How do you reconcile giving big tax breaks to people with those outstanding costs out there? You mentioned the storm, Hurricane Harvey, and the aftermath of that. There's talk that they may try and attach Hurricane relief to the debt ceiling bill. Would that be a smart thing to do? Well, both of them need to be done. You guys have a tradition of must pass bills and taking difficult stuff and attaching it to must pass bills. Everybody seems to agree that Harvey relief is a must pass bill. The debt ceiling is quite controversial. It is controversial by those who say they want to use it to get something else, like huge pay force. What the debt ceiling bill is about really is paying what you owe. It's like a family who takes out a mortgage and then says, well, I don't want to pay this, so I'm not going to pay it. You don't do that. You pay your bills. So it's a must do bill. It's a crazy procedure, but it's a must do bill. We have our responsibility. We have the keys to that car and we've got a responsibility and we need to pass it. So is it smart? This might be the best way to get this done is to combine these two things. Sure, absolutely. You mentioned North Korea. As we sit here in the long saga of US-North Korean relations, we've never been at this point where both sides are openly talking about the use of nuclear weapons, or at least hinting at them. What is your sense from your perspective as a leader in the Senate of the approach the president's taken? In fairness, presidents of both parties have been stymied by the North Koreans, but what should happen at this juncture? We are sitting here today in Seattle. We are very conscious of where North Korea is and what their capability could possibly be and what it would mean to our state and our region, much less to our country. They are a real threat. They have a leader who seems bent on showing the world his prowess through nuclear force. We have a leader who needs to learn that two bullies on a playground, one upping each other, is not a way to solve problems. That's what concerns me. We as a nation need to have a strong prevention program. We need to work with our global allies. We need to send messages in very strong ways, in multiple ways, through the economy, through working with other world leaders that it is not acceptable what North Korea is doing. But I do worry about the language the president is using and the one upping, these two world leaders are doing to each other that could lead to a fist fight on a playground that will not benefit. Do you think he's moved us closer to armed conflict with his rhetoric? I used to teach preschool and I told my kids, bullies don't win, but they do cause problems and we have to all speak to that collectively and say bullies can't win. We don't need a leader who is bullying today to solve a problem that is very real. That does frighten me. I think that we need to have a leader who projects strength but without calling names and without upping the rhetoric. If he were here, I'm sure he would say that we have tried the approach of involving the international community of sanctions, of UN disaprobation and we have seen a steady advance of this nuclear program. We have seen a huge steady advance in the past few months of the testing and movement is that because of the bullying or not. I think that the bullying doesn't help that at all. What about the suggestion of pulling out of the trade agreement with South Korea? I'm stunned that the president made those kind of comments right now. The people of South Korea need to be part of the global community. They are the neighbors right there. They are the millions of people who will have the first impact. We need their support. We need their help and we need them as part of a global community. Let me just finish up by asking you about the Senate and the Congress in the era of Trump and how that has impacted relationships there. What kind of sense do you get from your colleagues on the other side of the aisle about how they are processing all of this. He ran as an opponent of Washington generally. He's not a natural ally of Mitch McConnell or Paul Ryan and many of the people who are in the Congress. I don't think I've ever worked with the president who loves Congress. But I have worked with presidents that respect Congress and respect gets you a lot further than putting people down or calling them names or again bullying them. Bullying gets you headlines, certainly gets you attention, but it doesn't create deals and it doesn't solve problems. I know the president is an inveterate listener of the podcast. What was your impression of his tactic in challenging Mitch McConnell as he did and knowing McConnell as you do and you know him very, very well, what do you think that's likely to produce? Not much. You don't get the respect and the ability to work with somebody if you're putting them down in ways that are disrespectful. But McConnell himself, what would you read of him and how he would interpret that? He's a quiet leader and more than anything he respects the institution of the Senate, which sounds really boring, except that is how we get things done in this country. Whether it's a budget, whether it's policies like family leave, whether it's health care, whether it's you have to be able to respect each other within the Senate. It's why the women's senators get together. It's why Mitch McConnell spends time on the floor talking to senators. You have to respect each other to move things forward. When you inject disrespect, then you inject the intolerance for each other and it doesn't get things done. Do you think, how would that impact on the president's ability to get things done? Well, I mean, there are a million ways in which a leader can be helpful or unhealthy. I've already seen it actually because we had a budget deal that we had to get done in March. And what I saw is Republicans virtually ignore the president's budget and work with Democrats to get a budget and appropriations bills done in a timely way that funded things. Not the way I love. I mean, obviously, I'd like more investments, but in a way that can move us forward. We are now entering the month of September when a lot has to be done, from Harvey funding to the debt ceiling to the children's insurance program to the budget and appropriations. If we ignore the president's bullying and work together in the Senate and get it done in the best way possible, I actually think that's what the country wants. I don't think families across our country like chaos. They don't like uncertainty. They don't like infighting. What they want is for their country to feel secure to them. And I'm hoping that's what the Senate does. Senator Patty Murray, thank you so much for being with us. Thank you. Thank you for listening to The Axe Files, part of the CNN Podcast Network.
