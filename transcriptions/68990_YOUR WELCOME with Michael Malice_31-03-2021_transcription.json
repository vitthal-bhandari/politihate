    "text": " and there's nothing going on tonight. We can't see it right now. I mean, you just get together and stay inside. Good afternoon, Michael Malice here. Let that be your welcome for the next hour. We have with us. I think probably our most requested guest, James Lindsey, who is the co-author of How to Have a Possible Conversations, co-author of Cynical Theories, co-author of What's the Third One? I didn't co-author anything else. I wrote a book back in 15 called Everybody's Wrong About God. Okay, those are the three. Yeah. So you are the probably biggest point man right now in our culture, taking on critical race theory, which has permeated from the universities, it's into media, corporate America, politics. Most people do not have a good understanding of what it is. They are being explicitly lied to about what it is. My very simple example of this was during the presidential debate between President Trump and Joe Biden and Chris Wallace from Fox. Fox, the crazy right-wing lunatics, where he says, what's wrong with critical race theory? They're just teaching people to be polite. And if you tell someone, we should encourage people to be polite to immigrants or those different cultures, 99% people would say, yeah, I agree. I don't want to step on someone's toes if they're an immigrant and they're hard working. I don't want to make those mistakes. What is wrong with that being the claim? You have an hour, sir. You have the floor. Yeah. That actually happened recently. I actually was invited to have a dialogue. And then we were doing the pregame there on the Zoom. And the guy was like, no, just talk for an hour. We changed our mind. And I was like, about what? He's like, critical race theory. He's like, okay. And so if we want to do that, we can. But no, I mean, that is the trick, right? So I'll just jump straight into some nasty. If we could look back at the 1953 testimony of Dr. Bella Dodd, who was a member of the Communist Party USA, and then she defected. And then she confessed everything or testified everything to the House Committee on Un-American Activities, now known as the House Judiciary Committee, which is not McCarthy, by the way. McCarthy was a senator. He said that error. He loved them in the house. Yeah. Yeah. But anyway, she testified and she said, oh, yeah, when communism comes, it always comes in high-minded sounding terms. So what it will do is it will lie about itself. And it will say, for example, at the time, what they were literally using as the line was that the communists are the true anti-fascists. So if you oppose communism, you must be pro-fascism. Just logic. Yeah. Perfect. I mean, like we haven't seen that trick ever tried again and worked, completely worked on half of the polity. But they did the same thing. They just copied this literally with anti-racist. They literally just copied the same mentality with anti-racist and it just tricks everybody. You know, the framing that critical race theory is, is racial sensitivity training or is diversity training? Not even that it's one approach to. They won't even say that because they say that all the rest of them are somehow corrupted with white supremacy or something. So it is the one and only approach. That's the thing that lets the lie go by, right? They say that it is the way, if you're going to have diversity training, you have to use critical race theory or else you're not actually doing diversity correctly or you're not actually looking at racial sensitivity correctly. Usually they'll say some awful thing like re-centering the needs of the privileged. If you don't use their completely crackpot method to do it. So first thing out of the gate, you know, you hear these distortions and it is, I guess, very vaguely true that critical race theory could be construed as racial sensitivity training. It's really racial hypersensitivity training because it's first hypothesis is that race is relevant to everything and therefore you have to think about race all the time and its relevance to everything, which seems to be hypersensitizing rather than, you know, I get it. You got to be careful around certain cultural issues or certain, you know, sensitive buttons, certainly certain language is going to be inflammatory to various people for various reasons, some of which are actually good and you do want to kind of be sensitive about this. You don't want to be making jokes. It makes people feel uncomfortable whether you knew better or not. And so a little sensitivity training even could be useful. But to start as critical race theory does with the fundamental assumption, its first assumption is that race is the ordinary state of affairs and society. So it is not a question of whether or not racism took place, but how did racism take place in that situation because it's going to be there. You're already way off the rails. Right. So what it is is one way to do this. I would say a very bad way to do this. We could talk about lots of its other scary core assumptions. But it denies the fact that there are others. And so that lie right out of the gate should have people much more suspicious of this ideology than they are. This kind of ports to bet what happened in the 30s were installed until the left part of the Communist Party's adjourned. And so you may be saying that you stepped on his toes from their perspective. That is just worsening the problem. And so that's what happened in the 30s were installed until the left part of the Communist Party's in Germany to go after the liberal or the socialist parties call them social fascists and basically refuse to work with them. And then as a function you got Hitler. And it's this kind of idea that like, well, what's wrong with just telling a person, hey, probably someone aside, go, you know, when you're in a very negative perspective, that is just worsening the problem because you're making that racist feel comfortable about his racism in a racist milieu. My operating assumption and I'm not as knee deep in this stuff as you are. So I very much want to hear your perspective is the Marxist analysis is that everything's a function of economic classes, right? So you have the bourgeois logic, they have polylogism, right? The bourgeois logic, then you have the capitalist logic, then you have the proletariat logic. And as a function of your economic class, you're going to be a political candidate, and you're going to react things in a certain way. Then came the counter examples like this guy's a proletariat and his family's been proletariat for decades. He's not seeing it this way. Why does it apply here? Oh, that's false consciousness. So it's like, well, it's not that predictable. But then so what happened as a result is a lot of these union people who wanted better conditions. They wanted, you know, not to be named at work. They didn't want a bloody revolution. So this was a big problem for the Marxist. And my understanding is what happened is instead of it being a political candidate, they just crossed it out, wrote race, and it's the same logistical, logical approach to an analyzing how societies work. Is that accurate? That's completely accurate. Yeah, that's 100% accurate. It's 100%. What's really scary is, you know, you had to be like your capitalists here, you got your bourgeoisie. So what you've got is this idea that there are the people who set white culture, because it's all framed out in white culture now, right? And so the bourgeoisie are going to these good white liberal people who think that they can, that's what they call them, good whites. There's an entire book written about good white people. That's what the title of the book is, Good White People. Shannon Sullivan? Yeah, Shannon Sullivan. Yeah, I quote her length in my book and then you were right. It's superb because she actually goes after this very heavily from a hard left perspective. Yeah. So that is the same logic, exactly same logic. But the really scary bit, just to kind of drag up something really grows real fast, is that the people, there's a book that was written in 1998 called How Jews Became White Folks by somebody Brodkin, Emily Brodkin, maybe I keep me in need of look up the first name again, but either way, Brodkin. And she argues that Jews became the people who, they worked their way to the top of white culture and the setting, the people who set the parameters of what whiteness white culture actually looked like. And you know, it's like, man, we tried that logic was tried in history before and that had a pretty damn bad result. So there is that element within critical race theory, but yeah, it is the exact same logic that you've just laid out, the exact name marks this logic that's now like he's a crossed out economic class and it's replaced it with social class as understood through a very cartoonish understanding of race. And they don't regard the other thing I think people don't and appreciate is they don't regard race literally because in their worldview, Clarence Thomas literally is not black, but the fact that it's Thomas Thomas literally is not black, Bill Clinton literally is black. It's a function of ideology and not a function of melanin or socioeconomic background necessarily. If it's you can be used against you. So people don't appreciate that they're talking about race, but they're not using the word race in any as if that service has an objective meaning, but let's pretend it does. They're not using it anything remotely close to an objective sense. So that's where, I mean, Nicole Hannah Jones, the de facto editor of the New York Times now slipped. She's a career to the 1619 project and basically the bully and chief over there. And so she slipped last summer. We know she slipped because she deleted the tweet soon after she tweeted it and she said there's a difference between being racially black and politically black. And so what you're talking about is when they say black, they're talking about having black politics. You bring up Clarence Thomas. He's certainly not black. They canceled his documentary during a black history month. You talk about Kanye West, he put on a MAGA hat set, I think for myself. And they were like, literally Tom Hizzie Coats came out a couple days later and was like, you're not black anymore. You know, so and also Mendelio. So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like this is the one time they were caring about him being mentally ill. Not that he's not all of a sudden, all of a sudden now that they can they can just brand him crazy. And so this is, this is how they think now it is true that the racial category matters when somebody is going to step out and make an absolute knowledge claim. So there's a difference between somebody like Bill Clinton, for example, being politically black and somebody like, uh, Nicole Hannah Jones being politically black because Nicole Hannah Jones gets to lean into lived experience and Bill Clinton can only lean into ally, allyship and solidarity, which are, you know, slightly different. In fact, allyship and solidarity can be attacked, whereas lived experiences is made invincible, cannot be attacked. It is the one unquestionable thing. And so this is, this is the way that, I mean, people, I keep trying to tell people so freaking frustrating. It's like people race is like really far down the list about things that critical race theory actually cares about. They use it. It's useful, but they don't really care that much about it. Um, it's, it's all really do you align with the politics or do you not align with the politics? Uh, and that's what it's about. It's create it. It's Soviet logic. It's creating that party that has the correct views and then everybody else has a problem. What do I need to say to get you to do what I want? That is basically what can be summed up very, very quickly. Uh, what, something that I find hilarious or, or, um, just interesting is how many people, maybe, especially boomer conservatives think that they will have some kind of semblance of remorse or shame if they're caught in a contradiction. Whereas the basis of their dialectical thought is their reality, not that they get into this high concept, but like if you got the smarter ones, the basis of reality is dialectical is inherently contradictory. So if anything, if there's contradictions to my thought, that's me overcoming them and creating this new Hegelian synthesis. So therefore I'm doing it right. And if you're not perceiving contradictions, you're the one who's out of touch with reality. Yeah, that's exactly right. You can't catch them in hypocrisy. You can't catch them. The asymmetry is intentional. It is part of the strategy. The self-contradictory nature of it, as you said, based on the dialectical process that's baked in and the metaphysics that the Hegel laid out and some of his followers, but not others ran with, um, that, that guarantees exactly the way that you just put it that if you try to point out their contradictions, it's like they're gleeful about that. They see the contradictions as productive of their activism. And they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they have a, they have a, they have a, they have a, they have a, they have a, they have a, they have a, they have a, they have a, they have a parallel. A lot of them are essentially thinking kind of is quantity by the way of data. A lot of other events and there's really, I mean it's great that if each of these recognizant things are usually changing their flaws and then, the third way of, you know, easily creating a basis and start in and then type it, then\u2026\" Uh, that doesn't matter.\" I mean, right? And, there's really 23, which is all the negative there's no ground to stand on. You have to kind of just go into this kind of like Schrodinger's. Nothing is, nothing is real. Everything is superimposed. Opposites are the same kind of topsy-turvy world. And while people are lost in the fog of that, you know, they get to, get to move the ball. And, you know, usually through force of argument, um, where they're, they're belittling somebody or making them out to be not sympathetic or whatever to some, you know, pet issue. Hey guys, Michael.

I don't think people appreciate to what extent there's an evolutionary psychology basis behind all this where it's just mechanisms for lower status people to and not lower status due to race or, you know, social, sexual identity, but just, you know, people who aren't as the person who they're talking to. And this is a very easy, quick and effective means to assert dominance and leapfrog over them in some kind of status hierarchy. If there was a word that I would say or that you would say that would automatically make you more listened to, more important, more liked, more popular, more lucrative, I would say that word. And so would you. So I think people don't appreciate to what extent many of these actors are responding to incentives. Yeah, that's super important because I've talked to, I don't know how many people I've talked to kind of in the business world who, but also in education, where they've pointed out it's like they became aware that this was happening, that the world being constructed around the ideology was creating incentives for them to lean into it. You know, they're going to make the deal or whatever it is in a business meeting. This is a kind of based on a real story. I'm vague, making it really vague to identify details, but they're going to make the business deal and all of a sudden it's like it's not quite going and it's like, yeah, but I'm an immigrant. You know, in that little bit of like magic, magic power behind it's like a magic spell. And all of a sudden it's like, oh, well, we have to help the immigrant, you know, and tapping into that. The person didn't realize they were they were taking up the invitation, but it was there. They knew on some like subconscious level that would work and they just lean into the incentive. And it's like you can you can take yourself three inches down the road and rationalize every three inch step and end up three miles down the road before you know it and just stand around wondering how did I get here? And this is a thing that I think most of the people playing around in this world have done. I don't think most of them, I think it's a relatively small number of people who are genuinely the the bad actors who have, you know, cooked up these ideas or not even sometimes not even bad actors. Sometimes they're just psychologically broken people and they're trying to force the world to conform to their pathology. We're seeing that with Foucault right now, who you know, it's now coming out that he probably did rape young men and boys as a matter of fact. And Keynes as well was another one. Yeah, so I've heard. And so, you know, it's funny with with Foucault because he is so Nietzsche and you know, Nietzsche had this whole observation that everybody who's read even barely any Nietzsche knows that, you know, Nietzsche was pretty down on the other philosophers and said, you know, most philosophers aren't doing philosophy. There's rationalizing their own pathologies. And it's like that's Foucault like to the end and then the queer theorists have continued it. And now we have these like, you know, what is it? M.A.P.'s minor or something people or something like that. It's just, I forgot what I mean. Minor attracted person. Is that what it stands for? Yeah, that's it is attracted person. That's their code name for pedophile. Yeah, that's they have a code name for it. Of course, everything has to be hidden behind a friggin acronym in lots of syllables. Well, I don't know. Yeah, petos. I don't know if it's hidden. I want to hear your thoughts on this. My understanding or my my hypothesis at least is that they use jargon as a very quick mechanism of in-group signaling. So I'm using terms and, you know, if I know what an M.A.P. is and you know what an M.A.P. is, right away, you and I know we're on the same team. Everyone else won't know, but you and I can have a conversation in plain view that'll be completely comprehensible. Everybody else. And this is how you can pass in a broader culture. And this is something that the Soviets did very, very well, that they train their operatives to pass in mainstream culture. And I recently was doing research from my upcoming book. And there was a, I think it was in West Germany when a Stasi operative was caught because she was using communist phraseology like in a matter of fact ways like, wait, wait, wait, people don't talk like this. I'm on to you. But this is something I think people don't appreciate as well that they use language, not only in complete different mechanisms than average people do, but they also view language as inherently a means for one group to dominate another. Is that not accurate? That is accurate. And just as an example of what you're talking about with their like, you know, in-group language, I was literally talking with a group of friends of mine who are Asian American civil rights activists in there in this whole group. And most of the people in a Chinese American or other Asian American. And they were, they were asking each other, have you ever heard anybody call us a API, except woke people? Nobody's ever used this acronym and now a API, stop a API, hate or whatever is all over the internet. And you are correct. My friend Mike Nana calls this discourse engineering. They believe that if you change because they're ultimately deeply involved, well, it's Hegelian on the one hand, that's structuralist on another hand. So I've taken up, I don't know how much Hegel influenced the structuralist actually, but they have this belief that the structure of language and the application of language actually do dictate how we understand reality. But in fact, further how reality is constructed, this is what constructivism is about at its bottom. And these people are technically, you know, we say the woke, we say social justice, we say all these words, the formal, the correct academic term for them is critical constructivist. These critical theory through a social constructivist model, and this is a well-defined and well-understood and well-described term that nobody knows you can't use it. It has no power to use it because it's so academic. But these people actually do believe that if you engineer the language the correct way, then you will succeed in getting rid of all of the problems of society. Or more importantly, you will engineer circumstances in which you hold the linguistic upper hand. And they play all kinds of, whether they know they are or not, whether the cognitive is never to not, you play all kinds of linguistic tricks and language games. We named cynical theories a book, you know, we crossed out on the cover of the book, we crossed out critical with critical theories and put cynical. And we went back and forth actually between playing off of Wittgenstein's language games and crossing out language and putting power, like the same motif, but too different. We didn't know which title we wanted to use when we were writing it. And so that's actually what they're doing is they're using language to create power games. And they do this a lot of times through like double meanings and equivocation very intentionally. Mott and Bailey, I don't know if you saw the one that came out, I saw us on the internet like three days ago, somebody shared it with me on Twitter. And it's a woman saying that, you know, well, people are complaining that critical race theory is very divisive and it has no place in our schools, but lots of knowledge is divisive. Look at math, it has division, division is by nature divisive. And it's just like, it's a transparently stupid word game. And it works on a shocking number of people. Yeah, people often sometimes ask me for advice about what their kids. One of the things I was very fortunate to be was tri-lingual by the time I was in like first grade. And when you are raised speaking at least two languages, this stuff doesn't work because it might make sense in English. And if you only think in English, you only heard English, you're not going to realize how absurd it is. But if you think in other languages, you're like, this person's more unerlunatic. This makes no sense because conceptually, these are entirely different concepts. But so if anyone's listening, I would advise you strongly teach your kids another language, because then they will not fall into this really almost embarrassingly obvious, obvious trap. It's really embarrassing. I mean, I was watching this person and I was thinking, this is an adult. I mean, that was the actual thought. I'm staring at this as an adult. And I'm trying to figure out it's like, is this being cute? Is this being stupid? Is this being like, is this woman cognizant of what she's doing? And it's like, the thing is though, it's not just this person in the education, you know, activism space at a school board meeting or whatever. It's throughout their scholarly literature. I mean, that's how we wrote our stupid papers we wrote back in the day is like, we just played stupid word games with things, doubling and tripling meanings. And you know, they think this is like deep, but it's actually just embarrassing. One of the reasons I'm so optimistic is I'm sure you're familiar with the red pill, white pill, all that stuff, right? I know I think seven pills of the course. The other ones are legitimate. There's only four. There's two pairs of two red and white black. One of the Bitcoin people, they're orange pill. They will come for you if you say there's an orange pill. They came for me already. But you know, me too, they come for me all the time. So I got red and blue. Those are obvious. I understand those very clearly. And white and black, white and black. But that's it. There's also so-called clear, right? That's a mold bug. This. Okay. Now I'm triggered pills are clear. Pills aren't clear. The metaphor doesn't make sense. If you're going to stick to this metaphor, you know, use it accurate. The point being one, the reason I'm not black peeled, meaning why I don't think all hope is lost. And you know, the good guys aren't going to win is because the enemy class are not Machiavellian masterminds. The vast majority of them as you're describing, this is not a sophisticated thinker. This is not someone who can outwit me every turn I get. This is really someone who is it's not like they're saying this to their like a demagogue, right? The audience buys into it. Then they get off the stage like I can't believe they bought this division crap. This person is actually perceiving themselves as making a good point and being persuasive where it's like this is not capable of persuading anyone. And this is why they need so many organizations to mandate their and imposing their ideas because they're very of very little persuasive value, especially for those of us in cities who do come from a diverse milieu, I'll even use one of their terms. And it's like, no one I know thinks like this when it comes to other races or genders or sexualities. We don't think in these terms, everyone gets along organically. Yeah, it's, you know, these are the kind of people that thought the dog sex paper was like legit, right? What's the dog sex paper? No, I don't know about my dog sex. Okay, so let me just my wife's not here. She gets so sick of hearing the story so I can actually tell it. She hears it through the door when I'm in here. She's like, you can talk about the papers again. So two years ago, two of my colleagues and I, people I wrote the books with Peter and Helen, we wrote a bunch of fake academic papers and submitted them. Yeah, so the one that got the most attention was literally about using people watching dogs have sex at the dog park as an implicit bias test to find out what their attitudes on rape culture were. And that I mean literally, it was like we we claimed that we were a feminist researcher sitting in a park for a thousand hours in Portland in one year, but never in the rain, like let that sink in for a second. Like it's raining it all the time in Portland except in June or something like that. And so anyway, we examined 10,000 dogs, genitals, and then we interrogated owners. We watched the dogs, how having sex and looked at how the owners reacted. Did they flip out? Was it what they matter if it was straight dog sex or gay dog sex? It was literally what the test was. And that was not supposed to tell what their attitudes are homosexuality were, but rather their attitudes toward rape culture. This paper was given an award for excellence in scholarship in the field of feminist geography. And it's just unbelievable. It's like these are the this is you are correct. That is, you know, a white pill that I need to keep sucking on all the time is that, you know, these people are transparently clowns. I mean, just transparently clowns. Well, let me let me black pill you for a second. So is the joke. Oh, I'm already there. So no, no, so what I'm saying is just because their clowns does not mean they're not capable of enormous harm and murder as well in the meantime. Oh, yeah, I'm almost positive. That's coming. I mean, I am black built. So, but it depends on like, what timeframe we're talking about with which pill it's like, can I have a black and white pill? No, no, to medium term, I think we're screwed. But in the end, it'll come out. Okay. Then that's why I killed. That's white pill. Yes. If it's it's going to be difficult in the medium term, short term, that's not even a question. The question is, it it's it's is it possible that the good guys are going to win? And if it is possible, then you fight on your feet and you fight for that. That's all that the boy pill is. Yeah, it's not, of course, though, there's many people, especially on the alt right who think that, oh, because of demographics or whatever, it's all it's all hopeless. And I'm like, America was much worse off under Woodrow Wilson and FDR than it is in contemporary time, especially in terms of ideology and totalitarianism and all these other things. Yeah, those people should probably talk to the Latinos and see what they think about this stuff. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Not big fans. Hey, guys, want to talk about our newest sponsor, Fume F U M. These are really cool. It's a great non addictive replacement for smoking, vaping and nicotine. What it is, what it Fume is, it's a hollow piece of Canadian maple. It looks like a steampunk vape, really cool looking. They have these different cores that you stick in the end, which are infused with the benefits of the world's super plants. These are great replacement therapy people who are smokers who are vapors. You don't know what to do with your hands, right? You have that kind of tick. Fume replaces that hand to mouth action and the different cores have different uses peppermint for better breathing, laughing for relaxation, handmade in Calgary, Alberta, Canada with Canadian maple. If you go to Fume essential calm and use promo code malice, you get 10% off. You could subscribe for my deliveries. If you check out the website Fume essential dot com and promo code malice, you can start to quit smoking, which is the worst habit for your health that you can have. I'm not joking. Let's get back to the show. Talk about implicit bias. So how it's presented is, you know, people like babies will look at photos of white people and then black people. They will somehow signal the preference for white people. Doesn't this prove that kids, even from a very early on, are taught or received somehow racial preferences and isn't it fair to say that it's really bad when kindergartners or very young people are going to be treating people of color in a worse off manner? Well, I mean, you would think so, except that there's no evidence whatsoever that this translates into any behavioral anything at all. No matter a fact. So the study that they like to quote on this or a few of these that are actually bothered to look up. One of the studies they like to quote is that by three years old, there's already racial preference showing up in implicit bias tests. Okay. Well, the test that they did with that, they actually only did it with white children. And so they have no, they have absolutely no way to rule out that it's just that the person looks the most like their mother. And I said three years, I think I meant three months, very early on. It's very early in the development, but it's it's they did not have a sufficient experiment to determine whether it's just person who's got similar skin tone to my mother. They had they don't the study is really poor. What a shock. And then they did a second study that's saying, Oh, well, you know, I six years old this and by 12 years old that and whatever. And what they actually ended up showing is that by 12 years old, you know, there's literally no demonstration of explicit bias whatsoever. You ask these children, you know, at 12 years old, do you think that, you know, white people are better than black people or vice versa or whatever? And there's no evidence of any bias intent whatsoever. And there's no evidence that it translates into behavior whatsoever. So there's not really let me ask you, doesn't that show how pernicious it is if it's not even showing up in the test? I mean, that's their claim, right? Right. This is like some Freudian nonsense. It's like getting inside of people's heads and then claiming that there's some, you know, force that you can kind of detect, but we don't really know what we're detecting. Something is being detected, but it's not quite clear what is being detected because the testing mechanism is, you know, what is the speed of reaction between various words or various images and various words. And you know, they're talking about literally tens of milliseconds of difference being indicative of something. And then looking at the way that this translates into no observable biases in actual behavior, however. So I don't understand how that's supposed to be indicative of anything except that it becomes a pseudo or maybe slightly stronger than pseudo scientific tool by which they can say see there really is internalized dominance. See there really is internalized racism. There really is this hidden white supremacy culture, which is really weird also because from what I understand with the implicit bias tests, you know, you don't see, you don't see people having intra racial preference. You just see this same pattern cropping up everywhere with everybody. And so maybe it's something else completely, you know, I have no idea what it's finding, but it's not, it's not apparently finding anything that has any, there's no connection that's been demonstrated whatsoever to having any impact in the real world in terms of people's actual behaviors or bias or beliefs or whatever. And in the current Malu, if we're going to talk about current Malu is where we've become so sensitive to all these things, it's probably the case that it's something that people try to compensate for already. And so if you if the implicit bias is as they say it is, there's a good chance that under the current social situation or contract that we're operating in that it's probably producing a reverse result to what they're claiming. So I'm pretty skeptical of this, especially also given how easy it is to game the test, which, you know, I don't know if you've done that, but you can do it on your first try, like literally. Is there any concern in this space? I'm assuming the answer is no, but I'd like to hear the thought process. When you using a term Asia, like one of my books is about North Korea, if you go to Asia and basically try to conflate someone who's from Korea and from Japan, or a tele Chinese person that I'm going to categorize you the same as this Cambodian, this Filipino, you would be looked at as as you might be grounds for assault or at least an argument, at least think you're a lunatic. But the fact that it's a matter of factly been discussed here, whereas if you drill a little deeper, they at the same time, they will they will gleefully, not gleefully, gladly admit that the Japanese American experience is not the same as the Chinese American experience. It's not the same as the Vietnamese experience. And yet the same time, just they'll just put them in the same basket. How do they do they even address this kind of concern? I mean, I'm sure that somebody's working on the epicycles here. But generally, no, they usually try to create political voting blocks. That's what they're usually most interested in. It's all a political ploy. And the races and the identities are actually incidental to that. So they're usually trying to create the largest block that they can. As a matter of fact, what you're talking about is, I mean, well known to most people in history, the most vicious act of racism I've ever seen in my entire life with my own eyes that I've witnessed was in China toward a guy who was with us from LA, who's Korean. And like the Chinese guy, we're at Starbucks, just freaking lost it on the Korean dude, because he's Korean. And then when he didn't even speak, you know, he doesn't speak Chinese, he doesn't speak any Asian language, I don't think even speaks Korean, maybe he does. But he certainly wasn't going to show it. Speaking English, the Chinese guy flipped out even harder. You're a traitor to your race. You shouldn't even be in China. And like, we thought we were going to see a fist fight breakout. The guy's just going bonkers on the Korean dude. So what you're talking about is 100% true. And no, the API, right? They're actually trying to group identities together. Is that Asian American Pacific Islander is how a API stands for? So they're trying to they're trying to cobble them together to create coalitions that are politically useful under an identity politics umbrella. You see the same kind of hamfisted crap with LGBT, which cramps together things that don't naturally go together. And in some cases, you know, the T in some senses is contradictory to the L and the G and the B. And then when you put the Q on, it's now you're openly contradictory, because those people are hostile to the other groups. I mean, so you're trying to create the trying to create political coalitions at a by identities. And the point isn't to get anything right. The point is to create coalitions. See, I mean, they even cobbled together under Asians, you know, South Asians, you know, Indians. And yeah, because yeah, they're basically the same, no big deal, whatever, you know, it's but it's it's what's useful to create a political coalition that can become a identity block. That's all they care about is creating. I mean, you see this, for example, in Kimberly Crenshaw's paper, mapping the margins, which is her kind of biggest paper. It's not where she introduced you had to intersectionality, but it's where she made it get operationalized. And so she's talking about at the beginning that what we've learned is that, you know, a victim here or there doesn't have any political power. But if you group them together by an identity block and maybe the millions, now you have a lot of political power. So that's the objective. So certainly you would see kind of while there may be people working out these epicycles, because they can leverage a little advantage over somebody else or call somebody else problematic from within the bigger goal is going to be to try to create, you know, Asian American and Pacific Islander solidarity, where it all becomes one giant issue that looks like it affects lots and lots and lots of people. So let me ask the author, co author of how to have impossible conversations. How would someone have a conversation with someone who just graduated college and has this worldview? If they've already taken the worldview on all the way, you're kind of screwed because I don't I don't know that it's actually possible because I've spent a lot of time thinking about this because they actually if they're fully into the worldview, they view conversation as one of the tools of the one of the so-called master's tools as Audrey Lord had it one of the tools of the power structure. So you see them complain about this in terms of things like respectability, politics or complaining that civility or even the demand for reason to dialogue or reason at all that these things are are tools of say white supremacy or patriarchy or whatever and used to exclude other people. So that makes it very difficult to have the conversation with them. But in general, as one of the authors of that book, the way that you have to go into it is actually to ask questions that they're probably not likely to be able to answer a Socratic approach. Yeah, very Socratic approach. So, you know, questions like that, you know, with normal people or people who have taken on some of the worldview, but they're not all the way steeped in it, you can ask questions that expose the contradictions because they're not they have not fully embraced that dialectical model of thought, but they're kind of like, you know, knee deep in it rather than underwater. So maybe if they're just someone who raised this, they don't want to be prejudiced. Yeah, exactly. And so you if you start asking questions like, well, what about, you know, the fact that Latin X is a term that fewer than 20% of Latinos recognize or even know and less than 2% of them are willing to use it. And they many of them complain about, you know, how it's like colonialism and some stupid gringo thing. How does that what do you do with the, you know, the fact that the overwhelming majority of the people reject this term? And those kinds of questions will take normal people and kind of shake them up a little bit. What do you do with the fact that, you know, defunding the police has worked out really badly primarily for black neighborhoods and black owned businesses. That's who seen the most damage. And the fact that black lives matter didn't give any of the money to any of these things. You know, how do you square that those kinds of questions will get normal people, but people are all the way baked into it. You have to ask impractical questions. It's called exposing the illusion of explanatory depth. And what you have to do is basically start asking them, okay, let's just take my fee out. That's right. How does this work? What is how do we implement it? What are the details? Like, walk me step by step through how are we going to put this in? Who's going to pay for it? Where is the money come from? What is the intended outcome? You know, what is what does it look like while we're implementing it? What does it look like when it's implemented? And what does that achieve? How does it do it? And because they don't have answers to those things, because I mean, we even discussed on Twitter earlier that it's I can't even say the word on the spot millenarian. And so yeah, yeah, so it just believes that when certain conditions right society or achieved that the utopia pops out. And so it doesn't know the how. Again, I mentioned my friend Mike Nene, he's a filmmaker. So he usually describes this in terms of films. He's like, you know, they have the we're going to indoctrinate everybody seen. And then they have, you know, the utopia scene and in between is seen missing. It's underpants. It is the underpants known. So it's exactly the underpants. What was that? 1998 that they did the underpants knowns thing? Yeah, so far ahead of the curve. But that's the logic. It's that the utopia is going to pop out. So they don't know how. They don't have the slightest idea how how is getting rid of standardized tests going to improve, you know, merit based admissions for talented underprivileged kids. They don't have the slightest idea how this is going to work. They have the slightest because it doesn't. They don't have an answer. It doesn't usually work on them though, because if they're all the way in, they're just going to scream re and call you a name and move along. But it does work on people who see that go down. And this is a culture that where people are incentivized and trained to be as emotional and often as aggressive as possible, because this is presented as passionate. This is being presented as a fighter. And you're not doing a half of yourself, God forbid, you're doing the behalf of these poor marginalized people who are not a position to talk, because obviously someone's a person of color or their LGBT, they can't get onto Twitter for some reason. Their hands don't work or they don't know how to use a computer. So it's your Biden said, you don't know how to get on the internet. So it's your role as this educated, you got the diploma. As Thomas Sol talks about the vision of the anointed, it is your job to be the warrior on their behalf and any kind of equivocation or any kind of civility towards the enemy, you are selling out these weak, marginalized people. Amen. And a woman. That's another white pill. Like if this is the level of just discourse that you're dealing with, it's like, these are not bright actors.

When you were talking about their use of language as a means basically of forcing outcomes that they find desirable, this is pretty much one of the big themes of 1984 with George Orwell, where the party was making it impossible to literally to say things were bad. You have to say on good because the good is so on Facebook implemented this, you can have likes on Facebook, you can have dislikes. There's an asymmetry there. Do you see any places where this ideology has been defeated or is in retreat? I know of some companies where it has been resoundingly defeated. So individual corporations have here and there beat it. It's very interesting right now as far as kind of on a bigger scale, watching what's going on around the San Francisco school board. In San, I mean all of California in some sense, you know, they're recalling the governor, everybody's pissed off at him. Looks like they're going to try to pull a recall on the San Francisco board of education. Looks like they're going to probably try a recall on case of Boudin, the district attorney for San Francisco. People are pissed. Let's talk about that district attorney San Francisco because this is one of those under the radar stories where I think more people need to be aware of just how it's not like a Nancy Pelosi figure we're dealing with with that. Can you tell who that is? I mean, I don't know who he is as well as you do probably. So you'll have to fill in with me, but he is the if I'm not mistaken, he's a children, a child, I should say, of actual terrorists, right, who were arrested for actual terrorism. And so he vowed that he wasn't going to see families broken up over sending people to jail, you know, at least when they were doing, you know, the right kind of justice oriented work. And so he ends up somehow, I don't know how he ended up in the seat of the district attorney. So he immediately like fires all of the seasoned prosecutors within the first couple of weeks that he's there. You know, it's kind of young, young gun coming in here. And basically, I was, I just talked to somebody in San Francisco that's a kind of a high flyer who will go unnamed at the moment. And they said it's just a known known right now under kiss of Boudin. Like let's say that you wanted to school, to sue the school system for this, for discrimination or it's, you know, refusal to open or whatever other thing, you know, refusal even to have a plan to open. And you want to just sue them. Well, of course, you have to be a plaintiff, you have to put your name on the lawsuit. It's just a known known that if you take on the left in San Francisco right now, your house is going to get vandalized and trashed, you're going to get harassed and that whoever does it is going to have their charges dropped by case of Boudin. And this is their mo because then there's more strife, there's more conflict, then you look to the state to have more power. Conservatives certainly would do this to have a law and order more strife, more power, the state, you know, lather rents repeat. And this was actually the kind of a Yenday model in Chile back in the 70s, which, you know, better for worse, brought about the coup with Pinochet, because there was just wide scale nationwide in that case here. And so, and my understanding in San Francisco is he's refusing to prosecute for shoplifting under a certain amount of money. So people walking the store, take whatever they want, and the police will not, I don't know if he'll believe it'll arrest them, but they're not prosecuting them. Yeah, I mean, it'd be a waste of their resources to even try to arrest them. So you can't really operate businesses in this kind of a certain and the thing is, it was again, is the asymmetry. We kind of saw this, it's a more complicated thing, but in Salem, Oregon yesterday, where, you know, the anti-fos out there busting up cars and harassing people and spraying people in the face. And that dude pulls out his handgun after his windshield gets painted, they're breaking his windows, they're spraying him with pepper spray, bear spray, apparently, and he pulls out a handgun and the cops who've been standing there watching all this go on and like not doing anything. Suddenly, you know, on the ground, man. And so they disarm him and they arrest him. And so it's, if you if the asymmetry becomes the problem, I'm not saying that I'm a big fan. I know you're you're much more anarchist than I am in this regard. But if every guy can't, yeah, every regard, if the shopkeeper can't shoot back, or the guy with the truck can't shoot back, that's when you actually have a problem. Or even flash his gun is he even have to shoot back. He just sounds like, all right, I've got a gun get away from my car. I'm pointing at the sky. I'm not pointing at anybody. Nope. And they arrest, it would arrest him for that. And so that becomes a serious problem, because that creates a kind of instability that's going to erupt, you know, in a nasty way eventually. And so people like Casey Wudin, you know, know what they're doing, they're destabilizing that society. And if all it was was a completely like, you know what, I'm just not prosecuting anything, you'd have lawlessness and you'd have various, you know, problems around that. But it's we're not going to prosecute one very select set of things. And if you try to try to stand up for yourself or you try to, you know, do anything to protect your business or your home or yourself, we're going to screw you over. And then especially, by the way, when there's a political motivation that favors our side, we're always going to be cool. And when it's against our side, we're always going to throw the book at you as literally hard as we can. You're creating a recipe for a catastrophe when you keep doing that. And so Casey Wudin is a big problem in getting him out of that office in San Francisco really has to be like a top priority for the community if they don't want that community to melt down in scary, proper real violence. What a matter of time. One analysis I heard about the 2020 election is that both with the Democratic Party very heavily putting their finger in the scale and forcing Biden to be the nominee over Bernie Sanders, plus with the increased number of Republicans who were electing the House when all the polls said the Democrats are going to be picking up seats, that this was in many ways a center left repudiation of what you're talking about, that this is the corporate Democratic Party who's not particularly as big fans of this as some of the activists, although they use it to further themselves. And that's who's really running the show. Hmm. I mean, the proof doesn't seem to be in that pudding. There is that that happened. Bernie's an interesting case because Bernie's actually much more left-wing populist and not left-wing establishment. Right. Wokism is an ideology that despite being kind of, it's got strong communist roots, right? It's figured out that its avenue to success is through the establishment. Its goal was to do a long march through the institutions. So if you all of a sudden get rid of the institution, if you bring a populist in left-wing or right, that's not going to be in part of their agenda. The other thing is, it's a little bit different now because they have so much power. They have so much, they're so close to having hegemony in the culture, at least temporarily, that they're being quite bold. But normally they don't want their guys at the top. They don't want them highly visible. They want them two layers in the bureaucracy to out- The power behind the throne. Yeah, exactly. I mean, this is again, this is Gramsci. Antonio Gramsci laid out the ideas that you infiltrate the existing institutions and establish a counter hegemony from within that then kind of very cordyceps. It zombifies the organization and then takes over the whole thing. That is their model. This is why the cordyceps meme, which is a little highbrow, I gather, but I admit, but the cordyceps meme sticks because that's what's going on. You have this kind of fungus ideology that's becoming like parasitic into an institution or an individual that gets them to do its will from within. But if you just put somebody up on the top, they just become a target to shoot at, and not literally, but in terms of creating a strong public pressure campaign to get the mount. And so they tend to not want to do that. So Bernie being squashed out, even if it depends, was he a populist or had he tipped, had he sold out? Which side was he on? It's real hard to say now. In 2016, it wasn't hard to say, but now it's hard to say. I don't know where he is, ideologically, but either way, Joe Biden is safe, safe, safe. Look, he's basically asleep. We have to put him to bed at five 30 because he's sundowners. Look how safe sleepy Grandpa Joe is. Nothing bad is going to happen. He's always been a moderate. He's always been corrupt, but he's always been a moderate. He'll be held to account by his moderate base. And this tricked massive load of people. Even him putting out very radical ideas, like his complete racial equity program and literally everything tricked a lot. Even with that, they're like, no, no, Joe is safe. Joe is safe. So very Trojan horse mentality here. And Joe, the puppet, seems much more believable, especially now than Joe, the guy who is leading or calling a single shot anywhere. But I think that was the case over the summer too. I think they chose him because he was safe to vote. Oh, absolutely. Because yeah, because then he's bland. It's kind of hard to pin anything onto him. His record hasn't been of standing after one issue or another, particularly in any way. So people can, you know, he'll be a blank slate and that's a blank canvas, excuse me. And that would be of a great use to them. I mean, another point, I know we've got a mutual friend in Bridget Fetticey. I love her. She made the joke. Yeah, she's hilarious. She made the joke on Twitter that remember that Trump, you know, his game was kind of the art of the insult. There's even like a fake documentary made about called that about Trump. But she said you can't make fun of somebody with dementia, right? It's just not cool. And so it's like, this is this really awful dimension to this. If you think, well, the Democrats really knew what they were doing and choosing it, you can't make fun of him. Hey, Bridget, I even feel bad making fun of Joe Biden. That's because you're weak. Because you're an American. I'm from the Soviet Union. Bridget challenge accepted. I'm gonna write his dimension pony all the way to Gainesville. I'll read to you. I'll probably lean into it too. I think a lot of people will. I mean, Trump did drop that one. Resident in chief where he crossed out the P and showed him an emergency home. I didn't see that. Oh, wow. So yeah, instead of president or whatever. Yeah. No, Biden for resident is what it was. He showed an nursing home or something like that. So you were saying that you were very concerned about the short to medium term. One, the points I made during the riots was that corporate America has done a better job of implementing Maoism than the Chinese Communist Party was ever has been. We have seen in a few years college educated urban whites go from a situation where they're terrified of being called racist or being perceived as racist to getting on phone calls at their job and proclaiming I am a racist, which is. I mean, it's just shocking to see how quickly that has turned. What do you see as corporate America's role in all this and why do you do you think there's any hope there at all to change that ship? I don't know about hope. They do follow what there is to follow. The model is not Maoist, however, you know, it's easy to say that. And I say it a lot on Twitter myself. I have written about it. Let me interrupt you though. Don't you think this? I was talking about specifically those struggle sessions. Do you not think that's what I'm saying? Okay. That the cultural revolution side is quite Maoist. Yes. But the goal is not to un-cratch Maoism. Yes. The goal is to do something that we might more accurately call dengism, but deng Xiaoping who followed Mao. And what he figured out was how to wed the kind of corporate power to the CCP. And so you have like kind of all the power in the universe, you go get as rich as you want, build your corporations, because you want to pollute whatever you want, burn trash outside, whatever. You get big enough, you get rich, no regulations, but you insult the CCP and you're, you know, we'll disappear you. You're not a billionaire anymore. Somebody else runs your company now. And so this model is more like the model that we're headed toward. And a lot of people don't know who deng Xiaoping was. They don't know the history following Mao. And so it's very difficult to kind of relate this to people in a quick way. So the corporate model has been tested and perfected since the late 1970s or early 1980s in China, you know, the kind of corporate, it's like corporate tie. It's like fascist communism. It's like a blend of them. And that model has been being worked out, like in a lot of the kinks in it, early kinks in it have been being worked out over the past three or four decades. And so people, people fail to understand that the corporations being in on this does not change the nature of what it is. And they are extremely effective. And they turn out to be an Achilles heel for for the United States in particular, because we have so many legal protections baked into the Republicans, in fact, very dutifully made sure got put into place that free enterprise, however big, however, whatever it is, you know, has final say. So Facebook can ban whoever or whatever it wants, Twitter can ban whoever or whatever it wants. It can, you know, create these horrific weird, you know, very biased and biasing kind of algorithms and things that favor certain narratives and squash or destroy others. But there's no implicit bias, of course, because that's only about race. That's right. Yeah, these biases are very explicit. Yeah, they're right on there. When you when you go look them up, but the thing is, I don't know how you get corporations who are massively empowered by this to decide it's actually in their better interests, not to continue doing this. Right. And then the worst part is, is that a lot of these people have either been captured ideologically, or they've been captured by people who have cooked up stupid things like sustainable development goals, and what ESG was the environmental social goals or something like that governance or some shit, I don't know. And so they've come up with these, these, these metrics by which companies are judged in terms of how good or how investable they are or how useful they are. And those are all just cooked through with this ideology. So they're all competing to play harder in this ideology. Part of the ideological capture behind that is that there is literally a death cult that has decided that the world is going to end in the short period of time due to climate change, if we don't take radical action, or even if we do take radical action, that's the funny part. A lot of them say, even if we do everything we're saying, we're still screwed. And it's just like, then why are we doing it? Well, because we want to do it anyway. It's just like, wait, what? If you ask them, they will explicitly say, even if we implement all of this, we're still doomed. And then it's like, but then what can I at least have fun in the meantime? Yeah, but the, the, the exactly, please, but the evil, like, the evil is that there's, there's a level of cronyism here that I don't even know what you do with, because like, just take the example, these stupid vaccine passports, right? So they introduce this idea of a vaccine password, we could talk for the next hour about how horrible of an idea that is, but just we'll take them as they are. So what happens next? So Pfizer and Moderna, right? They, they make vaccines. So what are you going to like, you know, well, every two or three months, we're going to drop out a new vaccine that's going to make us, you know, 200 billion dollars. Look, I often remember, I started to interrupt you, but those of us who had flash in our computers, remember how often flash hats update? Well, if it's a virus that's mutating, they can with a straight face say it's six months, it's now COVID 27, you better get your shot. If you want this passport, why are you taking that chance? Your five minutes of your life could mean saving someone's life. Surely you're not going to not do that. Yeah, exactly. And the key here is Pfizer and Moderna are just like, you know, walking with their monocle and their top hat and bags and bags and bags and bags of money all the way down the way. So what what motivation would Pfizer and Moderna have to not be on board with this program, you know, as kind of a evil faceless corp that is stands to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year by forcing you to get injections that you don't actually need. The business model for them turns out to be pretty good. So I don't know how you this is this is when you ask like, why, you know, what you say white pill and I say black pill, this is kind of why I'm more black-filled. Sure. No, I hear you. Yeah. One of the things that I'm also interested in is it's a given that Nazism is regarded as just a foreign and horrible. I actually interviewed Jared Taylor from my book and he found the idea of Nazism to be absolutely like insane for America. But when you bring up communism, it's regarded as kitschy. It's kind of a joke. It's kind of like, oh, it's I love Lucy. It's like communism. Ha ha ha ha. Even though, you know, to this day, if you look at Venezuela or North Korea, which does not identify as communist, they longer, I mean, the blood that was spilled in name of this ideology for decades is just limitless. Paul Pot is another good example. I, my fingers point that the right, because you can understand why people on the left, especially the hard left, it's going to be a great use to them to have this be a laughing stock that you have to bother addressing that the blood is on your hands for what you did in the 30s. But I'm, are you surprised how little on the right are talking about just how bad this is and the consequences in the past? Um, a little bit, you know, I do like to, when you said that you point your finger to right, my first thought was because they called everything in the universe communism and social. Yeah, like 30 years. And it's like some of that guy's really wasn't. And so, and now they're all like, see, it was slippery slope and they just still look kind of crazy. Another aspect though that I point a finger at there is in the education system, which got taken over very early by leftist activists who were ultimately Marxists. And so it was in their best interest to make sure that the, the, the kids were not informed about the horrors that have been attended to every attempt to install socialism in the world ever. Um, I mean, our education, our schools of education were more or less captured by like 81 or 82 or something like that. So we're talking literally 40 years where the Marxists on some level or Marxist sympathetic types have run education. And then, I mean, I have no idea though, because there was all these complaints about Texas Board of Education, you know, with all of its crazy, like, you know, A is for Armadillo and whatever, or Alamo or whatever they have to do, everything has to be Texas centric. Um, but they didn't that I mean, I don't, I don't even know how to put it. I never learned about communism until I was in college. I never learned about it. It was a word I knew, but that was it. I didn't even know what it meant. And, you know, I wouldn't have, I never heard of Solzhenichan until Jordan Peterson started talking about him. Is that right? Yeah. Wow. It just doesn't get taught. I mean, there are reasons because Solzhenichan had like some pretty strong anti-Semitism and some of what he did too. So I understand why they kind of like downplay that at the high school level. Yeah. But that's not why they don't talk about him. I don't think so either. I think it's, it's because they don't want people to know how bad it is. And I think, you know, I pointed the right for calling everything in the universe that, but I also pointed the left for occupying the education system and making sure that people remain ignorant of it. And then they have a much, you know, we say the left can't mean, but they have a much better kind of propaganda game than people tend to give them credit. You know, they talk, they're so relentlessly good using a critical theory at pointing out where something went wrong and saying that capitalism did it. Yeah. And they're so relentlessly good at pointing out and saying, they don't have to say, you know, look at this other example of a socialist place. They just say, oh, this is capitalism screwing up capitalism screwing up this capitalism screwing up. And they do it so relentlessly and so well. I mean, you see see on Twitter, you know, the most asinine things that capitalism allegedly did. And it gets, you know, literally hundreds of thousands of likes and retweets and things like that, which of course also as part of the game. That's largely not organic that sure, you know, so they're really good at the propaganda game. And communists realized at least 30 years ago that American citizens, especially, but America may be including its intelligence communities, just don't understand political warfare. They don't understand propaganda. They don't understand how to identify it, how to resist it. I was even talking about an example on Twitter a little bit ago, which is the so-called reflexive statement where, you know, it was, you know, nothing will ever go back to normal after COVID. You know, well, that's only true if everybody believes it. Right. So it's reflexive. It's not true on its face. It's not false on its face. It becomes true or becomes false. There's your kind of dialectical mindset, by the way, becomes true or becomes false based on whether or not people believe it. And they're super good at this. They're really good at putting these reflexive statements out and making people feel like it's an inevitability. Right. And then with the right side of history argument, which side, this is inevitable, which side do you want to be on? They're super good at putting all that together in a very coordinated act of political warfare that demoralizes all opposition. Yeah. How much easier it is to fight a battle when your opponents are like, what's the point I'm not going to win? So they're just going to stay home. That's what you want. That's the ideal scenario where everyone else is like, I can't win or it's going to be too hard. It's like, okay, great. I took the battlefield and I didn't lose a cent or a finger. Yeah. Soo Nza is like, ha ha, you know, of course. Yeah. So this is something they're extremely good at and they have been doing relentlessly for 100 years and improving and perfecting. And I don't think since probably the 1950s have American citizens been very good at identifying that kind of propaganda. I don't think they ever have been. I think this is, I mean, this, I don't know if you've ever played the game, Secret Hitler or these other like, there's game where wolves basically or mafia is another party game where you have an informed minority against an uninformed majority. And this is the Lenin model when you have a little cadre of intellectuals and there's this is rent capture, right? If I'm in the sardines industry and everyone else is in the sardines industry, we just got a lobby, Mitch McConnell, hey, put a five cent tax and give them money to us five cents for 350 million people. They're not going to notice it. But five cents times 350 million for me as the sardine manufacturer, I'm loaded. So there's an enormous asymmetry and same thing here. It's like most people are oblivious. All it's going to take is that small number and they can, you know, move the earth. Yeah, exactly. I think three and a half percent is enough if you have a sufficiently informed minority acting as a coordinated vanguard. Yeah. And this is why when people tell me, oh, you never can get the majority of people to agree with you. I'm like, you never get the majority of people think it that's completely irrelevant. I mean, as long as you have, but it is a battle of the elites in this kind of Italian school way, where if you they have 3.5%, you have 1%, it's not, I mean, you have a fighting chance. It's not 53 versus 47 because that's the consequence by the time they get the polls. Yeah, exactly. It's exactly right. So, people should, I mean, I don't think the left can mean, to be honest with you, but they are relentlessly good at propaganda. And so getting people to identify that propaganda, I think is extraordinarily important right now. And these critical theories, critical race theory, for example, are just really good at cooking up propaganda. You know, why do they always want to pull up all the most awful stories of history? You know, why do they always say such and such as rooted in because they want to, it's all a propaganda-izing game. It's not branding. That's right. And then that very Hegelian, very dialectical article of faith, the right side of history, you know, the history has a tailos. And at the end of it, there's a right side and the wrong side, and you will be judged accordingly. When you tack that mentality on, and people don't realize they're like, oh, the right side of history, ha ha. Now, when you tack that on, it turns all of that propaganda that they have into a very formidable weapon. Especially like you said, yeah, you'll get people motivated at that level. You'll also get people who either won't show up or what they'll do is very cynically, they'll judge their odds, right? And they'll say, well, it looks like the New World Order's coming. And I better, if I had to pick, I'd rather have a place in it than not. So I won't be an enemy of the thing coming. And so you have people who literally lay down their guns, if you will, and not fight against it, not stand up to it. Because if it does, if all the shit goes bad, you know, it's in their personal best interest to be positioned to try to survive and be well placed in the New Order. And yeah, they're they're making it clear that the cost benefit analysis is going to be very disproportional. Whereas if you fight us, we're going to absolutely destroy you and your family. Whereas if you don't do anything, you're not going to lose anything. So sit down and shut up. And you do the math. It's a really if what they're saying is true, then the choice or obvious look what happened with the guy who ran, what's that that gay workout organization CrossFit? The head of CrossFit was like, we have nothing to do with Black Lives Matter, we're a fitness, and he got fired. Or driven out of his company that he founded. Yeah. Yeah. So you make examples. And you know, speaking of propaganda too, a lot of people don't know this about propaganda. They think, Oh, propaganda tricks dumb people. No, but actually smart people. This is my line. It's a lot easier to train a smart dog than a dumb dog. That's right. And then you have people who have gone for four years of education, whose status is based on being perceived as better than and smarter than it is a lot easier to train them and have them be the Vanguard, as you just mentioned, than to have them be just some random who knows four years of psychology. Yeah, they'll fall for it. They'll rationalize it. They do all the heavy lifting. I mean, I call these people the very smart people. Yeah. They do all the heavy lifting for this kind of intellectual vanguardism, even though they technically might be against it, they might openly be against it. And yet, they do all the heavy lifting by rationalizing it, looking for third ways, that are all just kind of like soft implementations or compromises. And so the ratchet turns ever, or if we were mold bug, we'd say, Chulu swims left. Yeah, again, if there was one book that you would have everyone read other than your own, what would it be? The book that I have highlighted, the largest quantity of text is John Stuart Mills on Liberty. Okay. I might recommend that. But a kind of more contemporary book, if you want to understand the basis of how a kind of free knowledge system works, I always recommend Jonathan Roush's Kindly Inquisitors. But I could list a lot, a lot of books. I would actually encourage people, it's a little weird, frankly, but to read Lubitschowski's political panorology. Have you read this? No, I'm not familiar with it. Yeah. He, I mean, it's a little weird because he ended up having to burn the first two copies of his book because like the Stasi showed up. So he had to like throw out the fire before they would, you know, confiscate it and kill him. So he ended up, you know, he's like 80 something and he writes what is now the published version of it. And he was like, you know, I don't have time to go find all my data. So I'm just going to write what I remember. And so it's a little squishy on the, on the fine points, but it's like he technically did have to throw his book in the fire twice beforehand, you know, at pain of death. And so it's a very interesting panorology refers to a theory of evil. So it's a very interesting look into how psychopathy plays a role in these kinds of evil regimes rising up. So that's an interesting one that people might want to consider reading as well way off the beaten track. James, we're running out of time. What has been your favorite part of this interview? Your nose. You are welcome."
