    "text": " Hi, I'm Annemarie Cox. Welcome to With Friends Like These, a show about messy coalitions and difficult conversations. Today's conversation, I thought was going to be difficult. It turned out to be both remarkably easy and incredibly productive. Today's show is all about Hillary Clinton. I had the idea to do it out of a rather selfish impulse, which is that I have called myself in the past a Hillary skeptic. I think I have been in the past a Hillary critic. I voted for her. I was happy to vote for her. But even since the election, as we've continued to re-litigate and re-litigate and re-litigate, I have found myself. I don't even know how to put it. I don't know what to say about her. I do feel like I've had to have a position about her. And I don't know what it is anymore. Or I didn't know what it is. I decided to do this episode all about her so that maybe I'd figure it out. And we do have a bonus episode coming up that includes interviews with Hillary fans online to get their book signed, Simone Sanders from the Sanders campaign to talk about what she thinks about Hillary Clinton, and a conversation with my best friend of the world who happened to work for Hillary Clinton. And those conversations were all productive and all useful, but it turns out all I really needed to do was talk to Rebecca Traster for an hour. You probably are familiar with her work. She is a writer at large for New York Magazine and the author of the book All the Single Ladies. She has written about Hillary Clinton, I think we could safely say for a decade, if not longer. And our conversation just really helped me. I hope it helps you. You have complicated feelings about Hillary. If you don't have complicated feelings by Hillary, if you wonder why you feel about her the way you do, that is if you wonder what are the historical forces at work in your own thinking about this woman, one of the most important women in American history, I think it's safe to say this conversation is for you. Coming right up. If you think you might have negative reaction to the things we're talking about, you might want to have a couple of numbers on hand. One of them is for the National Sexual Assault Hotline. And that number is 800-656-4673, which stands for hope. That's 800-656-HOPE. That is for the rape abuse incest national network. And they also have an anonymous online chat that you can log on to if you would like. And that is at online.rainwith2ins.org. And also I love the crisis text line, which is 741-741. You can text almost anything to that. And they will hook you up with someone who can talk you through whatever you're going through. What I like about that especially is they don't ask you to think of what you're going through as an emergency. Is if you're in emotional pain or if you're experiencing anxiety and you don't know what to do, they want to get you help before you reach a true crisis. So don't hesitate to get in touch with them. I'm going to start by saying that we were here to talk about Hillary, but you came into the studio and the first thing out of your mouth was something along those lines of I'm sorry I'm a little frazzled. I've been in rape wonderland. Yeah. Which is two-glib. Which is was two-glib a comment on my part to describe just being in a lab. I know I know I know I know we're all laughing. I know we're all laughing. Yes. What you're talking about. Right. And that's actually the do Miramax ride. That's what that is. Yes. That's so dark. Yeah. So if you're, I mean the reason that I'm here to talk about Hillary is because my job is writing about women in politics and power and the public sphere. And because that is my beat, I have been writing a lot in recent weeks about, I'm going to be writing about sexual harassment and sexual assault. Also not unrelated to last year's election that got us President Donald Trump instead of President Hillary Clinton. But it really is sort of, it's like choking. You know, it's the smoke is so thick everywhere. You can't, on my way in, I'm reading about Roy Moore, who is the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama, who is alleged now to have made sexual advances on women, underage women. There were four, I believe, people coming forward. Yes. The year is from his 14. And 30 people on the record as sources for the story. Yes. Yeah. It seems like a pretty solid story. And the question I was asking myself as, and this is very related to the election of Donald Trump. And I think also to the rage that got us to this moment in the news cycle where we're actually printing and reading stories about sexual harassment and assault and the ubiquity of that assault. The question I'm asking myself as I read about Roy Moore is, yeah, well, is he going to get elected anyway? Because our last model for this was he got elected anyway. And I think that the rage of that, that you can do the thing and report the story and get the 30 sources, that you can be one of the women who tells their story. And I was very interested in reading the Washington Post story about Roy Moore, that they took a lot of pains to get the women who were coming forth with their accusations to describe themselves. They're not Democrats. They're not a, they are Republican voters. The woman who's the core of the story is a Trump voter that this was not. Which is by the way, its own kind of mind fuck. Right. But yes. Yeah. But that this wasn't partisan. It's not partisan. It's not ideologically motivated. It was reporters coming to them, not them coming to reporters. And all of that can be true. And they're doing something very brave because as we know with all the harassment stories we're talking about, in addition to the sort of fears about speaking out and telling your story and telling painful, recounting painful, intimate things about which women are taught to feel tremendous shame, there's also the fear of retaliation that you're going to be mocked, that you're going to be seen as the aggressor, that you're going to, all these things that really happen, not to mention sort of threatened that somebody's going to publish your sexual history to try to discredit you, that somebody's going to publish nude photos of you, that you know, all that stuff is very much up in the air for all these people. And all of these people, when we talk about the people who told their stories about Donald Trump, groping them, kissing them against their will, sexually assaulting them, that he himself was caught on tape, bragging about the pleasures of being able to just grab women against their will. And it didn't matter. It didn't matter. He's the president. And it didn't even matter, by the way, that three million more people voted for his opponent, I mean, which is the other sort of, God, it just, I mean, the sort of cicifian feeling about this is like, you can even do the thing, right? And I know, elect really, we didn't do the thing, and there are a million reasons why and all that. But sort of democratically, small, de-democratically, we did the thing. We voted for his opponent. And it didn't matter. He still has the job. And so it's very hard. And when I read about Roy Moore, there's a, I mean, I'm going to say 75 to 95% of me is like, he's going to get the job. He's going to get the job. I have like two, so there's kind of two directions I want to take the conversation. One is there's a part of me that just wants to talk about the, as I call it, like the daily insults that Donald Trump is, right, to all of us that have ever experienced any kind of harassment or assault men or women, no matter where you identify, if you've been groped, touched, punched, whatever. And then there's a part of me, and I am able to just get this off at the top, which is that. What do you think would have happened if we had had this mindset about sexual assault and sexual harassment during Bill Clinton's election? I think about this all the time. I've been thinking so much about Bill Clinton in the past few weeks. Yeah. Well, you know, we should have because it was right after Anita Hill. So so in the timeline of how we talk about sexual assault, I guess, I want to identify the we here as like women in newsrooms, women connecting with each other, women on social media, like this, that not like the society at large, which I think is still right, right, you know, kind of figuring it out. But there's a lot of progressive women now who support each other in speaking out. And we have a culture that's nascent culture of that, of supporting that. Right. That maybe didn't. It certainly didn't exist, but it had been triggered. I mean, this is the this is the mind fuck of all of this. And I think, you know, after the stories about Weinstein came out and then there have been a lot of stories about men and left media, which, of course, as anybody who's ever worked in progressive anything can tell you activism media can tell you that though it is a world not a partisan issue, this is not a partisan issue. But and in fact, the mismatch is especially painful. And I think that plays into the the defenses that happened to Bill Clinton in that moment. There was a kind of like if you are first of all, if you are theoretically a member of a progressive sphere or progressive project as a politician, as an activist, as a as a publisher, the idea is that your progressivism is supposed to entail a pursuit of increased possibility and opportunity and equality for all kinds of people, including, of course, women. And then the idea that there's this disconnect between how you actually treat women, how how you abuse what is still fundamentally a patriarchal power structure from which men benefit in this country, that there's a mismatch. And of course, it's not totally a mismatch because it's always quote unquote women's issues that are jettisoned first in the progressive project. It's always, I mean, we just had this conversation over the past year around, you know, could we have a exciting new left progressive coalition that didn't support abortion rights and reproductive autonomy? Like it's the first thing that gets traded away that happened in the healthcare horse trading, you know, in the first Obama administration, when we had a super majority, we were like, Hey, but maybe we should still get do away with abortion. Right. So, so, and part of what was happening with Bill Clinton after Anita Hill came forward and gave her testimony about her experiences with Clarence Thomas. I think we forget. And by the way, I should say some of this is, is memory for me. I was in high school when this happened. I was in I was in college. I actually, uh, Orrin Hatch came to speak at my college during this. And this is the little baby punk rock activist that I was. We did street theater in front of it. Yeah. Which I only time in my life have done it. I swear I won't do it again. And then the school that I went to disallowed signs in classrooms, I think is an artifact from their best student takeover of administration buildings in the 60s. So, right. All these, they had all these rules about what kind of activism and protests you could do. So the largest piece of paper you could bring into a classroom was like a legal sized pad. So we printed out, you know, uh, dozens, I guess hundreds, probably of a piece of paper that just said, I believe Anita. Oh, that's. And then we went and sat down and just in silently like held our signs. It was very proud. God, well, you covered yourself with more glory than I did because I was a, I was high school. I guess I was in 10th grade. And actually, I watched the hearings with my very conservative Republican grandparents. I happened to be up in there on the farm they lived on in Northern Maine and watched it on the small and they were like, she's lying. She and I was just, I mean, I didn't, I, I believed her, but there was, there wasn't even a space for conversation. I was just sitting in the kitchen with my Nana while she was telling me that this woman was a, you know, a lying troll up or whatever. And, but I did, I did believe, you know, I should also point the reason that I'm proud of that story is that it was actually an outlier thing to do. Yeah. Yeah. It was, we were not, we were very considered very French, the group. It was a queer university that did it. And for not all anyone who I wanted to be a part of, it could be a part of it. And it was like the activist core. And we were considered pretty Frengy for doing that. Well, while that while this was going on, one of the things to remember, and this also gets back to the sort of the ugly heart of, of some of our left wing liberal progressive heroes, what was happening during those that need a health testimony, the Senate Judiciary Committee, all white guys was led by Joe Biden. And the person who was the great liberal lion, who should have been up there, giving space or defense to Anita Hill as she told her very painful story was a man named Ted Kennedy, our great progressive hero. And in addition to his public and questionable past with women, he at that very moment was part of a rape trial that was ongoing of his nephew in Palm Beach, William Kennedy Smith was on trial at the same time. Then Anita Hill was testifying. Ted Kennedy's nephew, William Kennedy Smith is on trial for rape, a night that began with him drinking with Uncle Ted, like Ted Kennedy had been present on the night that his nephew had been accused of rape. And that was ongoing. And sort of everybody can agree retrospectively that probably that had a lot to do with why he sat there silent as Anita Hill was sort of ritually abused and insulted by the Senate Judiciary Committee that was led by a Democrat. Highly encourage people to go back and look at this. It is I even so I even watched it and believed her and was doing activism around this. And it still is appalling to me. Like it's an amazing there's a good documentary about it. It was Anita. It was released like four or five years ago. Right. And there's also a book that I'm going to blank on the name on Jane, Mayor and Dolly Brumson wrote it strange justice. Strange justice. It's a bed. It's like a page turn. It's an incredible book. Highly recommended. And she herself contributed she edited and contributed to a set of essays. Oh, I'm not going to remember the name of it. But I have it at home. Anita Hill has done incredible writing and is doing writing this week, in fact, on sexual harassment. So but after and the women in the house at that point, there were so few women in Congress. We also forget this wasn't long ago. It was less than 25 years ago. And or no, it was 26 years ago. Yes. It was 26 years ago. Just kidding. It was a really long time ago. Super old. But but many of the lawmakers who were present are still, you know, in our political scene today. The women from the house actually had to storm up the steps. There's a very famous photograph of the women, including Eleanor Holmes Norton, Patricia Schroeder, a women in the house to interrupt the Senate judiciary. And they their version of the story is Joe Biden was like, go away. And they were like, no, you have to get this woman to testify. So this has been very hard fought for her even to be able to testify. Then she testified there were women who were willing to back her up. Joe Biden did not call them to testify. Clarence Thomas is confirmed to the Supreme Court. I view this as like one of the turning points in in political history. And I think we're going to go back to it again. And again, we're going back to it as far as sexual harassment, as far as women running for office in the wake of that in the wake of her treatment. Your fringe activism was fringy, but there was so much anger from women. That bubbled up in the wake of Anita Hill not being believed and being treated so dismissively by this all white male Senate judiciary. First of all, there was something about her not getting it, which maybe says a theme here in a way about her not getting meaning her not being believed and and Clarence Thomas being confirmed. That was more bitter than the fight itself. And I sort of feel that way. This is maybe another leave as a touchstone for talking about Hillary. Well, I think I love. Let's finish that. Yeah, comparison right now because I've said this is something I think I've written. I view those moments as like real parallel echoes of each other because, yes, it's a loss. It is a material loss with long term negative consequences. Clarence Thomas serving on the Supreme Court gets us to the voting right. You guys don't get to see me like shaking my head and being sad. But yeah, Clarence Thomas is part of gutting the Voting Rights Act, which enables the election of Donald Trump, right? There's there's even a direct line you can draw in terms of negative consequences. It is a massive long term loss. But the rage that it inspires, the backlash of fury, the way that it makes clear the inequities, both gendered and racial, that we're still very much in play in politics in the public sphere, creates a couple of things. First of all, more women run for office in 1992, the year after. That's where the year of the woman, it was the year of the woman for women, including the first Carol Mosley Braun, first African American woman ever elected to the Senate. And she remained the only one until this fall when Kamala Harris was elected. I remember crying in the school library. When she won, I was I remember as a Harper library studying and it was like finals week. And I remember I'm getting teary now like it was it was a moment. Yeah, it was a moment. And it was you're right. It was a direct response. A direct response. Those women will tell you Patty Murray, who's still in the Senate, will tell you she was mad about Anita Hill and was like, why doesn't anybody who looked like me? Why wasn't anybody on the Senate Judiciary Committee? A lot of those women are running and they're direct about it. They're furious about Anita Hill. And again, not exactly just about the harassment, but about the loss, right? The loss and how she was treated, right? The response was what was activating. The second thing is that sexual harassment comes into the public like lexicon is like not just a weird quirky behavior. And that's how men are and what do you expect if you're going to go into offices, ladies? But as like a harm and economic harm done to women as a class, something that that renders them unequal in workplaces that that disadvantages them. And so there's an something that can be pervasive and not necessarily a predatory in a way that people had not yet had not recognized. Right. Predatory not in just like I'm trying to get a date with you. I think that's the kind of sexual harassment that people still kind of have in their head as the kind that counts. Right. Exactly. You know, you have to date me or else. And that's the only kind of sexual harassment that exists. This sexual harassment of Anita Hill was it's more pervasive, like weird, hostile workplace is the phrase that we now have. Right. Right. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And so but then what happens next year? Ninety two, year of the woman. Right. What if hiring could be easier, more streamlined and less time consuming?

The year of the woman is also the year that Bill Clinton is elected. Right. Which there are things that match. OK, there are things that match. So in the moment, what we know is that there is a woman who is making allegations that he was unfaithful about her and Jennifer Flowers. Right. And that is a public thing during his campaign. And everybody knows about it. I don't believe that at that point there is any allegation that it was non-consensual. It was an affair. He's claiming they have to go on. Hillary has to do the like I stand by my man. I'm not like it was all it was infidelity. And she was I believe a tabloid reporting started to make its way into mainstream political stories that way. Right. And you're right. It was it was consensual and it was he cheated. That was he cheated. That was what we knew about this guy. Here are the other things we knew about this guy. He had a wife who at that point was probably the most impressive. I mean, by, you know, First Lady and she was a feminist heroine already from the start. She was the first First Lady with a postgraduate degree, the first First Lady to have maintained a career outside of her husband's political career. He sold them as a two for one presidency. She had as many qualifications as he did. And she was viewed, which will be hilarious to some listeners now as a kind of left wing radical poll on his administration. She was viewed as this the fact that she kept her name, the fact that she worked for the children's defense fund, which I thought it's that was radical, which is actually was sort of radical today. I still radical, but the children's defense fund. I'm trying to remember the other signature thing, not only did she keep her name, but she had a job and a job that she was proud of. Well, and the big controversy during the campaign was that at some point she was asked about Jerry Brown, his one of his opponents had made an allegation that there was improper use of funds around her job. Her job as a lawyer and a very successful one. And she said, well, I didn't stay home and bake cookies. I suppose I could have stayed home and had teas and baked cookies. Right. Now, she also said a follow up thing. I was we always get that far and everybody flipped the fuck out. Like she had just told American mothers that they were helping. Yes. Yeah. Right. No. And in fact, the follow up to that, like they said everybody freaked out like in the diner where she was talking. It was like, rah, sirens. And then everybody calmed down and then she continued and said, look, I've always my work has always been toward helping women make any choice that's right for them, including staying home with their family, including going to work. Like she actually her immediate follow up. She's such a bad politician. I know. This is like a theme. And the irony is, but here's one of the ironies for me about her and the bad poll. Politing is that sometimes what she she just says, what she thinks. She obviously meant like the whole thing about her being inauthentic. I'm like, you guys, there's literally never been a more authentic person in the world than Hillary. I agree. Ever. And also, I just finished reading her book, which there is only one chapter I wanted to throw against the wall. But for the most part, it's was it the Russia one? No. It's when she comes out for universal basic income and is like, oh, but I didn't propose that because we could make the numbers work. And she was like, and then she has the same, literally the same page. She says Democrats need to be not afraid of big ideas. No. I'm. No. No. It was on a plane or else I would have thrown it very hard. Yeah. She's like, but it's all these. So she talks about some of her gaffes during the campaign. And the thing is, and she always says I was taking out a context where I should have said it more clearly, but it's, but you want to argue with her. No, you meant that. You actually meant that. Like when you said Colmont, you're going to put coal miners out of work. That's that's true. Right. Like you could you I know how you should have said it differently. You should have said it differently, but you weren't taken out of context. You you want to put coal miners out of work. No, this is this is the horrible irony about Hillary. She has been so herself and so I would agree with you. This is I've not seen the frame this way, but I totally agree with you. From the time if you go back and read her commencement speech, which is totally radical and weird and loopy and all of that. And if you read the letters that she wrote to her friends when she was in college, she has always been this lady. It's just that America hasn't liked her. And so and doesn't really fundamentally like a person who talks that bluntly and doesn't put it in better context and isn't slicker in a lot of ways. And then. And I actually totally I didn't see. I think one of the reasons I'm a Hillary skeptic is that I actually completely identify with her. Like I completely see myself in a lot of her a lot of her habits, which is that I don't know when to shut up a lot of the times. Like I often assume that people would like to be corrected if they're wrong. Yeah. Like I don't know this about her, but I bet she corrects people's pronunciation of things, which is something that I do when I was in rehab, that came up in like group therapy. Oh, no, because people were like on a correct people's had they say things. Like and that makes me feel less than with less than a big like rehab thing. So and you don't apologize for being smart or for having a napkin. Right. I mean, like this is, but I get I get why she is the person that she is. And I also would never run for president. Right. But let's go back and talk about Bill somewhere. So he comes to Washington. He's the president. He has this wife who many feminists admire the very people who are driving home the conversation about sexual harassment in a broader in a broader sense, like are lionizing his wife. OK, for good reason. And she's heading up health care. You know, that went poorly, but there was a lot of excitement about the fact that she was going to do it and scarred her. That's such a terrible thing, but it's it's really, I mean, again, she, I do remember this part, the initial proposals, this idea we're going to health care for everyone. I mean, well, going back and reading about what happened with health care is like total Rashomon. Like everybody tells you a different story about what her role was, what she was fighting for, how involved she was. Maybe it was all these other people. Maybe it was Ira magazine or maybe it was Hillary. You can't get a straight story if you weren't actually in the room and even the people who are in the rooms tell you different stories. But one of the versions of the story is that, again, an irony that she was pushing for universal and pushing and pushing and pushing and pushing and that it wouldn't it wasn't going to fly and it turned out to be disastrous. OK, anyway, she's a she's a famous icon. She's a nice icon. I've been her emptying you, but this is great. Bill is, I mean, it's been at that point years of conservative years of damaging and also the years in which the Republican Party has aligned with the religious right, which is particularly bad for feminists because you've seen the ramping up of a war on reproductive rights. Bill Clinton is the president. He is a strongly pro-choice president. He appoints women. He appoints Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court. He, in all these ways, is not only a friend to feminists, but such a relief after years of having had these Republicans in office. And then it turns out he has had a relationship with an intern. Do you remember how old Monica Winsky was? I believe she was 21. Yeah, I think so. About the age of his daughter, just a couple of years older than his daughter, while in the White House, an intern. And intern. Like, let's like the people, I think, sometimes forget just how dramatic this power differential, like by any definition, this was not just inappropriate, not just infidelity, but an abuse of power. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. It was. And that's a thing that's clear in my mind. And I think has been for a long time that it was because there was a lot of fighting about it because because the look, liberals and in fact, feminists defended him. They defended him in public. They defended him in big ways. And so there was a conversation about it at the time. And defended in ugly ways too. Oh, yeah. By, by in part, part of the conversation was about Monica Lewinsky's participation in this and the fact that by her reckoning and I mean, his, he didn't, the degree to which he ever even told the story is not the fault. But so mostly we have her account of it. And in her account, she was in fact in the, the, an enthusiastic participant. And she approached him first. And so that gave ammunition to feminists who wanted to defend Bill to say, this was not coerced. This was not, there's even a conversation between Hillary Clinton and her friend, Diane Blair, who she, do you know about this? There's, she was, I know having conversations that she knew that her friend, I think it was Diane Blair. She knew her friend was writing down as sort of a public record of her. It wasn't, they were private conversations. They were not for public dissemination, but this friend kept a diary. She kept a diary. But the conversation I'm thinking of is one in which I believe the friend is writing down what Hillary is saying about this as it is unfolding. And even Hillary takes care to say it was not a coercive relationship. Like she, she at least, and I mean, I think about that all the time. She at least was saying, I've thought about this and I've investigated it and it was not, he didn't coerce her. But feminists, public feminists, including Gloria Steinem, who defended Bill Clinton in the New York Times, tried to make this distinction. And there are distinctions to be made. Of course, there are distinctions to be made between all of these cases. And Monica Lewinsky herself, to this day, I believe, when she writes about it, says it was a consensual relationship. But what it also was and that we didn't get to, and that makes it very different from what Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas were talking about, right? Here I'm nodding. But it is a grotesque abuse of power. And we didn't have the vocabulary around that at that point. And we didn't have a feminist commentary. We didn't have a feminist media that was at that point empowered and anxious to make those distinctions. And I actually want to point out I did a story at some point during this. And I don't remember if it was for my college paper or for a class, but I went to the University of Chicago Law School and talked to this avant-garde professor who was writing law articles, wanting to institute some kind of legal distinction about abusive power relationships, that any relationship between a superior and their subordinate, I don't think I think he was saying like, anytime it's a superior and a subordinate, that should be considered sexual harassment because that person could get fired, because that person could suffer if the relationship is broken off. Absolutely. But that was considered again, like, but he was like out there. Right. Right. Right. No, no, no, that was a completely out there idea that I'm, but it shouldn't have been, it shouldn't have been, but we weren't there in the public conversation. Then in the course of the star investigation, which is what digs up, and it is, it's also true that in that case, it is totally ideologically motivated. It is Republicans looking to take down Bill Clinton. Yeah. Right. That's the context in which all this stuff is dug up. There are also Republicans also, and this is the part I can't remember about at what point Juanita Broderick's claims become public because there is a woman named Juanita Broderick who claims that Bill Clinton raped her. Yes. And there's a, she tells a very vivid story about it. Um, I don't remember when the timing is either, but yes, it is in the whole Clinton conspiracy theory, uh, heated, um, hot house, uh, heated hot house. Right. There's a, there's a, the, the right is doing its own kind of alternative journalism. Let's say during this time, some, and they, they're doing a Vince Foster investigation. Right. And they're also, uh, you know, they ran cocaine, the kilns ran cocaine and Arkansas. There's this whole cottage industry. Right. And a lot of it is in his horse shit. Right. A lot of it is totally manufactured horse shit. Like absolute. Fiction. Yep. And that's true too. And this is all these factors that are making this. I was a little older than you are. And I remember all this. Yes. Like the, you were, you had them, them being running coke and Arkansas and having killed, killed, killed, killed, killed, been tossed her. And then also you have this story about Juanita Broderick that is so lurid. Those of us, and I was one, I, I admit, like I was really confused. I remain confused. Um, because I also was like a pro, pro choice and I, I, I, I had problems with the cleanse, but they were mainly about like policy and stuff. And I recognized that they were basically my ally and all these different things. We didn't, we, the phrase, this is actually kind of an amazing thing to think that when we sit, when we did a little science that said, I believe Anita, that was just what it was. I believe Anita, the phrase, believe women did not exist as a popular conception. Right. So there wasn't this like feeling of like, I should believe this person. Right. You know, and the thing that happens in the wake of this, which I've thought about a lot, even before this last election. So when it gets dismissed by most liberals as part of the, the hot house conspiracy theory factory, right. And there are reasons, right? Like this is, I go back and she does go to conservatives. She goes to conservatives. It's, it's the Juanita Broderick story is a really complicated one. Actually Katie Baker wrote a great piece about Juanita Broderick last year that I recommend people go and read because it is. It's a very confusing territory. When I say she goes to conservatives, I mean, like she elies herself with that. Yes. Part of the political spectrum and that kind of the conspiracy theory factory. Dinizens. Right. She, she does not try to align herself. She doesn't present herself as anything, but someone who is actively trying to bring down the clip. And to be clear, there are other women. There's Paula Jones. There are other women who make claims about Bill Clinton, not rape claims in those cases, but harassment claims or, or assault claims. Yeah. Some of them are, are, I think, plausibly discredited at the time. Okay. So this whole stew of, of shit happens. And one of the things that comes out of this is that Bill Clinton sails out of office. He is, I mean, he looked, he faces impeachment. He has to do a lot of, but he comes out of, he doesn't have to step down. He is not convicted of anything. He not only, I mean, it, it derails, and this is bad for progressives, bad for liberals. It wholly does, it derails his second term. It ruins Monica Lewinsky's life. It ruins Monica Lewinsky's life. It also, there's, there are some confusing things about what it does for Hillary Clinton's life. Yes. This is probably the nut of it right here. Yes. Because on the one hand, she sticks with him. Okay. And, and I've also, I've had to think about this a lot in my writing about her, like in general, I don't believe that wives should be handed the checks for their husband's misbehavior, like as a general rule, unless they participated in the misbehavior, obviously, right? Um, it was one of my qualms last year when, for example, Donald Trump brings the group of women to the debate he's having with Hillary Clinton, who is the candidate for the presidency. And I was like, are you kidding? You are, she is going to, she's going to answer like, all right, we are now at a place where we can revisit Bill Clinton's behavior with a new set of lenses and comprehension about power dynamics and gender dynamics that are going to reveal him to be a lot more malevolent and his actions a lot more malicious than we had understood at the time. But you're the one doing it. We're going to do it. Hey, Donald Trump, you're the one doing it and be the person who's going to pay for it is Hillary. Are you kidding me? No, that is not because I think this happens very often. What is also true is that she doesn't leave him, which first of all, discredits her with a lot of feminists who'd loved her there. I still talk to people today. I had a conversation on Monday with a really respected, really smart friend who actually thinks the world of Hillary politically in a lot of ways, but is like, I just don't understand why she didn't leave him. Okay. So it hurts her with certain feminists, but her approval rating skyrocket with the general population. She's going to run for Senate in New York. And this woman who's been this radical lightning rod for all these years, who's been a very controversial figure. The idea of her running for office would have been totally implausible at some points in the Clinton administration because she was so unlike. She was so toxic, toxic caricatured as this feminazi bitch castrating, you know, shillery, whatever. And Hillary, right. Vince Foster murderer, all these horrible things. But because she stays with him and the question is, I mean, there are lots of questions. Is it because she stays with him or is it because she's humiliating it? Because there's also the pleasure in she's sexually humiliated by this because her husband has wondered, right? So she in some ways, it's a, it's a morality play for conservatives who don't believe that women like Hillary should have been working outside the house and should have been wielding all this power. See your husband's going to cheat on you because, and it's, and it kind of brings her down several notches in a way. Then it makes her sympathetic. We are, we are conditioned, all of us, to some degree, to feel more warmly toward vulnerable women than we do about threatening women. She becomes vulnerable, humiliated, people like her more. They, I also wonder, I mean, the, it's such an interesting counterfactual about whether or not she would have been able to run for Senate had she left him. Because there's a part of me that wonders, there's like a middle option about why her popularity soared then, which is that she's a survivor. Right. That stay with him or leave. She does, she has her eyes on her own prize. Well, she's going to have her life. I've been thinking about this with regard to anger. I'm writing this book about women anger and politics. And I've been thinking about Eleanor Roosevelt. And you know, there's one telling of Eleanor Roosevelt's life. In which she's going to be the helpmate. I mean, and I may, I'm like going to pervert this because I haven't gone back and reread my Blanche, Wies and Cook and everything. But popular understanding of history, popular understanding of history is Eleanor is going to be the sort of supportive helpmate. And then her husband's infidelity, chronic infidelity and bad behavior becomes known to her. And that her reaction is basically a kind of fury that's like, fine, I'll stay married to you, but I'm going to make my own fucking life. And that this is part of the stuff out of which Eleanor Roosevelt's independent engagement with the world. And at that point, historic engagement with the world is born, is out of anger at Franklin in part and like, fuck you, I was going to do this. Like I was going to play one kind of role, but I'm not going to sit here. What, you know, that that's that's one version of the Eleanor Roosevelt trajectory. And I think about it sometimes with that Hillary version, too. I mean, when they when they got together, there's now a sort of revisionist history that both of them swear is true that when they first fell in love, Bill was like, no, you should run for office. You should run for office. There were lots of women when she was just out of law school who believed that Hillary Clinton should have become a politician in her own right when she was Hillary Rodham. And she she made the choice to go to Arkansas and put her political career. She was a badly miserable. Yes, of course. Of course she was. But that's just another interesting part of the story. One of the most the book, what happened is not very revealing at all, except there's just a few nuggets in it that are both well written and a little cracks. I mean, I don't want to put it pejoratively, but like there are just sort of flashes of of of of again, I don't want to say humanity, but like some deeper level of her that doesn't usually get displayed. One of them is actually this lovely sentence that she says about Chelsea about how she didn't realize she wanted a girl. And she says it was a secret, so secret, I didn't know myself. And that actually makes me like terrible, but what a lovely way to say it, right? Right. And then I can't remember the exact way she says about, oh, her writing my bills sort of stuff she said before, my best friend, my partner and all that. But when she's talking about his speech at the convention and how it was about their relationship, which I do remember kind of rolling my eyes out, but he's such a, he's so good. I know. So good. You know, like I remember kind of get carried away with it too. And she says how overwhelming, how overwhelmed with emotion she was. And it was like having a love letter read out loud. And that's, I was like, yeah, you know what, I get it. But then that moment I was like, I see why I see. I am one of those who really believes they love each other. And I, well, in that sentence to me, like for some reason, there's something about that moment where I'm like, I get it. Yeah, I understand. I mean, I, you know, love is complicated. Love is complicated. And you know what? Here's the other thing. And this is crucial to understanding anything about Hillary and this is not none of what none of what we're talking about. It doesn't even fall in a spectrum of like excusing or defending. It's just trying to contextualize so much of what I feel like I do when I write about women in politics or individual women, especially somebody like Hillary is trying to put this stuff in some context because we are in a world that is changing quickly and has changed quickly recently. And one of the most important things to understand about Hillary Rodham Clinton is that she was born in one era of possibility and she ran for president in a totally different world. And it is impossible to understand her in a contemporary context without considering the world in which she was born, which, you know, even for a woman, and that she still operates and is so clear that she still operates within that. Yes, frame. And, and, and it's hard to break how you're raised. Sure, sure. She, and, and even for a middle class, white, expensively educated woman, that the era she was born in the 1940s, it is in the midst of a post-war backlash, not, not just sort of post-war Norman Rockwell creation of the white middle class. It is also a feminist backlash at that moment. We never talk about that, but there had been this enormous expansion of possibility for women and for people of color. Thank you. Eleanor Roosevelt. Yeah. Yeah. Well, in part, and also thank you to the ladies. I mean, I wrote a book about single ladies. Like, thank you to the women who didn't marry at the end of the 19th century and instead opened colleges for women, opened the women's colleges, opened the historically black colleges for women. You had this period at the end of the 19th century, in the beginning of the 20th century that saw this enormous expansion of opportunity for women who wanted to get educations of political opportunity for women culminating with, in 1920, the passage of the 19th amendment that permitted women to vote, although, of course, black women in southern states still could not exercise that, but made some women to vote. Right. Permitted some women to vote. And, and then you have what was a massive backlash to that. Okay. And women started dropping out of colleges to marry the marital imperative, the early hetero marital imperative, especially for middle class white women who are the ones who had been the most threatening at the turn of the 20th century, because they'd been the ones who weren't marrying, who weren't having kids the way that they had been in past generations, who'd been getting college degrees. And in some cases, medical and legal degrees, those women were the closest to challenging white men for power. And there was a massive sort of multi-tentical approach to get them back into early hetero marriages. And in the middle of the 20th century, the early hetero marriage and women's economic, social and sexual dependence on that marriage as the institution that was going to contain and support them was tremendous. And Hillary Clinton was born in that era. My mother was also born in that era. Lots of our parents were born in that era. And the way that they felt about marriage is very different from the way that, for example, I feel about marriage. It is, it was there were degrees of, I think, dependence and kind of reverence for and fetishization of the institution that were just bred into you. That doesn't mean the word identity. Yes. Is I am a married person as an identity. I'm a married woman. Sorry. I'm a married woman as you getting your MRS degree. The one of the reasons why that's funny is because it doesn't have a husband attached to it. Right. Exactly. It's just right. It's just who you are is the married person. And in 1960, Gail Collins writes about this. I think it's a Barnard. If you graduated one engaged, you got a rose at your graduation ceremony or a party at your graduation ceremony. And if you were single, you got a lemon. OK, it was so something like 60% of female undergraduates are dropping out of the colleges that just a few decades ago had been open so that they could go to them, dropping out to get married by the middle of the 20th century. And that's the world in which Hillary Clinton gets married. And she is politicized, right? It matters that she keeps her name. It met for a while. It matters that she keeps her name in the 70s. It matters that she says no to marrying Bill several times, which happened. She turned him down three times and there was tremendous pressure. She was such an anomalous person, even as a young person. The first undergraduate ever asked to give the commencement address at Wellesley. The, I mean, that and she was, it was her classmates who pushed for it to happen. They viewed her as extraordinary in some way. She gives the commencement address. She, she gets this law degree. There is people move to there. There are women who, who change their lives to, to mentor this young woman who, even when she was young, they thought might be the first present woman, president of the United States. That was thing that was, those were things people thought about Hillary Rodham before she married Bill Clinton. And many of them were very angry at her. There's an incredible story about the woman who drives across the country with her to drop her off in Arkansas. She's decided she's going to go marry Bill, who's going to run for office in Arkansas. And the woman, she actually just died at a hundred this past year. The woman who was her mentor, who drove her cross country, spent the whole car ride begging her to not do this, do not throw away your future, do not do this. And she did it. She made the choice to marry this guy. And I think that the trying to look back through a contemporary lens and say, why didn't she leave him? And that doesn't mean like we can all think she should have left him. She should have left him. But I don't think that we can imagine what it's like to be in the head of, younger contemporary people can't quite imagine the mindsets around marriage. And we can also imagine the mindset about just because we started talking about this, her framework for understanding the accusations against Bill. Right. Right. Well, they're different, just different. And you don't have the vocabulary. Remember again, it's 91 when sexual harassment, the very kind of, again, I want to just distinguish like this is not excusing. Right. And I want to make that point too. It's just trying to contextualize. Thrive Market has all the top premium healthy and organic products that I usually get from a grocery store.

Some of the conversations we have now, it's not just about sexual harassment. It's about things like prison reform, criminal justice reform. They don't totally track with even the sort of raised consciousness of a 1990s, right? I don't, you know, those are the other parts of the book that are kind of frustrating when she talks about the chapter in the Mothers of the Movement, where she just conflates the Mothers of the Movement and Gabby Giffords campaign. And it's like she has no idea that she's doing a strange thing there. It's very, very odd, but she has no idea that she's just like, Oh, gun violence. It's all gun violence. Right. Well, this is and there are connections to be sure toxic masculinity in the police, toxic masculinity that causes white guys to shoot up things, but they're different problems. Right. And I don't think, I mean, but the other thing that we forget, I forget, and I'm going to say this and I may be wrong about it. I don't think that we started talking about the prison industrial complex until the late 90s. Is that I may be wrong? I may be saying something very wrong. I feel like I remember, you know, in my again, super radical college days, like the normal folks, the pro marijuana legalization people were talking about something like them. I don't know if they use the words mass incarceration. Right. But they were talking about the way that drug laws were being used to lock up right people. Right. And so that's my understanding of like, but I think that's about when that conversation starts. Yeah. Somebody should come and correct me on this because I'm just, you know, I have no idea, but I think it's the 90s. You should Google that for us right now. I think it's the, it is certainly not earlier than that. Right. Right. It is in the 90s as I don't, I don't think it is. Okay. I'm just, we're going to wait for the Google, but I do remember that there was the conversation around marijuana legalization. Definitely there was people, you marshaling evidence about drug laws. Right. There was an argument about the crime bill. There was an argument about the crime bill. And that's all another part of the book that's really frustrating because there was a very serious argument about it. It wasn't just like a compromise we had to make. There were people who like were like, you're going to wind up locking up lots of black people now. Right. Right. And I wish that we could just argue about her policies. That's what I wish. That is my fondest hope. Right. And we don't, I also wish we could argue about her policies, but I also wish that she didn't, and this is not about, it's not even necessarily about external pressure we put on her. It's about her choices too, to defend her husband's policies. Because sometimes when I think about that 90s legislation, she didn't write the crime bill. But she, but she chooses to go back. No, she chooses to own it. She chose to write about welfare reform. Now, there are a lot of people. That's in the book too. There are a lot of people. And it's been in past books. Look, in one of her past books, one of the things she does is she brags when it seemed like welfare reform, which of her had been a raging success. She, she, she, she, she compromised. Sorry. That's like her big thing about it. Right. She, in an earlier book, writes about how she'd rounded up votes for it. Now, contemporaneous reports say that she was actually pushing against welfare reform. But then there's a, while it was being debated, and the Edelman's, her mentor, Marion Wright Edelman and her husband, Peter Edelman, quit the Clinton administration during welfare reform because they understand what a disaster it's going to be. And Hillary is in, like she at that point knows that argument and her, the people she is most professionally and ideologically aligned with are making the opposing argument. And there are lots of people who claim that she was pushing against it within the White House. But then the creature that she is, right? The political creature that she is, when it seems like maybe welfare reform was well received, she then retroactively in an earlier book, even goes, goes and says, Oh, well, I was rounding up votes for it. I'm not sure that was true that she was rounding up votes for it. Well, boy, it maybe was, but there's a sort of public, this is how we got to part of how she wound up again, sort of handed the bill for a lot of legislation that her husband and Joe Biden, who during the election was a sitting vice president and hadn't had to answer for a lot of this, including having chaired the Senate judiciary for Anita Hill, including having written the crime bill, including having voted for welfare reform, how even Bernie Sanders who voted for the crime bill, though he's been more public about saying, explaining why and being, and regretting it and regretting it. Absolutely. But a lot of it landed on Hillary. And I'm not exactly saying it's unfair because she did seek it out. She's fought those battles since they've happened, but she was also the person who wasn't in elected office, who wasn't actually crafting the legislation and creating the mechanisms that were going to imprison more black people. Right. Although it's funny, because one of the other things about her book that I did just finish, which is why it's like just a topic in my mind. And I haven't read it in a couple months. Whenever it came out, I read it. She comes out in favor of the system. Like that is like she is a fan of the system. She's an institutionalist. She is a she is oh boy, howdy. She is not a revolutionary. Which is actually why she's weird. Like her Wellesley speech is actually very revolutionary, very radical and talks about how we shouldn't be slaves to corporate interests and right that don't know what happened. But I think no, I think that Wellesley speech is about changing from within to agitating from within the system. It's not about blowing up the system. And I and I write it's about. She says something about we shouldn't let corporations like in slave us. I don't know if she's worse in slave, but there's an anti corporatist bent to a couple of the lines in there that struck me given who she is. But you're right, it isn't about throwing off the chains. Right. It's it's about how we resist internally and how we make small and criminal changes. But yeah, she's an incrementalist. She's an institutionalist. And she believes that these systems will steer us in the best direction. And now we have different language and different ideas about that that allow us to be suspect of the system itself. Right. Like we, you know, in having gone through more philosophical debates than she has actively participated in. Now see the problem with saying you need to work in the system. Like we're like, Oh, well, if you if you work within that system, you're going to get the same results. Right. So you need to rethink the system itself. And she's like, no, the system, the system is the system. Right. The system is good. So there's actually like a part in the book where she talks about like how she fell in love with basic like the system, how like working for the Children's Defense Fund. She's like, and you wrote papers and you got witnesses and you made laws. And I'm like, do you understand why the Black Lives Matter people don't trust you? This is why they don't trust you. And also she that that scene, there's a scene in the book that breaks one's heart because she's talking to Black Lives Matter people and she's like, you need to work within the system. I know that will. That's it. I've seen that that's the thing there's the video of. Do you remember? I mean, that's right. I remember watching that conversation and being like, I mean, no, no, this she has Hillary. It's who she is. And it's just in it. She is in a weird way. Like right? All the ironies here. She is in a weird way, very conservative. She's absolutely she's a temperamentally conservative person. Yes. And doesn't like change. That probably also if we're going to do pops psychology armchair psychology about her. Another reason why she didn't leave belt and just pure. I don't want to do that because that is a big change that I do not feel good about making. Yeah, she's very I would I don't know if I would say she doesn't like change, but I think she's very slow to change. Like, I, you know, I I won't put it in like her. Don't like I think she's temperamentally conservative. I agree. And she needs to have good reasons to change. Right. Make changes in her life. Make changes in her ideas and right. I think that I think that that is probably very fair. And I don't know, you know, the reasons why she didn't leave bill, man. I don't know. They're going to do a whole separate podcast series. God, I really appreciate you coming in. In part, because the reason why I wanted to do a special episode about Hillary is that I do have such trouble knowing what my own feelings are about her. Because I don't feel fervent, you know, admiration. But I also very clearly see the sexism that is used against her. And I also know that my own brain is talk about systems. I know that I the lenses that I see through have been shaped by patriarchy. All of ours have. So I don't quite trust my own opinion about her as a person. Right. You know, I know enough about myself to be like the fact that she turns me off in some weird way. Right. Right. Maybe because I'm internalized. Right. This is like how I like would hide under the couch when she spoke too loudly into a microphone, even though I knew perfectly well that like it was about a register of a certain kind of voice that I was reacting to. I'm like the I am the feminist writer who covers Hillary Clinton. I get the thing about women's loud voices versus men's loud voices. And yet I was like, stop talking into the microphone. So, okay, yes. And here's my, I mean, look, I've written about her now for more than a decade. I've thought so much about her. I've now post-election, actually spent a fair amount of time with her, which I, which was not true up until 2016. I did, you know, and then I did one profile of her during the election and then one lengthy one in this post-election year where I wound up spending a good deal of time with her. And here's the thing with me. I have tremendous admiration for her, just tremendous admiration for her. That doesn't mean that I don't share probably many of your qualms. The way that I think about that, though, is I try to compare it to how I feel about other politicians or leaders, many of whom I have like a whole variety of like warm feelings, admiration, respect, but about almost all of them, I also have serious qualms or things that I don't like about their past records or about their approach or their strategy or what they're willing to do to win. Like I actually, that's like a totally normal set of feelings. That's how one, what I was about to say is like, that's how one feels about politicians. But of course, the adjective missing there is that is how one feels about male. Right. Well, politics, right. And we don't need that adjective historically because most of them men, right? And so it's not like, for example, like John Kerry, not one of my favorite politicians. I voted for him with a song in my heart and like my middle finger raised at George Bush. You're a better person than I am. I was actually not excited about voting for him. Right. Well, no, I was excited about voting for him. I voted for Nader. That's why. Because I lived in DC. I lived in DC where my way it's going to go like 90% carry anyway. Again, like my punk rock history, little ractionary, like, no, no, no, no, this is right. Anyway, and my politics were so to the left of John Kerry. My politics have been to the left of literally everybody I think I've ever voted for. Right. And so about all of them, I have felt major qualms. I did not like John Kerry. I thought he made so many errors. I thought he had so many flaws, but that did not differentiate him in my mind, not only from like Michael Dukakis or Bill Clinton or other people I'd voted for. It also didn't differentiate him in my mind from Franklin Roosevelt, a man for whom I have tremendous admiration or, you know, from any number of past progressive heroes who Ted Kennedy, like who I also understand, not just personal stuff, but like Franklin Roosevelt imprisoned the Japanese and he is one strike against him. It's a strike against him, right? It is not incompatible in my mind that I might and the new deal policies who he put badly damaged people of color in this country. Like, and I know those things and I still admire. And if I think about economic policy that I want the left in this country to aspire to, I still think of the new deal. I still think of Franklin Roosevelt. It is not incompatible for me to deeply admire Franklin Roosevelt and also to feel that he made errors, which like to say their flaws is to is to under examine exactly how bad these things were, right? So to me, the idea that I might simultaneously tremendously admire Hillary for all kinds of reasons and be critical of her is doesn't differentiate my feelings about her in my mind to how I feel about lots of other politicians, who I had many of whom I admire less. But you know, nonetheless, I've never sat around and talked about their flaws as much as I sit around and talk about Hillary's flaws, you know? And that's helpful because I guess I can say, I can revise and extend my remarks, which is to say that I do admire things about her. I see that. And like the book in one of the ways it's infuriating is it does remind one of all of the things that she is good at. And one of them is making an argument. The argument is, I've joked, I wrote a little, I wrote a blurb for about the book for signs, the feminist journal. Oh, yes. Yes, I'm familiar with signs. I've done that myself. Yeah. And I said it should be called What Should Have Happened? Because it's basically another argument for her as president. And it's a great argument. Well, she would have been a good press. She's my, my, so I want to say is like, so one of the reasons why the book is infuriating though is because I'm like, I guess you are correct. You, Hillary Clinton, are correct. You would have been a great president. But at the same time, like I do have all these mixed feelings. But part of me wants to say that in your argument, I think, or what your time is like, we let these two kinds of feelings about other politicians exist without debating them. Yeah. We don't, we don't, we don't, like, oh, God, FDR so problematic. We don't have a national discussion about it. FDR, maybe we should, but we don't have a national discussion. We don't even, we don't have it about Joe Biden. Like we don't have, you know, although maybe we should. Well, maybe I don't know where I come out. Like, should we take everybody apart the way we take apart Hillary Clinton or should we get over it and get behind somebody? I don't know. I'm actually not, I don't know where I stand on that. All right. And so I understand what you're saying. And that's, I think that it's going to help me just personally in the future. To be just be like, you know what? My feelings are complicated and just live with that. But there's a part of me that also feels like, I appreciate a lot that has come out of some of these conversations that we've had about her. That she has been the catalyst for conversations that maybe we should have been having all along. Yes. That she is a historic figure in ways that she probably cannot quite comprehend. And that we may not even in our lifetimes, but I suspect, I mean, my suspicion, if we survive, and honestly, there are a lot, I'm sort of not joking. No, no, we survive as a democracy. My suspicion is that a, this is all going to look really different in about 75 years. But right. And that b, I suspect that if we do do the kind of change we need to do as far as getting something closer to a representative democracy. Hillary Clinton is going to be understood. And this is not to make, this is not to lionize her or whitewash her or anything like that. But I think the role she's played, she has absorbed so much of the shit that the first woman president was going to absorb. And it's a shock, by the way, that it was her to begin with and not like Margaret Thatcher, American, right? Like, it's an amazing thing that this was not Liddy Dole. It's amazing that this was not a conservative, comfortable Republican. And our first woman president may indeed be Nikki Haley, right? So, I mean, that is what I always assumed. If you'd asked me in high school, when I was holding that Anita Hill sign, I probably would have told you it was going to be Liddy Dole. Right. Right. And it was always, I thought it was always going to be a conservative Republican, you know. So it's shocking that it was Hillary Clinton to begin with. And I think she's done a lot of the work of being the first woman president. The sad thing is, the thing she would have actually been good at was the job of being president. I mean, we would have been sitting here complaining about what she was not doing right now with policies, like whatever. I would have loved to have been sitting here. Yeah, I mean, conversation. Totally. But in fact, the actual doing the job, she would have been great. She would have been great. She was terrible at getting the job. She's a terrible candidate, period. But she's always been a good, she's been a terrible job candidate and excellent at the job. I mean, maybe she's a good job candidate as a lawyer and stuff too. But anyway, I understand what you're saying. But I think, so the grim irony is we didn't even get the good part, which is her actually being the president. But I think she will have done a lot of the work of clearing some of the hurdles for whoever does become the first woman president. And I think it's possible, and coming right after this past election day, and I don't want to get over dramatic about it because there's a fuckload still to do. We've learned our lesson. Right. But a little bit about predicting from, we've learned our lesson, there's no predictions. But let's just look at Tuesday. And what you see, and it's the comparative moment is again, I need a hill in 92, what you see is a lot of women and people of color and people who are angry about power imbalances that were made invisible. Right. And a lot of people who were angered by power imbalances that 2016 made so visible to us, responding by not just yelling, but like presenting themselves as the power alternative. And on Tuesday, many of them winning and actually shifting power. And if that happens, and I don't, I'm not looking to say like, 2018, it's all ladies, like, I'm not saying that. I don't think it's going to be that simple or that quick. But I think you've, you know, you were reading about the numbers of women who have expressed interest in running for office. And that also brings us back to the sexual harassment conversation, where we started, which is the only way to actually change this shit is to revise the power structures that until now have been so suffocating white and male. And so if all of this that's happening now, all of this Trump and the harassment and the abuse and the predation and election and Hillary, if what it gets us to not next week, not 2018, but as a long term investment is a revision of that power structure in which we look more like the representative democracy, we imagine ourselves to be. I think we will look back and see Hillary Clinton and her candidacy is absolutely instrumental to that revision and that shift, which is ideally what those of us who want to make the country better are aiming for. And that is it for the show. It has been quite a week. I believe this is the first week I have closed the show without wondering how I'm going to get through the weekend. There were some very good news this week, and I want everyone to remember that. I also want everyone, if you are listening now, you are a super fan, you qualify as a super fan, so please go to iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts and rate and review us. It helps other people find the show and it boosts my ego because it gets us up in the rankings. It makes me feel less, less than. If you want to be in touch with the pod, you can follow us on Twitter at cricket underscore friends. And next week we probably will get back to answering listener questions. So please, if you have a question that has to do with relationships and politics or politics and relationships, please send it to us at with friends like pod at Gmail. And if you want to include an audio version of the question, that would be great. But if you don't, that is also fine. And that is it for the show. Please, have a good weekend."
