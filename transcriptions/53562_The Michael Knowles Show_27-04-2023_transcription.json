    "text": " Despite the nationwide backlash against Bud Light, Dylan Mulvaney has just received another endorsement deal, this time from Maybelline. Here it is, Mr. Mulvaney looking like a dude, and then he puts the makeup on, and he looks like a dude trying to look like Audrey Hepburn. He does his cheering, and unlike Bud Light, which caters primarily to frat boys and construction workers, Maybelline makes some sense as a Mulvaney advertiser. Yes, Mulvaney's ideology is opposed by the vast majority of Americans, but Maybelline makeup is intended to make people look different than they otherwise should. Sure, the company seems to be taking its tagline a little bit far. Maybe she's born with it, maybe it's Maybelline. In this case, it's all Maybelline. It's entirely Maybelline. I Dylan Mulvaney is definitely not born with it. Sure. Okay. Why? Why are they doing this? Because the establishment has spoken. Transgenderism is here to stay, whether it's profitable or not, whether the people want it or not. The scariest part of these campaigns is not what they say about gender or the corporations, but what they say about self-government. Our ruling class is in agreement, and so for now at least, that's the way things are going to be. I'm Michael Knowles, this is The Michael Knowles Show. Welcome back to the show. A lot of companies are cashing in on the backlash against Budlight, against Maybelline, against Olay. Watch companies, beer companies, conservatives following the Jeremy's Razor's model, which we will get to in just a second. First though, it's not just some corporations, it's not just Disney and Budlight and KitchenAid and Maybelline. It's the Biden administration all the way up to the White House. The Biden administration is now wielding the DOJ to double down on transing the kids. Joe Biden's DOJ is challenging the Tennessee law that says you can't cast straight little kids and pump them full across sex hormones. You can't trans vulnerable children. Biden's DOJ says, oh yes, you will. We are not going to let the people of Tennessee through their elected representatives stop the transing of the kids. We are going to challenge the Tennessee law that bans what the White House calls critically, medically necessary care for transgender youth. Forget about transing the kids for a second. Forget about the whole ideology of transgenderism. Just think about what this says about self-government. The only conclusion here that we can draw is that this White House and the whole political class that it represents, they don't feel they need to answer to the people. Pure research shows that 60% of Americans reject the ideology of transgenderism, period. A far greater number of Americans oppose transing poor little kids. Doesn't matter according to Joe Biden. They are going to double down on this. Why? Why would the White House, especially at a time where approval ratings are so low? Joe Biden's got these historical approval ratings, disapproval ratings rather. He's heading into a reelection campaign. Why would they double down on this? The only plausible answer is that they don't feel they have to answer to the people. They control enough of the power centers in the media and the schools and the administrative state. And the way elections are conducted perhaps, that they just don't think they have to answer for this. And so they're going to do whatever their ideology tells them to do. Public opinion, common sense, right reason, be damned. Speaking of Joe Biden, Joe Biden has been a declared candidate for reelection for now about 32 hours by my count. And he is already lying up and down the campaign trail. Here's a new one from Joe Biden. You thought you heard all of his lies about his academic record, about his professional record, about how his dad loved watching men kiss in the street back in Scranton or something, about his family, about his children, about his whole record. About growing up in the black church, about corn pop and hairy legs at the local pool. Well, now we got a new one. It involves not Joe Biden's father, but Joe Biden's grandfather. Think about it this way. My grandpa, who I never met, he died in the same hospital I was born in two weeks before I was born. Wow, think about it this way. I grew up in small town America. Good old family tradition. Good old Scranton Joe. The story that Joe Biden is telling is irrelevant to the point here. The point being he completely made that up. None of that ever happened. Joe Biden's grandpa, who he didn't know died in not in Scranton, but in Baltimore, Maryland. And he died in September 1941. Joe Biden wasn't born until November 1942 in a different town and a different state. The whole thing was just made up. Who cares? Who cares that Joe Biden's flubbing some story from 80 years ago? I care because it tells me that this guy can't tell the difference between lies and the truth. This is what happens when you are a habitual liar, as Joe Biden is. Politicians tell lies a lot. Joe Biden tells more lies than most politicians. He's particularly egregious in this regard. And the fear of this is not just that you're going to deceive one person or even a lot of people on just one issue or two issues. If you've ever known a liar, I mean a real habitual liar like Joe Biden. You'll know the craziest part is that after a while, even they can't tell the difference between lies and the truth. It's not that Joe Biden is setting out to deceive people. He says, oh, yes. I'm going to fool them all today with this story about my grandpa in 1942. It's not that even he sincerely believes this really happened. Maybe he does. Maybe he doesn't. It's just that he doesn't care. The truth means nothing to Joe Biden. And so with a president like that, for people who have grown up with an ideology that lends itself to that kind of behavior, is it any wonder that they'll double down on the lie that a man can be a woman? That they'll double down on the lie that castrating children is really good for them. It really improves their health. That they'll double down on the lie that a baby isn't really a baby. That they'll double down on the lie that foreign nationals are actually American citizens sort of in some way. That they'll double down on lie after lie after lie. No, because they just don't care about the truth. It doesn't look good. Okay. When people do this sort of thing. Now, when you want to look good, you got to check out GenuSell.

Some really doesn't look good in politics and media is that Fox News fired Tucker Carlson. The political world is still reacting to this. The top rated cable host, not just these days, but ever of all time, fired totally unexpectedly at the very height of his power. People are trying to figure out what motivated it. Is it the Dominion lawsuit? That doesn't really make sense because other hosts on Fox, went much further in their claims of election fraud than Tucker Carlson did. Why do they still have their jobs and Tucker doesn't? Well, is it that, I don't know, Tucker has a sexual harassment suit or something like that coming, kind of like Bill O'Reilly. No, there's not been one peep about anything like that. That would be completely out of character for Tucker. Totally shocking. Well, I don't know. Is it that Tucker just chose to leave? No, Tucker signed off his show on Friday telling people see on Monday. So Tucker thought he still had his show the following week. It was a story that came out of Vanity Fair. She talked about it a little bit yesterday, which is that Rupert Murdoch, head of news corporation, apparently had a dinner with his then-fianc\u00e9 and her favorite host, Tucker Carlson, in which the then-fianc\u00e9 brought out a Bible. She said, oh, Tucker, I think you're a messenger from God. I just love your show. I think you're really standing up for the right thing. You're standing up for God. Then Tucker, well, then Rupert Murdoch apparently broke off this engagement shortly after that dinner. And then Tucker gave a speech on Friday night or Saturday night, sometime over the weekend, at the Heritage Foundation, 50th anniversary dinner, in which he said, I no longer believe that our political fight is between one white paper and another white paper, both parties seeking the same ends. I'm now beginning to think this is a clearer fight between good and evil. And so I, even being an episcopalian, a fairly shallow tradition these days, I recommend you all take 10 minutes out of your day to say a prayer. And according to the news reports, according to Vanity Fair, that's what got Tucker fired. The fact that he said in a big speech that people should pray, that was a bridge too far. And so what do I know? I've been on Fox a lot of times, but I've never worked for Fox News. I don't know Rupert Murdoch. It seems so crazy that it also would seem to me to be the most plausible explanation. It's so absurd. It's so ridiculous that in this fallen world that is governed by the principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in high places, in this fallen world, in which you're not allowed to read the Bible in schools, but you can be assigned gay porn in schools, including elementary schools. In this crazy clown world we're living in, that to me seemed like the most plausible explanation. And our friend Glenn Beck seems to be backing that up. Glenn obviously worked at Fox for a long time. It was a very highly rated host over there. And he said from what he knows of Rupert Murdoch, the story rings true. This is something that bothers Rupert deeply, deeply bothers him. I was told not to use the word God on the air anymore. And I was like, wow. Okay. And they're like, you know, you have to stop using it. And three months go by and he comes back and he says, do you know how many times did you do you not remember when I said don't talk about God all the time? And I said, yes. And he said, you know how many times you've said God on the air? Since that? I looked at him and I kind of laughed and I said, you counted. And he said, I can't remember the number, but it was like 91 times. I'm like, huh. Now stop it. Okay. Well, I didn't. But that really bothered them. That really bothered them. Rupert doesn't like that. Isn't that kind of weird? Isn't that kind of weird that according now to a Fox source and according to Glenn Beck, who has plenty of experience at Fox News and who is going on the record with this, that the head of not just the allegedly conservative news channel, but much of conservative media really doesn't want you talking about God. Without God, what are we conserving? What is conservatism? What is the right without God? When these terms came about the right and the left, what did they refer to? They referred to two sides of the National Assembly in the early days of the French Revolution. On the left side of the assembly, you had the radicals who opposed the political order and who opposed the church and who opposed God. And then on the right side of the aisle, you had the people who supported political order and justice and the church and God, people who supported throne and altar. In America, now, long after the French Revolution, American conservatives, what are we supposed to be defending justice? We're supposed to be defending a prosperous flourishing country. We want a strong economy. But more than that, don't we want family values? Don't we want to defend faith? Don't we want to defend what's right? Don't we want to defend God? God doesn't need us to defend him, but it would be good for us to be on God's side. If you got a pick, I would recommend be on God's side. A nation that turns away from God doesn't turn out very well. And the men who founded our country, going back even before the American Revolution, going back all the way to 1620 in the Mayflower and Massachusetts colony, they viewed America as a shining city on a hill. It's a Christian country that would look toward God. We have in God we trust on our money. And in the head of the conservative media, at least the traditional conservative media, he says, don't talk about God. We're going to fire our top-rated host. If he talks about God, it's pretty weird. So it's almost as if we always knew the conservatives were outnumbered in terms of the power centers. We thought, well, at least we've got this one cable channel. Well, at least we've got this one media corporation. I don't know if we can't talk about God, then we don't have that power center. And it is simply not conservative. Tucker's right. Tucker's speech was right. Increasingly, our politics appears not to be a debate between the most efficient or prudent means to achieve the good ends that we all agree to. It just increasingly seems to be a fight between good and evil. You want to see one of the creepiest videos you'll see in a while? It's not a trans thing, I promise. I know that all the creepy videos these days are transgender activists doing all sorts of weird stuff. This is actually creepier. This is an Arizona state representative, Stephanie Stahl Hamilton from Tucson. She was caught on camera going into the house members only lounge at the Arizona state Capitol and hiding Bibles. I guess there are some Bibles out in this lounge. Probably a good thing for legislators to refer to. The most important book in the history of our civilization. The book that I believe is the inerrant word of God. But even if you don't believe in that, certainly you think it's an important book and that lays out the law, the moral law, from which we write our civil law. I was out there if people want to read the Bible. They're not being forced to read the Bible, but then this Democrat goes in. You just very creepily picks up these Bibles and hides them under a chair. Hide some, I don't know, behind a desk, but just so people can't read them anymore. A reporter confronted her about this. A reporter tried to get a statement. This woman's office totally stonewalled the reporter. A reporter goes up and says, hey, okay, I'm glad I caught you state rep. Why are you hiding the Bibles? Stephanie, not very nice to hang up on me. Just a simple question. Why do you want to talk? It's just a simple question. Why would you hide the Bible? Let me think about hiding Bibles. You're caught on video. It's a very simple question, Stephanie. Stephanie, you're an ordained minister. Why would you hide the Bible, Stephanie? Did you catch that part at the end? He says to the state rep, Stephanie, you're an ordained minister, which I don't know what weird cult this lady isn't ordained minister in. I don't, certainly not the traditional church, but I don't know. She's a priestess, I guess, in some strange cult, but whatever cult she's in, she doesn't seem to like the Bible very much. She doesn't seem to like the word of God very much. And regardless of her side hustle in some new age cult, this woman is a representative of the people in Arizona. And so the press comes up. Remember, the liberals have told us that the press, they're the fourth estate. They're the brave, intrepid journalists who speak truth to power. They're the most wonderful people in the world, except when they have questions that are inconvenient for the Democrats. She says, I don't want to talk to you. I don't go away. I don't want to talk to you. Stephanie, just a simple question. Why are you hiding Bibles at the Capitol? I was said anything about that. Well, I just said it because we have you on video doing it. Bye. Good. Good. See you. Bye. It's really weird. And it really seems to prove Tucker's point. It's some periods of politics. Things are kind of normal and people basically agree. We've had moments of this kind of a consensus in American history, not even all that long ago. And so the two parties aren't all that different and it's easy to work across the aisle. And sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between a Republican and a Democrat. Because listen, we all salute the same flag and we all pray to the same God and we all love our country. We're not in one of those times right now. We don't salute the same flag. The conservative salute, the store spangled banner, the libs salute, the rainbow, which is increasingly gaining colors seemingly by the hour. We don't pray to the same God. Conservatives pray to God. Liberals pray to, I don't know, to Gaia. Liberals pray to Reiki and crystals and astrology. And the trans-nosticism and sometimes explicitly to the devil. You see a lot of devil imagery today. And at the very least they pray to themselves, the cult of the self. And we don't all really love the same country. Conservatives certainly speak in a way that is patriotic. But the libs don't really, right? The libs say that America was founded as an evil country and read the 1619 projects It tells you the country was founded to preserve slavery. And even though that's not true, we're still going to publish it. We're going to put it in schools. It is an evil, terrible country. We got to erase the borders, get rid of the country entirely. In that framework, you can't just kind of work together and reach across the aisle. In that framework, someone's got to win and someone's got to lose. You can't meet in the middle. We've talked now for a few weeks, really, I guess, since my CPAC speech, about how on some issues you can find a conciliatory middle ground, on some issues you can't because you'll just end up splitting the baby. And that's no good to anybody. On some issues that involve mutually contradictory principles, you've got to pick a side. You can't be lukewarm or you will be spit out. No one will want you at all. Now, I know that when you hold a barbecue for your friends, they're not going to spit out that food. It's going to be delicious. But to have that barbecue, you've got to have a full propane tank.

Don't miss what they'll do to host Jake Crane if they hit a hundred thousand subscribers during the stream. Speaking of sports, Mayor Pete, Transportation Secretary Pete, he has had it with all this talk about transgenderism in sports. Okay. Mayor Pete, he's got a lot of important work to do. And all this talk about how men shouldn't be put on the women's sports teams, well that's preventing him from building bridges. Well, I do think that the culture wars are getting in the way sometimes. I mean, just the other day I was testifying in the Appropriations Subcommittee explaining how our budget was going to help with things like railroad safety, air traffic control and other transportation needs. And we had to take a break so that they could all go and vote on a bill to kick transgender teenagers off of sports teams. That was the priority for the House GOP that day. So these things really are getting in the way of our ability to get work done. They're literally building bridges and they're literally banning books. Ha ha, yeah. The other day I was testifying about all the things that I've implausibly screwed up as Secretary of Transportation. It's the easiest job in the whole government and I somehow managed to blow it. So we were talking about all the trendy railments under my watch and all of the many supply chain problems and just everything that possibly could have gone wrong, going wrong, under my watch. And then we had to take a break so that these terrible Republicans could go and protect women and young girls from getting concussions because they're being forced to compete against burly men on the volleyball team and well on the track team and on all sorts of teams where the men are then taking their trophies and scholarships. Ha ha. Can you imagine that? I can't imagine that. And then I had to take a two month break so I could go chest feet. Ha ha. Oh wow. Wow, that's amazing, Mayor Pete. You sound really, really busy. But I don't know. I guess I've got a little more hope and confidence in the government. Seems to me that the Congress can protect the rights of women and girls while at the same time you run the train tracks and the roads and the bridges without all of them collapsing. I don't know. Call me crazy. I think we can do that. I think it's even easier than walking and chewing gum at the same time. Maybe not for Mayor Pete. We can't build bridges anymore because the Republicans are protecting young girls. What are you talking about? The government does a lot of things. We've got a foreign policy that Biden's screwing up. We have an economy that Biden destroyed. We've got borders that Biden fails to secure. We've got, okay, you're right. I guess this administration can't do much of anything at all. But other administrations have dealt with these issues. They do lots of different things at different times. It's not very convincing that you can't build bridges while protecting girls. It's a deflection and Buttigieg has to deflect here. Buttigieg realizes that the best course of action on the transgender issue is deflection. This is why my debate opponent at the University of Pittsburgh debate sponsored by ISI. This is why he pulled out at the very last minute. It's because he's got all sorts of fancy degrees. He's probably the most erudite best educated person in the country to debate this issue. He realized at the last moment that even he, with all that fancy academic background, had no argument. He had to withdraw from the debate. He had to concede before the debate took place rather than lose in front of C-SPAN's cameras. Nobody will debate this issue. ISI at that point reached out to something like a dozen pro-trans libs. None of them would come on. We finally got a guy who identifies as a right-wing or Brad Palumbo to defend a far more moderate position than was initially supposed to be the topic of the debate. There's no one who adopts the pro-trans view. No one, like the Biden administration, who is going further and saying, we need to trans the kids, we need to stop states from protecting kids against the trans procedures. No one can actually defend it. So there's no intellect left in that debate. It's all pure will. It's all pure slate of hand. It's all, hey, look over there at that bridge. Hey, come on. Don't pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. Yep, that's right. Now, speaking of the culture war issues, Nikki Haley, running for president, certainly in the more moderate lane of the GOP, Nikki was just on Fox News. She was asked about Disney, which has been under fire, for transing the kids, for opposing a Florida law that would make it harder for people to trans the kids. Nikki's answer is raising a lot of eyebrows. This is obviously dramatically escalating the feud between Disney and Ron DeSantis. They're alleging that the Republican governor has waged a quote, relentless campaign to weaponize government power over the company. What is your reaction to that as we still have yet to see him jump officially into the race? You know, as governor, I took a double digit unemployment state and I turned it into an economic powerhouse. Businesses were my partners because if you take care of your businesses, you take care of your economy, your economy takes care of the people and everyone wins. And so that's the way we dealt with it. We are, South Carolina was a very anti-woke state. It still is. And if Disney would like to move their hundreds of thousands of jobs to South Carolina and bring the billions of dollars with them, I'll let them know. I'll be happy to meet them in South Carolina and introduce them to the governor and the legislature that would welcome it. Everyone is saying this is a huge mistake and this is the defining moment of Haley's campaign and she's totally toast now. I don't agree with that analysis. Yes. And Nikki just articulated a very unpopular stance. It's a stance that is out of step with where the GOP is right now. I don't think the GOP wants to hear about how these woke corporations should be invited into our states to bring a lot of jobs and money and drive the economy. I think the GOP wants to hear more about how politicians are going to throw their power around to bully the corporations into cutting out their unjust practices such as transing the kids, trying to overturn laws passed by the people's representatives to stop transing the kids. Okay, I agree with that part of it, but I'm not convinced this is a huge mistake for Nikki. Nikki is running in the more moderate lane. Nikki is running in the business-republican kind of lane. Let's just focus on the economy. Let's pay a little less attention to these culture war issues. It's probably her best lane in this race. If Nikki tries to compete on wielding the government to wage the culture war and she's trying to compete against Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump, she's going to come up short. We're in a really weird year where a one-term incumbent is running for reelection. Even if she were just running against Trump, a brash cultural figure, she and everyone else would come up short. But especially you've got her running against Ron DeSantis, who is the subject here, who is wielding the government specifically against Disney. She's got to give herself some differentiation. I don't know what the calculus was from the campaign or from Nikki herself, but just looking at this as an observer, I think what she's saying is, okay, political wins can change. Right now, we're in a moment where the GOP base really wants to wield the government, really wants to hit these corporations. But wins might change. Political wins have changed more quickly at other times in history. If that happens and if Trump falters and if DeSantis falters, then I am going to be over here as an alternative candidate. Does that mean that Nikki is suddenly going to jump up in the polls and is going to become the favorite to win the White House? No, but from where she stands in the race, I'm not convinced this is the worst position to adopt. It's just an alternative if things change dramatically. Now, speaking of Ron DeSantis, Ron DeSantis is doubling down on his position, which is now we got to bring Disney into line. He says, there's nothing conservative about deferring to corporations. I just think as conservatives, it's not conservative to just simply defer to every corporation in America. That's being a corporatist. And so when I have to look and see in the state of Florida, are we being governed appropriately? Are we advancing the rule of law? And I have to take on a company like Disney. A corporatist would say that you have to give Disney everything at once. Well, in reality, Disney was enjoying unprecedented privileges and subsidies. They controlled their own government in central Florida. They were exempt from laws that virtually everybody else had to follow. They had great tax breaks. They were even able to rack up debt. No single entity or individual in the state of Florida enjoyed such privileges. And that's not good government. That's not free enterprise. But it's certainly even worse when a company takes all those privileges that have been bestowed over many, many decades and uses that to wage war on state policy regarding families and children. This is where the conservatives are right now. This is where the Republicans are right now. I also happen to think this is the correct approach. What DeSantis is saying is, look, it's not that we hate business. It's not that we want to destroy the economy. We just want to put business in its proper place. And there's a tradition of this critique on the right. This is not a totally new idea. You might say that Ron DeSantis is a business second Republican. He's not a business first Republican. He's a business second Republican. Yeah, you want thriving businesses for the end of a good flourishing society. There's a famous essay by Irving Crystal, the better Crystal. And the far superior Crystal, compared to his son Bill Crystal, and Irving Crystal had an essay called Two Cheers for Capitalism. Not, not quite three cheers, but two cheers. We want a thriving economy. We want prosperity. We want people to have their material needs taken care of. But we don't want to worship Mammon. We don't want to pretend that political society is simply to serve the economy and to serve GDP. And the corporations can do no wrong even when they want to trans the kids. No. Two cheers for capitalism. Business second. America first, really God first. And if you put God first, then you're going to have a healthy sense of patriotism. You're going to have a strong support for your family, a love of your community, and the basic building block of your political community, which is your family. And patriotism is an extension of that filial piety that you have. And all of this flows one from the other. But then when you start to get these things out of order, and you say, no, actually my family is just a kind of an economic unit. And our country, it's really just a space where a bunch of producers and worker bees and consumers all happen to live together so that we can tick up that GDP. And that's all that matters and forget about the culture. Then things start to go a little bit haywire in stores all across America.

My favorite comment yesterday is from Derek who says, so the London marathon turned out to be a drag race. Do you get it? We got a lot of Henny Youngman one liners today, don't we? It's a good line. I left. I lolled. And speaking of the transgender issue and the economy and private industry, it's a story I was meaning to get to a little bit earlier. I'm glad we have a little time to get to it now. Are you familiar with Eggard watches? Probably you're not. It's a relatively small watch company. Well, they just over the last week or two put out an ad for their watches. I love watches. Watch is a pretty simple thing though. Tell us a time. What is the ad about yet has nothing to do with watches and everything to do with our culture? When I was a little girl, I had this dream that seemed so impossible. I was going to be the fastest runner in the world. Hey, I knew a world record. I got this little nugget of an idea from my dad. He used to watch me run and say, ain't no woman alive that can be true. I was working hard. I believed him. He made me feel. I had a goal that I wanted to achieve. It wasn't easy. I trained harder than anyone else I know. All right, girl power, right? That's supposed to be the conclusion. I was an unstoppable force. A life dedicated to perfection. Perfection. These watches. You can have this perfection. But even perfection wouldn't be enough. Oh, wait a minute. Transgender woman who last year competed as a man wins the NCAA track. Leah Thomas, this dude wins the women's history one spot. Fallon Fox, how many skulls need to be cracked by transgender and hashtag erased. A guard watches. That's quite a turn. It starts out like a normal aspirational ad strength, courage, determination by our product. Very standard. But then it's strength, courage, determination. It really matter if we're living in a system of injustice that allows men to pummel women figuratively and literally in sports by our watches. There's not even a tie in. They could have had a tie in, which is we know what time it is here at A guard watches or or even a tie in to timing the track. They don't need to do that. A guard is selling their opposition to leftism, transgenderism, wokeism, liberalism, all those isms that you don't like. And it's persuasive. If I were in the market to buy one of these watches and I were debating between a company that either wanted to trans the kids certainly or even a company that were kind of silent on this and A guard watches and I basically like the designs all the same. I would totally pick A guard watches. Right now if I am forced to drink some crappy light beer because I don't know they ran out of mango white claw or something at the bar and I've got to pick between Bud Light and almost any other beer company, I'm going to pick almost any other beer company. Even though in the past I previously would have ordered Bud Light. Not even because I like it that much just because it's there. It's easy. It's cheap. College parties, just the main use I think of Bud Light. And so they're done. I am done giving my money to corporations that hate me and that want to pursue policies that are not just stupid and inefficient but downright evil. I'm done with that. I know it's difficult to totally stop doing that because in our economy everything is so intertwined that you are going to many times during a day have to participate with companies that are doing this sort of thing. But in as much as we have a conscious choice, in as much as we see it in a commercial, yeah I'm done with that and I think a lot of other people are too. You saw this recently a conservative social media influencer came out after Bud Light and he said I'm launching my own beer company. It sounds a little bit familiar by the way. Bud Light has been drinking beer from a company that doesn't even know which restroom to use. That's why I created conservative dads ultra right, 100% woke free beer. As conservatives we're constantly getting hit in the face left and right by the woke mind virus. But the last place we want it is in our beer. If you know which bathroom to use you know what beer you should be drinking. Not giving money to woke corporations to hate our values. And to the rest you woke corporations say that away from our kids. Buy yours online in 42 states at ultrarightbeer.com. Tastes like freedom. Okay now I can't help but notice. Can't help but notice that this commercial looks and sounds a little bit familiar. And where have I seen this kind of cadence and shot structure and premise for a company before? I don't know I may have seen it at a razor company or at a chocolate company or I don't know I keep bugging Jeremy to start a beer company too. And then to start 20 more companies after that once these liberals keep screwing up all of our products all of our favorite products. But I love that we're seeing this. What does it mean that we've got companies now following the Jeremy's model in some cases almost shot for shot in the commercials. What does that mean? It means the model works. What does that mean? I love it. We are seeing other conservatives come out and say I want to do exactly what that guy is doing. Because when the Daily Wire launched Jeremy's razors a lot of people said well this is crazy. Why is a media company launching a consumer products razor subscription service that's nuts it's not going to work. You're going to lose a lot of money. It'll be a funny commercial but you're crazy. You're limiting your audience by being so explicitly political blah blah blah. Then we sold about a bazillion razors and a lot of other conservatives and just non-far left people around the country looked at that and said you know what that works we're in. That is a when you see those two ads that is a vote of confidence in the alternative economy. That is a vote of confidence in people who are not just saying I hope that some conservative starts a company to give me an alternative. That's people putting their money where their mouth is saying no I think this is a good bet and I think it is a good bet. We've seen this proven time and time again and if Bud Light or Maybelline or even the supposedly right wing cable news businesses think that they can just continue to spit in the face of conservatives as they have in the past pretty much without consequence. I think they're in for a rude awakening. Politics can change very quickly. The media landscape can change very very quickly. Many can change very very quickly and I think we're in one of those periods of transition. Before we go we may have another presidential candidate. It seems like every day we've got a new presidential candidate. Christy Noam who's the governor of South Dakota was just on Sean Hannity's show. Sean asked the question that I think you got to ask every single Republican politician today. Here's her answer. There is a lot of talk that you might be considering getting in to the presidential race, the nominating part of the race. Are you considering in any way shape, manner, form, or run for the presidency? I'm super focused here Sean in South Dakota but I'll tell you this country cannot afford four more years of Joe Biden so we need new leadership and leadership that loves this country. Not one that is clearly not healthy. That's not a no. Well you can. I don't know if it's going to do you any good but you sure can. All right we'll give you a shot. But that's not a no. Would you consider it? Are you considering it? It's not a no but also Sean we've got so many people that are talking about it and running that I think it's best if I stay focused where I am and continue to visit with my family and pray and do the best thing that we think is right for our family but then also still continue to serve this country because we need people that will step up and do hard things these days to solve our problems. So if I had an answer that was clear I'd give it to you today I promise. Okay we get the point here from Kristi no I'm good on Sean for pushing back a little bit. She's well it's not a no and now look I'm no advanced logician. I am not but if it's not a no then I guess it's a yes. She is considering running for president obviously she's been signaling that she wants to run for president for some years now. And Kristi noam is kind of in the middle of the moderate wing of the party the centrist wing and the conservative wing and she's gone back and forth between those two wings a little bit so she might be running in a third lane which is the lane between Trump and DeSantis on one side and Tim Scott and Nikki Haley on the other side and she might just think it's a little too crowded so I'm going to stay up but if she sees light she is obviously running. Now we have got an interview that I'm very very excited for in the member block this is an interview that I've been trying to set up for a while I mentioned it some weeks ago when a daily wire reporter told me about one of the dark secrets of the transgender movement which is that one of the drivers of transgenderism it's not just what kids are being taught in school it's not just the popular culture it's not just I don't know the plastics in the water turning the frickin frogs gay that pornography is a big driver of the explosion of transgender identity we have a women's rights campaigner and a journalist who has done some pretty serious work on this issue so we will get into it on the member block the show continues now daily wire.com slash Knowles use code Knowles at checkout for two months free on all annual plans."
