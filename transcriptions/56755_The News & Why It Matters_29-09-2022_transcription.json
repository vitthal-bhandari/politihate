    "text": " Today, Fauci's net worth increased by millions during the pandemic. I'm sure you are shocked. Lizzo plays James Madison's 200-year-old flute, and Chris Elston joins the program to discuss child gender transitions. We've got all that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I'm Sarah Gonzalez and I am joined today by again a double dose of a Jakub Williams police TV contributor and host of the bottom line who looks extra snazzy today. Thank you. With the jacket. And can I say I like the bun? For all those haters out, they're just going to say something. I'm just letting you know the girl's gut style. We're starting off super controversial because that I was telling them off air. By the way, welcome to Packray, host of Packray Unleashed as well. Thank you for being here. I was telling them off air. The most controversial thing I've ever done on this show is wear a bun. People have very strong opinions about it one way or the other. And so we'll see. But the good news is I don't actually care what you think about my hair. You care about? Yeah, I don't. I love all of you. I just don't care what strangers on the internet think about my hair, which I think is a healthy approach. Very healthy. I'm not supposed to care. You're not codependent. I'm glad that I'm glad that you guys care enough to comment on it, I guess. But so let's get into the the headlines of the day. So all good, great news, really, really great news happening today. According to a Bureau of Economic Analysis report published yesterday, GDP is confirmed to have shrunk at an annualized rate of 0.6% in the second quarter of 2022. So this is two consecutive quarters of negative growth, which confirms that the United States is in a technical recession. Let's go, Brandon, I guess. And recall, just to remind you guys, there's a lot that goes on in this Biden administration, just as a reminder. Earlier this year, the White House attempted to redefine recession in a blog post that read, while some maintain that two consecutive quarters of falling real GDP constitute a recession, that is neither. The official definition nor the way economists evaluate the state of the business cycle, instead, both official determinations of recessions and economist's assessment of economic activity are based on a holistic look at the data, including the labor market, consumer and business spending, industrial production, and income. So they are saying, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is much more nuanced than the way that we've always looked back to define recession, the way that they talked about it. You even had left leaning, I shouldn't say left leaning liberals, very, very blue people saying this during the Obama years, everyone said, all of this was the way to define recession. Now all of a sudden, it's much more nuanced than that, because we can't admit that we have failed the American people throughout this entire tenure. The irony is that the quarterly reports consider all of the above. They consider the labor market. They consider everything. When you look at your productivity as a nation and your ability to produce income and wealth, it considers all of those factors. No, it's just the culture today is you redefine. And as I said before, you must change language to change culture. So they'll change language. They'll redefine everything, everything from a woman to what is a recession. But then when you ask them, give us the definition, then, then what is a recession? Then they can't tell you. It's like, well, maybe they'll say, I'm not a scientist or a biologist, like did it for the virus, or I'm not an economist, then get somebody, because there's no economist. You can call Merrill Lynch right now. You can call JP Morgan, you can call Morgan Stanley, all of them for millennia have operated in this country under two consecutive quarters, and we are in the recession. But those who really are in like Steve Moore, chief economic advisor to Reagan and Trump, he said, Yaku, we're in a recession four months ago. And he's arguing we're closer to 20% inflation. If you really consider all the factors. I'm sure what it feels like. I'll tell you that. Well, they're trying to redefine reality pretty much on every level. That's the truth. They do this to us every single day, redefine words and meanings and what it means when a president doesn't know if a representative is dead or not. They have a really tough job. Those people around the president, like KJP, she's awful at it. But it's also a really impossible job to be able to explain things like like she had to explain yesterday. And then you've got to you've got to explain when the economy is awful. And you don't have any chance at winning in the midterms if the economy is awful. So you got to redefine awful and you got to tell people you're not doing you're doing fine. Everything's great. Your your salaries up, the prices are down. We brought down the gas prices. Have you? It's got about eight cents this week alone. So that's back on the rise now. The economy sucks. And they're going to have their heads handed to them. I hope in November. Yeah, I do too. I hope it's not just in the house. Oh, it's got to be the Senate has to stand it as well. It's too important with the Supreme Court nominee possibilities. But but but but I said before, right? If if the gas price rose by a buck 50 and you claw back 25 cents, yeah, right? Yeah, right. Okay. Yeah, but they celebrate that. I know like it's just champion status. Like it's amazing. Look at all the jobs we brought back. Yeah, you shut the whole world down. Yeah, you didn't bring a job back. You're still in the recovery phase still. Yeah. And I argue we haven't recovered. I mean, if I look at service in this country, Sarah is atrocious. Absolutely atrocious. I mean, we just bailed from a bank. Just walked away from a bank because we couldn't get we couldn't give an appointment to sit down and just get service. There is no more service in New Sim and California on minimum wage to be $25 an hour flipping burgers. It's in the economy is in a disastrous position. Yeah, I you know, it's funny that you mentioned that I was just complaining to my my husband earlier because we went we grabbed lunch at a I don't want to trash the company's name, but it's like one of those, you know, like fast food, Mexican type like burritos and bowls and stuff. And we were just thinking like man, pre pandemic, like we were in and out. And we I mean, it was not that long of a line. And we waited for like 30 minutes. We waited longer in the line than we did just actually sit there and eat our food because it took so long. And you got to feel bad for the people that are there too, because they're you know, they're stretched then. Everyone's you know, everyone's just trying to like do probably way more than what used to be their job because they don't have enough employees. And you know, you feel bad for them. But then you're just like, okay, well, I'm not going to come here again, because I don't have time to wait to just stand around and wait in line. It's just just such a bad situation all around. All right. So I want to I want to go to I think you probably you guys both you guys favorite person ever Dr. Anthony Fauci. Oh, God, that's such a great picture of him. This is this is Dr. Fauci's face when he thinks about himself. I love me. Well, I consider him to be the greatest con man in American history. But while the rest of the country is of course you guys just talked about facing this giant financial crisis. Dr. Fauci does not have to worry because open the books. This is a nonprofit organization devoted to posting all the disclosed spending of government officials just obtained data on Fauci's net worth before and after the pandemic. Again, sit down for this because I'm sure you will be shocked to hear that the Fauci household disclosed net worth increased from $7.6 million back in January 1st, 2019 to over $12.6 million December 31st, 2021. And he in case you guys have forgotten he it was or is still the most highly compensated federal employee earning $456,000 in 2021, 480,000 in 2022. They had to give him a raise because of how well he worked and how well he did during the pandemic. Because usually I mean here Pat don't you know like when people they fail at their jobs, they don't do what they say they're going to do. They promise something and don't deliver on it. Their numbers are bad. Yeah, they get raises. They get raises. Right. Yeah, that's how you run business. So, it's great for him, isn't it? It sure is. I mean, he sucks and he just keeps making more money. And you know what? The thing is that doesn't include royalties. Right. Because the royalties have still been redacted. And so we don't know anything about how much he's earned in royalties. So, it's $12.6 million without the royalties. And I'm guessing royalties are going to dwarf what he made as far as his household income. So this says, so let me read the details on this. And this maybe, you know, obviously there is more that we can't we can't obtain. But this says, during 2021, his household income perks and benefits and unrealized investment gains totaled $2.8 million, including federal income and benefits of $903,000 outside awards and royalties. So, again, I don't think all of them because we don't have the number for all of them. But the ones we do have total over $1 million and $910,000 in investment gains. He's the highest federal paid employee of all time. And when he retires, if he retires this year, like he says, he's going to, he's going to make almost $400,000 a year doing nothing. By the way, we will all be paying for that. That comes from us. In addition to the $12.6 million, he's already got sucked away. Then he gets another additional $375,000 a year for life. Wow, that's a great game. Boy, it pays to kill people and a little kid's back on learning. It actually does pay to kill people. But I'll say this, Pat, that number 12 million, it's a drop in the bucket. It is. When you look at rewards and royalties, rewards come in the form of this. And this is where his biggest gains are. The boards that he sits on, okay? Now, look at the boards that he's sitting on. You get stock options on boards as a board member. And they deferring the taxes on the stock options as the board. And he doesn't disclose those because there's no physical gain yet. But wait until he exits some of these board positions and these stock options and positions. It'll be an excess of $100 million. I'm sure. Okay, so this is not a bit of a well. They're back channel because a knife set on many boards. And you get stock options when you sit on boards. They issue stock because it is especially Fauci. And he'd probably get a point point and a half, one and a half percent in a major multinational corporation that when he exits, that's not 12 million bucks. You're going to talk about money that you cannot imagine that they didn't roll into to avoid capital gains, into other equities and investments and in a real estate. And so no, this guy is a fat cat sitting high, performing the worst of anybody in health care ever because the master he serves will reward if you that's. Well, I also hope that this is kind of a wake up call for Americans just generally how this works in the medical industry, pharmaceutical industry. Everyone is tied in government is tied to big pharma. And there is major incentive to work with the pharmaceutical companies. If you think that it's just Dr. Fauci that's making all of this money, let me tell you about the bonuses that your doctor gets, your primary care doctor gets if they make sure that they vaccinate all of the children in their practice with all of the childhood vaccines on the schedule that the CDC puts out. I mean, these things are happening and have been happening for a very long time. So I hope that the American public is waking up to just this. I've always said, I mean, back since 2020, I'm like, okay, this sucks. A lot of people died and a lot of people's families were torn apart from addiction and suicide and children were, you know, are still recovering from the learning loss. Like this was a horrible thing that happened. But if there is a silver lining to be had, perhaps people are now a little bit more, you know, wary of government agencies, big government agencies and big government bureaucrats, doctors and experts because they're not those are not the always the people that you should be counting on to give you the truth. And by the way, this reminds me, I was reading earlier today, let me see if I can, I can find it, that the government, the FDA is proposing changes to the nutrition standards that foods must meet before they can carry the healthy label on their packages. Because don't you want the same government who told you to eat 11 servings of bread every day and who already puts and allows all of these toxins and poisons in your body that you're ingesting all the time and the high fructose corn syrup is great and the chlorine and the fluoride that they put in the water is great. I definitely want that same government explaining to me what is healthy and what is not. So thank you, big daddy government, because I don't know how I could do it without you. I mean, that's why everyone here in this country is so fit and thin, because we have the government telling us what is healthy and what is not. So I am really, really excited about our health overlords explaining that to us. We've got more, but we've got to take a quick break. First, we want to thank our sponsor, fast growing trees.

Yesterday, Tennessee representative Jason Zachary tweeted out a letter signed up by the GOP over in Tennessee, which formally requests that Vanderbilt Medical halt all gender transition surgeries on minors. This is of course in response to the investigation by Matt Walsh's team of Vanderbilt's gender clinic, which was performing double mastectomies and sex change operations on minors. I want to welcome to the program his first time on Chris Elston, who is a child advocate exposing gender ideology. Chris, thank you so much for being with us. I guess I should, I should introduce you as the, your name that everyone knows you on Twitter, which is billboard Chris. Yeah, that's right. I literally walk around wearing signs and I know that historically people in a Sammock board aren't the most dependable people to talk to. But it works. It creates the conversations that I'm trying to start. And that's all I'm out there doing is trying to have as many conversations as possible. Because we have to step outside of our echo chambers and reach parents, especially about these child abuse that's going on. And many times their children are being indoctrinated in schools to believe that they're born in the wrong body. And this is child abuse, so we need to post up to it. So I want to, to, to add to this particular topic in conversation, I want to, to bring up a post that you recently highlighted over on Twitter. It was from the D transition Reddit forum, which just, it breaks my heart that that's even a forum on Reddit. They have an entire forum dedicated to D transitioners who just speak out about how horrible it is, what the process that they have to go through. And this, this particular one is written by a 17 year old girl about the impacts of testosterone therapy on her body. It says, every time I open my effing mouth, I sound like a freak. I've ruined my life with my stupid decisions I made as a kid. The doctors ruined my life by allowing a barely functioning mentally ill child with severe OCD and undiagnosed BPD to go on hormones. I'm legitimately suicidal because of the decisions I made as a kid. It's all my effing fault. I don't know how long I can keep doing this. This, by the way, I'm going to try really hard to keep my colon not cry is a 17 year old. This is a 17 year old writing this. Chris, how do we dig ourselves out of the medical community just, I mean, seemingly just going complete bonkers and doing this and not just doing it, but celebrating it, it seems. Yeah, this is like the biggest cult in history that's completely captured all of our government and medical institutions. So the American Academy of Pediatrics is having a conference on October 8th. There's going to be a big protest in Anaheim. And so far they've been ignoring calls for an inquiry into this practice by their own doctors because they're politically captured. But this is not a political issue. It shouldn't be. It should transcend politics. And I know from my personal experience out on the street that more than 90% of the population agree with my position. Because guess what? Democrats also don't want their own kids getting sterilized by a teaching that is indoctrinating our kids to believe that they're born in the wrong body just because they don't adhere to sexist, regressive stereotypes. The entirety of our gender ideology is based on regressive stereotypes, teaching that tomboys are actual boys. So I think in the long run, we get out of this just by creating enough awareness of what's going on. And then there's the expression that politics is downstream from culture. Well, hopefully that holds true. And as more people get outraged, these politicians will start to act and down this in state after state. So what made you decide, you know what? I'm just going to go out and wear a billboard on my body. What was the thought process there? Yeah, it didn't start that way. I actually put up a real billboard in Vancouver in September 2020 that said, I love JK Rowland, the Harry Potter author. Because a woman in the UK named Posey Parker had put up a sign at the Edinburgh train station that said the same thing. And some people on Twitter complained that it was hate speech. And the government run train authority took it down after one day. And I got tired of all this child abuse. I got tired of our freedom of speech being taken away. So I put up a huge billboard in Vancouver. It also lasted just a day because a Vancouver politician said it was hate speech. The sign company took it down. So then I did a campaign all across North America, all across the United States actually putting up billboards. And then because I can't even put up a sign in Canada, I said, well, I'm not going to let them cancel me. If I have to become a billboard, that's what I'll do. So I had them made. And I went out on the street and I started having conversations and it proved to be much more inspirational and effective than any number of huge billboards because there's a person behind it. And I'm having these conversations. And I think it's inspired a lot of people to also get over their fears of talking about this issue. So I'm sure that you have your fair share of trolls. Maybe you would call them or people who just vehemently disagree with you. But what is your sense when you have these conversations with people, particularly in DC and places where you're frequenting? Do you feel like perhaps the pendulum is starting to swing back from all of this radical ideology? Absolutely. So I've been at this for two years. I've probably had 2,000 hours out on the streets all across North America. I still get a lot of abuse and I've been attacked more than 20 times. I've had my own broken by Antifa and I've been arrested twice after getting assaulted. But the vast majority of the population agree when they understand what's going on. Two years ago, nobody had a clue what puberty blockers were. Now I get nonstop support. The awareness is risen dramatically. And I see this better than anyone in the world because I'm the only person out there on the streets doing this. And so I have tons of hope and I always had tons of hope because I know this is too crazy to last. But we just got to keep the hammer down. And we're going to win this battle. It's just a question of how many kids come to harm before we do. Yeah. Yeah. So what would you say to the viewer out there who wants to join the fight, join the cause maybe, but they can't travel to DC and be a walking human billboard. What would you tell them? Well, the most important thing first of all is to get yourself informed. You don't have to know everything about this. This is pretty basic stuff. Obviously, we shouldn't be doing child sex changes. This is one of the craziest things humanity's ever done. But we can all do things like go to our school board meetings and raise heck there. In many school districts, in many states entirely, they're hiding from parents. It's the written policy to hide from parents that they're changing their child's name and pronouns at school. So this is absurd. It's absurd that we're teaching children that they might be born in the wrong body. No one can even define what that means. But what an abusive thing to say to a child who might not feel like they fit in. But the reason for that is because they're born in the wrong body. This is abuse from top to bottom. There's absolutely no truth to this entire ideology. And parents, especially, need to make noise with their school boards or get involved with an organization like Moms for Liberty, Independent Women's Network, or whatever conservative group you have in your state. Because we all have to fight back. This is an abusive ideology that's coming for our kids. Yeah. Well, I just wanted to tell you really, truly from the bottom of my heart, this is an issue. I think the gentleman here at this table, it's a very huge issue to us. It's a very huge issue to me personally, mom of two boys. And we just appreciate all of the work that you're doing. And, you know, sacrificing all of your time to have these conversations with people. And, you know, we're signs. So we appreciate you so much, Chris. Thank you. Got to do what you got to do. Thanks, everyone. All right. Thank you. You guys make sure to follow Chris on social media. He really is doing tremendous work out there in D.C. and all of the other places that he's frequenting. We've got more to come on the program. First, we want to thank our sponsor, First Liberty. So court packing. I don't know if you guys have heard, but the Democrats, if they get their way, they're going to pack the court. And that is a coup. Okay. They're working over time. And if we don't stop them from installing four more justices so they can rig the system in their favor, it's going to be catastrophic for our entire country. We cannot let that happen. First Liberty is asking you to do the most simple thing ever. They're asking you to sign a letter to say no to court packing and no to the Supreme Court coup. A bunch of people have already done it. Frankly Graham, Attorney General Ed B.s, Dr. James Dobson, the family policy allowance, the Heritage Foundation, of course, but they want you to also join them in the fight. Go sign your name. It is SupremeCoo.com. I'm not asking you to buy anything. Okay. I'm not asking you for any of that. I'm asking you to go sign your name to show that you support this fight. It is Supreme C-O-U-P.com. Phil Robertson here. They told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on the screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. OnTheBlindToday at blazedtv.com slash The Blind. The Blind and share it with the Blind. Hurricane Ian, of course, made landfall yesterday as we discussed yesterday on the program and has since been downgraded to a tropical storm. Now, we talked about all of the everyone on the left. Once this to be about climate change, because as we know, anytime you have a weather-related event, if we're talking about volcanoes, if we're talking about earthquakes, if we're talking about tsunamis, if we're talking about flooding, if we're talking about what is this a hurricane, if we're talking about any of these things, it is only due to climate change, I guess, which is what CNN Chief Climate Correspondent, Chief Climate Correspondent over at CNN said yesterday that, of course, the hurricane was due to climate change. Thank you. Ian is coming. Ian's here. John, we just felt a market increase in wind speeds. We're going to last 10 minutes or so. We were riding about 40, 50 miles an hour. It was hard to fathom that speed tripling in the next few hours, but we're now getting maybe 70 mile an hour gust here. We're right at the point where US-43 heads across the Peace River here. I'm just in front of the memorial for Hurricane Charlie, which in 2004, devastated this town and sent a wake-up call to this community about the threats of living on the coast in a rapidly warming planet. It's hard to build power lines or building codes for 17-foot storm surge, though. That's the crazy variable here. Right now, no one has ever seen that, so we don't know what that looks like, but this is exactly what climate scientists have been warning about for a long time, and now we get to see it all close. All the climate scientists, yeah, they've been warning about the possibility of hurricanes if we let climate change get out of control. Because there were never hurricanes. No, no. Until what 2004 when you saw the first one there? There was never rain. No. There were never temperatures at all. There was never heat. There was never cold. It's interesting. They have it both ways every time, too. The preponderance of snow means climate change as well. Everything means climate change. Well, that's why they changed it to climate change, because remember it was cold. Global warming, warming, climate change is five times a day, wherever. It's interesting. I wonder what Noah thought about a flood that covered the whole earth. Climate change. Climate change. Climate is changing, guys. Sorry, but I'll say this. We have snow on the equator, where there's never been snow before. They won't report that. Climate change. No, but they won't report that, because that means somewhere it's cooling down. Something is happening. It's a climate change. Sarah, it's really cool when you wake up in the morning and go, today I'm earning my keep. I'm going to be in the store today. I'm suffering. I'm in an Andrew Cuomo moment there for a minute. Self-sabotage. Now, look, it's such a joke. You know they named hurricanes 40 years in advance. They named it. Ian's been named decades ago. They don't name him when they happened. There you have the list. A list. Katrina was named 30 years prior to hitting New Orleans. We've had hurricanes and earthquakes and things forever, but no, no, no, no. This is how we're going to win the midterms. You should be scared to death. Go get your vaccine and vote Democrat. Get your hurricane vaccination. And we will protect you from the hurricane. It's so fascinating too, because in the same breath that they're like, climate scientists have been warning for a long time. If you live in a place that is very close to the beach, you too could be in trouble. It's like, really, that's weird, because all the people who have been telling us about all this climate change crap and that all of the houses we're going to fall into the ocean are buying up really expensive mansions like Obama and Nancy Pelosi and all of these people. So I don't really, I feel like they're very evil people, but I don't feel like they're dumb. And I don't believe that Obama would make such a horrible investment in buying the multi-million dollar mansion that he knew was going to be falling off into the oceans. They don't believe their own bullcraft. You know they don't. You wouldn't act the way you do. You wouldn't buy a home on the ocean if you did. But it's also intentional though. Sorry, Pat, go ahead. In 1900, people lived on the beach in Galveston, Texas. That's when the worst disaster to ever hit the United States of America came ashore in the form of a hurricane in Galveston and killed over 10,000 people. 10,000 people. Why? Because they lived on the ocean. So even in 1900, this was happening long before that. And it's been happening forever. In fact, Galveston in 19, I think it was 1905 or 1906 raised the city 17 feet so that wouldn't happen again. And it hasn't been as devastating there ever since. But it's one hurricane this season. One. I don't think we've even had a tropical storm hit America. It's one. And they're trying to cause hurricane climate change hysteria over one. And it's bad. I know when a lot of people lost their lives and it really is tragic. It really is. But the origin is not climate change. Right now. But they've spread it too, Pat. It has nothing to do with climate change. They exploited. Or you take a Gavin Newsom that refuses to do forestry. Five feet of pine needles in the Californian forest. He refuses to clean the forest because he knows. So they have fires right here. Fire season will come November. And man, we can get more government aid, more money from the government and see climate change. No, just go do some forestry and protection in your forests and clean it up. And you won't burn down a million acres. But it'll have fires. But you'll stop less severe. You'll stop them. I mean, so it's hurricane season. Then they tell us it's the most severe and it's the worst ever for fires. And in Australia, even when on that fire year that they had was that last year or the year before, it was a an abnormally low fire season for Australia. I mean, they lie every single day to us. Every day they lie about this. We've got rivers right now in Africa showing up in the desert. We have snow showing up on the equator. They don't give you any context. They take a sliver and they give you this narrative and they drive it. They should do it. And then shame on the people for being stupid enough to think that this is the worst hurricane and it is. Lives are lost. It is terrible. It's terrible even if it was one house. But it's not global warming, which is really what they want to say. They can call it climate change all they want. So I want to throw into the equation here. I'm just here to raise your blood pressure with Joy Behar from The View who insinuated that this hurricane was actually karma for DeSantis' views on climate change watch. This is the quote from Governor DeSantis about climate change. Quote, I am not in the pews of the church of the global warming leftists. This is what he thinks about climate change. And now his state is getting hit with one of the worst hurricanes ever perhaps. Is that how the world works? It's because one person in Florida says something the universe doesn't like or whatever she believes. It punishes 15 million people. Okay, so what did it mean? So what did it mean when New York flooded and New York subway was flooded? What did that mean, Joy? Was that karma? Was that punishment? Yeah, maybe it is. Maybe it is. So let's go calculate. The disasters that has happened in California where she's sitting. Yeah, yeah. Maybe you're going to have an earthquake and split off and float off into the ocean maybe. Well, I mean, imagine how stupid she would have felt saying the same thing about like, this is Governor DeSantis' view on having trans kids in schools and then read that because that has about as much to do with hurricanes as his statement about climate change. It's just like, it's okay, cool. He made a quote about something. I don't know what that has to do with hurricanes and yet they still spew the garbage. Honestly, you talk about CNN and people watch it and still believe it. Every time we play a clip from the view, I am astonished that that show is still on. But to have an audience. How? With all that whoopee has done. Okay, how she's put her foot in her mouth this year alone? Oh, my gosh. With what Joy has done. They're never right. No, but anything about anything. It's a division of ABC. How any voice that's in it is. I don't think it away with that. No, it's a marketing agency. I mean, how any voice that has come on that show that has even resembled reason being kicked off the show. You can't bring logic, okay, intellectual honesty on that show. I don't know. Maybe they're as fake as Twitter is with their viewership. Maybe the viewership has pumped up like Twitter was when Elon discovered it's a whole bunch of bots. Maybe that's their viewership. I don't know. Well, I mean, I just it actually is incredible how wrong they are all the time. Because think about it. Okay, it's ABC News. How many producers do you think they have in the control room? How many producers have the ability to correct them in their ear, right? Probably five at least at any given time. At least. By the way, for reference, I have one producer in the control room and she's not like fact checking me in real time. Like we just we just do this, you know, on the fly and try to inform ourselves. They have that much staff that they're paying to produce this show and they still get things day after day. Everything wrong. Like the White House Press Room? Yeah, they do actually. They look like the White House Press Room that has a lot of staff as well. And you know, when Glenn worked at Fox, they had to check and recheck and triple check and quadruple check everything he said. Because if he was wrong every freakin night, he'd be done every night. He'd be done in one night after the first snafu. Exactly. And but they get away with it every single day. No, but they're the chosen puppets. They're not going to remove their chosen puppets. They're the chosen puppets. They will they will bail them out like they bailed out airlines. This this government will bail these people out of their show tanks. They will fund it. They will find a way to keep them on the air because it's a voice. Well, that's why I just I really think, you know, Kyle Rittenhouse needs to sue them for all that they're worth. Turning point, they went through the they threatened legal action previously, which was absolutely the right call. Like people need to push back every single time they have the ability to if it's some sort of defamatory thing. Yeah. Everyone needs to sue the crap out of these companies because it's going to be the only way to get them to stop it. If they're scared that they are going to go bankrupt, that will be the only way that they stop. Otherwise, they just keep going because they don't care. They don't care about you. They don't care about your livelihoods. They don't care about anything. They just care about demonizing you and winning. All right. We got to take a quick break. We'll be back. During her Washington DC show, this past Tuesday, Lizzo became the first person to play James Madison's crystal flute. This flute is said to be one of the few heirloom saved by First Lady Dolly Madison after the British Army burned down the White House during the war of 1812. And look, it's obviously a very important historical artifact. So you would want the person who is the first person to play it to have some sort of respect for the artifact that they are holding, which I think probably is in fact shown by the way that Lizzo twerked while playing James Madison's flute watch. What is this? Wow, what talent. It's amazing talent. All the girls should aspire to be like this. Just as people are out of the country. We just made history tonight. Oh no, you make more history than the flute. You've broken the young girls tonight. You've broken the image of women and boys' eyes tonight. How much would you be willing to wager that Lizzo had no idea who James Madison was before they arranged that? A lot. I'd like to wager a lot. You can wager everything you've got. So before she played that at the show, she gave a more limited performance with the flute inside of the Library of Congress. And after employees explained that the flute had been made in 1813 for Madison, she apparently performed her twerk flute combo for a small crowd of library employees in what appeared to be a back office. And in the middle of her performance, she just so passionately and respectfully and just with so much dignity looked up and said, B-O-Tch. That's great. This is great. We don't have a problem holding up the wrong people as role models. Let me tell you. Let me tell you. James Madison. Okay, so this bothered me. I want to toss it to you guys by saying this. I said, I responded to this on Twitter and I said, Madison is rolling in his grave. And I had someone who maybe they watched this program, I don't know. It seemed like they were a conservative who wrote back and said something to the effect of, you know, well, I don't really like her, but she has talent and we shouldn't be so negative and judgmental all the time. And I'm like, I don't think I'm being negative and judgmental by saying, I hope, I would wish that the library of archives had a little bit more respect for the artifact than giving it to someone who's going to use profanity and twerk while they're playing it. Yeah, do you think they'd lend it out to us? No. Who revere and respect James Madison? And, you know, it's the man who wrote the Constitution for the love of heaven. And this is what you do with it. How did that happen? Yeah, let's check it out to Lizzo. The great big fat chick on TV, let's put her on and give her the flute. What? How does that make any sense? I don't understand. I mean, that's great. You don't have to worry about body image. That's fantastic. I'm sure it's completely healthy. I'm sure I'm completely healthy, except my blood test that I just had proves otherwise. Okay, but I'm not out glorifying it. And we shouldn't be. It isn't healthy. It's not right. She's not a good example for people. And I don't even frankly, I barely know who she is. I've just started hearing the name recently and seeing her on, I don't know, was it the Emmys or something? I don't even know where she came from. All I know, why is there Lizzo? I've heard a couple of her songs, but my favorite place that I know her from is Glenn's rendition of Where to Hell My Phone, which is one of her songs. That's right. Okay, that's where I know her from. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Which is honestly, the best thing I've ever heard about Lizzo is only when Glenn does a bit involving her. That's the greatest thing that I hear about her. Yaku. Yup. Yup. You said it. That's it. That's it. Okay, all right. So here's what we're going to do. We're going to, Yaku just doesn't want to get in trouble, I think, because he's thinking he's having thoughts that might involve. I don't think you want me to start. Why is it going to say that might involve? I don't think you want me to start because that woman's single, I can't even. She's single hand. Anybody that celebrates that is involved in child abuse. The images, what she's doing for women and against women, what she's doing to young boys, the lack of dignity, the lack of self-respect, you're an excuse, you're an oxygen thief. You should not be celebrated. You need mental help. You've got massive, images with your issues with your own image. We celebrate broken people here instead of helping them pack. No, no. We got a president that needs mental care. And so we celebrate. So no, I should honestly shut up because it does great. Well, and then you bring an archive, an American icon into the whole picture and disrespect it. You know what? I'm going to put it in a right. I know we got to take a break. I'm going to put in a request. I want to put in a request to see if I can also put that. Right, you should. I'm going to do that. You should. And Pat, maybe that's the point. It's the mockery they're making. It's the mockery. That's what they're doing. They're mocking. That probably is the point. Because what do they care about the Constitution? They want to completely dismantle it. So we shouldn't be surprised. All right, we got to take a break. We'll be back. The American Academy of Pediatrics has updated guidance on Headlights for the first time since 2015. They say that it's a new it's a civil rights issue. Okay, it's the new guidance reads, no-knit policies that exclude children or adolescents until all-nits are removed, may violate a child's or adolescent civil liberties and are best addressed with legal counsel for schools. Most health care professionals who care for children or adolescents agree that no-knit policies should be abandoned. No-knit policies are unjust and should be continued because they are based on misinformation rather than objective science. And they cite an article giving international recommendations regarding school children and LICE from the International Journal of Dermatology as their authority, which of course cites the AAP as the authority for their recommendations. So they're saying that infestations are neither a health hazard nor a sign of poor hygiene but can result in significant stigma and psychological stress. So you should not send children home. So here's what we're going to do. For a virus we can't see. We have no real science about. We got a social distance, put your kid in a mask and in Dallas, Texas, put your kid in a plexiglass box. But for LICE that has been around forever that we can actually see and we know it spreads like well that should stay. That makes all the sense of what you don't want to stigmatize a kid for having LICE and then spreading it to their peers. But yeah, it's just a great LICE. You should celebrate LICE. Look at the month about it. We should. Let's do. Stream and subscribe to more BLASE media content at theblaze.com slash podcasts."
