    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast Welcome back in clay Travis Buck Sexton show appreciate all of you hanging out with us rolling through the Thursday edition of the program and yesterday we brought you the news that the Democrat attempt to enshrined Roe v. Wade in a Senate vote had failed because Joe Manchin failed on his Democrat colleagues and so By a 51 to 49 vote that attempt by Chuck Schumer failed But as a part of that failure We're already starting to see the argument now be made buck of This is not only about abortion. It's going to spread beyond abortion and during the commercial break I was reading the Washington Post They are doing direct agenda based journalism Buck they have got Washington Post reporters obsessively calling every video game company To find out what their policy is going to be what their statement is going to be in the event that Roe v. Wade is overturned this of course is not journalism It's a pressure-mounted campaign to try to get all of these companies to issue Woke statements relating to abortion meanwhile So far most companies seem to be avoiding making these comments and what is this telling us? What are we learning from this obsession coming from the leak from Justice? Alleo's Potential opinion remember it still hasn't even occurred potential opinion overturning it. It's that Roe v. Wade by itself Is it enough? There has to be more associated with it. So this was Chuck Schumer After the Senate failed to advance what they were calling the Women's Health Protection Act Here in cut 9 he says and follows along what we talked about yesterday the slippery slope argument of Contraception is next to listen to Schumer's litany of what's to come in the way of this opinion vote we just took makes crystal clear the contrast between the parties as we approach the midterm elections vote elect more pro-choice Democrats if you want to see a woman have control over her own body elect more pro-choice Democrats if you want to protect a woman's freedom and right to choose collect more mega Republicans if you want to see a nationwide ban on abortion if you want to see doctors and women Arrested if you want to see no exceptions for rape or incest So far that has not come to fruition anywhere, right? That's the slippery slope argument But buck what you're seeing actually is that Democrats have enshrined that they believe abortion should be legal up to and including the 9th of pregnancy which is a radical proposition that is overwhelmingly rejected by the vast majority of the American public But this campaign is underway this Washington Post Journalism I'm putting it in a quote in a quotation mark of calling a company and wanting to know what they're going to potentially be doing And then writing about a failure to act which is what they did in the newspaper is advocacy direct and straightforward and this is all part of the campaign that is underway to define this elito opinion I Think they're just trying to mobilize corporate America the way that they did With the last voice we just talked about in the last hour there they're expecting the same Genuflection and begging for forgiveness from corporate America now And then there's also a lot in corporate America who would they're just open advocates for this a lot of major companies But the difference is with BLM in the initial days. I think there was a bit of There was a moral panic, but there was also a sense of well Maybe this is a time for a conversation Half the country doesn't want to have a conversation about whether or not women should be able to abort babies for all nine months of a pregnancy They want this to stop they've wanted it wanted this to stop for a long time. They've wanted this to stop for decades They've set up organizations. They've raised a lot of money. They've been engaged in advocacy They've been helping women who are who are on you on plan pregnancy setting up on plan pregnancy centers for women to have babies I mean there's been a lot that's been going on here So this isn't just one side gets to have their argument and no one else is going to stand to thwart them and say We'll hold on a second as that was the case remember with BLM nobody I mean there are very few people who are willing to say early on I Will say that I was among them that this was not going to help. This was a bad idea This is rooted in lies on this issue. I think that they underestimate the strength and the and and the solidity Is that a word? Of the I think it's a word of the pro-life movement and how it's been Waiting for this moment in time to now take it to the States You notice the panic among the Democrats is oh my gosh. What if people can vote on this? Yeah, what if what if states actually have to deal with the intricacies and the gray areas and the differences in opinion the Democrats need this cover this fig leaf this Fiction of rho and now they want it at a federal level think about how Obtuse this thinking is as well when Republicans come into a majority they can just remove you're gonna have a federal law That is saying you have this right. No, you don't have this right That's going to ping ping pong back and forth depending on who's in charge No states make you know very clear determinations somehow clay We've lived in a world where you know I go in and and I go buy a handgun in the state of Texas and I'm enjoying my second amendment rights I walk around the streets with a handgun in New York that I haven't run through their special six-month long anti-gun Get fingerprinted and treated like a criminal before you've done anything system They're gonna lock me up for three years like I'm a bad person they're violating my constitutional rights But we live with all kinds of differences among the states That's where this is heading and that's where it should have been all along And I just think the democrats know that their arguments are weak And there's also a sense this is not going to be the mobilization. Yeah, of course if you're left with the people that are outraged about this The blue-haired nose-ringed Shrieking banshees outside of Kavanaugh's house and outside of roberts's house They were all voting democrat anyway clay. I really don't now there will be some people that maybe See that things you've been talking about the emails. It's like oh, it's gonna go after We're gonna take away your contraceptive rights. We're gonna take away exactly But I think there'll also be a lot of people who say Hold on a second Chuck Schumer really believes and we're not making it up He does and betto a rork and what's the the senate? That's him ryan would be would be senator from ohio Nine months you don't want to have a baby anymore doctors should take it out of you and kill the baby That is what the democrats believe people are going to realize what that actually means to no doubt And I think that's important to emphasize what actually was voted on There is a totalitarian nature in pro-choice abortion rights Arguments that now requires buck Lest you offend them that you support abortion all the way up to the ninth month of pregnancy That is what they believe that is what they voted on yesterday. That's what 49 democrats affixed their name to What's interesting to me associated with that is The pro-life movement actually has a variety of different perspectives within it right some people out there Do believe that there shouldn't be any exemptions at all that's your right to have that opinion right for religious-based reasons Whatever they may be other people and I would put myself in this category Believe that contraception should be widely available and and some people disagree with that but i'm in that category in terms of what the line should be for rape incest for For how many weeks? Should be available if at all there's a wide variety of perspectives the reason why I bring this up is I think there is a tendency to treat pro-choice people in the media certainly As if they are more of a reasonable group Think about this nine month pregnancy abortions That is murder That is now the position of the democrat party and it is one That if you are running if you know jadie vance is running up against tim ryan in ohio Tim ryan is trying to say hey i'm a moderate for the democrat party running in the state of ohio It ain't moderate buck to believe that a nine month pregnant woman can decide to do away with her abortion And that needs to be you need to get everybody on the record in the midterms who is out there Do you support a woman's right to have an abortion in the ninth month because you know what if that woman was shot? And the baby died Most of our criminal statutes would call that a double murder As they will most everywhere out there and as they should pointing out. I mean we need we need to take a moment here and and really think about this as a country prominent democrats Really the most powerful democrats in the country are arguing for a legal right to what is Obvious infanticide. Yes full stop nine month babies They could be born at any moment. You'd be who's gone through a pregnancy has had a baby nose you get to seven eight nine months You get to nine months that baby can come in any moment full on infanticide pretending it's a constitutional right pretending It's a moral right pretending. This is somehow about women controlling their bodies They are they aren't saying hold on. Let's have a let's have a national conversation about difficult things There are they're advocating for savagery full up full on savagery. That is what they're actually Publicly demanding right now something that we would have you know if you're looking at a at a previous society I think I mentioned this before you know the Aztecs A pre-modern, you know pre discovery by by the west society That used to have massive human sacrifice and we look at that we say well that's that's so awful They thought they had some reason for that whether it was to appease some gods or whatever Our reason is effectively according to democrats convenience. Yeah, it is inconvenient You had you've had uh jannett yellen say, you know, hey, it's really we need to make sure people can abort babies because you know babies are expensive And it's and it's hard and it's particularly difficult for low-income and minority communities That's an immoral position. She's advocating for I mean people's jaws should be dropping I do think we need to have something of a moral awakening in this country You know we want to have a conversation about you know When does life begin and and what legal protections for you know week one and week forward That that is I think going to happen and that should happen at a political level That should be something that goes on if we can't agree that a baby's a baby at nine months What can we agree on think about this analogy book woman goes into the hospital headed to a hospital at nine months pregnant Man before she can go into the hospital Jumps out and pummels her in her stomach leading for her to lose a baby. That's a vile awful Unbelievable crime to be committed and most people would say that man should go to the prison for the rest of his life Woman walks into the hospital and decides to have that baby aborted People are totally fine with that occurring in the democrat party right now When if think about how crazy that is just that that that difference between somebody assaults a pregnant woman And she loses her baby That man goes to prison for the rest of his life. I'm not a direct attack I'm not a big advocate for saying well, what does the rest of the world do on a whole range of things? Sometimes it's interesting the rest of the world gets to have Secure borders to the degree they can and not be considered racist or xenophobic like every other every other industrial country modern country Gets to try to control its borders and that's not but on this issue you want on abortion You look at what the rest of the world believes America is only Aligned in terms of what the democrat party pushes for with china Which created of course the one child policy and forced sterilization for sterilization and north korea countries that have open concentration camps and to this day and the united states Are democrats of course are the ones that advocate for this abortion for all nine months of a pregnancy There's no it doesn't get more morally clear than this actually like this part of the discussion There which is I think why democrats are so Uh, they're they're they're enraged They're over emotional that they because they don't want to actually think it through They want to shout slogans and live in a land of make believe where they haven't been advocating for evil for a very long time and they have been And this is something that they all need to go on the record for and this is what I would say is the benefit of The elitoe opinion in the event it becomes law because we go from debating whether rovey wage should be the law To what should the practical law be and that is why all 50 states should have a democratic process to figure out What is and what is not permissible?

Um, this was on october 22nd I think it was during one of the debates against donald trump biden said 220,000 deaths If you hear nothing else I say tonight hear this Anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain president of the united states to your point buck More deaths by far since joe biden became president than when trump was president and again A lot of these deaths we understand our deaths with covet Where these people have multiple covet morbidities all these other different issues that are going on Uh, but for joe biden to argue that trump had done such a bad job.

We are joined now by rob smith. He's in a rock vore war veteran political analyst host of can't cancel rob smith Podcast which just launched yesterday Rob i'm gonna tee up early here with a lot of the topics that we've been discussing so far today Uh and over the past couple of days. What do you think about us spending 40 billion? On ukraine While we can't even get baby formula on the shelves in this country for moms and dads running around trying to feed their young kids Not only do I think that this is the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard and the most absurd things that i've ever heard It's one of those things that actually makes me angry It makes me physically angry when I found out that this was happening And when I think about this and when you think about 40 billion dollars being sent to the ukraine while you said like you said We have baby formula shortages while people are struggling paying more gurus paying more for groceries paying more for gas Um, it's outrageous and it makes me absolutely angry and I need to make a point right here Now, you know a lot of people i'm conservative Identify myself, you know, I vote republican all that stuff But a lot of people really do like to think that this is just something that comes from the left There's something that comes from a couple people on the right And I think when people need to realize sometimes that there is a unit party in washington dc That is united on this stuff. We have only a couple of bold and brave um, congresspeople that are bold enough to vote against this stuff Rob, you know There's also a real concern and i'm seeing it start to Speaking of the unit party not just on the spending front but when it also comes to foreign policy Interventionism getting involved in things more than the american people actually want We're we're hearing a lot more now from democrats and from republicans about how ukraine is an opportunity to bleed russia or ukraine is an opportunity to uh to offset, you know russias ambitions in the region And and they even will say things like you know, we're we're at war or we're close to war with russian ukraine I think that there has somehow been a mission creep that has happened and very few people have noticed this and it really is Concerning as we all know pouton has thousands of nuclear weapons Yes, absolutely and the thing that I hate about this book is that you have all of these chicken hawks, right coming from dc And they're talking tough about russia and pouton and all this stuff Um, most of these people have not served most of these people do not know anybody that is serving most of these people Do not have family members that have served so you have a lot of people talking this very tough talk when it comes to russia And like you said, you know, this is a nuclear power And this is something that that really irritates me as something that is very concerning How sort of casually these people are ramping up this rhetoric In pushing us into this war now. I'm not entirely sure now russia has always been an adversary of ours I definitely get that um, but I am not entirely sure when it became our responsibility to Send all of these billions of dollars to ukraine and try to believe them Um to sort of launch this offensive against russia And so we have people talking about no fly zones. We have people talking about this tough talk against russia It is absolutely insane to me when we are going through the toughest times that we have seen in years Right here at home, but you got to understand and I go back to the swamp and I go back to the uni party These people do not care about the average working american What these people care about is making their donors happy with these people care about is continuing to fund the war machine What these people care about is continuing to see their stocks go higher and higher and higher when they use their positions to sort of bring up this rhetoric a lot Rob we saw dave shapel get attacked on the stage Uh in la a couple weeks ago and then the d a in la decided not to charge his attacker with a felony Uh, there's been a lot of discussion certainly with dave shapel about the trans universe As it compares to the gay world and and and all of that What do you think about kind of the unholy alliance that exists right now when you see all of the discussions about? Uh teaching kids who are first grade about transgender related issues Uh, how in the lbgt larger community how much conversation is going on? How much agreement is there on issues like these in the trans universe? Well, the thing about it is there's not like, you know, you guys both know i'm a gay dude myself I don't identify with the lgbt qi or any of that stuff. So what's going on here is is twofold First of all, you have gays and lesbians in america right now that have basically the rights that that you know They have fought for decades and decades and decades we're talking about don't ask them tell repeal being able to serve openly in the Military we're talking about the right to get married fine Now what the radical trans agenda has done is it has latched itself to the very powerful organization That existed to advocate for gay rights and have done so for decades And so gays and lesbians don't even exist anymore to these people they're talking about trans they're talking about q They're talking about a hundred different genders. They're talking about literally transitioning You know kids that are as young as five six seven years old And so that has a lot to do with the fact that we are seeing thanks to the work of of places like libs of tiktok Where you see these people have infiltrated the public school system in the agenda that they're pushing to these kids has nothing to do with Gay and lesbian and everything to do with this sort of radical gender ideology that has taken over that entire movement I guess I guys this has nothing to do with the average gay and lesbian american who just wants to live their lives in Peace and this has everything to do with a very very very far left sort of transgender Gender identity cold ideology that has taken over that entire movement to the point where most gay and gays and lesbians Do not even want to be involved with it anymore speaking of rob smith. He's a iraq war veteran Political commentator. He's got a new podcast that just launched yesterday can't cancel rob smith Uh, but you can listen to him and you should you should check it out rob. I'm just wondering before Uh before let you go Clay and I have this ongoing discussion and we're just we are so curious that I know maybe it sounds like we're Just a bunch of guys sitting around, you know smoggin cigars trying to figure out the trajectory of the democrat parties politics It is it is kind of a fun game to play but Biden runs again How do they run him again? Given what's going on? But they can't run comela because nobody would vote for comela and they can't replace comela with may or peter Because that wouldn't look good and if they brought hilly out of quasi retirement, I mean What do you think happens? We we go back and forth on this all the time. How do you think this shakes out? I do not think that biden runs again at the top of the taking who's the thing as of right now They're doing a very good job at hiding biden, right? So we see if you're a conservative doing personally or somebody that is just very anti-biting we see all of them as That's we see him struggling with the teleprompters. We see him, you know, not knowing where he is at the time They cannot take that out and run that again in a national election because then everything that we've been talking about the vast majority of the public Is going to say now they also cannot run comela at the top of the ticket as well because she is so deeply unlikable She couldn't get past 1% when she was running I think honestly that that mayor peter is playing his cards, right? I think that he will be on the ticket at some point They're going to have to find something to do with comela Harris But I do not believe that either biden or comela Harris is going to be on any part of that ticket Um in 2024. I do not see that happening comela is too weak. She has failed Um, she is good at being a politician and bat at every single thing else Biden is old. He is weak. He is female looking he is Ineffectual and you cannot put that out in front of the american public in the rigor is that a presidential campaign Would have to sort of get from him. I don't see it happening Rob fantastic stuff. My man. We appreciate it. All right. Thanks guys Guys interest rates are not looking good We can all see that they are rising and they may continue to rise in the future That's means whether it's your mortgage or your credit card anything with an interest rate tied to it You're in jeopardy of having to pay more for the money that you've borrowed You can't let that happen and let those rates get control of you So right now make the time to call american financing get a free mortgage review We've been telling you about it only takes 10 minutes See if there are loan options that can fit your life better and you can do it right now while you can still save up to $1,000 a month plus tens of thousands or even Six figures even a hundred thousand or more on the life of your loan Think about that what that could mean for you and your family Given how much you're trying to save on gas driving from one gas station to another Clipping coupons trying to decide what to buy maybe generic since that a store brand In in the larger cost in the grocery store How about making the right decision?

We're having a good time with all of you uh Apparently the new top gun which is going to come out here in a couple of weeks I can't wait the review of it is that it's uh, well here you go This was on drudge cruise brings fresh excitement of throwback studio hit top gun and um People are saying I mean I saw a video from some who got a sneak peek because they invited They invited former top gun instructors Uh to you know merlin for those of you who watch oh yeah those guys Invited them to go check it out and they said it was um it was really good and people are excited about it It'd be great to have a really excellent theater popcorn movie, you know now that people I think are moving back toward the Going to movies more regularly. I mean not on broadway yet You still have to wear a mask But at least the rest of us can go to movie theaters and not worry about things How about one where american soldiers are heroes like I mean just America is a good guy Right. I mean they pulled cops off television for goodness sakes Uh, I think it's back at fox nation now because everybody decided two years ago that cops were the worst human beings on the planet wins the last really great cop or uh or Soldier movie to be made in america where you leave and you're like man I'm glad that that police officer or that Or that soldier is an american. I can't even remember like there's no, you know the end of top Movies where we're fighting nazis basically. Yeah, right? Hollywood's okay with us being the good guys when we're fighting nazis. That's the good news You know, but remember when you left back in uh when top gun came out buck you were like america Yeah, what a great place to live everybody was super pumped Where are all the I mean look at all these people that are talking about you crane all the time And I want to say where are the rocky four memes? I mean you're not seeing a lot of them right now because that movie Uh was you know, there's a lot of strong political messaging in that movie. I mean, I'll be honest I remember that rocky movie where where you know first obviously apollo creade squares off against i i've in drago And not russian by the way swedish kind of funny, but anyway Um, uh doll flungren, but uh, you know then obviously rocky fights him I remember that movie better than any of the rocky movies. I mean the one that is the most vivid in my mind I'm a little it was came out a little later. I was a little older, but I saw the first rocky movie I went back and saw it's a great movie But rocky four in some ways is the one that really sticks with you Well, I just I hope I hope we're gonna see a pivot swinging back the other direction We started off the show talking about this buck. I mean it's impossible not to notice the overall murder rate skyrocketing in this country And if you remember the 80s and the 90s police officers tended to be heroes, right? They were the people who were You had the buddy cop movie certainly the lethal weapon type era where the cops were not you know morally perfect But they were the heroes of the films and same thing with american soldiers And that's the way you felt when you walked out of top gun I'm looking forward to seeing top gun maverick because I hope i'm coming out being like, yeah american. We're back Do we know who the bad guys are because in the first top gun movies you recall and i've had people Challenged me on this then I said go back and watch it And he never established who the bad guy pilots are they're just flying around with a red star on their now The clear soviet illusion is there yes, but they don't they're not speaking in russian They're not you know that there's no They don't actually i saw ever show you who the which actually makes it a little bit more timeless in some ways in the sense that you Just can kind of you know, you can watch it now and it doesn't feel like it's it's in any way outdated But i'm i'm excited to uh to go check that out and the other thing that caught my eye here clay before we Dive back into the the news the day in a moment here is uh Elon moscow is saying that he thinks that millions were gonna live on mars in 25 years I did now The the what is the movie that you the mars movie that you Most people I guess would say the martian the one that sticks out of my brain the most is total recall Do you remember that one? I didn't even remember the mars connection to total total it's on mars Okay, get your get your i can say that it was on mars. I knew it was in the future 11 I asked permission to clay Around Yeah, that that's all in mars. So that's a mars movie I gotta say that it was set on mars. I knew it was set in the future Oh, yeah, I remember that it was there most of the whole movie takes place on mars basically That that I gotta say i'm No, I don't know about that elon's brilliant guy. I hope he saves twitter and saves free speech with it But i like what would it take? Clay For you if you were a young guy put aside, you know all the professional stuff and everything if you're 22 years old What would it take for you to be like? Yeah? I'm gonna go check on mars for a few years like I just don't see how that's possible Well, it would take first of all knowing that you could come back from mars That's the biggest you know a lot of these people who go to mars first If are maybe never going to be able to return from mars so i'm not that excited i'm not a space travel guy I understand there's some people out there who are like i would give anything to go into space and You know whatever i i'm not begrudging anybody from that But there's lots of places on our globe that I haven't been I haven't been to australia I'd much rather go to australia right now than go to uh the the suborbital Space to be able to look at the globe right so until i've seen everything that I want to see on america I'm not too concerned about going to another planet I think probably most people are the same as me But to go at a minimum to go to mars You would have to be able to guarantee me that I could easily return from mars if I decided I didn't want to be there anymore Yeah, I don't know I don't even like being on a boat that isn't inside of shore so I don't think mars is in my feet That's my rule by the way if I can't see land i'm not happy I'm not a boat guy But you know I lived in the caribbean on an island for a while And I didn't mind living so I I got my law license in the us virgin islands Uh, and I didn't mind living on an island, but even there Eventually you want bigger places so like we would hop a plane and go to san wah in portorico Which was like new york city to us i'm pretty sure this is almost exactly like a 90s sitcom screenplay By the way clay in flip flops and shorts is like the island lawyer. I think there was a vet veterinarian Uh, that was it went down to the kribbian and then he's like, you know, anyway, so it sounds like that Yeah, no 100% I would wear flip flops into the office And then I kept real shoes underneath my desk So that was uh, that was it was a flip flop lawyer indeed We've got kennedy from fox business and fox news join us here in just a little bit Talked more about inflation and biden and sky high prices. Oh my clay and buck stick with us You"
