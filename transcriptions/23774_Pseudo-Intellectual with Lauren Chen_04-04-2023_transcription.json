    "text": " Sadly, it looks like not even country music is safe from the woke mind virus you see earlier this week were the Country Music Television Awards and frankly, there was as much liberal virtue signaling as you would expect from any mainstream Hollywood event. As Breitbart News explained, CMT Music Awards go woke Kelsey Ballerini stands in solidarity with drag queen seeking child audiences. Now, I'm going to let you guys in on a little secret that even though I do live in Nashville and even though I am conservative, I actually am not super into country music. And I almost feel like that's not really something I should be admitting, less I anger in if you're watching this, but it's true, which is not something that I really grew up listening to and I don't dislike it, but it's not what I personally would choose to listen to or what I would seek out. However, what I do know about country music is that in general, or traditionally, maybe not now, it tends to lean more conservative than things like rock music or pop or rap or anything like that. Just because it's more popular in the South and Southerners do tend to be more conservative and so a lot of country music stars, or at least previously used to be conservative themselves or at the very least, they knew that enough of their audiences were that they would not really talk about politics, especially not if they were liberals. And if you want an example of just how controversial it used to be for a country star to be, I guess, on the left, just take a look at what has happened to the Dixie chicks who I think now go by the chicks ever since they started just trash talking George Bush, which I don't even really blame them for, but it's like they weren't trash talking him for the right reasons. But it seems like over the last few years, at least a lot of things have changed. Now there are some country stars who have really, I guess, pushed back on left wing influence in the culture. And I'm talking about people like John Rich, but apparently as you say that social justice and heckeven drag queens had more support at the CMT awards than you may have thought. A co-host of the annual awards show with singer Kane Brown opened the Austin Texas show by listing the names of six victims, three adults and three nine year olds, who were killed Monday at the Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee. She noted how she shared their pain explaining that in 2008. She witnessed a school shooting in her hometown high school cafeteria in Knoxville and prayed for real action that would protect children and family. So I am glad that this person who I will fully admit I am not familiar with. I don't listen to her music, but I think it's good that she acknowledged these victims, especially considering that she is from Tennessee. However, I will just say here, even though I guess praying for change to protect families sounds kind of vague and there are definitely policies that conservative support that will protect children in schools. We're talking about things like increased security or maybe even arming teachers. I want to be clear that those policies are not what the singer was talking about. She was referring to gun control. And I know this because the CMT awards as a whole, just like the entire platform, they also announced a partnership with a gun control organization. Yeah, they apparently used their 2023 music awards to announce a new partnership with Sandy Hook Promise, a gun control group founded after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Well, a music award ceremony partnering with such a political group is strange to me. I don't know why we've just decided that everything must be political, including our music awards. But so there are a lot of people who I know listen to country music who probably aren't going to appreciate this partnership. And if you thought the only problem here was gun control, you'd be wrong. Because you see later on in the show, it's written that the Tennessee native saying, if you go down, I'm going down to and dance with Kennedy Davenport, Jan Sport, Manila, Lousin, and Olivia Lux, all stars of the show RuPaul's Drag Race. Her home state of Tennessee was the first to play strict limits on drag show performances, which were said to take effect this month. It's also written that the law has been temporarily blocked after a lawsuit was filed earlier this week. And on Twitter, the singer wrote, if you go down, I'm going down to with a rainbow flag. Thank you to these iconic queens. She'd been listed their names for celebrating love, self-expression, and performance. Okay, so there are a lot of people out there who are good people and well-meaning who support gun control. I can understand that. However, when it comes to opposition to Tennessee's recent bans on drag performances for minors and gender affirming, i.e. mutilating surgeries for minors, I'm not really interested in giving people the benefit of the doubt. Okay? It is not okay to sexualize children. It is not okay to mutilate and sterilize children. If you are someone who's ever bought one of these singer's records, make it the last time. Please know that this is somebody who thinks it's okay and actually a good thing, something to be celebrated when children are exposed to lewd acts as long as it's men in drag who are doing them. And also it's okay that women, I guess, young girls have their breasts cut off. Like, don't be mistaken. This is exactly what the singer is saying when she comes out in opposition to Tennessee's policies. That or she's just too stupid to know what she's talking about, but doesn't know enough to shut up about it. There's not really a positive way to see this whole thing. And I wish I could say that was where the liberal influence of the night ended, but unfortunately that's not the case we have more to get to, but first I want to say thank you to today's sponsor, Nefarious. There is a new movie coming out and I'm pretty sure you're going to want to see it. It's by the same people who made God's not dead and unplanned. It's called Nefarious. If you've seen the posters or trailers, you will know that it looks amazing, but it also looks a little scary like a horror film, but the thing is it's not, and best of all, it's based on a book by the blaze's own Steve Day. So that's just really exciting. You see, it's more like the CS Lewis book, the Screwtape Letters. I like to call it interview with a demon. A psychiatrist is called into a prison to me with a convicted killer who's about to be executed, but the killer, here's the thing, says he's a demon named Nefarious and the psychiatrist who doesn't believe in God or demons has to decide if the man is insane, pretending to be insane or well, I won't give it away, but let's just say that the psychiatrist is a little bit out of his death. This supernatural thriller is perfect for your friends who love scary films, but more than that, they also love going to church and you're going to have some great conversations afterwards. Nefarious opens nationwide the weekend of April 14th. I know I'm absolutely going to be in line to see it. Mark the day and get your tickets now at whoisnefarious.com again, that is whoisnefarious.com. So I really question why this award exists at all, but apparently, Country superstar and five-time Grammy winner Shania Twain was given the Equal Play Award, recognizing her for being a visible and vocal advocate for diverse voices in country music. What, I mean, that just, this award existing at all, I think goes to show that country music as an institution, it's been infiltrated by Vokeness and I'd say that as someone who I don't want to say I like Shania Twain because I don't know enough of her songs, but I like so of her songs and, you know, she's Canadian, so I know that. And if this award champion diversity just wasn't bad enough, check out Shania Twain's acceptance speech. I promise I will continue to champion the many outstanding country artists who are not currently played, they're not streamed towards signed or awarded at the level they deserve. So I believe in an all-inclusive country music or family, that us, the country music industry, do our part to close the gap and provide an equal workspace for all talents. I am so tired of how many people nowadays feel the need to be affirmed in everything they do. It's like every brand needs to affirm that we support LGBT voices, we support women, we support black people. It's like, you know, people who are actually confident and competent, they don't need all of this external validation, they just go out and they do. And you can see from the results that they get that they are worth it and worth investing in, I just can't stand the insecurity, the narcissism, the attention seeking that social justice has really conditioned so many, especially Gen Z people to expect. And now this didn't happen at the CMT Awards, but considering it's in the country music sphere, I thought I would include it here as well. Reba McIntyre apparently is not a fan of Tennessee's laws either. Reba McIntyre, at least I'm pretty sure she's, she's country. Anyway, she recently gave an interview where she said she was disappointed in Tennessee. She was asked, what do you think about the bill that Tennessee Governor Bill Lee recently signed into law restricting drag performances in certain parts of the state? She says, I wish they would spend that much time and energy and money on feeding the homeless children in those two counties. She also said she was disappointed the bill was passed and continue to say, we've got a real problem in this country and to be worrying about men wanting to dress up as women, God bless them to wear those high heels. I feel for him, but let's send her our attention on something that really needs attention. So at the same time in this interview, Reba also said that she didn't want to tell people who to vote for. She wasn't a politician. She was a singer and entertainer. But I mean, still you're making statements like this. You are involving yourself in politics. You can always refuse to answer these questions. And these people act as if the right just one day woke up and was like, you know what? F the drag queen. It's like you completely ignore all of the viral footage we have of men, grown men giving lap dances to small children, stripping down to BDSM gear and performing in front of them. It's like, it's outrageous. And so same with the singer earlier, Reba, you have absolutely no excuse. You are defending groomers. You are encouraging pedophilia. And I say you either shut up or you educate yourself because you look like a damn fool right now. And ultimately, if you are a country music fan, you're probably in the best position because there are so many country music stars out there who aren't woke, who aren't caving into the left's agenda. Why not go support them? Why keep giving your money to people who hate you? And you know what? Years ago, I probably would have said, oh, we can just support the artists and not necessarily, you know, have to agree with their political opinions. But frankly, I'm past that. I'm tired of that. I'm at a point now where my husband and I, we've actually turned around when we've seen rainbow flags at establishment because it's like, I don't want to support people who frankly, not only are just probably anti my values, but are also at the very least complicit in the attempts to groom and trans my child. I'm just not about that life anymore. And if you ask me the reason why the right is in such a terrible position, at least in terms of the culture, it's because for too long, we rolled over and let the left do whatever they want, bring politics as much as they wanted into the public sphere. While we stayed out of it, we can no longer afford to stay out of things though. That's pretty much all I have to say for now.
