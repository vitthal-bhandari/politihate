    "text": " Hi everybody, Dennis Prager here with both dogs. Otto who's gonna leave early, I'm sorry to say this is the new Otto and here is Snoopy who might stay for the entire half hour because he loves being rubbed. Snoop. Anyway, Dennis Prager here, fireside chat number 273. 273. That's my chance to talk to you about what's online. I'm going to take your questions completely unscripted and I want to share with you a thought on one of the most important things in your life in any of our lives. A new study has come out on happiness. I always get a kick out of these studies. You know my view of studies. I have said it. I don't know if I've said it on a fireside chat but I've said it for much of my life. Studies are largely useless because they either confirm what is suggested by common sense or they're not accurate. In my life, I've encountered one study that went against common sense and turned out to be accurate and I believe truth is number one. So I acknowledge it was it is that couples that live together prior to marriage have a higher divorce rate when they marry which is counterintuitive because you would think that couples that live together know each other better are more used to living with one another, configure out are we compatible and then and I'm not talking about religious issues of premarital living together or anything like it just on the face of it statistically but the reason it gave was so convincing as counterintuitive as it is. It turned out to be very commonsensical. So really as I say they do confirm common sense or they're generally wrong and this was in a nutshell, people who live together if things aren't great, it's much harder to break up when you're dating someone if you live together than if you don't live together because it's really as emotionally wrenching as a divorce in many ways. So people who would have broken up premaritaly don't break up or are less likely to break up if they're living together. So I did not think of that on my own and that was a very good study but otherwise they don't tell me anything new. But if you're a big fan of studies and a lead colleges Harvard just came out with a massive study on happiness. I've written a book on happiness, I have many lectures on YouTube and elsewhere on happiness and I've done of course an hour of my radio show for 23 years now every Friday the second hour. I've never missed a Friday that I broadcast. I mean sometimes I just have on vacation but I've never missed a Friday that I broadcast and gotten rid of the happiness hour. That's very important to me. So I have said for years you must have friends. Friends make the journey of life infinitely more absorbable not to mention enjoyable. I have even said for years you should date for friends just like you dated for a spouse or you should date for friends like you date for a spouse and that includes after you get married. You need friends if you're married just not just like but very similarly to meeting friends before you were ever married. Ideally you're married to your best friend that's the ideal but even so it is great to have them and I'm specifically referring to same-sex friends. It's a whole other issue maybe we'll do one time why I am ambivalent about opposite-sex friendships as a general rule. General rules always have exceptions. It is so powerful according to all these studies that not having close friendships is as dangerous to your health as smoking, as obesity, as well as not moving around. I mean it was amazing. In other words maybe if you want to smoke and be obese make sure you have a lot of friends. I've been blessed with very close male friends all of my life. It started in sixth grade interestingly enough. I didn't think oh it's important for me to have a male friend. I just knew it. I just did it and it's never been different since since sixth grade till today and I have a world of spectacular friends. In fact people call my radio show and they will often say Dennis if you could have dinner or lunch with anyone in the world, any living person, who would you choose? I get that periodically and I answer them honestly, my friends. I can't think of anybody. I rather have lunch or dinner with than my friends. Okay so you need to know that and my fear is that the electronic world that so many of you, especially under 30 let's say live in maybe now under 40, is to say the least not helping you have real friends. There is no comparison between electronic communication and real life. And by the way I text a lot and I think it's, first of all I find it invaluable in my life because so much is achieved. It's gotten done but there's no substitute for getting together with people. And I'll tell you another thing that you need to understand for friendship is that you need to find a kindred spirit. It is very important that you share the deepest values with that person. You don't have to agree on everything but on the deepest things it really helps. So anyway you need friends. You should do everything you can to cultivate it, have time together with them, have meals together, go to a movie together, do anything together but together it has been the great strength of my life my friends. Okay let's go to your questions and we begin with a video or the video question. Hi my name is Katie. I am 20 years old from Los Angeles, California and my question for you is what do you think of an Article 5 Convention of States? Now how many 20 year olds in the United States know about the Article 5 Convention of States idea? I'm just curious. So you are you exceptional. Is it Katie? Yeah that's really remarkable. So this is a convention. By the way we have the best answer is actually already given at PragerU a video by Jim Dement, former US Senator South Carolina I believe and it's a PragerU video on the Article 5 Convention. So you should watch that and really get a very informed answer. It is about getting the states together. A certain number have to vote yes and then you could have a convention with regard to adding some or one amendment to the US Constitution. And ideally I would love to see certain things added. For example most people don't know this but I don't remember which amendment it is that allowed for an income tax. The United States before the 20th century never had an income tax. Taxes were paid excise taxes and import taxes and a whole host of taxes but not an income tax. You were allowed to keep the money that you earned which sounds to be to be the moral approach to keep to money. That stopped it started at 1% and now it's 50% which is what happens with everything that touches government. It grows and it grows just like the government grows and grows. There are a whole host of things that people have thought of that might work for example term limits that people should not be allowed to serve in Congress more than two terms because the ideal when America was set up was to have regular human beings take time off from their career and serve their fellow countrymen in Congress or as a governor, senator representative whatever. And now we have a lot of people whose entire life is politics. That's not a healthy thing for the country. It's not a healthy thing well it may be healthy for them because a lot very few people who spent a lot of time in Congress are poor. How did they get that wealthy? How did the President of the United States get so wealthy just as a senator and then as a vice president? How do you get wealthy? It's certainly not on the salary of a public official. It's a tragedy because what does it power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely said Lord acted in the 19th century? It's not good to have a class of politicians. Be that as it may it's hard to imagine in such a divided America that we could get three quarters of the states to ratify an amendment but I'll tell you the one that I'm the biggest fan of even more than term limits is to get rid of the income tax and have what's called a consumption tax where you're not taxed on what you earn you're taxed on what you spend. So every time you spend money there's an added tax Europeans have it it's called the value added tax. The problem is they have an income tax and a consumption tax. I would like to get rid of the income tax. Maybe I should even do or a few some thoughts on another occasion on why the income tax is so destructive especially morally it makes a nation of cheats and there's a reason for that. How much better a consumption tax would be for the economy and for the moral health of a society. Okay we'll move on here. David 22 new town Connecticut why did you decide on talk radio was your career? P.S. I missed you having your cigar on the fireside chat. By the way if we really move enough people over to Prager you I could resume my cigar smoking. It was Facebook that said we can't broadcast you if you smoke a cigar. It's such a it's things are so upside down in in in so many ways in our society that that's corrupting. You can take five year olds to see a drag queen provocatively dance that's fine but to see an adult smoke a cigar oh that's corrupting the youth. You see what I mean it's it's very it's very unhealthy stuff. But anyway I I miss it too. Now why did I decide on talk radio? I actually talk radio decided on me but the real answer is this and I think I've mentioned this when I was in high school I wrote I kept a diary for a few years and I wrote in my diary we still have it I pray somewhere. I know what I want to do with my life I want to influence people to the good those were the words I used. I think it was my junior year in high school third year in high school. So whatever enabled me to talk or write or speak well it's the same as talk to as many people as possible that was perfect for me and so talk radio became the vehicle and now obviously the internet and that's it. I want to touch people. I I knew I believed at a very early age that I had healthy and good ideas for a better life and if you believe that I guess you do because otherwise you wouldn't be watching this. Sarah 23 years old Lancaster hello I know this is a touchy subject. Uh oh. This is not a question to be hateful but about personal conviction concerning my religion. I work at a retail store here soon we are supposed to set up a section specifically for gay pride month that has a sign expressing it along with wearables and decorations. I would be responsible for setting it up. I really don't feel good about doing that. I am the assistant manager though so it's expected of me. Our district manager checks up on us often to make sure everything is done and we also have to mark it off in the system. I work with people of the LGBT plus community. They are lovely people. I don't want to be offensive but there's a difference between being friends and promoting something God is not for. What would you suggest I do? This is a very tough one and putting even the what did you say something God is not for? Yes. Okay so even if one says what if you don't believe God is for or against it? God isn't God for love and so on. This is a very complex issue. I don't find it healthy the whole notion of having these public and gay pride presentations. US embassies around the world had gay pride flags up at the embassy. There are a lot of even if you think it is the most wonderful cause there are many wonderful causes but it's always the left that does this however. I mean there are people who believe that abortion is immoral unless you're saving them others life. So would any embassy in the United States, would any retail store put up signs? Adoption is more moral than abortion just as an example. Of course not because they're so afraid of the left. Nobody's afraid of the right. It's not a healthy trend. Why can't we leave spaces untouched by political messages? That's the way it was in the past. Stores didn't put up political messages because they knew a great portion of their clientele may not agree with it. Whether it's even if it's a good idea. My gay friends don't believe in gay pride presentations. They believe that we should respect people who are gay, that we should needless to say tolerate it, that we should not make it illegal. But what is it being pride? Do we have heterosexual pride month? We have straight pride month? I mean if they wouldn't it be nice if we had let's say parent pride month? We can't even do that. The only thing we're supposed to be proud of is is same-sex sexual orientation and people who say that they are the opposite sex of the biological one they were born. And that's a very big problem. I never understood why the T was with the LGB. I never understood it. I asked this 20 years ago, what does trans have to do with gay or lesbian? It has nothing to do with it. And my gay and lesbian friends are totally in agreement. In fact they think it hurts their cause because they're lumped together and while a lot of people are completely accepting of people who are gay, a lot of people are not accepting with the idea that a biological man competes against a woman in women's sports or that a man shows his genitalia to young girls in a shower in San T California has happened a couple of weeks ago. And think about it. Do we take pride? That's part of the LGBT pride. I'm proud of you for showing your penis to young girls. That's what this guy did in a shower at a YMCA in San T California you can look it up. 17 year old girl to her credit protested. I don't want to see that thank you. But all he has to do is say I'm a woman and you're forced to be there and with him. Unless you don't want to be in the YMCA at all or shower there at all. What is the pride? Are you proud of this person that did that? Are you proud of the of the biological males who compete against women and women's sports? I'm not proud of them at all. I'm ashamed of them. They're cheats. Every male who competes against females is a cheat period, a narcissistic cheat. That people can't say this, that girls compete in this because they're so afraid at the University of Pennsylvania where it happened for example. The girls on the swim team who lost out because this guy kept winning or this woman kept winning. I don't care what you called this person. The person's a cheat. They were cheated out of their wins of possible scholarships to college of a whole host of things. But they all competed because they were so afraid that the University of Pennsylvania would ruin their records and it would. University of Pennsylvania is leadership like almost every college leadership is composed of cowards. This is a very real problem. What does it mean? Pride. What is the pride to be taken? I'm proud of you for exposing yourself in a shower. So here's the way it works. If you expose yourself to a girl in a shower, you go to prison. But if you expose yourself to a girl in the shower and say you're a girl, you're fine. I'm supposed to take pride in that. That is an embarrassment to our civilization. And America is the worst in the world in this regard, the worst. They're not doing any of the work on trans like we are of cutting girls breasts off, for example, in Sweden, Finland, and 13 other European countries like we are in the United States. They closed down the biggest trans hospital in England just recently because they realized how many kids they were hurting. Do you take pride in that? But if you said this to your retail manager, you'd be fired. That's what you fear. I have no good answer for you in the final analysis. Look, if enough people did say I am not part of this, I don't want to politicize the store, and I don't take pride in the damage being done to young kids in this country. That from the age of two telling them, oh, yes, true, you really are a girl when it's a boy. And their whole whole answer to everything I said is not to answer anything I said. It's to say this is transphobic. The left doesn't debate. The left doesn't argue. The left smears. You don't agree with them. You're six herb. An acronym I made up many years ago, S-I-X-H-I-R-B, sexist and tolerant, xenophobic, homophobic, Islamophobic, racist, bigoted. Let's a teacher at Hamlin University, an art teacher, put up a drawing of Muhammad done by Muslims, done by Muslims, religious Muslims in the 15th century, and she was fired by Hamlin University. That's what they do. They didn't argue. They didn't have a hearing on the issue. Did you do this to hurt Muslims? Of course not. Muslims are totally divided on this issue anyway, and it was Muslims who drew the original painting of Muhammad. But some Muslims today believe that even to paint the picture, you've committed blasphemy. But how do you commit blasphemy in another religion? By the way, there's an exhibit called Piss Christ. This is years ago already, an artist put a crucifix in a jar of his urine. Now that is truly humiliating and insulting to a Christian. I'm not a Christian, and I find it humiliating and insulting. You put a crucifix in your jar of your urine, but you know what? It went from museum to museum in America. But you can't show a painting of Muhammad, a painting, a respectful painting from the 15th century. By the way, they apologize because the uproar in the country against Hamlin University was so great. It's too late. The president of the university should resign. But nobody resigns. Anybody at Southwest Airline? Airline's resigned? Isn't that amazing or get fired? How many hundreds of thousands of Americans had their vacations and their trips to weddings ruined because Southwest became so utterly incompetent? You get fired if you say anything that the Left differs with, but not for incompetence and not for intolerance. We've got a lot of battles in this country. And if you're watching from outside this country, don't let these ideas enter your country. I mean, you can't censor. I'm against censorship. But don't be persuaded by them. So I feel for you that you have to put up a pride thing. By the way, I would feel for a left winger who had to put up a right wing message that I agree with. That's not the job of a retail store or the NFL or the NBA or the NHL. That's the different sports leagues in America. If I go to a football game, I just want to see football and cheer along with the next person seated near me. We both root for the same team, whether we're on the right or the left. It's one of the beauties of sports. But the left has decided to politicize sports like they are your retail store. This is a tragic development. As an intense day today, what can I say? But these are intense issues. Read my column, by the way, my column this week at Dennis Prager.com, Town Hall, and American greatness and Daily Wire. My column every week comes out on Tuesdays. I ask a question, who's more irrational? The religious or the irreligious? It's something to think about. All right. Thanks for being with me. Dennis Prager here. See you next week."
