I want you to know we are lucky to have Charlie Kirk. Charlie Kirk's running the White House folks. I want to thank Charlie. He's an incredible guy. His spirit, his love of this country. He's done an amazing job building one of the most powerful youth organizations ever created turning point USA. We will not embrace the ideas that have destroyed countries, destroyed lives and we are going to fight for freedom on campuses across the country. That's why we are here. Brought to you by the loan experts I trust Andrew and Todd at CR Pacific Mortgage at Andrew and Todd.com. Joining us now is one of our favorite guests citizen free press.com citizen Kane joins us. Kane thank you for taking the time. A lot happening in the news cycle. Kane you and I were talking all spring about how they were going to indict Trump. Here we are now post labor day. The summer of indictments it's not yet over more indictments are coming. But where do you stand Kane? You do this 18, 20 hours a day. Expectations versus reality is Trump stronger than you thought he would be now facing 600 years in federal prison. Yeah thanks for having me on Charlie and I would say an emphatic yes to your first question. You know that was the big right when you and I were dealing with this three months ago five months ago that was our big unknown right as we knew the indictments were coming but we didn't know how the voters would respond. And so we were sort of looking you know as much as we hate polls and know all the problems with polls that was our only our only way forward and we've been sort of looking for this. So there was a poll out yesterday done after the most recent Georgia indictment and Trump you know well I think the last time I was on we talked about one poll he was leading 49 41 in swing states that was McLaughlin or McLaughlin poll and then a poll came out yesterday Wall Street Journal showing him dead even with Biden and we've started to see these sort of fearful articles from Washington Post and New York Times just wringing their hands wondering why aren't Trump's numbers, why aren't his poll numbers falling? So I think we have the first answer to the question which is the lay of the land foreign indictments out Trump has not been hurt in fact he has been helped and and now we'll just have to sort of cross our fingers and watch if this changes as we head into the actual trials. So the Republican primary seems largely to be over it now talk for a second can and we'll play some pieces of tape here to reinforce this the media is now waking up that these indictments did not have the effect that they would have hoped that Donald Trump is now turning into a martyr your thoughts. With that our doubt I mean I'm sure you saw what happened on Twitter after the Fulton County thing we had it seemed like a pretty large percentage of the of the black voter population in Atlanta suddenly jumped to Trump's side. I think Jack Smith and Merrick Garland probably you know like all the all the never Trumpers on the Republican side I think they completely underestimated this you know it you know it isn't unknown you and I weren't exactly sure how the electorate would react to to all these indictments and I think that they just bought into conventional wisdom and assumed that as soon as uh as soon as these indictments started to flow that the electorate would turn away and they had no idea that it might actually not only turn people away but it might grab some independence who normally wouldn't lean for Trump who suddenly see hey the system is stacked against him so I think you know Charlie six months ago we could not have asked knowing that these indictments were coming we could not have asked for a better first six-week outcome in the polls than we've had. I totally I see it exactly the same way I want to play a piece of tape here that reinforces it let's go to cut 16. This is going to be a close election they can't take anything for granted um it is they should assume it's going to be decided by perhaps tens of thousands of voters in the swing states that we all know about and and they better get cracking now because um there's a real risk yeah so kane this is going to come down just a couple states a couple counties isn't this exactly what we've been saying for the last seven or eight months yeah and that was a great find with that clip it's on the um people want to watch that full discussion it's on or in the stack um uh from yesterday which you found you were the one who originally found it and that's what you've been talking about you know this is a six or this is a three or four swing state six or seven county deal it's part of the wide turning point USA is funded Scott Pressler and his movement in in Wisconsin to the tune of five million even though Ron you know ronah ronnie and the and the rnc are nowhere to be found so yeah we've been saying this and I think you know I think again it was sort of the arrogance of the left they've always no matter how many times they've been proven wrong they've always thought the next indictment or the next shoe to drop was going to be the one that brought down trump i think they ought to be able to see at this point that the guy is teflon it does or you know the base the base is sticking with trump no matter what as you said two minutes ago sort of the primary seems to be a theta complete at this point and and and so the left has continually underestimated the base and they underestimated how people would react to these indictments and see them as overkill and it's finally showing up on msmbc and it is and yes hearing him hearing robinson say that that's exactly what i heard you for say eight months ago you said this is six counties seven counties eight counties this is not a huge election and we need to we need to focus our effort on those counties yes we want to win yeah we've been saying this for seven or eight months and again the republican d.c. consultants they don't like that you know why can't they're not going to get rich that way if we went all in on seven counties donald trump is president but they they want to do this kind of well maybe a little bit of here and a little bit of there in tv and california and tv in new york the consultants are they are there's a word i could use but i won't use it they're they're leaking you dry let's just put it that way so so kane i want to now isolate this other part of this and the 14th amendment like one of the reasons i love citizen free press you're out you're on the drum beat it's it was totally coordinated david french lorance tribe atlantic new york times get rid of elections democracy and elections are incompatible and now here we are lawsuits introduced in colorado to prevent donald trump from being on the ballot tane you've been watching this very closely what's going on well i've been doing two or three headlines on it every single day yesterday the washing employees washington post join the chorus we've you know there's a lot of things happening here so i'll spit them out we've had the arizona secretary of state already say that it's not going to happen in arizona that arizona law will not allow 14th amendment challenged to trump so trump is going to be safe in arizona but we know that joslyn benson the secretary of state in michigan has already said that she's you know not only is she looking at this but she gave away some interesting details in in in the articles she said that she's talking on a daily basis with other secretaries of state in other blue states about just this issue so there's some coordination going on regarding this 14th amendment and i'm sure you know you read this stuff like i do right so so i'm reading hundreds of these articles a day some of them pertain to the 14th amendment and you know what's in every single 14th amendment article the first thing they bring up are the republicans at i believe it was heritage i could be wrong if it wasn't heritage foundation but it was a couple of republicans and then they lead right into the larry tribe so they try to claim that this 14th amendment movement is somehow bipartisan you know and it's incredibly infuriating because we know that 90 percent of the republican base absolutely would not support this and we've even seen in polls that independence um feel that this is you know that this is uh this is bad pool this is not it's not fair pool it's not how you play the game they can tell that something's wrong there so so the 14th amendment movement is strong you it's not me actually charlie it was you you are the one who alerted me to it we've been watching your show my site we've been watching this closely for two months and it's really really been rolling out in the last three four weeks but last thing i'm going to say is and all of these articles on the 14th amendment when you finally get down to the last couple of paragraphs they all admit that this is going to be this that these are long shots and that these this is going to be decided by the supreme court so whether it's california or what other blue state decides to bring this up first i think it will quickly go to the supreme court who will and this is purely my opinion but i think they will want to put an end to this as quickly as possible so that there are no issues when producing ballots for all of these states and so i think we're going to slide by this one but we're definitely watching it closely listen as students begin heading back to school do you think they'll be learning about the founding principles that made america the friez most prosperous nation history will they learn that our unalienable rights are god-given and not granted by government will they be given a full and honest account of our nation's history the answer to all these questions is yes for students at hillsdale

more about hillsdale and in primus at charlie for hillsdale.com they're an excellent college america's greatest college charlie for hillsdale.com there's the story citizen kane here's what happens so there's a young man in arkansas who was present at the capital on january six who now two and a half years later was indicted the feds roll up you have the video at citizen free press.com as if they're you know trying to storm the beach again more more firepower more artillery against american citizens than the foreigners invading and border jumping into our country on the southern border anyway so they contact liberty safe the fbi does and say hey we need the password to this safe allegedly they had a warrant and liberty safe says okay liberty safe could have sued like apple did with the terror cell phones they could have sent out a press release saying the fbi's asking us for private information and we don't feel comfortable with this they could have done anything yet they complied your guns are not safe with liberty safe citizen kane yeah this is an astonishing story i just want to do double check because i'd quickly read the public statement liberty safe now that this is kind of blowing up on social media and people are calling for a boycott liberty safe issued a second you know public statement and i can breathe from it it's astonishing you know it one of the craziest parts of it is says liberty safe had no knowledge of any of the details surrounding the investigation at the time so what they're saying in their statement is is as long as we get a warrant yep we will comply a hundred percent and they showed and that they went ahead and admitted that they didn't do any investigation they had no idea what the case was the warrant was presented to them so they complied so they're not taking it seriously at all you brought up apple that was the first thing that came to mind that even apple fought for the privacy of its customers they know left wing apple liberty safe left wing apple fought harder for your privacy rights than a safe company yeah it's astonishing i would expect this company to be filing for chapter 11 in the next 12 months this is you know gun people the the um the left the left should have learned the lesson from bud light they showed that showed how strong we can be and how well sort of oiled our social media sharing is this one is going to go nuts i've got four headlines in the out of 25 or 30 so far today in the stack on it i imagine this story is going to get bigger and bigger over the next 48 hours the company's going to end up apologizing because they're going to see that they're that probably the future of their business at stake it is truly astonishing we need to mobilize we need to say no more if you own a liberty safe return it immediately your guns are not safe with liberty safe they literally just hand over the password with your guns now this is important people say oh well charlie had a warrant they could have sued you can sue when you get a warrant you can you can immediately sue they gave over the passcode to the firearms they could have sued in federal court and said no we're not going to give a second amendment right protected we're not going to give over a passcode and so by the way liberty safe says this they say they make their customers hire a locksafe if elok smith if they lose their passcode why well interesting the feds if they want in your safe they'll just immediately ask them to send your code so if you own a liberty safe the fbi has a backdoor channel to all of your weapons can your reaction that's yeah that little tidbit you just supplied was is stunning so you know if they're like every other tech company every other company we deal with when you know hire an outside service to get access to your own product your own property but the you know within minutes from the fbi providing them with a with a warrant they turn it over here's you know they missed a huge opportunity here charlie you and i should be in charge should be involved in these corporate boards imagine if they've taken the office attack and they said no we're going to go public with this we're going to turn this into the biggest first amendment second amendment case of the last two or three years and you could have got people like dershowitz yep jonathan tearly sort of center of the road libertarian type people all involved this could have become a huge issue and their company would have floated would have gotten so much positive press they would have it would have they would have to be you know gun owners who have never heard of liberty safe suddenly would have known that this is the company that stands up for the rights and what would have would it have cost them nothing they would have gotten free legal representation i'm sure that this would have been a huge first second amendment issue so they blew it they blew it bigly and that's why i said i think we're gonna they're gonna realize it in the next 24 or 48 hours and we'll see what kind of response they have but but there's no mercy it doesn't matter i i want i want to put that out it does not matter what apologies come they are done as far as pay-free it's not concerned liberty safe should never pass the threshold of your house again i personally i do not have liberty safe anybody i care about i'm gonna say return it you need a real safe where the feds cannot get back and access to your weapons i mean and they just handed over oh sure you have a warrant that what you sue you or you do some sort of civil rights like hold on our customers privacy we're not going to hand it over it is a constitutional right fed on by the way this is not it this is an indictment this is a search warrant we're not going to hand it over liberty safe would have gone up instead they're going down chapter 11 is in their sites patriots will not put up with this we're gonna have to do what we did the target and many others and they will feel the wrath of the conservative movement peacefully obviously as they go through a restructuring bankruptcy process kane wonderful job thank you citizen free press dot com

joins us doctor gorka thank you for taking the time doctor gorka no real agenda for us to talk about in particular but one thing i do want to ask you about is i believe we're living through an attempt by the bad guys to demoralize our base and i'm seeing the opposite i'm seeing our side grow stronger in resolve talk about the psychological warfare of how marxists attempt to try to break the resolve of the core base of a political party to take over a country well look first things first the proof of the the lie that we're losing steam and momentum is what you did monday before last when we heard about this rhinos secretary of state in new hamshah scandal and trying to remove president trump from the ballads you unleashed the hammers of hell on your show you told everybody to get engaged in in less than 24 hours he said oops sorry i didn't mean that and he backed down so god bless you charlie everybody who listens to your rallying cry and that's the truth i've had it i mean you must get this every day as well i've had it with ostensible conservatives trump voters i met one at a church fate two sundays ago who says oh oh he can't win or or they're just gonna steal it again and it's like you know those are the talking points the left has generated for you to propagate that psychological warfare just watch the the video from the 1980s of this soviet double agent this i think your best manoff please yes yeah yourie besman of if you haven't seen it you're just watch the short version the short version he says you can demoralize a whole nation it takes about 10 to 12 years and you do it in the schools and within 10 years if you allow the children to doubt the veracity of the values upon which the nation is founded you've taken control of that country yourie besmanoff told us and that's i think why are you created turning point USA because that's how we stop them charlie and that's what you're doing that's right and it takes effort and it takes deliberate obedience to the values you care about to the divine to not allow these intentional demoralization tactics to wear you down and so there's this clip from donabra zil we played it a couple times yesterday but i'm gonna paraphrase it we might play it again dr gorka but i want your reaction where she basically said i've never seen a movement quite like this and yes the odds are stacked against us right they have the intel agencies they have the major corporations they have obviously the media they have social media donald trump is facing 600 years in prison but i am encouraged in fact i have hope with how the conservative base whatever you want to call it the mega base has a new spirit a new resolve we still have to shake off kind of the the skeletons of pants and christy who are complete waste of time but no matter it's the old nicha quote which is not always true in politics what doesn't kill you makes you stronger she actually quotes this dr gorka we've never seen anything like this before no i i'd still would love to know the real reasons she said that because this isn't a good woman this isn't an honest woman remember this is the woman that gave hillary clinton the questions beforehand surreptitiously during the dnc primary debate that that's who donald brazil is maybe she's you know this is a wake up called hay democrats you need to take d Donald seriously unlike in 2016 remember till the final moment what did they say about my former boss they said this is a joke he doesn't mean it this is a pr stunt they didn't take him seriously but even then what happened here's the silver lining we spent 700 million dollars on that campaign hillary clinton officially that we know of spent 1.4 billion she outspent the mega movement by a factor of 100 percent and still she won so despite everything arrayed against us we can still win but if you listen to that quote it's really interesting because she says a couple of things number one she called the reagan movement what does she say it reactionary which is Marxist language why is donald brazil using Marxist language about conservatism and then she said and he's been convicted oops charged like you know that that when the quiet part is set out loud right right and then and then lastly this point that you you made that you know we have to take him seriously why look at what they've done right this is not a group of individuals driven by strategic thinking yes they're cunning yes they evil yes they're utterly soulless what kind of man can go to hawaii stand in front of people who've lost loved ones who've had everything burnt to the ground and say well once i almost lost my corvette i mean these are really soulless individuals but at the end of the day they're also clinically imbeciles they're not very smart if you read the constitution if you read the 14th amendment if they can't do what they're planning to do it doesn't matter how many charges they bring 14th amendment applies to who it applies to senators it applies to state senators offices of of the state of of the military doesn't apply to a president it has a long enumeration and it never says the word president likewise who in the constitution can be a president there's only three conditions you have to be 35 years old a natural born citizen and a 14 year continuous resident of the united states they can convict president trump they can put him in an orange you know jumpsuit but he can still be president so this is where we have to embrace the conflict this is where we have to be ready to fight because as i say every single day if not you dear friend then who if not now when that's the only two questions you have to ask yourself so so dr gorka let's zero in on that i find that there's a limiting belief problem of some vichy french republicans that don't want to embrace the conflict that they want the storm to pass how should we deal with with such uh such people you know there's a point at which um you you just have to decide who will bear fruit where the seed should be scattered in such a way that it actually grows if you if you you know go back to to jesus is parable about that the seas sewn on the path if you look at the the rhinos if you look at you know the the the christies or or even the penses at some point you've got to realize they're not in it for america it's either ego it's either status quo and you move my my wife it was 98 degrees yesterday i was in a you know this air-conditioned studio where was katie gorka she was outdoor knocking not only is she a senior election official in vegina she is volunteered for the gop and they've given her 900 houses that's what she was doing and she was very clear we're not going to go to the democrat houses we're we're not going to go to the strong republicans we're going to go to the soft republicans the ones who may be this inclined to vote why because they hear the talking points charlie he can't win he can win a primary he can't win a general focus focus your efforts on those people who will bear fruit and also remember the catalytic power of key issues yes we've got to talk about clean elections yes we've got to talk about you know de-weaponizing the justice system but i think and tell me if i'm wrong because you have a real feel for what's the pulse of the general public i think the transgender movement is the the the damis scene moment when the scales fall from the eyes you don't have to be deeply imbued in politics but when a girl who's been you know swimming for six years is at the highest level as as as an athlete in high school or college and that gets it all dashed away because of the guy who says he's a woman suddenly or when a grown man goes into a girl's locker room that's when the average person goes uh no and i want everybody to watch the video of you at that event i think it was a religious event where you said where are the fathers yes that's correct at those swim meets i mean you had some righteous indignation i've been i've been channeling that as much as i can because if you're father of a of a girl who's at one of those events competing and along comes you know will thomas pretending to be leah you should be making a human wall around that swimming pool and saying yes you do not get that man does not get in that pool with my daughter so wake up and take responsibility for your country and your family i i to answer the point you make yes the trans thing as erniz temingway said i think it's happening gradually then suddenly be awakening i mean tonight we have right we have riley gains tonight at an event and we're interviewing her and she's the perfect spokesperson for this because she's not political she had a championship legitimately robbed by a freak and no one stood up for her the end she's fearless and she's fearless she's fearless yes and she's articulate she understands the issue and she she's working very hard in traveling the country and then of course the media attacks her and says she sucks at swimming in that whole thing so yeah i think the trans thing i think you're i think you're exactly right i think the trans thing in my opinion we must double or triple down on this but you know i want to just i want to play this piece of tape play cut 27 this is the attitude i want you to listen carefully the word selection of mr pence play cut 27 our digital team got a copy of your speech today and one of the lines you said to deliver is that are we going to follow the siren song of populism away from the timeless conservative principles of the republican party to whom are you referring right well look i you look at this republican field whether it's uh my former running mate or some of his imitators and uh there is a push uh in this republican primary to to move us away from our party's historic commitment to american leadership on the world stage to a commitment to fiscal responsibility and reform in the face of a massive national debt crisis and many of those people i shared the stage with including my former running mate who wasn't there want to marginalize the right to life and relegate it to a state's only issue my former running mate um he doesn't have the where with all the spine the te- testicular fortitude to use the man's name and to try and say that he's weak on the right to life this pains me every time i say it there's only one president who addressed the march for life as president and it wasn't even Ronald Reagan it was my former boss president trump and a populism that you're using it as like a dirty word like the left does so the most people like him are you against the most people supporting the president that means you're an elitist mike it pains me to say it it means you're part of the elitist nomenclatura he's an oligarch and he's sad that the commoners have a voice yes time to take a stand for life everybody we can say we're pro-life but what does that actually mean in a pro-ro versus weighed world there are states that are more radically pro-death than ever before aborting babies up until the moment they draw their first breath where they word for that it's called murder the Biden regime is more radically pro-abortion than any other in american history they celebrate abortions the way we celebrate life it's time to do something that we know will make a difference that is providing ultrasounds with pre-born when a pregnant girl sees her baby on an ultrasound machine and hears that baby's heartbeat she's twice as likely to choose life just $28 provides that ultrasound and saves one baby hundred forty dollars saves five a gift of fifteen thousand dollars provides an ultrasound machine that can save literally thousands of babies for years to come i donated this cause and you should too call 833-850-2229 or click on the pre-born banner at charliekirk.com become a donor charliekirk.com and click on the pre-born banner. I want to play two tapes here remember so this is just another just kind of piece of data on the trans thing this thing has not got this story has not received as much attention as the riley gains mr. thomas freak let's first cut 41 msnbc talking about a biological man who forced his way into a sorority who gets an erection watching girls change uh the court said that the biological man is allowed into this sorority play cut 41 y'all may and made history last fall as the first openly transgender woman to join a sorority being the first can be incredibly hard and this case is no exception but this week brought some very good news for artemis um arnold mislenford scored a major legal victory when a judge dismissed a suit brought by six fellow members of her capicapagama sorority who sued to kick her out of the chapter over her trans identity yeah obviously kick her out she's she is not a she it is a man who's masquerading as a as a woman listen to the freak Artemis just one more tape and your reaction dr gorker I want the reaction I want what I want is normal people are going to see this and they're like come on play cut 40 here's the freak it takes a very brave and unique person to do this to be a first in a situation like this and then to continue on I want people to know that everything that they have experienced that I'm certainly not the first trans person to ever be attacked by elements in the media I want people to know that it's never okay for that kind of scrutiny on a person just because their identity just because I'm trans every day that they can be themselves yeah is a good day for us all dr gorker biological man the court says biological men find to go into capicapagama sorority or reaction the host called that thing brave and unique just look at the visage of that individual that's an ugly pervert that's a freak that's a man who the women the sorority sisters who said stares at them from the couch within a reaction under the blanket that's what they've said of this what have we done we've allowed legal protection for perverts that's remember how the left talked about the the conservative war on women this this is the war on women title nine title nine is the will of the wisp it's disappeared now and now sexual perverts get to sit in the lounge of the sorority and and stare as they play with themselves as the real women walk around in in what their their pajamas stop stop the world we you know we need to get off this insanity and the enough people have given in it's not tolerance it's perversion okay it is dangerous this is the negation of the feminine forget forget about men all right we'll we'll look after ourselves this is the threat to the safety of women and it is the negat the trans movement is ultimately the negation of womanhood that's what it is so where the hell are the real feminists well i'll tell you where i mean and this is my theory and i've said this for a while that feminism never actually believed in womanhood it was making women more like men it was always it was about making femininity okay don't stay at home go into the workforce freeze your eggs go start up so it would actually make sense dr gorka the feminists are cheering this on because the next natural step of a young lady freezing her eggs becoming a corporate partner becoming a law firm partner and you know having much of cats and not kids it's just do the just do the last thing becomes a man dr gorka yeah yeah no absolutely it is the logical end game you know have the surgical procedure done take the hormones and live forever as a chemical and surgical freak this is when it has to stop and this is where this is where the subsidiarity this is where the republic you know the state the republic of states is so essential this must be fought not just when president trump god willing if we do our part comes back to the white house but at the states level so many states have said no this must not happen the idea that a 12-year-old can't buy a packet of cigarettes or get a tattoo but they can have their genitals removed without their parents just to make them happy without their pet yep and and that's supposed to make them happy i mean it's like jordan peterson who's a clinical psychiatrist says there is no condition no mental condition where we affirm the condition if i walk into a psychiatrist and say i'm napoleon or i've got 48 identities we don't say oh congratulations you're napoleon no no no no we treat that person why is this the only one because because we affirm doctors are profit driven and largely lazy right now and they just want to give them drugs dr and afraid and afraid and dr gork america first check it out great interview thank you thanks so much for listening everybody email us your thoughts as always freedom at charlie kirk.com thank you so much for listening and god bless i want to be judged by my political beliefs i want to get promoted based on my chromosomes when i grow up i want to be offended by my co-workers and walk around the office on eggshells and have my words policed by hr words like grand father peanut gallery long time to see no candy when i grow up i want to be obsessed with emotional safety and do workplace sensitivity training all day long when i grow up i want to climb the corporate ladder just by following the crowd i want to be a conformist i want to weaponize my pronouns what are pronouns it's time to grow up and get back to work introducing the number one woke free job board in america redbloom dot work"
