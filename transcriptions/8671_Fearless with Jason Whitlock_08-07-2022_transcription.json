    "text": " Don't miss the Marvels in theaters on November 10th, and see where the Marvel stories all began when you watch Captain Marvel, Wandavision, and Miss Marvel, only on Disney+. Plan starting at $7.99. I'm fond of saying you can't have free without the dumb. Freedom is actually spelled F-R-E-E-D-U-M-B. Dumb. Freedom is directly tied to the amount of dumb that we tolerate. I say that because of days like yesterday. President Joe Biden handed Medal of Freedom awards to 17 Americans, including Simone Biles and Megan Rapinoe. Biles is just 25 years old. She's most famous for quitting during the Olympics. Rapinoe is a superstar and soccer. She's most famous for bitching and moaning about America and being the purple-haired Colin Kaepernick. Biles received her award because she's black. Rapinoe was honored because she's gay. It's dumb, but she can't be free without the dumb. Happy Friday. The weekend is here. Welcome to Fearless with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock, your host. We have an awesome, awesome show to get you into the weekend. I'm not going to set a full fire. I'm sorry. I apologize. Just the weekends here around the corner. I'm looking forward to the weekend. We've had a great week of fire starters. I got a little fire. I'm going to start. A little bonfire. Then Steve Kim's going to come in and help me fan those flames. It's about the Biden and the Medal of Freedom stuff that I just teased you there. Steve Kim's going to help me with that conversation. Shemika Michelle, she's going to be here to help me make it make sense of Macy Gray. Macy Gray's flip-flopping everywhere on the transgender issue. Virgil Walker. He's going to be here. He's kind of a fearless contributor. We're going to test out today. He's written something very, very interesting. A letter to black ministers around the country about the abortion issue. I've tweeted out Virgil's blog post about this. You should go hunting up on my Twitter feed. It's awesome. It'll help you understand this conversation I'll have with Virgil. And then of course, the smartest man on the show, Delano Squires, will be here to help us wrap up the show. Delano's written a terrific column about what he calls the Great Separation. That's a feud, a war that's going on within the black community. The whole LGBTQ transgender issue is going to separate the wheat from the chafe. Is that what they say? It's going to separate the men from the boys. I know they say that. Anyway, fantastic show for us here on this Friday to get us into the weekend. I want to start with some just brief comments and setting up some context to the conversation I want to have with Steve Kim here in just a few seconds. Simone Biles and Megan Rapinoe, Presidential Medals of Freedom, is the highest civilian award that the president can give out. I want to play little clips from them yesterday so you can hear why they got these awards. I think we have those clips of Biles and Rapinoe and why they got those awards. Overcoming Great Odds, Simone Biles is the most decorated American gymnast in history. A former foster child who became a once in a generation athlete transforming her sport with artistry and degrees of difficulty that reimagine what is possible. With absolute courage and honesty, she expands the legacy of our greatest champions who challenge the powerful and speak up for justice and the wellness of body and mind. Leading on faith in God and family, Simone Biles is an inspiring symbol of strength, grace and pride in those three letters, USA. World Cup champion Olympic Golden Gold Medalist named the world's best women's soccer player. Megan Rapinoe is one of America's great athletes. Known for her creative play and leadership, she also leads with a fierce will off the field, a champion protecting the rights of fellow LGBTQI plus Americans, a leader on the US Women's National team, perhaps the most dominant of any team in any sport in their successful fight for equal pay. Megan Rapinoe challenges and inspires millions of people who believe in themselves and the possibilities of our nation. How you choose to have sex does not make you a hero. Trust me, I know that. How I choose to have sex does not make me a hero and it doesn't matter whether you're a giver or a receiver. And so, Megan Rapinoe, just literally, would she be getting that award if she wasn't gay? No, she would not. I don't follow the women's national soccer team that close, but in this last Olympics, I don't think she was our world cup. I don't think she was our best player. Most outspoken, most flamboyant, most hate-look at me with her purple hair and all that other crap she does. The most Colin Kaepernick-esque. She did not, a presidential medal of freedom. Are you kidding me? Simone Biles, a great Olympic gymnast, no doubt about it. But she quit at the Tokyo Olympics. She quit. Siding, you know, she just didn't feel right, and I get it. That's fine. I'm not trying to rip her for quitting. I'm ripping her and ripping the Biden administration for giving someone the presidential medal of freedom when the last time they were on the big stage, they let their teammates in the United States of America down. She did something selfish and narcissistic. As I said at the time, Simone Biles did not want to compete in those Olympics. Her mind was wrapped around 2020 is my last year, and then I can move on from all of this. When those Olympics got pushed back a year to 2021, she mentally checked out. She wasn't woman enough to say, you know what? I'm old. I'm in my 20s. Most gymnasts retire around 19, 20 years old. I don't want to do this. She wasn't woman enough to do that. She took all the money. She took all the endorsement bills. She took all the marketing and the PR to build her brand. And then when she got over to Tokyo, she quit. And then she spun it into how heroic and how courageous it is that I'm quitting because I have to do what's best for my mental health. You could have done that a year ago. A year you denied another woman, another gymnast, an opportunity to actually go and compete and be on that team. Medal of Freedom. Youngest Medal of Freedom winner, just a year after quit team in the Olympics on the biggest stage in all of sports. Presidential Medal of Freedom. That's because excellence, the meritocracy, the giving it all, our culture has been under complete 180. The things that used to matter don't matter anymore and success is defined by diversity inclusion and equity. That's the goal of life. That's America's goal. Diversity inclusion and equity. That's a luxury. That's something nice to have. It's not the end all be all. Excellence is. And I'm just sorry. Black people, particularly as it relates to athletics, we don't need charity to excel and to be recognized is great. Why we're handing Simone Biles this charity? It's an insult. It's stupid. It's not the right message for young people. And I know we're in this whole deal. Athletes in the past, Ronnie Lott cutting off the tip of his finger to play. That's stupid. Carry, struggle. That's the one that went out there on the bad ankle and stuck the landing. That was stupid. That's what had done what's best for her. This whole narcissistic generation and culture that we have built, this whole selfie. Everybody, hey, look at me and let me go to my social media feed. All of it's garbage and it's under mind America. And these presidential medals of free dumb, D.U.M.B. annoy me and I had to get that off my chest. Steve Kim, the Korean Co-Sell. I want to welcome you into this conversation. Are you as bothered by these presidential medals or free dumb as I am? Jason, first of all, good Friday to you. I'm actually a little bit surprised. Pleasantly, I would have thought Leah Thomas would have also got one too. I mean, she checks even more boxes. But this goes right in line with the Biden administration. I mean, winning an award such as that. It's almost like winning an award for best Mexican cuisine from Taco Bell. What's it really mean? And you're right, this is all about diversity and checking boxes and virtue signaling. You know, as it relates to Simone Biles, I give her a little bit of a break because she is younger, perhaps more impressionable and prone to being influenced. But you're right, if a football player actually quit in the middle of the second quarter of a playoff game and certainly a Super Bowl, nobody would call them courageous. They would not be getting the game ball. I have never actually seen a little kid go up to any athlete say, sir, can I have your autograph? The way you just pulled yourself out of the game from mental wealth and wellness has really inspired me that's never happened, not in real life. And just think about this. The 91 Pistons, when they walked out about what 30 seconds before the Bulls were officially the Eastern Conference Championship in a game that they had essentially already played, the game was over. They get criticized to this day for that. That game was over. Randy Moss, one time walked off the field, I think in Washington as Minnesota's playoffs chance is vanished. In a game where the offense, I don't think, ever got back on the field and he was so frustrated, he just, you know what, I'm out of here. He doesn't get credit for saying, man, you know what, maybe he was in a mentally bad space and so frustrated that you know what, he gets a game ball for that. We have truly lowered the bar for what gets these type of prestigious awards. But I want to go back to Meghan Purplehair. I find her contemptible on so many levels. I'm going to be honest, as a proud American, that if she was still on the US women's soccer team, if they played Al-Qaeda or the Taliban, I'd root for them. I'm being serious. I'm going to be fearless. I'm going to keep it real here. She's been fundamentally dishonest in so many things. She actually said one time at a White House press conference or something, I'm Meghan Rapinoe, I'm a female athlete and I could do anything a man can do. Well, outside of play as well as them and be athletically robust, yeah, you can't. And then she had the nerve to talk about this transgender issue in sports to tell all of these young women and their fathers and mothers across the board, hey, your youth female teams in your participation doesn't matter. Hey, Meghan, you are a product of Title IX, much like many of your teammates. Where do you think these athletic careers begin? And right there it showed me she has not an ounce of integrity in any of her bones. All right, I don't want to pretend like, and I think these are two of the worst, if not the two worst medal of honors ever given out. But there have been other allegedly questionable presidential medals of honor. I think we have a list here of some that we've identified. In 2008, Steve, Anthony Fauci received a presidential medal of honor. Tony Blair, if I'm right, Tony, but what do you the prime minister of the United Kingdom? Okay, yeah. Bill Clinton, Monica Lewinsky, give him that, I think it was a pearl necklace medal of freedom to Bill Clinton. Ellen DeGeneres, she got, I guess she beat Meghan Rapinoe to the punch and got one in 2016. Hey, Joe Biden. In 2017, I think Robert Bird hung a hood and a medal of freedom around Joe Biden's neck for that. Rush Limbaugh got it from President Trump, Jim Jordan, personal friend of mine, wrestler Jim Jordan got one in 2021. And I don't, I don't, someone may have to help me. I don't know who Sandra Lindsey is, but she's on this list as well. It got one in 2022, which I guess was just a yes for that. So as best we could tell, I think Obama gave out like 132. This is according to Wikipedia, 132 medal of freedom honors. This started in 1963 with John Kennedy. He started this tradition. Obama has the record, 132. I think Bill Clinton is next with around 110 or so. So it seems we, this may be some sort of tradition here with the Democratic presidents giving out a bunch of them. Trump only gave out like 24. That might be because, you know, half the country would have refused to accept one from Trump during his tenure. But just for some clarity, I want to state what the description of the presidential medal of freedom. The presidential medal of freedom is the nation's highest civilian honor presented to individuals who have made exemplary contributions to the prosperity values or security of the United States, world peace or other significant societal public or private endeavors. I mean, so I mean, you hear that and you automatically think Megan Rapinoe, Simone Viles, Simone redefined quitting and Megan Rapinoe has redefined sizzory. You know, it's maddening. I'm going full of Samika today. I'm just off the tape. You know, it's maddening. And I know this has to erk your nerve when you heard as cool Mo D once said the white columnist who was now so chicken. Yeah, I dropped my first expletive on this show. So get that be pretty. They actually write about these subjects and glowing terms. And I just wondered, do any of you mean a single sintella of what you're writing? These guys are so afraid of their jobs and for the outrage that they're going to create by merely telling the truth. They don't want to be canceled. They have no other job options. So they're almost forced to say, yeah, these two are the upper echelon of athletics and societal standards that we uphold. And I'm proud of them. I mean, it's amazing that I remember when the Simone Biles situation took place that literally like these major headline columnists across the country were arguing with people on Twitter who merely said, you know, the difference is it's one thing to back out of an event like the Olympics or let's say a season and do it before it even begins. They threw all logic out the window by saying, no, no, she could quit at any time and she's to be commended. And I was like, you cannot really believe that in your own heart of hearts. But I believe that once again, they want the ticket to the cookout, but they also want social acceptance. And I believe there's also no agenda with corporate media to make sure that everyone's in lockstep with the message. You know what I found highly ironic, Jason? I don't know if you knew this about me. My all time favorite boxer and maybe athlete was marvelous Marvin Hagler. And he actually passed away. Yeah, March 13th, 2021, he died. It was actually one of the few times I got emotional over a death of somebody I had never met once unfortunately. Never happened for me as a boxing writer. It's probably something I'm going to regret forever. But on the one year anniversary several months ago was the same exact day on a Sunday that Naomi Ahsoka, that's whatever name is, did one of her jobs again where she courageously quit and said, I can't do media. And I got a quit and then she's doing a magazine shoot the next day showing up to the Met Gala. Right? And I'm thinking to myself and I wanted to make this comparison then, but we never brought it up. Think about Marvin Hagler. He had to move from Newark to Brockton, Massachusetts at a very young age because the Newark race riots grows up in Brockton, Massachusetts, which is basically all white. And he began his career in boxing. His strength and conditioning program, Jason, five, six days a week, you know what it was, it was working a construction job for seven years before he actually trained. He'd run in the morning, get breakfast, work in a construction yard, a full shift and go to the boxing gym, repeat that. Then for a full decade or so, he's literally black balls from the middleweight tournament and he's got kids and a wife to raise, making very little money before he makes it big. Jason, you don't think Marvelous Marvin Nathaniel Hagler had mental anguish? You don't think he had stress. You don't think at times he was angry at the world. But the way, the reason why I admire him is that he persevered and was forged through this, this time and place when America may have not always been fair to a man like him. And he became an American icon. There was a point in time in our society, we praised those who overcame. Now we praise those who capitulate. Those who succumb. All right, let's get to our approval rating on Simone Bough. It'll be very interesting here. For both critics of Simone Boughs, can we keep her out of the dumpster fire? Let's see. Job performance, I'm just sorry. When you quit on your team at the Olympics, you quit at the Super Bowl of your sport, I just can't go there. I can't give her, it's a zero for me. Oh boy, you know I like to give my zeros. I throw more no hitters than Nolan Ryan. I looked at the overall scope of her performance. Let me make this clear. She's a highly accomplished athlete. I mean, you look at her trophy case, a lot of medals, a lot of gold. So based on that, if it wasn't for the quit job, she'd get like close to 25, but you're right. Quitting at the Olympics, that's almost inexcusable. That knocks her down to a 10. Can't believe you're going soft, Steve. No, I am a martial arts. Character. I'm going low here as well. You look, your teammates in the eye at the Olympics and you quit in the middle of the event and you take all that attention away from them that someone else could have replaced her. I give her a foreign character. Yeah, speaking of which, I remember those press conferences when they asked their teammates about that and all of them, it's almost like they had a gun to their back and they're like, yeah, we're all behind her. We also go like, oh God, I felt sorry for those young ladies. You know what, I am going soft. I'm the state puff marshmallow man today. Look, overall, I don't think she's been nearly as damaging to American psyche as Ms. Rapinale. I'm going to stick with a 10. Oh, it's the whole Rapinale conversation is why you're going soft. You would have been all zeros if we had been talking about making Rapinale. You've gone soft here. Intensity, she's on brand for a wolk millennial. Is she even a millennial at 25? Is that generation over? Is 25 still cracked that? Anyway, she's woke as any other young athlete and actually halfway believes the stuff that's been programmed into her brain. So I gave her a 12 for authenticity. Okay, I must be a Simone Braille's pompom waiver. I gave her a 15. Look, I actually believe a lot of these younger people. Look, we're a lot old now. Like you told me last week about college football, realignment. You said, yeah, but Steve, we're old. I get it. We're not exactly Walt Kowalski yet, but we are now telling kids to get the hell off our lawn. But I did give her a 15 because she's, I think she's young and impressionable. And I would like to see what her worldviews are in about five to 10 years. See if they evolved at all. Let me tell you this. If you go high on it factor, I'm going to start a rumor that you must be chasing some black tang or something because you're playing real nice with Simone Biles here. You must have a secret black girlfriend or crush on some black woman. You're not telling me about it factor. She's dating the NFL player. She's got a presidential medal. She's done a bunch of commercials. She is an exciting gymnast. I gave her a 20 in it factor. Okay. You know what? You better not get on my backside. And by the way, that last thing you just said, had me thinking of jungle fever, one of Spike Lee's most underrated movies. I gave her a 22. She was a celebrated gymnast. She's gotten endorsements. She gets a lot of accolades. Look, she got invited to the White House. So say what you want. And I did not want to get her into a dumpster fire. I think her overall body of work deserved for her to be at least kept out of that realm. Steve, I haven't checked your Twitter feed in a while. I see your tweets, but I haven't gone to your bio. But this whole thing, because right now you got her at a 55 and candlelit. I've got a 36 and dumpster. I'm going to go see who you're following right now. Yep, there it is. TR Mac, I knew you were up to something. You just started following TR Mac, the state senator from Rhode Island. You saw that twerking video. I am not following the twerking video. This is slanderous. I mean, I, folks, believe the old kifft, I am not following twerka source. Do not believe Whitlock that is a slanderous lie. Lies, lies, lies. I guarantee you, if I hop into your DMs, you and TR Mac been going back and forth. I knew that twerking video was too much for you. Yeah. She is sick of it. Some moans vials that candlelit in the 55. No, she's sick. Yeah. She's sick like drum back and free on that. All right, let me take care of some business. I got to let you go. I got to let you go, Steve. Take care of some business. All right, we've definitely had some tough times, but we recently had some wins for truth in the American family. The pendulum may swing back at any moment, but the center of that change has to be the family, your family. Ronald Wagon once said, all great change in America starts at the dinner table.

All right, welcome back. Time for some making makes sense. And we'll go out to North Carolina and bring in Shamika Michelle. See if she can make it make sense. Macie Gray, the singer, Shamika, I'm sure you saw this, she went on Piers Morgan show and she said one thing about the transgender issue. And then she went through three days of reeducation and she said something else on the Today Show. Let's start with what she said on Piers Morgan. Let's play that first. And I will say this and everybody's going to hate me, but as a woman, just because you go change your parts doesn't make you a woman. Right. Sorry. You feel that? I know that for a fact. Sounded pretty confident and pretty strong and pretty much like common sense to me. But three days of reeducation and here she is now on the Today Show with Hoda. I don't know how to say Hoda's last name. But anyway, let's play the clip. Well, I never, of course, knew meant to hurt anybody with what I said. I'm actually a huge, I think it takes a lot of courage to be yourself, to go out in the world and be honest about who you are. And so I think anyone who was in the LGBT community is a hero and set as an example for all of us with that, you know. She later went on to basically backtrack and stutter about the whole transgender issue. They completely reeducated Macy Gray in just three days. Make it make sense for me, Shamika. Jason, this makes perfect sense because if you lean on who you believe sustains you, Macy Gray believes her fans and the record execs sustain her. If she believed in the ultimate sustainer, the person has greater than any fan, greater than any hater, greater than any executive of any company, she would lean on his truth, which is male and female created. He then, you know, if you're a tree planted by the water, the steel water, the living water, someone can summons and send out all their flying monkeys, you will not be moved. As you know, Jason, that people are trying to make me backtrack, but I don't move on because I'm not Michael Jackson and I don't bend over because this ass is exit only. But when you think that somebody else is where you get your blessings from, that's what you do. It makes perfect sense that Macy folded just like so many before her half. I think you're right. I could have never said it that cleverly. And yeah, I, she's got a new album coming out and I'm sure someone got on the phone and was like, Hey, if you want this album to come out, you better back that ass up. Right. Exactly. That's what she did. She choked. Yeah. And I watched this clip originally in its entirety and I, it just reconfirmed and restated to me. This is why I had to leave Los Angeles and leave corporate media is because I'm just not going to bow to stupidity. And you know, I used to, I used to say this, this is kind of related to the conversation we were had yesterday, me, you and Jill Savage about relationships and it's relationships a lot of times and particularly between man and woman, people love to say it's based on compromise. You got to be willing to compromise. And I used, I was famous in my twenties and thirties and people would get mad at me. I say it compromised. I'm not going to meet you halfway to stupidity. What am I compromising on? Either we're going to agree on the truth, but I'm not going to meet you halfway to stupidity. I don't know if my position was right. I have some regrets to some degree for that attitude and it's probably arrogance, but that is who I am. I'm just, I'm going to stand on truth. And this woman has stated something that was so factually obvious and to see, she couldn't even hardly make eye contact with Hoda and the people. She was so embarrassed. She knew she was lying. Right. I can't do that. I just can't, I can't do it. Yeah, I was thinking, Jason, I feel sorry for her because when she was talking to Pierce Morgan, she looked like she had a little more confident as she was talking to Hoda. If that's her name, Hoda, what is it? Hoda. She looked so beaten down. She looked beaten down. She didn't look like she believed what she was saying. And I just felt really sorry for her. Like, wow, this is what you have to do. You have to bow to the establishment when you feel like they are where your blessings flow from. You know, if that's where you think your help come from, then that's where you're going to lean on and think that they sustain you. I felt sorry for Macy looking at that second clip. And so only I'm only asking you this because I know you love music. You do a little singing yourself. I can't off the top of my head think of what Macy Gray's most famous song is. Is she any good? And I'm sure I've heard some of her music, but she says her talking voice is unique. And I'm wondering what, because it doesn't come up in my head immediately what her most famous song is. Is she talented? I try to say goodbye and I choke. I try to walk away and I stumble. Though I try to hide it, it's clear my world crumbles when you are not near something like that. I don't think she has the best voice, but I did have that album. I have to say I liked it. She had some really good songs. I think she's a great songwriter. And I think that's what happened. She wanted to hide behind her songwriting ability and someone as she sang the song trying to teach it to somebody else said, no, you should be the artist. And that's how she became the artist instead of just the songwriter. Thank you, Shamika. Great job as always. Enjoy your weekend. Get your fearless army swagger, shopbladesmedia.com.

Been looking forward to doing this interview for a couple of days. Virgil Walker of G3 Ministries. He's the co-host of the Just Thinking Podcast. He wrote a piece, a blog post, a letter to Black pastors that I found fascinating. It addressed the issue of the Black church, Black ministers, and how we're handling or how they are handling the abortion issue, particularly since the overturn of Roe vs. Wade. And the letter is beautifully constructed. His position is powerfully argued. If you go to my Twitter page at Whitlock-Jason, I've tweeted out Virgil's piece. When we will bring Virgil on, he can tell you how to find him over social media and how to easily find the column. He gets right to the heart of many of the matters, even connecting faith leaders, seemingly pro-choice position to Dr. Martin Luther King and his relationship with Planned Parenthood and Margaret Sanger and the eugenics movement to pointing out, Virgil argues, there are three primary reasons why the Black church has been silent or in support of abortion. We've got a one, a financial partnership with White Liberals, two, political gain, and then three, cultural popularity to win the approval of feminists. He basically argues the Black church and Black ministers have sold out and we need to deal with that. Virgil, welcome to the show. We're honored to have you. I want to start with, how has your letter been received? Yeah. Well, Jason, thanks for having me. It's an honor to be with you. I've been a fan of the show for quite some time. It's been mixed, as you can imagine. There are those who appreciate the candor and the clarity that I shared regarding the article. There are others who, again, in like fashion, were rather upset about what it is I shared. As someone who served as a pastor for years, who serves in ministry now, and who is, I spent more than six years in the front lines of abortion clinics, for me, when I heard about the decision regarding Roe v. Wade, I was ecstatic. I was really excited. Never in my lifetime could I have imagined this kind of an outcome. When I recognized that there would be folks who would be upset about this, who would be angry about this, I recognized that. You said on the show often, you made the statement that if folks who are secularists or atheists or folks who are non-believers have a worldview that differs from ours, we'd have no problem with that. The problem that we have is when we see those who claim themselves to be Christians, who wear the title pastor, who actually are fashioning themselves as clergy, begin to articulate a worldview that is antithetical to everything they claim to believe. Then they have the unmitigated gall to stand in the pulpit on the Lord's day and utter blasphemies about the nature of God with so little fear in them. In fact, the real fear they should have is that God's wrath would actually consume them on the Lord's day and that they would drop dead. But these men don't fear God. They articulate a worldview that is antithetical to the biblical worldview that we hold dear and truth be told, they absolutely need to be removed from the pulpit. So again, with all that said, with regard to the motivation behind writing the piece, as well as what folks have experienced as a result, it's been mixed reviews. But again, I've never been moved by that. So Virgil, you're hearing from people that like the piece, you're hearing from people that dislike it. And I'm wondering if the people that dislike it, who claim to have a faith, are they upset that you criticize the black church or do they have a substantive disagreement on how the Bible and how God feels about the issue of abortion? Yeah, there's never a substantive argument. Basically, it really results like it always does from those who hold at worldview. It's ad hominem, right? It's your cocoon, your sellout, your uncle Tom. It's all the normative tropes that you come to expect when you hold a biblical worldview. When you don't look away from sin, when you actually acknowledge the sinfulness of sin and begin to talk to people about these issues, they really don't want to address them. And you become an easy target for what it is they want to say about you. And again, you have a fearless army. That's been something I've been a part of for quite some time. And again, I say that in this way, Jason, I'd heard you the other week acknowledge the fact that trading barbs on Twitter, you don't have to be brave to do that, right? You don't have to be the bravest person in the world to do that. But it's interesting how when you do declare truth, how those who hate the truth actually come out and stand against it. And so that's exactly what you're seeing, but you don't see any substantive arguments. I think the worst that they've actually done or said, they try to challenge Margaret Sanger and her actual view regarding abortion and things like that. But most have not really read Sanger in her own words. Most have really believed the revisionist history of Planned Parenthood. And so in my piece, I actually quoted specifics from the award that was given to Dr. King so that no one can say, well, I misinterpreted Sanger or I thought, you know, I said this and that was wrong. I shouldn't have looked at it in that way. I just used their words so that you could hear from those people. Virgil, I hate to ask this question because it's really irrelevant. But I do have to ask it because we're trying to make people deal with the truth. And so I just want to know for clarity's sake, growing up was your experience in the traditional black church and your work as a minister and in the church now. Are you in the black church and working with other black Christians? Yeah, that's a great question. I want to first amplify what you said from the beginning. What color the group is that I've worked with in the past is irrelevant to truth, right? At the end of the day. However, for those to whom those kinds of things matter, I grew up in a cogic church, cogic for those who aren't aware, church of God in Christ, one of the largest Pentecostal denominations in the country. That was a part of my background. I grew up in black Baptist circles. That was my growing up the entire time, which is why I have such a heart string, an affinity for black folks who are still in those churches. I spent an enormous amount of time at Carlton Pearson's church. If you're familiar with Carlton Pearson and Tulsa, Oklahoma, I was a member there for years before he became heretical in the ideas that he espoused. So I've been around black circles. I've got the street cred, so to speak, if that's what's necessary to tell the truth, which again, I really reject. Currently, I work at an organization called G3. It is a reformed Baptist setting. The beauty of where I am now is that my skin color is irrelevant to the declaration of the truth that we're challenged to deliver on a consistent basis. That's one of the reasons why I love where I am. I'm proud of where I am. I'm proud of what I do. Rather than someone looking into my history or trying to figure out what background I'm coming from, what they need to do is grapple with the magnitude and weight of the truth that I shared in that particular article. I was just having or having this discussion off the air that we will have on the air. This whole thing of what you're trying to do and what we're trying to do with this show, with fearless, and I know your friends with Delano, he's going to come on after you, is people look at us like we're crazy and we're selling out. But actually what we're trying to do is reach black people who claim a religious faith and say, hey guys, are we sure we're standing on biblical values? Are we letting politics move us away from God? That's the real question we're asking and we're asking it out of love and trying to shake people and say, hey God, we serve a higher calling, a much higher calling than our skin color. We claim to be Christian. That means we claim to be with Christ and the good news of the gospel and we have to stand on that. So we're actually trying to, with love and affection, reach black people that claim a faith, hey well let's stand on this faith together. That will serve us all in America and the world to the best of our ability. Yeah, I don't disagree with much of what you said there but my only thing is you and I and others like us probably are a little crazy and as far as being sold out, we have. We've sold out to Christ and Him crucified and so we don't need to apologize for that. I think we need to stand on that truth and declare it with great boldness. I do understand the point that you're making. The heart cry is I desire to see my brothers and sisters who share my complexion walk in the truth that you and I have been blessed to be exposed to not because of the fact that we're so smart. Now Delano, he may be that smart but not because you and I are necessarily that smart but because of the very grace of God bestowed upon us that we're able to go from darkness to light and we want everybody else that we know love and interact with to come into that light. And so I see the point you're making. The reality is unity, the unity that we seek, the foundation of that is truth. And so if we can't begin by exposing people to truth and allowing them to stand on that truth will never actually be united in the way that Christ intended. I had such and I didn't plan to go this direction Virgil. It's just these thoughts coming to my head and I'm getting to know you and I appreciate the conversation but there's a nostalgia and again I think I'm much older than you. I'm 55. But me growing up in a small little black church, 25th Street Baptist Church in Indianapolis, I have so many fond memories of that entire experience. Trips to Kings Island with the church, cookouts and camping events and Eagle Creek Park in Indianapolis we do all these and I don't and as a kid and as a young person, politics weren't at the center of our identity and so politics didn't matter nearly as much and we just connected because we were believers and we had things in common. And now I see politics at the center of churches and it's like wow it's like because I'm sticking to biblical principles and apply those to how I view the world even politically. It's like I'm made to feel uncomfortable. That I'm not going to stand with the Democrats that support Planned Parenthood, support abortion, think that somehow without their assistance I can't make it in this world and I'm like well I'm on Jesus' team, what do I need you for? And so I just have this nostalgia that I want to return to that time where we could connect one nation, one group of people under God and that's where my, I want that energy and flow back and your peace and this will lead back to your peace is you really get it like man this division we're seeing in the church has a long history that goes all the way back to even Martin Luther King. Yeah absolutely I don't disagree. I think that I wish I had more time and I may have to revisit the construct of what you're sharing because there was a time when faith is what brought us together. If you begin to look at the statistics from the pre-civil rights era what you'll see is that family structures for black families were intact and this was at a time when there was there was actually greater segregation, there was actually more laws that codified racism, right? You want to talk about systemic racism, those folks felt it for real but were actually doing better in the timeframe in which they lived. Why? Because they weren't looking for handouts from government, they were actually standing on their faith and that's what brought them together and kept communities together. I mean there's a whole lot more I could say about that but I agree with you what we've done is we've really, we've really abdicated that we've let that go and in an effort to get something now, to gain something now we've let go of God, we've latched on to government, we've let go of scriptural sufficiency, right? And we've we've latched on to social justice. I mean these are the kinds of things that we're doing in our culture that is actually having a damaging effect over the long term and it puts guys like you and me back into that nostalgic period when we when we had you know grandma's home cooking on Sunday morning and we'd all go over and enjoy that and over the course of time it wasn't what government can do, it's what we could do as a people together united under the banner of faith, that's what it's really about. For drama let you go on this note, do you see any light at the end of the tunnel? Do you are you hopeful that the black church black ministers will wake up? Yeah I'm hopeful in this regard Jason I recognize that when it is darkest light shines brightest and so again I applaud what you do my brother Delano, my man chalk knocks, those guys we're band of brothers you know behind the scenes I'll pick up a phone and tell one of them hey I'm getting ready to write this article they'll tell me hey I'm getting ready to go on you know fearless I'm gonna do this and so what I'm seeing is there is that camaraderie there are those people who are connecting the dots my brother Daryl Harrison that I do the co-host to show with we're all connecting with one another to an effort to get the word out to get the message out and those who my goal is never to figure out you know how many are coming to that light my goal is simply to share the truth and allow God to draw those folks to the light and in that regard as I'm faithful I'm definitely hopeful. Virgil thank you so much appreciate it would love to have you back would love to be a guest on your podcast thank you so much all right go to youtube.com slash Jason Whiplock hit notifications hit subscribe if you're listening on Apple give me that five star review all right Delano Squires all right welcome back. Tom Raul out to DC bringing Delano Squires who's written another tremendous column today for us at the blaze and for fearless Delano writing about the great separation this is has nothing to do with the great replacement theory the great awakening the great new world order the great debate it's the great separation and you're saying that like black people are headed for maybe a final conflict where we have to choose sides you in the column at challenging us what side are you going to be on and my takeaway from reading the column earlier today was Delano is like there's going to be a side that says you know what I'm sticking to my biblical values and I'm choosing my biblical values and I'm going to partner with people who share my values regardless of economics regardless of color regardless of anything do we have shared values and then on the other side there are going to be people to say I'm going to choose the side that fits my political worldview and my fight for power have I misread your column in terms of what the divide is and what the choice is for black people. No just I think you you you hit it pretty square on and just to be clear the the scene that I that I paint in this particular column is sort of a microcosm of a larger separation that's going on within the country right we talk about it every week that's not just you know within the black community but but I wanted to talk specifically about you know the black community because there are certain forces that are unique to us right so one one of one section that I actually cut out just because the I was getting up to 2,500 words is the fact that even your socially conservative older let's say southern black grandma right sister Pearly the the woman that helped propel Joe Biden to his candidacy in South Carolina when he when he was struggling after those first two states she she believes that marriage is between one man and one woman right she would not support biological men and women's sports but she just like her atheist granddaughter feeds at the trough of CNN and MSNBC she gets a social commentary from Joy Reid and from Don Lemon and when she hears the name Clarence Thomas she responds with a with a frown and a scowl so whereas within sort of the larger you know population particularly among white Americans you have clear divisions so your the white version of Miss Pearly is not watching CNN and MSNBC she's watching Fox News she's watching Newsmax or she's watching some she's watching this show she's watching other conservative networks but even socially conservative black folk are tremendously influenced by the black left so so part of the reason that I want to talk about the great separation is because I can see these forces this this tectonic shift happening in real time I started by talking about Tiaramack the the twerking senator from state senator from Rhode Island who clearly is is desirous of attention and she even said it on some of her tiktok that she's trying to go viral so that she can talk here this Jason she's not so that she can talk more about what's holding black the black community or improving reading rates or literacy or numeracy she said she wanted to go viral so that she could talk more about abortion and that that really is on brand for the democratic party for the black left in 2022 it's abortion it's drag queens it's transgenderism and and and the black community that used to be built on the pillars of faith and family and education and dignity and hard work now as I describe it the foundation of that house of of the new house is perversion subversion diversion and inversion and we see this both in terms of individual black leaders I talk about eric atoms and his pledge to put a drag queen in every school like he was a you know a presidential candidate who said we want a chicken in every pot like eric atoms has a has a different set of priorities it's black lives matter that says that they are fighting as as one of their 13 original principles they're fighting to dismantle the nuclear family it's the NAACP that says they are fighting so that fewer black babies could be born maybe they think 12% of the black population is too high they want to drive it down into the single digits and on and on and on I describe in in my column all of these forces of the afro-stocracy the black elite the the leadership class have arrayed themselves against the interests of the black masses and it's one of these things where eventually people are going to have to choose sides because you can't sustain a community where there are no common values where there's no common principles where there's no morals where respectability is a pejorative but calling yourself a boss bitch is a sign of empowerment and that's where we are today and I'm just trying to get out and head and paint a picture of where it is that we're going I'm so appreciative of the column because it's it's right on brand with what we're trying to do with this whole show and and again the show is for everybody it is for everybody but I am specifically trying to target and and and wave a flag send up a sos signal send out a flare that to black people like hey don't surrender your biblical values for politics I would rather see you abandon politics altogether that's the choice that I've made that again I've never voted although that's likely to change coming up here in November I'm just being honest I but I've never voted because I don't think politics determine my destiny and and I don't want to be controlled by politics I would rather be controlled like Shamika was who is my ultimate sustainer god and so I'm going to be loyal or try my best as to the best of my ability I'm a weak man I sin and all that but I want to live up to and be loyal to those values and and I'm trying to let other it's okay if the democrats hate you because you want to be loyal to god that says more about them than you it actually says something good about you and something bad about them and that's what I love about this show and what we're doing and the column that you're writing and and I think you know there's a price all of us seem to pay in the black community if if we stay loyal to our biblical values we get accused of oh we have some political agenda and and I really I just don't there's no proof I have a political agenda it's it's I'm going where my values tell me to go and I'm willing to align myself with whoever says and backs up that they share my values and so if that's the blades if that's the republican party if it's Ron DeSantis I could care less and and we have to get in that mindset and I think the thing that you're saying is the straw that may break the camel's bat is the transgender and the LGBT issue that it's becoming so obvious that we have to hop on board with that agenda or we lose our black status that may be a bridge too far yeah Jason there's a couple points I want to make really quick one one of the most confounding parts of this great separation is that you have self-identified black Christians on either side of the dividing line and you have black Christians who will affirm and say yes I I have biblical values but for them biblical values means ridding America of white supremacy and racism right over the last week you and I have both seen multiple videos with with prominent pastors who who shepherd large congregations coming out and criticizing the Supreme Court for overturning Roe versus Wade which again doesn't ban abortion which I wish it did but just sends abortion back to the states and I mentioned Jamal Bryant who used to have a church here in Baltimore and now is down in Atlanta who you know he talked about overturning Roe versus Wade and criticized it and he said men need to step up not as husbands and fathers mind you but as abortion supporters and in the same video where he talked about his support for abortion he couched in the language of choice but the support for abortion a couple minutes later he pivoted and said now we're ready for the baby dedication right so it's as if these people have no self-awareness that irony is completely lost on them and he's not the only one it was a pastor after pastor who I've seen take to the pulpit and say no God in fact supports abortion and these are churches that have whose congregations number in the thousands so these are people who have real influence so so that's one of the the most challenging aspects of this great separation that a lot of people are standing on fault lines and they don't even know it so so when the space opens up they are going to fall through and to your point you talk about the trans issue macy gray is probably one of those people right soul singer and actress who talking to pierce morgan she said you know and her sort of unique style that I don't think that you know if you get surgery it makes you a woman that's okay that's a that's a reasonable take to me right now she said if you say you're a woman but you're obviously man I still call you a she you know obviously I wouldn't agree with that because you're lying at that point but I said that's about as good as gonna get on the left it wasn't even a week later where she showed up on a today's show and was subjected to a public humiliation she couldn't even look the host in the eye squarely she couldn't finish a sentence with any sort of coherent thought it was all about the education that she received and and and you know and and if whatever you are I believe it and and this this is what the black community needs to understand and again let me go back to black preachers the the people who had moral authority who wielded that moral authority for our our greater benefit a generation ago these guys need to understand that today if you affirm a biblical sexual ethic the left including many of your own people will accuse you of basically burning a rainbow cross on somebody's lawn and say if you don't get with transgender rights that you're a hateful bigot so this as I said this this thing is is coming apart now it's not a revolution it's an evolution so it's moving somewhat slowly in terms of what we can perceive with our own eyes the average person still thinks that races the biggest issue the average black person still thinks that race and racism are the biggest issues in this country right they see the periodic police shooting horrific as they may be and they say well this is black life in America and they don't understand all of the plates that are moving beneath their feet and the things that are going to swallow them up and their children so I thought it was important to raise that issue and one one other point I want to raise quickly I quoted Tana Hasey Coates twice in my piece once I was going there okay okay so I was going I was going let me ask you a question let me ask because I don't want to but the second time you quoted him you mentioned his that there's no black problem that can't be solved by the elimination of white supremacy and it's so crystallized for me what my problem is with Tana Hasey Coates and these people on the left is is like and again Tana Hasey Coates I don't think claims to be a Christian or have any religious faith that I'm aware of but those of us that do claim a Christian faith what he's expressing directly contradicts our faith that there's not it doesn't say in the Bible if if if white people are on your side how can you fail more if white people are against you how can you succeed but if God is on your side how you know don't worry about the haters and and and that's where people like confuse me or other people that are labeled conservatives or people that have a biblical worldview I'm not sitting around worried about white biggest because God is on my side I don't see white people as my salvation I see Jesus Christ as my salvation and my adoption of his values and principles will protect me and allow me to succeed yeah and co-coats is is a central figure in in the peace because one he's one of the more you know significant public intellectuals particularly in terms of the written word over the last 15 years people like Ibram Kendi Kent he couldn't even carry Tana Hasey Coates jockstrap because every Kendi column is basically a repetition of racism, sexism, capitalism, homophobia, transphobia, so on and so on and so forth and racial equity that's that's every Kendi column but Coates is both the person who said they I'm paraphrasing that they made us a race we made ourselves a people right so he's talking about the impact that slavery and segregation had on sort of forming and fortifying the black community you had slaves that came from all over Africa but once they came here they are what sort of formed over the genesis of what we now know as black America right so we don't identify as Angolan Americans or Gambian Americans we're black or some people say African American but Coates is also the person that said to your point that there's no problem with black people that the complete and total eradication of white supremacy couldn't fix I cannot think of a less manly statement to make Tana Hasey Coates for all of his soaring rhetoric right and his his dexterity would depend that that is the declaration of a child what he is doing is putting all agency all responsibility for the condition of the black community and he didn't write this in 1922 he wrote this in like 2016 2018 he's putting it all on the shoulders of white people and what I said similar to what I said in my clarinet's Thomas column is that for the black left or the left in general this is their worldview on race white people do things black people have things done to them white people are always the subject of the sentence and black people are always the object we're not even the star of our own autobiography Jason it's the white man oppressed us and now the white man has to come and save us and you can't build a community with people like that who have such an aversion to responsibility and after that I mentioned the quickest way to get the most radical black activists to turn into a white lives in matter field organizer is to talk about crime in in large cities like Baltimore St. Louis Chicago New York Philly then you get the question now it's the only time they ask this question they'll say well what about white on white crime now that's curious because they never bring up white people when it comes to police shootings they never bring a white people when it comes to drug overdoses or suicide or any of the other social maladies or social pathologies that plague the quote unquote white community but as soon as it comes to talking about violence in our neighborhoods where black people are 90 percent of the victims and 90 percent of the perpetrators then all of a sudden they turn into team United Nations and now they want to care for all the people of the world in Cincoomba yah and you and I know that that's not that's not real concern it's a it's a it's a diversionary tactic it's a dodge it's it's the clarion call of people who cannot accept accept any responsibility for their behavior so for me again it just shows that this is another one of those forces that's pulling the community apart you can't have a community where people particularly men refuse to take responsibility for anything we we are going to be a servant class in the next 30 years there's going to be a small black elite and middle class and then you're going to have a large the large black masses who are disproportionately dependent on the government and who exists in the state of multiple partner fertility right every guy's gonna have three baby moms and every woman's gonna have four baby daddies and uh uh perpetual co-parenting that that's what it's going to look like in in another 30 years if we do not get our act together i i i want i love your point about how unmaskulent tana hec coaches words make him appear uh but here's what he would say and people like him would say is like i i want the responsibility of fixing white people and that's why that's literally i i'm i'm would see you a man enough to do the work of calling out white people and fixing them and again that's why you know and i'm i'm not trying to be abusive to people but i'm just gonna put names on that's why manio archo had a show uncomfortable conversations with a black man where he went out and talked to white people we'd love to go out and fix up and play therapist for white people that's why ebrand kendy x is out collecting money uh teaching white people how to not be racist that's why tana hec coats every all of his books are directed at written forward to white people on how they can better themselves we have established a hospital a doctor's office staff by black liberals that go out and their lives are dedicated to improving white people because they think there's some salvation for them in that and then they turn around and look at me look at you look at the people on this show and say why y'all sitting around talking to black people about how we what we should do is like well don't we think doctors are good therapists are good improving yourself because again the conversations i'm trying to have i'm having with myself also it's all a reminder of me jason improve you be responsible for you you have the power you can take these biblical principles apply them to you your family your friends your situations your existence and things will get better for you i don't have a problem with white people everybody knows that about me i don't have and again i'm willing to partner with white people i'm willing to partner with people who are willing to work on themselves but but i'm not sitting around thinking about how i can improve white people because i grew up around black people my family most of my friends are black i want us to embrace things that will improve our life and our existence and our happiness and our salvation here on earth coats archo ebrum kendy rolling martin every they their lives are dedicated to improving white people they should own that they should and you know we we've talked about rolling martin i've talked about the root the grille um at one point i was doing research on a on a for a column and i counted i think they were over 150 articles that the root had that were tagged white people rolling martin has an entire section on his youtube channel with karen videos right rude white middle-aged white women who get into verbal disputes with black folk these are the things that our sort of ethnic media focus on now they they will not say a word about the hundreds of school children toddlers too even if you want to look at toddler like five-year-olds through eight-year-olds in these big cities who end up getting killed and driveby's on their porches while they go into school while they're walking home from school none of these outlets will talk about that but if you find a white lady in shaboygan wherever the shaboygan is whatever state it's in and she says a crossword to a black lady as they leave the target parking lot or yeah rolling martin's gonna find that he's gonna find that and you're gonna say look it we haven't called this we haven't come very far because as you in the same way and i've said this before that the true north of the feminist movement is is the alpha male right is masculinity the true north of the anti-raceness racist racist movement is white folks these these people are perpetuating an anti-antii identity they they have no um sort of vision for what the future for black folks could and should look like that they can speak of affirmatively it's always what they're against never what they're for and that's why it's not a lot of times people say oh black conservatives want to act like racism doesn't exist no that's not the case it's not i think it doesn't exist it's that from my own experience i grew up in new york city in a in a neighborhood that was almost exclusively black by the time i came of age right i i've spent all of my life in and around large cities up and down the east coast i married to a woman from houston the vast majority of black people that i've known in my life have grown up in majority black neighborhoods so what we say and do to one another actually matters it doesn't matter what somebody in aiowa says or what they feel about me and my family because they're not around me so we're the ones who've been pumping our heads full of uh uh violence and uh degradation and drug abuse for the last 30 years and it's playing out in our actions so as i said the the the notion that these things don't matter until white people get their act together it's just not something that i can i can get with i believe in take your responsibility for the things that you can control because if every white person followed elan must to the moon tomorrow went back to their ancestral european homeland every single issue that's facing black america today will be staring us in the face tomorrow and the rolling martins and even kendy's and the tannasi coaches and the co- hannah joneses would have nothing to say because they're their entire industry would be up right they they don't have they have they they don't they can't describe again what a future for black folk woodin should look like one that has strong faith strong family educational excellence dignity self-respect where a state center would never think about posting a video of herself on a handstand twerking as if she's some stripper at magic city she wouldn't do that because she would have too much respect for herself and even the women at magic cities would come off the polls because they would say i don't want my daughter to follow in my footsteps because i want her to have some respect for herself but we don't do that we say that that's playing respectability politics so as i said if your community and you use respectability as a pejorative and you think hore hop and hore culture is empowering you are going to be in trouble and that's and that's what the great separation is about and i think some people see it some people starting to wake up and say look we can't build with these people you can't build a cardie bee you can't bake with build with megan estalian they want to kill off all your offspring you a man you say i'm a king what does a king need he needs a queen he needs territory as soon as you meet your queen she says i don't want that baby and you say well whoa well how am i supposed to be a king that's that's where we are now and i would like for our leaders the afro-stocracy to take some responsibility for the way that they've mismanaged our community for the last 60 years but i know they won't do that unless the white people tell them to do that and as i said as i said but all the time where we find ourself as it comes to race is is because of the symbiotic relationship between white liberals looking for absolution for sins that they didn't commit and black liberals looking for empathy for injustices that they didn't endure those two groups are locked in in a relationship with one another and we need to break that if we want to see any progress thank you delano uh i'm gonna let you go i gotta keep it moving but i i'm gonna put a button on delano's point just just i'm gonna add a little touch of humor to his point just a hammer his point about like if white people all follow elon musta mars and how whatever problems we have here is black people will still exist white people gone what he's basically saying is like if they all go to mars jason whittlock is still gonna like fried chicken and he's gonna have to fix his fried chicken problem if he wants to lose weight that's what he means by that final final thought on this whole deal is this whole thing of of racism doesn't exist does not remotely my message delano's message point of this show it exists what's your best path of combating it commit to being a doctor for entharpist dr melphy for white people or adopt these biblical values and principles that have the 2000 years of collective wisdom found in the bible partner with christ and other christians regardless of their ethnicity adopt those values partner with those people connect with those people embrace those values within yourself that will combat racism far better than emmanuel acho's uncomfortable conversations with white people tony hec coaches books ebrum kenji's anti racism speeches and uh titt talks those will do nothing people running their mouth and flapping their guns they've been doing that for hundreds of years does not eliminate does not even combat racism adopting biblical values and principles applying those to your life those actually work all right uh i hear tomorrow that's it for us uh we'll see you next week you"
