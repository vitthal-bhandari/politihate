    "text": " Politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative true the conservative review with Daniel Burns. Welcome back fellow American Patriots and Minimans standing at the ready to fight anew for life, liberty, property and true equality here at CR podcast. This is your host Daniel Hurwitz back here today for Thursday and we got a lot of interesting things to talk about today. You know of all the top eight to ten existential threats to our society or liberties or way of life really in till now at least less two generations. The lead ship in the armada of those who have destroyed Western civilization is identity politics. Okay, that's how they made people feel guilty. The sexual stuff certainly the racial stuff and that is what has gotten us to adopt. I mean think about everything from education to employment to all sorts of public policies, fiscal policy is all based on race and now you got the gender politics too. Of all things I do feel that we have the biggest momentum the biggest tailwinds that are back when it comes to identity politics and we're gonna have coming up a little bit later on law professor discussing the affirmative action ruling the Harvard admissions case and what that means what we need to do about it. We'll start off before then with with the gender side of it but I think it's undoubtedly clear that on both fronts we are winning. All the polls show that. I'm not gonna tell you I have faith in the public I really don't on a lot of things but I think it's reached the point that people have had enough of just the unfairness of identity politics. But like everything else just because you're winning on the message in the abstract doesn't mean the policies will change on their own. Whether it's a court ruling whether it's just in general it's lost favor with the public. You have a successful boycott or two. It's not self-executing. You have to change it and that's why here we always have a sense of urgency. See I'm not black peeled I'm red-pilled I don't think it's all all is lost it will be lost if we don't change the game create a movement that's focused on substance and outcomes. But if we did I think particularly on these issues there's a lot we can win on. So I want to I want to discuss that again from both angles of the identity spectrum of evil today. First speaking of spectrum you need to have 2020 vision a spectrum of vision to actually see properly function properly and even think properly yes your brain works with it with your eyes and it actually is a spectrum of prescriptions and that's why I recommend better spectacles. See when you look straight ahead that's one prescription but when you look down to read your eyes torque in and converge in a way that gives you a slightly different prescription when you look peripherally that's another prescription. So with these glasses you can actually move just your eyes you don't have to move your whole head and it accommodates it. It's it's really an ingenious technology they have the biometric intelligence glasses not only is better spectacles the only conservative American company but they import authentic German rodent stock eyewear. But part of the problem is you go to a lot of stores nowadays and they're all marketed towards fashion and the functionality is really secondary. Even if a store offers expensive name brand lenses there are at least a decade behind in technology from rodent stock. So that's why I want you guys to go to better spectacles.com.com.com. Conservative everyone in the audience who has gotten it has not been disappointed just like my glasses my family I know Steve Dase has gotten better spectacles as well and I adapted to them right away they're changing lives daily. So again go now to better spectacles.com.com.com. Conservative to schedule your teleoptical appointment and get 61% off your frames today. So folks we have this article here. You know when you talk about the dichotomy and it's not even a dichotomy because they kind of work together between the seriousness the urgency the destruction of these policies but at the same time it's kind of two sides of the coin the blowback and the opportunity to fight them. By now some of you have probably seen this. There's an article been floating around from off the press.com and it talks about the fact that 38% of students it's actually Matt Lamb of the Washington Examiner is the is the original source. 38% of students identify as just one of the sexual alphabet things up from 14% in 2010. So obviously they're way ahead of everyone else but that that's a reflection of the broader society totally normal totally natural just like being born with blue eyes and red hair. You're just born that way. Yeah and a matter of a few few years like this is not funny and I just want to say again before we get into the racial part but with the gender ideology we have the opportunity to extra-paint this garbage from our society completely but if we don't do it very soon it will be embedded. Some of you might have seen the discussion I had yesterday on Steve show where I was saying that Bruce Jenner is so much of a greater threat than William Thomas who's called Leah Thomas the one messing up female swimming and my point was you know two things number one female sports is not does it rise to the magnitude of civilization like on the trajectory to a quarter to half of all kids being born now being groomed into an environment where they're confused about their sexuality. I mean that's literally procreation right there when you look at polls as 40% in a given area don't identify as something that could procreate like that is a nuclear bomb that's literally dropping Hiroshima Nagasaki on America you can't have a civilization like that this is a point that conservatives have to stop shying away from. Stop finding some sort of like oblique glancing way of making the argument well it's gonna create logistical fairness problems and female sports I mean that's true but is that the biggest consequence of this and that's where the Bruce Jenner's come in they're like call me Caitlyn gender is fluid and not only that if this is accepted on the on the right and the Trump right we are okay with this is what is just don't screw up female sports that's his message to create this fake overton window where you fight over some minute point all the while creating bipartisan consensus behind something much more destructive and this goes well beyond Leviticus and you know this stuff about cross-dressing and homosexuality and whatever God forbid all of forbid should we ever believe in that in this country but this is just you don't even have to be religious this is a separate point you could be the most you know homosexuality is awesome I mean sodomy it just doesn't get better than that and all this stuff but you have to admit that forever that could only remain a tiny minority lifestyle because what happens if you take 25% of all humanity and turn them into that you can't function I mean let's forget even the people who abhorrently believe in same-sex couple adoption which is pretty pervasive among conservative loserdom they have to admit where the hell do you get that kid from it's never going to be an equal proposition even in their you know perverted decadent worldview it just can't be so at some point you need to uproot the premise of the argument and go after the fact that you can't have a civilization where you're grooming people that it is an equal proposition you could be a man you could be a woman you could love a man love a woman that's never again I'm making a secular argument here purely a secular argument not that I shy away from the biblical argument although it kind of is the biblical argument because it's Leviticus and there's Genesis this is really more the Genesis argument civilization is built off of a woman and a man and a woman acting womanly and a man acting manly and as I've mentioned before it's not just the trainee stuff it's this broader like you go girl culture that like women are a hundred percent encouraged to work even during the formative years you know full-time just like a man you're a lesser person if you don't you're a failure in your career motherhood is a is a ways you down and then just this whole general kind of like you know ruining the culture of a lady being a lady and a man being a man masculinizing women and feminizing men I'm saying even short of what we've seen the last couple years this thing has been coming in the culture for a long time and by the way some that does tie into our next discussion with affirmative action this whole thing with and I know I'll get hate mail for this but um this whole thing of like encouraging and mass women in combat and and women and police and fire fires and inevitably obviously a lot of it is built off the same affirmative action that you have with the Harvard and UNC admissions case so this really all ties into it but I think as a society we have dabbled in this for so long it's like a trick waking up from a drunken stupid you're like man that was stupid and I think that's where we are it's gotten so bad now there's still way too many insane people but it's certainly a majority opinion against this but we have to first of all as a conservatives we need to start living the life of Genesis you know you know Genesis 3 we need to live that life stop adopting the leftist culture while claiming we're against it and be as a matter of policy we have to forge ahead extirpating every references and and now you know the good thing about the trainee stuff is it gave us an opportunity now to go after the libraries and the schools with the pornography which you know the stuff that even predated some of the the LQ whatever stuff no pornography should be okay so we're winning on this issue the worst thing we could do is to have Mar-a-Lago and Rick Greenell and Bruce Jenner create consensus beyond a minority view while we're actually winning as a majority and we can't I mean this thing has to be shoved back as soon as possible because this is this is just unsustainable so that is the first part I want to get to the race stuff but first just some news from from Congress this segment is sponsored by our friends at Raycon okay in the summer you know certainly if you're on vacation you're gonna want to walk around with

So one of the things bleeding over where we really are at a precipice, and this is very important. Like I talked about yesterday, we need all hands on deck to force all Republican members to a vote for the amendments getting rid of affirmative action, gender and race racial agendas in the military. This is in the defense authorization bill and making sure they commit to the fact that they will not support an NDAA and vote against final passage if not enough of these amendments pass. So late last night into the early morning, you know, it worked. And, you know, I think in this show, we had a little bit to do with that. Most of the 27 amendments I supported ranging from going after the green energy stuff, the vaccine stuff in the military, obviously the gender, the racism, Ukraine funding, they will all get a vote. We even have an amendment thing from Andy Biggs requiring them to pass an audit. And otherwise they face a half a percentage budget cut, which I think is a very important sea change and attitude and mentality change in this traditional Republican mentality of it's all good when it comes to the military. Just spend as much money. No, you know, it's time to hold them accountable. So the next two days, you're going to have a marathon of dozens and dozens and dozens of amendments. So watch my Twitter account at arm conservative. I might do a roundup in a column at some point, but I'm going to try to highlight and link to the voting tallies on some of the critical amendments. And, but again, I mean, this is where it's just bizarre. Tucker Carlson could tweet out Marjorie Taylor Greene, a couple other amendments on cutting funding for Ukraine. He could do that. I don't know why he doesn't do that. You know, this is your top issue. Don't tell me, well, I'm more philosophical, not activism. Yeah, but I mean, you're not allergic to it. It's okay to do it once in a while. And again, I think this would make a big, big difference. We're at the cusp of really getting rid of this stuff. This is important. And by the way, just one thing on Ukraine before we get to our guest on a, on a firm of action, on Tuesday, British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace, he said at that, uh, um, Lithuania, nados summit that he's hearing from a lot of people that were sick of being Amazon for Ukraine, like their private Amazon. I told them that last June, I said to the Ukrainians when I drove 11 hours to be given a list, I'm not Amazon. So if the freakin British Secretary of Defense could hold that view, is it too much to ask that the Republican party hold that view? I mean, but yet still, I mean, we have almost all this GOP senators, governors, and we'll see what the vote is like in the house, but it's, it's tough. I mean, there's almost no way that passes because you can only lose five Republicans. Now you might, I, ironically, there are still a handful of liberal Democrats that are somewhat, you know, principled on their anti-war stance, so that will bleed in. I mean, I'm not anti-war, by the way. You know, obviously, if they come to our border and we need to wage war, you wage it in full force. It's just that I'm anti-getting ourselves involved in things that, you know, have no national interest, no good national interest outcome, no logical outcome whatsoever. And they're just these sectarian tribal wars over, over territory that's been disputed and cannot be held against the advancing party just because of the ethnicity of the people. And it's just we've done too much of this, not against war, like, again, I don't want to get into this like aimless, endless populism without any grounding. I'm not anti-war. It's like, it's like, again, it's like, are you pro-vaccine, anti-vaccine, are you pro-surgery, anti-surgery? Are you pro-immigration? Are you anti-immigration? It's amounts, it's types, it's times, it's prudence, it's, it's all that. But anyway, you know, the, the affirmative action stuff, I really do hope that it will get unanimous GOP support. And then the question will just be, when the Senate Democrats balk at it, will the House hold their ground and refuse to pass another NDAA without it? So that's something definitely to watch, but let's get to our guest. So folks, right before the July 4th, how day weekend, we really got an amazing victory in the spirit of the declaration, all men are created equal, likely on par with, you know, rulings like the Dobs opinion, very, very seminal opinion in the case of UNC and Harvard admissions, where they ruled, hey, you know, violates the Constitution, you cannot have race-based preferences. As Robert said, in his majority opinion, an individual's race may never be used against him in the admissions process. College admissions are zero sum, he noted, a benefit provided to some applicants, but not to others necessarily advantages the former group at the expense of the latter. So, you know, again, I've been a critic of, of Roberts for a while, where we often, you know, don't even want to read his opinion, we just want to go straight to Thomas's concurrence. But in this case, his opinion was pretty categorical for Roberts. And you read language like that, what should follow based on that language is that certainly at a governmental level, because remember, Harvard Harvard is technically a private institution, it's just based off of public funding. So based on this opinion, we should be able to extra-paint all race-based preference, acknowledgement in terms of government programs completely. But the reality is it's really not self-executing. It's not like Obergefell in reverse when you have a liberal court opinion. It's like, oh, marriage is gone. Oh, boom, all 50 states done. No questions, no pushback. No, they'll say, all right, well, it's case in controversy. So in this case, in the case of Harvard, you can't use this process. But truth be told, it won't even end the litigation on even all admissions cases, much less you move on to employment, government programs. Congressional research service has a report, and this is from ages ago. So it's only gotten worse. And just in terms of explaining the scope of, you know, just how much we take race into account in terms, and not just like society and culturally, but in literally government legal favors and programs goals or set aside for minority groups, women, and other disadvantaged individuals have also been routinely included in federal funding measures for education, defense, transportation, and other activities over much of the last two decades. And now this is really four decades. And we have this going on even in red states, and it will continue to go on unless we make it stop. The court ruling will give us great momentum, but it's not self executing. Now is the time to really press our advantage on it. So to discuss this and more today, I want to bring in a new guest. Rob Steinbucke is a law professor at University of Arkansas, Little Rock. He was actually cited in Clarence Thomas's concurrence for his work on affirmative action and some of his academic papers, which we'll get to. He's also the author of the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act. He worked in the past as an attorney at the DOJ at the Senate Judiciary Committee. So really has a lot of governmental experience as well, and it's truly an honor to welcome him today. Rob, really, I've been meaning to get you for so long, and what a time in your line of work. Welcome to Blaze Media for the first time. Great to be here, my friend. Thank you. All righty. So let's just start with your line of work that was, you know, you got a pleasant surprise. You woke up and he found you were quoted by Clarence Thomas. So he was, my understanding is the context he was using you to push back against the dissent, which often a concurrence does. Justice Jackson said, quote, Black people and other minorities have generally been doing better, but those improvements have only been made possible because institutions like University North Carolina have been willing to grapple forthrightly with the burdens of history and basically the grappling means things like affirmative action admissions. So in what way did Justice Thomas use your work? What is your work pushing back against that premise? We all know it's unfair to whites and Asians, but how it doesn't work for blacks either. That's exactly right. And that last point of yours is the key to the research that I've done that was cited by Justice Thomas in a co-authored opinion, excuse me, a co-authored article that I wrote with Richard Sander. And we studied the effects of affirmative action on law school graduates. In particular, we look at how they succeed or fail on the bargaining and our study, along by the way with a previous study that I did, and let me reference that one in response because it captorates perhaps more simply the point that I'm raising here, which is I look at a very large data set of students and the bar failure rate for black in this cohort of some 500 students, I think, was double that of white. Now, from, you know, so these people already graduated law school. They took the bar exam and you have twice the failure rate for black than you did for white. Now, it's obviously not a function of their skin color, right? This is not a function of rights, but race is by definition linked to affirmative action. So what we've done is we let in students with dramatically lower metrics, which do in fact reflect abilities and then expect them to do the same as everyone in their class. And the paper that I did with Richard Sander, in fact, highlights that latter point, which is you can't put students with dramatically different abilities into a class, dramatically lower abilities and expect them just to magically keep pace. And that's a mismatch problem that we talk about. And why students, minority students, without the benefit of these huge preferences, would do better. You're going to school or going to a school in which they are well matched with their classmates. They won't be fishes out of water, so to speak. And that's the difference. We've got to ensure that students are going to the white school. They will succeed more, not less. Wait a minute. So if you could throw out some of your numbers there, if I'm getting this correct, you're suggesting that your research shows that if you try to at the front end, give Black perspective law students a leg up based on race and not, you know, ability to maybe put them in another tier level law school, it will bite them on the back end. You're finding higher failure rates of the bar relative to, let's say, if they would have been in what's considered a lower level law school, but they're more likely to pass the bar, which is ultimately what you want. And more likely to learn more because that's the thing. Try learning French by just going into an advanced French class as your introduction. You'll understand none of it. The way you learn French or any other language or any other topic for that matter is with increasing doses of information. And the problem when you take students who are not well matched with their classmates and the school is they are in a torrent of information instead of starting out on the less deep end of the pool. I realize I've mixed a bunch of metaphors in there, but the point is clear that it's not about whether they can succeed, it's the right environment for anybody to succeed. And this is why we see when Black students are admitted undergraduate to schools that they're mismatched with, they're failure rate in the STEM, like the sciences and technology, mathematics, areas, engineering is remarkably low. So what we're doing is by quote benefiting and quote students, Black students, in particular minorities, somewhat more broadly, by giving them this huge preference when to go to college is that we're basically telling them, you can't be a STEM major because you don't have the background to be a STEM major. I had this in some respects when I went to college and I took a chemistry class in college and I leaned over to the student next to me and I said, do you follow what's going on? I don't follow what's going on. And he said to me, well, yeah, just like AP chemistry. And I said, but I took AP physics, not AP chemistry. And he goes, oh, you got a problem. That's the point, right? I wasn't well matched for that class. Not that I couldn't learn chemistry, just not in that class. And I dropped it. So this is the problem. We are not helping students by dropping them into the English channel and saying, hey, learn this way. Not a good idea. Exactly. Exactly. And you can never change the trajectory of natural law. And that's really what you're doing. And then at the back end, you're either going to fail them more or eventually they're going to feel guilty about that. And then you're going to start having, you know, affirmative action on the back end. And there's a lot of concerns on, I know, medical schools, kind of a parallel thing. So, you know, I think the public really does get this the point you're making the fairness really in both directions is a problem. But then obviously we have this other issue, which is, you know, okay, these type of people behind this, there's a whole institution behind this mentality, they're not just going to give up easily. And you know, a lot of people like, oh, it's the end of affirmative action. Well, I mean, you find in red state governments, we're still having these small business loans. Well, if you're a black small business, you get X number. Well, I mean, that's, that's unconstitutional. So you were trying to work on this to, and this was regardless of the Supreme Court ruling. But certainly now I feel like we have more tailwinds. Arkansas SB 71, I know you were working on drafting it. So right now we have eight states, I believe, not up to nine. Yeah, we're up to nine. Yeah, that ban some degree of affirmative action and parts of the public sector, you know, state government, employment or education. So it's not even that broad. But a lot of states, including red states, like Arkansas do not have that describe SB 71, what happened and what you're trying to do and how that could be replicated. Yeah, so we just basically borrowed from California with what they did with Prop 209, which was to end affirmative action only in the governmental context, only in the public context. And the state Senator Dan Sullivan, author of the bill, it was co sponsored in the house by the system dollars, the state representative, of course, and that bill made it to the Senate committee, through the whole Senate, through the House committee, and then failed quite significantly on the House floor, because frankly, there are too many denominated Republicans in the party, here in Arkansas, that don't abide by conservative values. Indeed, it's a plank in our platform, but that was disregarded by those members. Of course, the Democrats voted against that, but I don't blame a mosquito for singing me. I just tried to swab it away, but Democrats spoke about against it. There's only 14 of them in the house. They didn't kill the bill. The Republicans killed the bill. And that's really unfortunate. Now, and that was before this opinion came out, needless to say. And so now the opinion has come out. And in fact, I have a column of coming out this Sunday, I write a weekly column in the states newspaper, the Democrats to debt. Democrats doesn't refer to party, refer to democracy. And the column asked the governor to put this on the agenda for the current session, which is called a fruit co-session, well, it's coming up in January, meaning we have alternating years. We don't have a full legislative session coming up in 2024. We have a fruit co-session, but you can bring up regular bills in a variety of ways, but one way is by the governor asking for it to be brought up. So I'm asking for the governor to ask the legislature to tell the legislature to bring up the issue. If she's interesting, because this really is at the core of the conservative movement, and now that we have this opportunity, like you say, we're either at the end of the beginning or the beginning of the next step, but we're certainly not all the way there. And there's a lot more that needs to be done, and passing the law that exists in only United States, in other states, including, of course, very conservative Arkansas, is the next step. And you highlighted something that I'm not sure you realize is going on in Arkansas, that a state department just put out a statement, the Arkansas Economic Development Commission, say, oh, you know, we're very interested in loans for minorities and loans for women. Well, you just put out a statement that's in contravention of the law. And that statement came out after the Supreme Court opinion. So this, yeah, so this is the point. I mean, this is what drives me nuts. It's like, you know, it's like the Supreme Court could rule just like the world's upside down that, you know, I don't know, all 8 billion people have an affirmative right to immigrate, you know, appeal to a billion people the way. And like, in three seconds, it's like, boom, it's like, there's, but when it's the other way around, it's like, and this was a pretty categorical ruling. I mean, to elevate one race over another in terms of a government policy, you know, procurement, hiring, you know, I mean, it didn't technically deal with that area, but it clearly applies to that. You know, that violates the 14th Amendment and really the declaration of independence. I mean, just the values that our country has founded upon, it's obvious everyone knows it whether you like it or agree with the policy or not. It definitely cannot be constitutional. And yet it's still going on even in red state. So I just want to get a little political before we move back to the law. You know, I, you know, I want our listeners to understand that the country's closely divided. The Senate's been roughly 50-50 for a while. So imagine having a Senate, in your case, it's the House, but the Senate's kind of a similar ratio in 82 to 18 majority. I just looked it up. Okay. Like, how in the world does, and this didn't even go after the private sector, which I want to get to, this was just like, no discrimination based on sex, race, national origin, and procurement, hiring, and education, public. Okay. What did, what did these Republicans say? I don't get it. What about the governor? Well, look, that, that, the question is, why did these Republicans vote against it? And they had all sorts of excuses, but the excuses didn't hold water. And it's time to step up and be a conservative part of the problem, mind you, is that some of the Republicans were Democrats a handful of years ago, and they switched party to stay in office or to get into office. And they apparently haven't switched philosophy. But others are just not committed enough to stand by what's in our platform and of course- But who's pushing it? Is it the chamber of commerce? Like, what special interest would be against it that if you're a Republican, you're scared of in a state like Arkansas? It's a great question. Right. And I don't know where the chamber is on this. The chamber has done many things that I'm not particularly happy with. So I can add that to the list if it's the case. But I don't know in this instance whether they're again, cramping down on discrimination by the government, because that's what the affirmative action is. But, you know, it's a great question. Part of the problem is I'm not sure if there's a definitive answer that if it's driven from the outside or is it driven by essentially a lack of commitment by these elected officials? I don't know the answer. Are they scared of getting called names? I think that's part of it. You remember the day before Trump was president that when a Republican went up against Democrats, Democrats would invariably call them racist for anything. Just call them and too many Republicans ran scared. And then after Trump was elected, we started to see a change in attitude which was for elected Republicans to say, don't call me names. That's not true. And I'm not going to run away. But some of these Republicans are running away. And we need more backbone and we need to pass it. And we need to pass it now. And in many states, again, this is a very important message that a lot of people miss. My colleagues all love, you know, they love like elections. They think they're self-executing. That's right. Over Republicans won. And I tell them all the time, well, in 50% of the country, they have super majorities. They win all the time. And it's not self-executing. It doesn't happen on its own. You've got to fight for the policy outcomes. You've got to fight for the legislation. And even the court opinions, at least when it's on our side, you know, it was a great opinion. I'm not trying to downplay it. But just the opposite, you use that as political momentum to then go and actually bring this past the goal line because at the end of the day, it's still happening. Even in the red states, we know what I have a niece who's applying to medical school. And she knows that it's a strike against her not being, you know, a darker shade of skin is going to be against her. And it definitely is a problem. And look, there's something also that the court can't control. She should be thankful. She's not Asian. Why do I say that? Because Asians are discriminated even against, even more so than she's discriminated against. And she's discriminated against. You know, I say that as an example, they say, this isn't even about white versus minority. Somehow, Asians have fallen off the list of minorities in terms of admissions to school. They're no longer a minority. And these false memes, by the way, about, oh, it's a bunch of working is, you know, most Asians in America or middle class or lower and dissociates that somehow they lift a privileged life historically in America is nonsense. Absolutely nonsense. And it's also a diverse set of Asians too. It's kind of a massive continent. You know, there's a lot of different types and and and multi like Indians are, you know, at the bottom, you know, the short end of the stick of affirmative action, but the far East Asians as well. So, you know, there's a lot of different ones. But my point is that, you know, the court itself is not going to be able to police the subterfuge that, you know, these other games they're going to play, but shouldn't it be incumbent upon this, you know, if you're a red state, I mean, these are state institutions, let's see if University of Arkansas, University of Florida, whatever, they should really be able to make it clear that, hey, we're going to be looking at this. So what are some ways that, you know, short of quota? So they're not going to do that at the front door now because they'll, you know, be targeted for lawsuit. But what are some ways to ensure that that they're not engaging in subterfuge to try to make sure they have a back ended quota system? Well, we've got to look at how they're admitted students. You hear now in the media, all schools are talking about dropping the SATs or the LSATs or the MCATs. Why? Because they are afraid that in a handful of years from now, someone will bring to like Edward Bloom did in this case and say, give us the data on your admission. And they will show that the admissions bill are admitting students, minority students, which are highly disparate grades. So what do they do? They can either get rid of their hidden affirmative action or get rid of the scores on the entrance exam. And they're talking about getting rid of the scores on the entrance exam. So states need to ensure that their public universities are maintaining standards by continuing to require these exams, which are good measures of ability. Not they'd be all an adult because nothing is, but here's the thing. What are they replacing it with? Hot air! Oh, well, you see, what we want to do is we want to look at the students they say. Do they exhibit leadership skills? And grit? Grit? Like the stuff that sandpaper is made out of when you look for 100 grits at the Home Depot. Is that stamped on the head of a student? Well, you're more abrasive and therefore have more grit than the next guy? How do you measure grit? The A, the A, it's covered for these race based admissions programs. So we need to speak to valid metrics. Hey, continue to have interviews, continue to to look at extra-curricular activities, but you need to look at these merit-based measures. And I don't want to hear this nonsense. Like I saw in the Wyoming legislative session, we had a bunch of these rhinos were like, and this was with regard to the pornography in the libraries there and the different and the gender studies as well. And they're like, it's none of our business. And I'm like, what do you mean? This is the University of Wyoming. The legislature funds it. And so we need to get back to this notion that, you know, the left, when they control something, they make sure it reflects their values. We should make sure if you're in a red state that, you know, the state universities should not be as left wing as they are in California. You don't have to make them a ferningly right wing, but just certainly the things like fairness and affirmative action should be stamped out. And I think there should be heavy-handed regulations that, that tried to police some of these back-ended quotas that they try to do because it is public. But here's what I want to end. I want to take this to the next level. Yeah. Private institutions. So, so, and not just education, but obviously you have all these mega corporations that are openly have these hiring programs that openly discriminate against certain types. And I said, we're only looking for blacks. We're only looking for this. So, so here's the thing. Obviously, from the Constitution standpoint, you know, a private entity could say, I don't like X group. I want this group. You're able to do that. But kind of depends what kind of private entity because remember, in the 60s, when we passed the Civil Rights Act, which includes Title VI, which is what we use against UNC, includes Title VII, which says you can't discriminate against people and employment. And we have public accommodations, meaning Denny's can't say only whites allowed because the court determined that we can, because it was a controversial point. That's what I wanted to say. Yeah. So, our side, you know, again, generically, ideologically, I don't like getting involved in such regulations. Like, if I were starting a country anew, which we didn't have, but like you said, the 60s changed that. We do have Title VI in education. We do have Title VII in employment. And it's not just public, but private as well. If I were to have a company that I said for these jobs, we really only want whites, I would get hit with a lawsuit very quickly and I would likely lose. My philosophy is, and I want to see if you agree in what we need to do in these red states, shouldn't we, again, you're not getting rid of this stuff. We're not getting rid of Title VI, Title VII. Shouldn't that be applied evenly? 100%. You know, this is, and you're absolutely like conservative, don't sort of follow through enough on some of these issues. That is, Title VII, the legality of Title VII has been decided since the 60s. And it says that it applies to private businesses. So, it's already applying. Well, we shouldn't go into a battle unarmed. We have Title VII if people are being discriminated against because they're white, because they're Asian, and Title VII says you're not allowed to do that, we absolutely need to bring those cases. The Title VII doesn't only exist for, say, African-American and Hispanic. And indeed, years ago, I litigated a Title VII case for a guy, a white guy, and it was, as they called it, a reverse discrimination case. Now, when we always thought reverse discrimination, it says discrimination. I hate that term, yeah. Right. But I understand sort of why people use it. It's a shorthand for saying discrimination again. In this case, it was white. But absolutely. That's the law. And it's well settled law. So, sorry, you know, you may have principles that say, well, in the grand scheme of things, I wouldn't have set up the law that way. But it's the law. So use it. Exactly. So, to me, all of these DEI programs that you have, certainly, even in the red states, where they don't have it in government, which a lot kind of do, but, you know, and your bill, again, you've got to walk before you run. And I understand you're starting with SB 71 is public. But I'm glad that you're behind this. I believe that you, and I said the same thing with disability. We have ADA, we have OSHA, we have anti-discrimination. So then suddenly, when it came to, like, you have to spend a million dollars to build ramps and this in affirmative accommodations. Then when it came to COVID, like, I could literally, you know, you could have asthma, you could have a rape victim that can't put anything on your mouth. You won't get serviced. You'll drum that of all economy if you don't wear a mask. Like, like, whoa, I mean, shut up, Daniel. Private sector can do whatever they want. I'm like, really? That's news to me. You know, I don't like adding new layers. But I do like, you know, like you said, not going into a battle, you know, where they're armed and we're not. If inevitably you're going to have these laws, which clearly, you know, whether we like them or not, they're like on par with the Constitution, we're not getting rid of them. So I would love to see us go after this DEI stuff, not just the programs, which, you know, I mean, if you're a private company, you could teach whatever stupidity you want and have whatever seminar you want. But it's not just the seminar. It's in their hiring practices. They're clearly elevating grace. And, you know, you see it in every layer of society. So my hope is that a, we could start, you know, more aggressively pushing laws, but b, you know, litigating based on Thomas and Gorsuch's concurrence, which, you know, they said it's not just the 14th Amendment, but, but Title VI violation and with employment would be Title VII. And that would reverberate to the private sector as well. My, my final question, I just want to, I know we're pretty much at a time here. I do see some of these left wing groups have filed based on this, this ruling complaint against Harvard for legacy admission. So they're trying to say, all right, you're saying you can't, you know, discriminate based on status. Well, you know, you guys consider family ties to donors or alumni when deciding whether to admit students. And that should be a problem too. What's your legal opinion on that? Two fall, one is morally, they're 100% right. Because places like Harvard hold themselves out as institutions of excellence and that they admit people based on merit. And it's not entirely true. In fact, it's often not true. One example of course was affirmative action, but legacy is just as bad and it should be eliminated. However, the legal standing is not the same, right? Because Title VII bars in employment context, Title VI in education context, and of course, the 14th Amendment in the public arena, all three of them bar discrimination based on race. And legacy is not right. So I think they have a more difficult legal challenge. But I think morally, they're entirely right. And I hope legacy is eliminated. I don't see that as being appropriate in any sort of institution that claims to be based on merit. But it's not the same legal argument that, Hey, you know, your parents donated more money. I mean, there's nothing in the Constitution or or any statute, precluding that. But again, the point is, folks, I just hope you see from Professor Steinbach here, there, this is such a so much of a broader issue than just college admissions. Oh, yeah. And it really is so pervasive for an entire two generations. And it's not going to be stamped out alone. And that's why we got to work, build on this momentum legally, policy wise and the legislature. Where could people find more of your work? Well, excuse me, you can look on the database called SSRN. That is a public database that allows you to access articles. I don't have all of my nearly all of my articles up there. But the one that Justice Thomas cites to is up there. So start there. And then of course, you can contact me at the university. You know, my name and likeness are on the university website, send me an email, it's r e Steinbach at ualr.edu. But if you didn't catch it, just Google it. And I look forward to hearing from anyone who's interested in this topic because I always like to share the research that I've done to help move the ball forward on this issue. Perfect. And you certainly have moved the ball forward. Let's move it past the goal line. Looking forward to having you back, keeping us updated on this legislation in Arkansas and around the country. Take care and hope you come back soon. And folks, you know, that was just terrific. He's a real happy warrior. Glad I met him. Not just an academic, but he gets on the playing field, you know, he'll do litigation and and obviously he helped write this bill in Arkansas that shockingly went down. I mean, all our guys like, ha, ha, affirmative actions did dead my foot. I mean, it's not dead even in the red States and we can't even rectify it in some places. Now, hopefully after this ruling, because all of this Supreme Court said so, there'll be more pressure, but Sarah, how could be Sanders? Where the hell is she? Her silence in that debate was pretty jarring. And you know, she needs to really get on this. And and again, that's only public, but I actually do believe in in private sector. Because the bottom line is if there's any whiff that you are discriminating against blacks and hiring, you will get a lawsuit and you will lose often even when it's not true. So I have no problem applying it evenly. And this is what I've been saying throughout the time. I don't want to put a new regulation on the private sector that didn't exist very, you know, readily just to achieve an outcome that we feel we need. But again, this is very similar to why you needed title seven, because at a systemic level, the government has imbued in society and often incentivize and work with society. And often the previous court decisions incentivize it and mandated it to to work against some groups of people in favor of others. So I have no problem applying that. And I think we need to go after some of these corporate hiring practices, you know, in a lot of the states. Now, I just will point out, my old adage, the ability of a good court decision to do good is nowhere near the ability of a bad court opinion to do bad. And like, like we're saying, you know, on its own, this opinion on identity politics with Harvard is not going to be that broad. But on the other hand, on the other ledger, the other side of the ledger that we started out with today, the gender stuff. So, you know, we're finally getting red states to go and deal with the castration and this stuff. You know, some of you might have noticed, we talked about a couple of these cases, one after another, the courts are so-called striking them down. Now, a lot of them hopefully will be overturned at the appellate level, because, you know, they typically shop them around to liberal judges at a district level. But all these things, whether it's the the castration stuff or the drag shows, puberty blockers, whatever, we have a problem of the 20 states that have passed laws restricting castration for minors, 11 of faced lawsuits. And five have had their stuff partially or fully blocked under the grounds that it violates the 14th Amendment, Arkansas, Alabama, Indiana, Kentucky, and Florida. Now, Florida, I have no doubt that the 11th circuit will overturn that. But my point is that I still do believe that if you put a gun to my head and say, Daniel, are we going to fight the left on their effort to delegitimize the court or actually agree with them and say, all right, you want to delegitimize it? Let's shake hands and do it evenly. I take the latter, because again, the ability of a good court opinion to do good is much more limited than the ability of a bad court opinion to do bad for a variety of legal and political reasons. And just the gap between the energy and brazenness of the two movements and parties, although we don't have a movement, only they have a movement that's kind of why we have an industry. So either way, in order to get good things, you're going to have to fight it out legislatively, in my view. So, you know, all the courts could do is just put a veto on the things that we actually do fight and win legislatively. And that's why I'm still, even after, you know, kind of a record of the last two years of good court opinions we've seen from the Supreme Court, I still maintain my opinion. I would rather de-emphasize judicial supremacism rather than elevating and crying about the left's attempts to water down the courts. I join with them. That's just my opinion there. But anyway, wanted a little bit of a change of pace. Tomorrow we're also going to have a change of pace. We're going to do a special show on cancer, cancer treatment. Are we getting it all wrong? Is that the other big lie, aside from COVID in big pharma? And, you know, where does cancer come from? Why is it exploding? Are we approaching it the wrong way with this kind of chemotherapy-based approach? Are there better alternatives? Let me know your questions for Dr. Paul Merrick. Tomorrow you can email me at ganylherwards.startmail.com. Till tomorrow, God bless you all, and thank you for listening."
