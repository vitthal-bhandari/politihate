Encourage you to make sure you never miss a moment. Go subscribe to the podcast, which is growing and spiraling in a good way. Like gangbusters. You can search out my name Clay Travis. You can search out Buck Sexton. Dub reads the review. So if you go give us a five star and you are entertaining, you may well hear your review read on the radio at some point. All of that we encourage you to be a part of the crew there. We talked and we'll continue to update you on the potential assassination attempt. I think it's fair to call it that of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as more details come out about the arrest that happened in the early morning hours of a Washington DC suburb outside of his home. So that is going to continue to be updated on the show. But I want to share some good news. We talked yesterday about all the different states that were going and having their primaries and primarily we focused on the state of California because there were real stakes in this primary election buck. And I want to hit two particular races of incredible significance that demonstrate the growing red wave and how it may even be sweeping across the state of California to two races. First, as we have let you know, the George Soros funded, Chesa Boudin district attorney of San Francisco, who has basically turned San Francisco streets into a cesspool, drugs, crime in terms of property crime, cars being burglarized homes. It's a beautiful city San Francisco. It is a total mess right now. We got a lot of listeners in the Bay Area who know exactly what we're talking about. So there's a recall, recall of Chesa Boudin attempted because crime is out of control and he's not taking it seriously enough. Chesa Boudin got recalled 60 to 40. Let me repeat that 60% of people voted in San Francisco, probably the single most liberal city in all of America. 40% supported him. Buck, this number one shockwave election. Now this is in line with what the polls were predicting. So this is what, you know, we, this is the reason why we've been talking about this for weeks. It did look like this was going to happen. I'm of two minds about this. I mean, on the one hand San Francisco, you have to check. I think the only city with a higher percentage. And when I say city, I mean, you know, of half a million or more, right? Is the only one that has a higher percentage of Democrats in San Francisco is actually Washington, DC. Oh, yeah. So San Francisco is very left wing as we all know. So you're looking at 90% plus Democrats. So 60% of 90% that are Democrats said we don't want to live with this anarchy anymore. Are our tests run off the purge for those of you who have seen the movie? Not fun. Not enjoying this. I do have questions about who the 40% are, but that just goes to show you no matter what Democrats put themselves through, because this is a Democrat enclave. There's no Republican to point a finger at. You can't blame any Republicans in office. These were all Democrat decisions pushed by Democrat voters. And I do have to say though, I think that one of the turning points and I remember this was it was about a year ago this time. You started to see editorials written by local San Francisco thinkers, writers, where they're making cases for things like, Hey, look, if someone's breaking into your home and they just want to steal your bicycle or they just want to steal your car, have it. Don't call the police because you could be inviting violence by the police against. And this was the argument disproportionately people of color. So allow someone, whoever it may be, irrespective of who the assailant may be in this case or the perpetrator may be, just let them steal your stuff. Even if you're home, don't call the police. They were making this argument. And I think that was when people in San Francisco all of a sudden were like, we got a real problem here, folks. It's a beautiful city and they have allowed people to run rampant through it. Is it Union Square in the center of San Francisco or is it Harold Square? Harold Square, New York City. I think you're talking about you. It's a is it. I don't know San Fran. Well, we've only been there once. I think it's Union Square. I'll look it up in a sec. But the other thing I would say, Buck, is you remember the viral videos of the organized? Those are big department stores high end shopping district in San Francisco. It went super viral where everyone was going in. This was not a random shoplifting. It is a hyper organized assault, basically, upon all of the high end shopping stores. And London breed, the mayor of San Francisco, trying to preserve herself effectively came out and said, we got to get this stuff under control. I think she used to award other than stuff. And so she'll get to a point, a new district attorney. But we've seen so many of these viral shoplifting mass events where it's clearly being done in a business like manner, where you just walk in and take everything. They changed the incentive structure for criminality in San Francisco. And by the way, not just San Francisco, the exact same mentality. And I want everyone to understand this because on the one hand, clan, I are sitting here saying what we tell you and what this audience knows to be true is true. Progressive left wing criminal justice reform and ending mass incarceration is a terrible idea. Good people of all ethnicities, you know, persuasions, religions, backgrounds, they all suffer as a result of these ideas. These are destructive. They are rooted in a kind of guilt complex and really societal nihilism. Oh, you know, we just burn it all down. Maybe we'll build something better when we're done. And this has been the case for years now in dozens of cities across the country. George Soros spent $40 million. Now that I know we talk about presidential elections and it's a billion dollars once I had a billion dollars. No one spends money on district attorneys races, which is why the fact that he was willing to throw $40 million. You spend a million dollars. You'll get a lunatic like Larry Krasner elected in Philadelphia, which just had its highest ever murder rate last year. You spend a million dollars. You'll get Kim Fox elected in Chicago. You'll get, I can't even remember all the progressive prosecutors. So Soros and the far left that he represents, because remember, there's all these organizations and nonprofits and that whole activist left wing movement seeded these prosecutors all over the country. And then we had the 30% increase in nationwide homicides from 2020 to 2021. Why was that the triggering moment? Why was that the year? Because they had put some of these policies in place, but they were in place. Meaning the prosecutors, the George Floyd incident happens. There's a nationwide racial panic. Police are thrown under the bus. Progressive prosecutors get to finally do what they'd really wanted to do for years. And we all suffered and innocent people going about their jobs, innocent people going about their lives were shot, bludgeoned, assaulted, raped and robbed. So that progressives in places like San Francisco and New York could feel better about themselves. Union Square, by the way, we were right. In San Francisco, huge shopping area that has been being robbed systemically for some time now and to build on your George Soros statements buck, 40 million dollars George Soros spent to elect 75 progressive prosecutors over the last decade, meaning one in five Americans now live in areas I'm reading from the daily mail covered by his criminal justice reformers. And this is such a clearly calculated attempt to take power politically where by and large district attorney races have been locally decided. People raise relatively small amounts of money and battle it out inside of neighborhoods with local voters deciding who the district attorney is. Soros exploited what he probably saw as a market inefficiency where he could spend 40 million dollars and impact the way that people were living all over America in a major way where you could never do it on a Senate race or you could never do it on a house race or a governor's race. And he organized and put in place a system that has led to utter collapse and ruination in many cities right now from a crime perspective. And that's why it's not enough just to look at the budan recall and say, oh, sanity is starting to rain in one city. There is a widespread ideology behind this. And I believe even cities like Houston has a pretty progressive or has had a progressive prosecutor in the past. I know the Chicago, New York, you know, Alvin Bragg, the new prosecutor here. Soros backed by the way. He though came into office and it was so his initial statements within the district attorney's office were so crazy that he had to scale it back a little bit because we had already suffered the huge increases in crime in the last couple of years that we had seen. But there was an ideology behind this. It was all Democrats. Republicans have been saying, Hey, hold on a second. Don't do this. This is bad. Don't don't make criminality legal. That was it's a very straightforward. The same way Clay spending too much money leads to inflation. Not enforcing the law leads to lawlessness. And there are a lot of Democrats for whom this became a difficult concept to grasp. It the reality of the world we live in was too much for them. They thought, you know what, if we're just nicer to criminals, don't prosecute them or let them get arrested 15 times, slap on the wrist, we'll all be safer because they'll be nicer. That's actually not how it works, which rational people, this audience, you and me know, but Chesa Boudin did not know this quite clearly. And by the way, the other race I wanted to mention in California, which I do think it's substantial. Now it's not decided there is a runoff that will now occur, but Rick Caruso, who was until a few years ago, a Republican and is now identifying as a Democrat, much like Mayor Bloomberg did. And let's be honest, big city Republicans and big city Democrats who are right on that line, sometimes finesse this. He is the leader right now in the election for the new mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, a former congresswoman who Joe Biden considered to be his VP choice and then decided Kamala Harris is way better than her. So hey, LA, you're listening to us right now in Southern California, Joe Biden considered Karen Bass as his vice presidential candidate, a running mate, and then said, wait a minute, Kamala Harris is way more skilled and way better at politics than Karen Bass. They're going to have a runoff between Caruso and Bass. Fingers crossed that Caruso can manage to get this win because it would be another seismic step in a return to rationality in one of the bluest states in America. So it's unfortunately not going to be, I think, a, uh, a Democrat party that does a lot of soul searching even in California after this, because they're just going to say, okay, we tried that. But now we can trust the reasonable Democrats, but we'll see how that goes too, because once you have the momentum of decay and crime in a city, you know, how you turn it, you don't turn it around just by being not crazy. You have to actually, whether it's Los Angeles or it's, you know, whether the mayor, the police commissioner, you got to clean things up, aggressively stop doing what you are doing and oftentimes do the exact opposite. So we'll see whether or not that happens, but these are two significant signs that we saw in Los Angeles and in San Francisco about what is coming, I hope, in five months in terms of a major and substantive change in the direction of this country.

Actually still on the table, though, to bring gas prices down at this point, because the president has said and made very clear that there's not much love that he can do. Unfortunately, that is the brutal reality. You know, this is in large part caused by Putin's aggression. You know, since Putin moved troops to the border of Ukraine, gas prices have gone up over $1.40 a gallon. And the president is asking for Congress and others for potential ideas. But as you say, the reality is that there isn't very much more to be done. Welcome back to Clay Ann Buck. That was the commerce secretary, Gina Raymondo, on the price of gas, which is about to bust through $5 a gallon nationally. It's like just pennies away from that right now. If you live in California, New York, I think the highest gas prices in the country right now are California, the Pacific Northwest. And then actually I saw this today. Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, some of those states have very high gas prices right now. It's over $8 in some of these places, Buck, which, which if you're somebody, especially, you know, you're, you're watching your budget closely, you're an employee who's paid an hourly wage, this really hurts. And there's no, there's no way around it, right? It hurts and it makes you angry every time you have to see those ticking numbers on it. It just makes you angry. And I just, I know that feeling. No, this is a problem, which is why depending on the day, it's don't worry. Biden's on it to today. It's, well, we've done everything we can do. It's not his fault. It's the Putin price hike. When we say they got nothing, we really mean it. They basically got nothing. You know, they're doing the defense production act for solar panels. Meanwhile, on the, on the gas side of things, and I think in part, this is, even if they took action, let's say they wanted to silence critics like you and me on this issue, right? And, and so they, the Biden administration sat down with people that actually know how to read a balance sheet, actually have run businesses and understand the energy sector, which is the fossil fuel energy sector, the real 80% plus of our energy needs. And it's like, well, what, what should they do? Uh, they won't do those things to even silence critics and show that they're willing to take action. And maybe it takes six months or 12 months to bring down the price, but they could say, Hey guys, we're doing it because the environmental lobby and donors won't, won't keep that, won't keep those cash flows going, going into the midterm and beyond. So they want to talk about special interests. That's a special interest for you. Worse than that, Buck, a lot of these people are actually cheerleading higher gas prices because that's the talking point that the Senator Stabenow from, uh, from Michigan used yesterday, which is look at me and my electric vehicle. I can just drive past and I don't even have to worry. Well, yeah, you spent 60 K on that electric vehicle. You got 60 K for a car. You're not worried about the price of gas anyway. This is yet another time where we are arguing with the irrational at its heart. This issue, this problem of gas, fossil fuel, climate change, the same mentality where we sit there, say, Hey, you don't really, you didn't really think that double masking was going to protect you. Right. And they're, yes, yes, they do believe this. They also really think that climate change is an existential threat to the planet. That's in the background of all of this, not all Democrats, but, but a fair number of enough Democrats. And so Clay, we are arguing with irrationality, which makes it almost impossible to gain any ground because to your point, someone think secretly, yeah, I like this high gas price. It means we're going to push forward into the green, new deal era. That's, that's their argument is that as gas prices go up, it makes other energy sources not seem as expensive because most of those are more expensive right now than coal or gas or certainly nuclear power would be. And so they actually welcome it. Solar wind power, all of these electric, all of it is in theory helped by high gas prices, even if it destroys many people in America's economic situation in the process.

We are joined now by Ena Stepman, senior policy analyst at the independent women's forum, host of the high noon podcast and Ena's I read your piece in the Wall Street Journal. It was fantastic. It was scary. I think many in our audience are not aware of where we are headed. That opinion was called Biden's title nine rewrite as an assault on women's right and women's rights and Ena's ice come from the world of sports. So I've spent a lot of time talking about the pen transgender swimmer and the assault upon women's athletics that is starting to take place in college. And things are going to get even wilder as it pertains to title nine based on your editorial. Thanks for coming on. Tell our audience where we are headed and what is likely to happen in near future in this regard. Well, thank you so much for having me on to talk about this. I mean, it is one of those incredibly important issues that's flying a little under the radar, I think just because so much else is bad in the world right now. But these changes, there are three major buckets of these changes. Each one affects either a core constitutional right or in the case of what you just referenced with regard to women's rights, a basic fact of reality, right, that men and women are different or biologically different. So this is a huge regulation that's going to impact just about every school in America from kindergarten all the way through graduate school. Ennis, how is this supposed to affect the system? And what are the changes going to be if they on effectively this will be titled so title mine will include trans rights in school. So what will that mean if for the people listening, if they have kids in school or kids in college, how will policies be influenced by this? So first of all, this change entirely erases women from American Civil Rights law by redefining the word sex to include gender identity. This is going to make nearly every school in the country except men or boys who identify as female across the board as women, meaning admitted to women's sports, admitted to women's locker rooms, admitted to dorm rooms in universities, sororities, you name it, anything, any program in a school that recognizes that women are women and men are men or girls and boys are different, that program would be in violation of American Civil Rights law, right? So that's one huge sweeping change. A second huge sweeping change is basically everything I think that happened to Kavanaugh. I think that's the thing that people are most sort of aware of. This system where mere accusation ends up destroying someone's life and there's no real due process that could actually uncover the truth of any of this. So that's the second bucket of changes. They're removing a lot of the due process protections that have actually been upheld by the Supreme Court. And the third huge bucket of this is it impinges into free speech and the best example actually of this was a case out in Wisconsin which is already anticipating these changes to Title 9 in which a school is punishing an eighth grader via Title 9 investigation, the US Civil Rights law investigation for refusing to use they, them pronouns for his classmates. I mean, that's the kind of level of changes that that Biden administration bureaucrats are pushing through likely in a couple weeks. You know, I want to build on one of these because I think it's a tangible reality that many people could suddenly find themselves confronting. Basically, this would mean that if a guy, biological male has male genitalia, if he decided he wanted to start using women's locker rooms at, let's say, the gym on campus, this would be permitted and and required in some way that you would have to treat that decision legitimately based on the way that this transgender policy is being applied to the new school dynamics. Am I understanding that correctly in terms of a tangible reality which we've already seen with the pen transgender swimmer where that male individual got to use the women's locker room? I mean, this is crazy, I think, to a lot of people out there listening to us right now. That's 100% correct. The school will be required under pain of losing their funding from the federal government and also having investigations launched into the school. The school will be required to allow the atomists into the pool and into the locker room with biological women. And this is self-identification, right? Gender identity is not actually defined. So it's anything that someone identifies as or no requirements say to have surgery or not to have male genitalia. We're talking about exactly what you said, allowing boys and men into every single female space in almost every school in America by law. All right. So Ena's a lot of people are hearing this right now and their jaws are dropping. You're a woman. I think I can define that accurately still. A lot of people lives, daughters, girlfriends, people out there. The idea of a man just being able to walk into a women's locker room because he claims that he is identifying as a woman. This is madness, right? I mean, it's madness on an epic scale. It's also dangerous. And it's been considered up to this point a crime. You would get arrested if you tried to do this for much of modern history in the United States. Yeah, that's exactly right. And yeah, it sounds insane to most people because most people have a shred of common sense left and they realize that males and females are different. And there's a very good reason why we have separate locker rooms, for example, for boys and girls in college. This makes total sense to most people. But we are now in the grips of this very radical gender ideology. And the Biden administration is moving forward with these incredibly radical changes pushed through, by the way, by unelected bureaucrats, right? This didn't go through Congress. There was no debate among the American people as to whether or not we want to make it part of our civil rights law that men with penises should be allowed in locker rooms for women. There's been no opportunity for the American people to weigh in on that question, right? This is going to be pushed through by the deep state, by unelected bureaucrats. And in addition to severely limiting the First Amendment and your right to do process. I mean, this is a huge regulation that does massively more than most acts of Congress. And yet the American people have not been given an opportunity to actually democratically weigh in on it. We're speaking to Ena's step been senior policy analyst at the Independent Women's Forum. She's got a podcast high noon. She's a host of the high noon podcast. And as before we let you go, I also got to ask you about this one, that the this was what what Ron DeSantis said that Biden is totally off his rocker according to the Daily Mail here over claims. His administration is threatening to pull school lunch money at the federal level unless there is the adoption of certain LGBTQ plus policies. Is that real? Yeah, that would be in compliance. I think what's happening right now is all of the agencies across the Biden administration are and some of them are just coming out before other ones. But I think they're in the process of essentially redefining sex so that it erases the concept of women and men from the federal law. And that means all federal programs that recognize those kinds of differences. All of those programs potentially will see massive changes. And yes, the school lunch program is one of them. They they are threatening to yank hot lunches for kids. If the school doesn't comply with this radical transgender redefinition of sex, that's that's what's going on across the country. And you can expect more of it. Ena step been. Ena's. Thanks so much for being with us. Appreciate it. Thank you so much. We may well see very turbulent times ahead in the financial markets.

Clay, I got two Disney stories for you. Okay. And you just went to Disney. So you're like, you know, I went, I was down in Orlando Magic Kingdom one day, Universal Studios two days, Sea World fourth day. So I took all my kids. We had a trip scheduled. This was back in early May or whatever it was. So yeah, I'm aware of the, of the larger Disney ecosystem. So you went full Florida man for a few days with the kids. That's right. Great. Now there's two stories that I think is what one is really sort of short. I don't even have, I just want your reaction to it. Did you see the video where a guy at Disney World is proposing? Yes. And, and the Disney employee runs over during the proposal to shoe them away from that ring grabs the ring out of the guy's hand and tells them they have to come down. I guess I don't know where exactly they were doing it. I think the Disney apologized. But can you imagine the guy was on bended knee with the box in his hand to open the ring and show his would be wife soon to be fiance this proposal and the Disney employee swept right in and took the box and the ring out of his hand. It is an on if you haven't seen this video, it is. Can you imagine? I mean, it makes you wonder, I'm like, did this guy date her at some point? Like was he objecting to the proposal? Because who my dad always says timing is everything. And in this case, you know, let them let them get through the proposal and then tell them to move. It's not like you were standing next to a nuclear reactor. Have you ever been in a wedding, by the way? You know, tell us obviously which one where when they said if anybody has any reason, you know, why this couple shouldn't like that you've thought to yourself, there are a lot of reasons why this couple shouldn't be getting married. Oh, has anyone ever said anything you mean during that? Never seen anybody ever say anything in a wedding. I mean, in your head, have you ever been sitting in the crowd and been like, there's like seven or eight things I would say if I would be honest, I've been in a couple of weddings where I thought this not gonna last. Yeah, I thought that at two weddings, one of them, I was right. Yeah. Yeah. So by the way, by the way, I kept my peace. I'm almost not my place. Yes. But the other, the other, I saw that clip. The other days, yeah, if you haven't seen that, that's if we put that one up, maybe on clay and buckle, we'll see. Just so you could, it's worth seeing guys. It's great. Although my favorite clip I've seen in the last couple of days, and this is probably an old one, but it's making the rounds again, is it's like someone, I don't even know where this is. Someone has a, it looks like a beijon or a chitsu and it chases a black bear off their property. If you see in this one, Chase is black. And then the black bear is like, you know what? Don't want none. Don't start none comes back and chases the dog back into the house. By the way, did you see the guy get attacked by the orangutan? Yes. People forget primates are incredibly strong and wildly strong, wildly strong. If you haven't seen that video, a guy evidently jumped over a fence to get closer to the orangutan video, uh, ringutan cage to take a video. And by the way, that orangutan was fast, right? Like that hand came out and he grabbed him in a hurry and then he couldn't get away because the orangutan is super strong. We usually think of orangutan because they move kind of slow and you think they're pretty chilled. They are kind of a chill in the primate world, but they're large primates and they're super strong and he was not letting that guy go. You can tell you don't mess with the orangutan buddy. That's not a good move. I'll move by that guy. But the so back to the other Disney World story, I thought this was kind of funny because this created a lot of hubbub yesterday on the on the internet. Um, there is a couple that said public and you know, this is one of these things. I think they just posted on their Facebook page or something and you know, and then it went viral. So they, I think it went up on on Reddit, which got it all going. These two huge Disney fans, uh, about a month ago, uh, had a wedding and instead of having food for the guests at the wedding, they hired a Mickey and mini, I guess impersonator or stand in or whatever because they love Disney World so much that apparently the guests have like revolted over this. Like this is crazy. You can't take people to a wedding and not feed them. We don't care about Mickey and Minnie Mouse. I'm just saying I have been to, I've, how many weddings have you, I've been to, uh, so many, I've been to between 25 and 35 weddings, I would say. I've been to a lot of weddings over the years. That's probably, that's probably, it's a great question. I've probably been to that many weddings. So I've been to a ton of weddings. How many weddings have you stood up in? Stood up. What does that mean? Like as a groomsman, like been up in the front, like I've probably done, I've only been in it in a meaningful way in a, in a handful of weddings actually. Cause I only got one brother who's married. So I've probably been in seven or eight weddings actually as a groomsman at this, maybe more, I, a bunch, right? Cause everybody got married. We just asked you question. We'll put you in the spot here. Are you always in charge of the bachelor party, buddy? I have been in charge of a few bachelor parties. Well, my guys are older now and I'm actually disappointed because everybody's gotten married already. Now we actually have money to spend on bachelor parties. Like when you eventually get married one day, all the guys that your friends with are going to have way more money to spend on their bachelor party than like I got married when I was 25 right after I took the bar exam, we went out to Vegas and we had four guys in every room, right? Like everybody was piled in. Nobody had money at that point in time. Now everybody's got money they can spend. I mean, it, it, it becomes a different kind of experience. Yes. Now the bachelor party has a string quartet, some, some Shakespeare being recited in the background. Higher level, higher level talent, higher level talent is available now. Um, but, but back to this wedding. So the, the basic theory here is if you have a wedding and you invite people, now you can have just a civil ceremony, whatever you want, but if you invite everybody to a wedding, you gotta feed them. And we spent clay, this was the crazy part. I think it was 2750, meaning $2,750 a Disney impersonator. So they spent over five grand for the Disney Mickey and Minnie impersonators and no food and their guests were very upset. I think that's fair. I think that's legit. I would be more upset about not having a bar than I would the food personally, but over $5,000 on Mickey and Minnie Disney adults and their problems. Explain this to me. What is this? They're probably some listening to us right now. I, I, I don't know how you would choose to spend your vacation at Disney World without kids being involved, right? Personally, that's great with kids. And maybe if you're a grandparent and you've been through your kids and you're reliving the memories, things like that. But if you're like 24, 25 years old and you're thinking to yourself, Hey, what should we do for vacation? Let's go to Disney World in the summer. That sounds absurd to me. One thing I will say from all the weddings I've been to, if you ever stand up, this is a little bit of free advice from courtesy of Clay and Buck. You ever stand up at a wedding to give a toast? No one ever said that wasn't long enough. Just put it out there. Keep it short, folks. Keep it tight. Also be careful with the stories you tell. You don't want to end up causing a divorce before the actual wedding is even finished."
