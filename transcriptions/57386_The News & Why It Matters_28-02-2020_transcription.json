    "text": " Today on the news and why it matters the 2020 race heading in to South Carolina this weekend. Also the coronavirus could there be a vaccine on the horizon? We will get all into it on this Friday and it starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. Happy Friday. Once again, I am Sarah Gonzalez. Today joined by Pat Gray of Pat Gray Unleashed, the one and only in the flesh here on Friday because we tape earlier and we don't want to ask him to wait and be here 12 hours just to do the show. Oh, I'd be happy to do that. I'll be happy to do that. Okay, great. So we'll. John Carlos Sopo back in the house, the Blaze.com's own John Carlos Sopo and on her maiden voyage on the show. We have Amy Robbins, the beautiful Amy Robbins, CEO of Alexa Athletica and also podcast host of Not Your Average Gun Girls. Thank you. She is. Yeah, thanks for being here. She is like the the gun girl. She had a couple of guns in my time. A couple. Yeah. And she has this really amazing, you know, they she has leggings, Alexa Athletica. Yep, where you can, you know, just store your gun. You need to say it. It's casual. I mean, good on it. Shoot a gun first before you can tell if you want to. Yes. Want to for yourself. I mean, I don't have a gun, but I would love to try on some leggings. We call them special pockets. So I guess it does bring a new meaning to is that a gun in your pocket. I mean, in our Alexa. Was it really? That's also John Carlos wanting to try on leggings is a much different broadcast, not this particular show getting into the news. So we're heading into the South Carolina primary. There is a new Fox News poll out that has Bernie Sanders knocking Biden, Joe Biden out of first place. Now this is a national poll 2020 national poll. So this is not a South Carolina poll, but it does have Bernie knocking Biden out of first place. Let's see. He gets in this poll 31% support among primary voters. And this is the first 2020 Fox national poll that has Bernie Sanders actually leading and not Biden. Now, if you look at South Carolina, Biden is actually he looks like he's gaining some ground there. I don't think it's a coincidence that this comes after Bernie's controversial comments on communist Cuba. Pat, what do you think? Yeah, I'm glad to see Biden up by 20 points again. I'm a little nervous about the the Bernie momentum because Bernie MENTUM has been sweeping the country until until this most recent debate. So it's kind of heartening. I mean, the the chance now that the economy economy could tank and Bernie Sanders is the Democrat nominee and wins the presidency because of a bad economy is really starting to become pretty scary to me. So I'd rather have Biden at the top of that ticket. I still think they'll lose to Trump, whoever it is. But with, you know, with everything that's going on right now with the coronavirus, people just in a total panic. Yeah, yeah, like, I love seeing black people pull through for America and South Carolina because that's what's happening. That's why that's why Biden's leading by 20 points now. We don't know if it's going to be that close at the end. But he's always been he's always carried a lot of favor with the black community, especially in black community, the the black community tends to they can identify a little bit more liberal in their ideology. But they actually and when they got to vote, they tend to vote more conservative. So like among Democrats, that is. So it's exciting to see what's happening. I still think that Bernie Sanders is very likely to head into the convention with at least the plurality of the vote, because we just saw a bunch of new polls come out of super Tuesday states and he's leading in most of them, including an Elizabeth Warren's own Massachusetts in the Commonwealth of Massimo. Yeah, it's close to the most. Yeah, super Tuesday states. Yeah, but I don't see how the Democrats can deprive them of the nomination if he wins the vast majority of states. I just don't know. I mean, I never thought I would have these words. I feel bad for Bernie Sanders come out of my mouth. But honestly, if I was a Bernie Sanders supporter, if he doesn't get the nomination when he keeps winning, I would be up in arms. You know, I'd be so mad I wouldn't even go on vote that day. I think is what she should just stay home because the system has been so against you from the beginning, you know, letting Mike Bloomberg in at this point, not having to fight his way through. I think it's very interesting what's happening to Bernie Sanders. But I also think for a party that loves to play identity politics so much when they're so heavily reliant on the black vote. And that is really what Joe Biden is going to be running on. I just want to encourage them all to look for the candidate who really is going to do something for your community. That's Donald Trump. When we talk about the lowest record unemployment numbers for African Americans, under Donald Trump, what other record are any of these other candidates going to be running on it? If that's simply the only thing that you're going to be looking at. So I think it's going to be really interesting to see who comes out. I mean, gosh, the Democratic Party is really fighting tooth and nail to keep Bernie Sanders out of this lead spot. But I don't know. Who knows? I don't know what's going to happen. It would be very hard to fight at this point. I think they tipped their hand a little early in 2016 to show what they were doing. Now it's going to be hard to recreate that in 2020. Jean Carlo, you mentioned the black community rallying around Joe Biden. A influential black radio show host, Charlemagne, actually had some harsh words for Joe Biden's candidacy ahead of South Carolina. Here is what I think he calls himself Charlemagne. Oh, God. And that's of course, T H A because he's hip, unlike me. Little G. Yeah, it is a little bit. But here's what Charlemagne had to say about Joe Biden. I just don't understand the hype behind Joe Biden. You know, the quote Tupac, when I see Joe Biden, I'm like, you really ain't without your homeboy. Because without Barack Obama, I don't see what all the hype is behind Joe Biden. Like they talk about him being the most electable candidate, and he's the only person that can beat Trump. How? He hasn't even proven he can beat Bernie Sanders in a primary yet. So it makes them think he could beat Donald Trump. I'm just, I know a lot of older voters in South Carolina are going to probably vote for Joe Biden, but I would hope that a lot of the younger voters in South Carolina, a lot of those new registered voters decide to turn out on Saturday as well. And maybe shake things up a little bit. Now he is, of course, a South Carolina native. So how much influence that will have on the primary, of course, remains to be seen. I don't know how much the black community is going to listen to Charlemagne's words and say, yeah, we're going to listen to what he has to say. However, Joe Biden is currently in South Carolina. He was just at a rally the other night, and he's saying weird things like this. Again, but saying no man has a right to lay a hand on a woman for any other reason is self defense. And I'm going to make you contrast with state was always made. If someone in this room got up, took off all our clothes and walked out the door, no man has a right to touch her. Zero. She can be arrested for indiation exposure. So, as you talking about, well, apparently it's controversial. What is that? It's for club or something? I'm really talking about. Now, for context, I think he was talking about domestic violence and he was trying to, you know, brag about the Violence Against Women Act and the stuff that he says that he's done. However, I'm not sure how much it resonates to tell people, well, I have come out and controversially said that no one should be allowed to touch women against their will. Amy, did you know that that was controversial in 2020? I didn't. I mean, and for all the women that wear a Lexo, we already know that. If you touch them against their will, they're probably packing something and going to take care of themselves. I mean, nobody, I don't think at this point, anyone is worse for Joe Biden's campaign than Joe Biden himself. And the fact that they can continue to push this guy is who they want as their forerunner is just like mind blowing to me. I say, keep it going though. Like, please, please keep pushing this guy. Let's let him just continue to talk. I would be happy for him to to go up against Donald Trump at this point. I mean, it isn't as sad, Jean Carlo, that this is the one guy that they're like, all right, I guess if we just get behind, rally behind him, maybe we have a shot at beating Donald Trump. I mean, that if that doesn't show the sad state of affairs, that is the Democrat, you know, a bunch. I don't know what does. Well, I just want to also point out I'm from Miami. So, scandally dressed women on a Tuesday morning is just normal. So, is it controversial that he's saying that you actually cannot touch them? We know we can't touch them. It's normal. Yeah, there's nothing controversial there. Yeah, I mean, I just think he's sort of like a default candidate because on one hand, the Democrats have somebody who lies about her ethnicity. On the other hand, they have a communist and Bernie and you know, like Joe Biden is sort of like just this milk toast dead guy who says creepy things. So, also things that don't really make sense. Yeah, he sees my name is Joe Biden and I'm running for US Senate. Yeah, he's like, he's incoherent. It also seems to like Pete Buttigieg might be dropping out after Super Tuesday. He's been canceling some campaign events. So, we're not really sure what future of any his candidacy has from now on. So, a lot of people might be looking at, you know, especially since, well, it was with Warren Nookd, Mike Bloomberg at two debates ago, they might be seeing Joe Biden as like a week in at Bernie's just to get them just to get them across the finish line. Yeah, what do you think, Scott? Has anybody else, Charlotte, me and the God, what his thoughts are on a woman getting naked and walking out of the room are, I want to know what he thinks about him as commandment says. I know he was like the leading voice for everybody in South Carolina. I know, apparently. And we haven't heard from a Charlemagne in about 1800 years. That's great. Well, we'll see how this particular story factors into the 2020 election, but apparently more bad news. Awkward news, I would say for Joe Biden. The judge that has been ruling over the Arkansas paternity case for Joe Biden, I'm sorry, for Hunter Biden, has ordered Hunter Biden to appear in court for sworn testimony. She said he needs to make himself available. And unless his hair is on fire, he needs to be in Arkansas and he needs to be in a deposition. He has fought this and fought this, you know, he pushed off. He almost was held in contempt of court because he kept pushing off returning paperwork. He also said that he was unev-, I'm sorry, I'm unavailable until after April. The judge is not- Of course, after the primary stage. After April, the coincidence and the timing, who knows what's going on. It's probably because of Lent. That's not too bad. I'm sure he does seem like a very wholesome religious man. I love that the judge came back though and says, well, this is very interesting that he's not available. Seeing as if all the documents you've presented are saying that he's unemployed, so why what could he possibly be doing with all of this time? Right, right. Well, he probably gave up testifying for Lent. Oh, he made a big sacrifice. That was his Lent and sacrifice, exactly. You think that's what it is? Pat, is this- Do you see this blowing up before Joe Biden implodes himself? I don't think so because I don't know the Democrats care, you know, sex scandals are nothing to Democrats. I'm not sure murder scandals are anything to Democrats. They just don't- They don't care what you do in your personal life, even Blackface. Unless you're a Republican. Unless you're a Republican. Yeah. Yes, if this was a Republican, they would definitely care, but- But when it's Joe Biden and his family, they don't care. Now, Amy, our network has done a lot of work on, you know, especially Glenn himself, on trying to expose the ties between Hunter Biden and Ukraine. You know, it's all a very convoluted story, so it's hard to really dissect, pull apart, and show people. There are a lot of people who say, yeah, I really think that this Hunter Biden stuff is really damaging Joe Biden in the primaries, but I feel like it's more just every time Joe Biden opens his mouth, is really what people are looking at. And I agree with Pat, they don't really care about the Hunter Biden. Like I said, no one is more detrimental to Joe Biden's campaign than Joe Biden at this point. I don't see it being a big point of contention. I mean, who cares? At this point, I think people are tired of talking about it and tired of hearing about it. So no, if Joe keeps talking like that and saying those things, I don't think Hunter Biden is going to be pulling down his campaign anymore. I also think that people like to give a little bit of grace when it comes to, I mean, if it's your son and your son's kind of screwed up, but it doesn't reflect on you. Yeah, yeah, right. It's not you. I mean, I think we've been we've given him a pass all along. Democrat family members get a pass. Republican family members do not get a pass at all. It's very hypocritical. I mean, you see what's their appealing starter? And Trump's entire family, like they're the entire impeachment process. Nothing was off limits at that point. But when it comes to anybody that's in the Democrat family, you can't touch the kids. That's off limits. You can't talk about that. So I mean, it's double standard on their part. That's why I just don't think this is really going to do a whole lot for his campaign to hurt his campaign. Yeah. All right. Up next, a coronavirus vaccine on the horizon. We'll talk about the possibility when we return. These can snorty coke off, hopefully, lookers for the. Israeli scientists are reportedly only a few weeks away from having developed the first vaccine to combat the coronavirus. They say that they could have the vaccine available 90 days after that, which would be huge. I guess if you want to be a guinea pig also, because I'm not sure. God bless Israel. Right. How I feel about using a brand new right off the shelf vaccine for coronavirus. Apparently, they were looking into this virus already. They were already looking. They said that they decided to choose coronavirus as a model for their system just as proof of concept for the new technology that they're working on. And it just so happened that they were working on the poultry coronavirus, which has a high genetic similarity to the human one. And that this particular virus uses the same infection mechanism, which increases the likelihood of achieving an effective human vaccine in a very short period of time. They say once they adjust the system to the new sequence. Now, Pat, this comes at a time where what there's like 8,000 people in California who are being monitored for coronavirus right now. There are hundreds in Massachusetts that are being monitored as well. And apparently everyone is panicked and we're all going to die. Yeah, to the point where they're not drinking corona beer because the same name is coronavirus. That's my plan for staying clear of the coronavirus. I'm not even washing my hands. I am just not drinking. Just don't drink their beer. I regularly don't wash my hands anyway. However, I am not drinking. I'm avoiding corona beer. I'm always avoiding corona beer though. Like it's not good. I don't want to drink corona beer. I'm more of a doc we've got 60 cases in the United States. Yes, it's up to you. People are being monitored. We're at 60 with no deaths. So there's a zero mortality rate right now. Will it get worse? Yeah, probably. But just prepare yourself and don't panic. There's no reason to run to the stock market and take all your money out of the stock. Definitely. Yeah. Actually, there's now is a great time to invest because the right stocks. If you're going to invest and invest in masks and the hysteria is in Lysol and sanitation gloves, your standard personal protection equipment, that'd be a great thing to invest in for right now. But the hysteria, I mean, we're seeing it just being in the manufacturing industry myself, even though we manufacture clothes, we do manufacture overseas. And so we're seeing that the hysteria, yes, is really affecting the stock market. It's also driving prices up to ridiculous levels on these masks all because of hysteria. And if we just kind of calm down, we have to look at our common flu that we deal with on how many people does it kill a year here in the US? 60,000 a year. 60,000 a year. And 45 million infected. And we're panicking about something that has a less than 2% lethality rate. I mean, we just need to calm down everybody. And there's so much misinformation, I think, too, that's being spread because people don't really understand how it works yet. So you think, if you get it, are you going to die? Like, remember when Ebola came out? Like, if you got Ebola, you were, you're just goodbye. But it's not like that with this coronavirus. It's not like if you get this virus, you are going to die. And so I think if we just understood more and got the facts out there more about what it actually is doing and how to fix your respiratory system, the simple things that we do take precautions with our colds and our flus, then it might not create such a panic in everybody. If you're not elderly, if you're fairly healthy, you don't have some underlying issue like diabetes or something else, your chances are really good at surviving it. Right. I mean, 98, 99%, including. Yes. I also think it's worth noting that the 2% rate, fatality rate is in China. And it's that high in a specific region of China. Outside of there, it's much lower. Yes. Right. So I think that's worth noting. Also, if you're under 60, it's like, it's very low. Yeah. Well, that's interesting too, because when we get these death rates, we're not told how old these people are. That's dying. Like there's so much information that we're not getting from them. We don't know. Yeah. Underlying diseases. Are they immunocompromised? Is there something that's making this progress quicker to a situation where they die? I mean, we don't know. And so, and I think they intentionally leave out a lot of those facts to just continue to stir up and create all this hysteria. I think you're really onto something here, because I think that the media in conjunction with the Democrats, it's almost, I feel like they're basically like, let's crash the stock market in the economy to own Trump. I mean, if you really break it down, I don't think any of us, we see through what's happening here. I mean, look, we know Trump is running on a strong economy. If they can do anything to create hysteria that will drive the stock markets down, this is going to blow. I think this is going to blow over. I really do. And we'll bounce back. But if they can do anything they can to hit his record on a strong economy, which is what he's been running on for so long, because it has been strong, they're going to do that. And they're going to try to ride this wave all the way to the election. Unfortunately, it's like they started a little bit too soon, because I think we'll be able to bounce back by November and he'll be able to run again on his record on his strong economy. Similar to the impeachment scandal, it's like, what you guys are doing this year away. Where are you? This is stupid. I do want to clarify. I was only kidding about not washing my hands. Everyone should wash your hands. What is with you this week? Just saying. I'm not washing your hands. I think you got a text from his wife after he said that that was like, you better tell everyone. Actually, wash your hands, sir. Elizabeth Warren, before we move on, Elizabeth Warren, actually, I guess, you know, when your desperate desperate times call for desperate measures, she wanted to make sure that everyone knew that she's doing her part to combat Trump's horrible, awful response to the coronavirus. She said she tweeted out coronavirus poses a serious health diplomatic and economic threat, and we must be prepared to confront it head on. So I'm introducing a bill to transfer all funding for Donald Trump's racist border wall to the USA to combat coronavirus. Thank God. Man, well, forget the fact that a wall would actually help not keep, I mean, that's not disease. Yeah. And we could monitor people coming across. A wall doesn't mean we don't want people to come over here. A wall means let's monitor who's coming across the border. Let's do this legally. So if people were sick with the coronavirus, we might actually be able to stop it from getting into our country before it gets here, which has been one of the problems with open borders with people coming into the country, the illegal people coming into this country, regardless of where they're from, they're coming into the country, infected with certain things, and they're spreading it into our communities. What could possibly go wrong if we do this? I was just hoping that she would unleash the medicine man from her tribe to curacile coronavirus. That's what I thought she was going to come back with. I think it's just interesting. You know, Trump was very quick to stop flights over here, to basically put up borders and keep people from coming over here until we could actually contain what was happening with these people coming from China. It's no different. No matter, like you said, no matter where they're coming from, borders and protection to monitor people coming into this country, especially in terms of infectious diseases, is very important. And if we really are concerned about keeping people safe, then we're not talking about policymakers transferring money from border wall security to the CDC, which we already know they completely waste funds and they have frivolous spending within the CDC. And no, Trump actually wants to put practical things in place to keep the population safe. Quarantine processes, shutting down travel, putting these bands in place until we can figure out what's going on has actually kept this virus from becoming a much bigger deal here in America, I think. Yeah. Pat, this is going to be the boost that she needs to take the lead in this primary book, right? Yeah, this was a brilliant maneuver. Yeah, they're going to bash Trump on his response to this and they already are. But doesn't this accentuate the reason that you try to have a secure border? I mean, yes. A pandemic is a perfect example of why you want to be monitoring at all times who's coming across the border. And we right now just don't know they could have any kind of disease. And we've seen recurrences of leprosy and all manner of diseases that have been defeated a long time ago in the United States and virtually eradicated pop up again because we don't know who's coming over that border. And with what? And now in the midst of the coronavirus, you're going to start bashing the border wall. It just shows that they make no sense whatsoever. There's no logic to the Democrat Party except I hate Donald Trump. That's it. It's true. Orange Man. All they've got. All right. Back in a minute. Apparently, the man who opened fire at the Mulsen Quars plant Wednesday, who killed five co-workers and himself had been involved in a really long running dispute with a co-worker that boiled over according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. I know this was it was a horrible event. We don't want it to happen. Anytime there's a shooting, we don't want it to happen. The Amy, are we going to hear because I haven't thus far? Are we going to hear from the Democrats more about gun control? This is what's interesting about this story. If you go back and follow the tweets from the last 24 hours, I haven't seen any calls for assault rifle bans, bans on AR-15s. Really, not a lot of chatter going on about this particular shooting. And I think it's because the handguns were used in this. So the ones that make the headlines, I mean, yes, there were some news outlets that touched on it. But it's really, for all practical purposes, died down a little bit. And it's because he didn't use the big bad scary AR-15 that does not stand for assault rifle. They didn't use that. He used the handguns. And unfortunately, this particular machine didn't fit their agenda. So even though they were calling for all these anti-gun measures at the rally, and they're all trying to who can anti-gun, who at this Democratic debates right now, none of them really stepped up and said anything about this particular shooting, because they can't go out there and start calling for the ban on handguns. I like to say that I think Beto obviously kind of exposed the true underlying issue of what the Democratic Party wants to do, which is to essentially ban guns, confiscate guns, and take guns, no matter what they say. It's not about public safety, by any means. And they want to put these laws and these regulations on the books that really aren't going to stop anything. We don't know a lot about this shooter. I've been trying to find out where these legally owned firearms. No one's writing stories on it yet. I'm following this very closely over the next few days to really find out if he did own them legally. Well, then we know that more laws on the books to keep guns out of bad guys' hands wouldn't have done anything to stop this. And we also know that criminals can get guns even if the laws are in place. So follow it closely, follow the verbiage that comes from the Democrats out of all of this, because right now we need to ban assault rifles, we need to ban assault weapons. But let's see if that rhetoric starts changing too, we need to ban semiautomatic weapons, which would then in turn start affecting handguns as well. So I'm going to pay attention to them. Pat, she makes a great point. And to her point, Virginia, it's not going so well for the Democrats there who are trying to cram all of this gun legislation down all of the Virginia and throats. Yeah, I think this shooting, as well as the one in Thailand and Germany recently shows the hypocrisy of the Democrat Party and the left. They don't care about any of these, because as you said, India doesn't fit their agenda. They only care about the ones that involve the scary assault rifles that are basically black hunting guns. And so they can't talk about these kinds of things, because it doesn't line up with where they're trying to take the country. We've been told all along that the United States is the only place in the world where mass shootings happen. Well, they just happened in Thailand and Germany. Huge mass shootings, quite a few people. There was nine, I think, in Thailand and seven or eight in Germany that were murdered. And now this one isn't resonating with them either, because it involves handguns. And they're just despicable. It just shows that they don't care about human life. What they care about is their own agenda, their political agenda. Sean Carlo. Well, as the only person at this table who's probably never fired a gun. It was probably. Well, I'm saying I'm fairly sure. I'm sure you're fired. You're the only person that has never fired a gun. So you have a lot of credibility here on the line. Right. So the truth is that when I see stories like this, it actually makes me want to buy one for self-defense and go to the range with you. Right. And buy leggings. And get some leggs. So leggings. We're working on a men's line. So might not have to be the leggings. You know, just hold on there, Sean Carlo. All right. She will get to you, I promise. Which kind of, I mean, to your point, Pat, you know, they talk about well mass shootings don't happen. And even if that were the case, which you pointed out, it's not, but even if that were the case, you know, it's like, okay, well, in Canada, they're running vans into people and telling a bunch of people that way. Nice attacks are up in London. Right. Yeah. So, I mean, at least with, you know, the firearms, well, at least I can protect myself with my own if I so choose. Well, that, you know, and again, I've been looking for this because I like to find out most mass most mass shootings we know occur in gun free zones, right? I even looked up this almost all of them. I don't know if this particular one was. I would say it probably was just because it's a brewing company. They don't want to mix alcohol with firearms. That would make sense. So their policy, if it was a gun free zone. But look, had, I always say had an armed citizen who is trained and proficient and carrying their firearm. Look, exact. Look at the church. It just happened here in Texas. They were armed. They were trained. They were able to stop the guy before it got out of control, because we all know that cops cannot be there every single time. And they were not able to get there in time before five people lost their lives, including the gunman in this particular situation. So, you know, I'm a big advocate for people taking responsibility for their own safety. Why put it in the hands, like more responsibility in the hands of the government, who we already know the Democratic Party is anti-police anyways. So they want to give the power back to the police to take care of all our war. They don't trust. They don't trust. It's just, it's so messed up. And yet at the same time, we know that good guys with firearms, when they're trained and responsible, do stop shootings from happening every single year. And it could have been different in this situation had someone been armed. Yeah. Moving on to a new California bill, because you know, we always like to talk about crazy California bills. A new California bill would require retail outlets to have gender neutral space for children. Now, Jean-Carlo, you were talking, did you write this? Okay. So Jean-Carlo wrote this at theblaze.com. It is available over there right now. So you were saying it doesn't mean the whole store has to be gender neutral, but they have, they require that every store has to have a space that is labeled gender neutral and is in fact gender neutral. Yeah. So this applies to retail stores or chains with over 500 employees. And the way that it would work is that it would require each store to have a gender neutral aisle for children's items. And it's not just toys. It's also clothing or books or whatever. But they cannot be separated according to like little boys and little girls that are must be mixed in, which is patently insane. You'd figure that the people in in California would have much higher priorities, given the homeless problem and housing issues. Yeah. Yeah. But they really have their priorities straight. They're worrying about, you know, mixing GI Joe's with Barbies. And I love the Bloomberg is out there saying, well, California, he just tweeted that California is the symbol of the American dream. And that's coming from Mr. Nanny State himself, who wants to not only tell us how much soda we can drink. Now he's going to tell us how we have to shop for our kids. I mean, you can clearly tell that this is from a policy maker and not a business owner. Because a policy maker is going to ruin our experience as consumers who want efficiency. When I get in, I want to know where I'm going. I want to shop. But no, the government wants to put their hands and even more of our lives. Like, when are the people of California going to get sick and tired of this? I wonder. You got to wonder. I mean, I think, yeah, a lot of them are. They're coming here though, which, okay, you guys, that's great. But remember that when you go to the voting booth. Okay. Yeah. My best friend from high school lives in San Francisco. And I was having dinner with him last night. And he was telling me that he had to call a cops because he didn't realize it. But like, next to his house, you know, like houses are pretty close to, so like between his house and his neighbor's house, like two to three homeless people had just set up and like they were living there. They had shut up a tent and everything. And it's kind of heartbreaking because you don't, you know, you feel bad for people obviously. And they don't really have anywhere to go because they don't, they also don't want to build more shelters. But it's just a really terrible situation what they have going on there and certainly not emblematic of the American dream. But there's no bigger problem than gender neutral areas. Of course. Yes. Yeah. I think a lot of human beings are being neutered right now. And so they don't want that special place where they can go and there's no gender involved. And so man, I mean, this is for point seven percent of the population. This is for two million people. There's 330 million people in our country. And yet I don't understand this all of a sudden we've done this shift into high gear to bend over backwards for the trans population. I don't want to do anything against them. But neither do I want to turn our whole society over to them now. And all of a sudden that's what we're expected to do. It's even worse than that. It's even worse than that. Yeah. But you know what? It's even worse than that because most like some of like most trans people are binary. They're just no longer their logical sex. We're talking about so among the trans that zero point seven percent. It's only about a quarter of them who identify as non-binary. We're talking really about like zero. Five of them in the country. Yeah. Zero point two percent of the population. It doesn't make any sense. The vast majority of people are not intersex either. So it doesn't make any sense to just rearrange, start rearranging children's toy stores. No. And I look at it from a business owner's perspective. And if this, if the problem becomes big enough that consumers walk in and it's confusing, it's annoying, it's going to take time. They're going to skip going to big bucks, retail stores altogether, go straight to e-commerce. Yeah. Retail, retail space in general is already on the decline. It's going to, I mean, if the market really doesn't like it and the consumer truly doesn't like it, then don't shop there. Do your quick, easy, simple search on Amazon, your e-commerce site, get whatever gender product you would like and then move on with your day. And it could seriously affect big bucks, retail stores. They're also threatening to find the stores, right? If they don't comply, it'll do it. It comes with a thousand dollar fine now. Sure. And now it's now like retail stores, but imagine when they start telling websites you cannot have male and female sections on a website. Oh, good luck to them. God bless. All right, back coming in. Featured in Bloomberg.com of all the places is a really sad heartbreaking story that abortion clinics are getting nickel and dimed out of business. I know you guys are all very upset. Really sad. At that proposition, but it follows the owner of Whole Woman's Health in Austin. It talks about the Supreme Court decision, Whole Woman's Health versus Heller's four years ago. And now her day to day work is at least as challenging as it was before the decision where she thought that things were going to get better for her. The abortion tax has gone up with new barriers that hurt clinics bottom lines. Protests have increased in number and providers are struggling to offer a medical procedure that has been legal in the US since 1973. And they're just, they're really upset that they are, if this is affecting their ability to operate. And I mean, you gotta read it. It's just horrible. Amy, I know you read it. You're writing this for me to feel sorry for these people. And I don't. Well, come on. As a small business owner, you're gonna face challenges and risks every single day and like stop whining about it and get creative. I mean, look, as I dove into this story, this lady who was buying these clinics, this is a, we're in a free market here, people, this is capitalism. So she would go in and rent her space, rent the space next to her to prevent protests. So life clinics coming in, you know, and so then we'll then the anti-abortion people got smart and said, well, if you're going to do that, well, then we're just going to rent up all the spaces and up your rent. And you can figure out how you're going to stay in business around here. You know, that's like any small business has challenges. And I mean, I don't really feel sorry for you. Just stop whining about it. And not that I agree with her mission and what she's doing. But, you know, I'm more about capitalism. Yeah, like if this is a thing, if you're for profit, your abortion clinic is for profit and profiting off of all this, well, then you're going to have to face the same challenges that other small business owners are. And you know, I don't really feel sorry for it. Amen. Just don't, Pat, you're heartbroken. Very, yeah. A lot of sympathy for abortion mills. This whole culture of death that we're witnessing right now from the left is despicable. And the fact is we just had the image up on the monitor over there about the girl who is celebrating her abortion. Oh, gosh. Yeah, we have that. And we've seen so many of these videos lately where they, their whole thing is not, I had to have an abortion and it's really sad, but I'm just not ready right now. I can't, they're excited about it. They're celebrating it. They're having abortion cakes. They're throwing abortion parties. How does a, how does a civilization continue to exist when you have that kind of culture of death? It's really, it's really sad. That's a great point. John Carlo, I want to bring you into this, but let's go ahead and watch this is a, it's a TikTok video that's gone viral, showing a girl. I mean, it's what they do on TikTok now. Apparently they brag about getting abortions. Like it's a wonderful, beautiful thing. Let's watch it. How do you feel actually? Wow. It's tough to watch. I can't, I can't either. I'm, I'm, I know, because I do in like six weeks. So I'm like, I don't know if it's the hormones or. I'm sure no, well, no one can probably tell, especially because you're saying they don't see you from here, but Amy is pregnant. She's expecting. I am and I think that's hard. It is. That's like, that's so heartbreaking to me to, to watch that and to see that. And, you know, I, when I, when I think about this, this whole issue, you know, we've, we've switched from a culture of being able to sympathize towards a woman who really has to, if they have to make that tough decision, you know, if they have to go through that empathizing and sympathizing with people that have gone through that to now shifting to celebrating it and making videos about it. I mean, it's, it really is heartbreaking to see. Yeah. Jean Carlin. Well, I mean, we have an entire party ignoring science and saying that someone's not a fully, like a full equal human being worthy of life and legal protections until they exit the vaginal canal. Right. Yeah. So, which, you know, so it's, this is, this is the logical outcome of that. I almost want to, I mean, I, I won't, but I almost want to give the younger, the younger children a pass because they're clearly being indoctrinated by the left into this celebrating this culture. But the people who I really have more of a problem with, I think, are the people who are themselves parents. And I look at it and I'm like, how can you have gone through this journey that Amy's going through right now? How can you have gone through this journey of growing this human and knowing what goes on inside the womb and having the baby and then turn around and act like it's to be celebrated to kill it? I just, I, to me, that's far worse than a bunch of kids who are copying what, you know, the adults are teaching them. Pat? Yeah. It's, you're right. They've been indoctrinated. And they, there's just such a lack of respect for human life now. And with them, with the Democrat Party denying that it is even is human life, what are the young people supposed to, what are they supposed to infer from that? That it's not a problem. It's not a problem that should be mourned or, or that life that's growing inside them should be respected. Yeah, it's really sad back in a minute. Yesterday's poll question, are you worried about the coronavirus in the United States? 69% of you said no. That's good to hear. Okay. So, with some of you who are not quite panicking yet, but about 31% of you are panicking. You said yes. But we did make the discrepancy yesterday. I said, okay, worried is kind of a dip. Like, should you panic? No. So maybe these people are like, I mean, I'm cautious. So I'll say I'm worried, but like, I don't want to get the flu, right? I don't want to get sick. Everything I could, you know, right now to not get sick. So, no, I don't want the coronavirus. Right. Like if you call that worried, yeah, about the same amount worried as I am exactly. And I think because we just don't know a lot about it, it does. There is a little bit of that, you know, voice in my head that's like, well, sure, I don't want to get this because I don't really know what to expect, you know, I don't know what kind of symptoms I'm going to be on. Yeah, just fear of the unknown. And I'm a little bit more cautious traveling. Yeah. But I mean, no, I'm not panicking about it yet. It's prudent to be concerned. Exactly. Yeah. Like be aware. Yeah. Right. Be cautious. Today's poll, which 2020 Democrat is the fakest? Is that a word fakest is the most fake? Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, or Amy Klobuchar. What do you think, Pat Warren, Buttigieg, Biden, or Klobuchar? Wow, that's that's hard. I think I would have to say Warren. Yeah, I probably go with Warren fake. Fake. Indian, fake Native American. Yeah, it's an operator. Yeah, you think you got Warren too? Okay, Warren. You got to go Warren. You got to go Warren. Every time she opens her mouth, it's fake. It's another lie.
