    "text": " You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears. And boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged. New zealied. Strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, what is going on today? My name is Ryan Mikler and I am the host and founder of Order of Man. I am glad that you're tuning in today and I want to welcome you to what I would consider to be the best podcast available for men. But of course, I know that I am of the biased. Now, before I get into the discussion today, the Friday Field Notes today, which is actually a follow-up to Part 1 on Masculine Sovereignty, which I started last week, I do want to give you a couple of quick resources that you can tap into if you want to take the concepts that we talk about here on the podcast to the next level. So first, you can get the transcript for this show at OrderOfMan.com slash F-F-N. As in Friday Field Notes. So F-F-N-0-4-1. Second, make sure you join our closed Facebook group. We've got just about 19,000 men in there and we are having, as a lot of you guys know, some incredible conversations about what it means to be a man. We talk about leadership, dating, relationships, making money, raising sons and daughters, asking for job promotions, just about anything else that you may be interested in as a man. And third, we've got an exciting live event coming up on April 27th through the 30th of this year, 2017. I'm not going to get too much into that discussion for now for the sake of time, but we will be having 25 men from all over the country flying into Las Vegas, then we'll be driving to a cabin in the mountains of southern Utah. And my design, our goal is to give you the tools, the strategy, the skills, and the practical information you need to be a better man. So if you're interested in that event, jump on it quickly, guys, because we are already selling out, you can learn more, you can check out some of the footage from last year's event and also claim your spot at order of man.com slash uprising. Now, with all that said and done and out of the way, let's have this discussion, the follow-up discussion about masculine sovereignty. I'm not going to give you a lot of backstory here because, again, this is part two to the conversation that we started having last week. So if you haven't heard last week's Friday Field Notes, go back, listen to that, so you can get some context for the rest of the conversation that we're going to have today. Now, last week I covered six principles of individual sovereignty, which I try to live by, and I try to implement in my life, and those six are no one owes you a thing. Everything in life is a choice. Focus only on what you can control, operate in reality, accept responsibility, and be accountable to yourself. So, again, if you want more details, you want to dive further into those six, head to order of man.com slash F.F.N. is in Friday Field Notes. F.F.N. 040. Now, let's get to the next six principles today. The first one, do not get offended. Learn. Look, we live in a world where everyone seems to be offended about everything, and if anyone happens to disagree with another person, they automatically treat it as an insult or a personal attack, and they go on that defensive, and they go on that offensive immediately. If you find yourself taking offense to everything, I would suggest that you have some confidence issues that you need to work on. If you can't let the fact go that someone else may see things a little bit differently than you, you've got some serious issues to work out, and the other element of this is your pride, and it's your ego. Our pride, our ego, our desire to be right all the time is hindering our ability to learn new things, and every time somebody disagrees with us, it is an opportunity to gain new insights, to gain new perspectives into how we might actually improve our lives. So if you really want to grow, you won't take offense to everything. You'll learn from that opposing view. Second, if you mess up, make it right. All of us mess up. It's human nature. It is in our nature to get things wrong. Most people, they actually make those mistakes worse by denying it, or even worse than that, compounding the problem by not fessing up to it and making that situation right. If you yell at your kids, for example, unnecessarily, apologize for it quickly. If you drop the ball on a project, fess up, get back on top of it. If you've wronged somebody, make amends. It doesn't make you weak to apologize. It makes you weak, not to. So if you catch yourself having to apologize over and over and over again, maybe, just maybe, you'll start considering doing it right in the first place. And if you're not willing to apologize and rectify the situation when you get it wrong, you guys are never going to change your behavior. Don't be stubborn if you mess up, make it right. Now, the third principle I want to share with you is stop seeking other people's approval. I used to do this all the time. I used to change my thoughts and my ideas and my beliefs and my actions to appease other people. I was a people pleaser. And the more I did it, the more I realized that not only is it impossible, it's actually a recipe for disaster and satisfaction and fulfillment in your life. Regardless of what you do, you could be reading from the Bible and somebody is going to be upset. Not everyone is going to be happy. And the more you change who you are, the more unsatisfied and frustrated you are going to be in your life because there will be a huge gaping void or disconnect between what you believe and what you do. So stop trying to please everybody. Stop trying to get their approval or their permission. You have ideas. You have inspirations. You have thoughts. Act on those things without the need or even desire to see or find out what other people think. Now, this isn't permission to be reckless, but it is permission for you to do what you want to do and have faith knowing that you already know the best way moving forward for yourself. Next component, understand your emotions as men. We are led to believe all the time that we should suppress our emotions. That even the quote on quote negative emotions we experience are bad and they should be avoided. Then we hear about the concept of stoicism and we think that we should hide those emotions even further. But that's not what stoicism is about. Stoicism is about understanding your emotions so they can serve you more effectively and also those that you care about. It's okay to be mad. It's okay to be angry. It's okay to be jealous. It's okay to be sad. Emotions, even the negative ones are indicators. Indicators that something is working or something is not. So when you feel these emotions bubbling up, stop, breathe and try to take a minute to understand what those emotions are telling you so you can make the best decision moving forward and then you can act accordingly. It's okay to be angry, guys. Sometimes that's appropriate, but how you respond to that anger may not be. So really strive to understand what your emotions are telling you. Next, execute relentlessly. So many people get caught up in paralysis by analysis. They strategize, they plan, they overthink so much and then they never do what it is they were thinking about doing. They never take that action. I did a great, but they're cheap. Show me a man who's willing to execute even an under articulated plan, then go back to the drawing board, then execute again and I will show you a man who is going to succeed in life. Eventually, you're going to mess up. You're not going to get it right. You're going to trip and fall. People who aren't willing to execute will probably mock you when you do. As we watch the Super Bowl for example this weekend, we are going to hear from all the critics and all the armchair quarterbacks who never once dared to actually step onto the field. It actually reminds me of the man in the arena by Teddy Roosevelt. I'm going to read this to you because it is so powerful if you wrap your head around this concept. It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again and again because there is no effort without air and short coming. But who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends themselves in a worthy cause, who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at worst if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. Are you daring enough to get into the arena? That gentleman is what makes us men. And the last thing I want to share with you today is that you need to learn from your mistakes. I'm not going to dive too deep into this one because we already talked about it a little already. You're going to mess up, right? It's part of the deal. But what's not part of the deal is to keep making the same mistakes over and over and over again. If something isn't working and you keep falling prey to that thing, you have not adequately learned your lesson yet. You don't need to continue to struggle. You don't need to keep doing the same things over and over again. Sometimes you need to try something new. You need to reflect upon an exercise or your day to see what actually went wrong. Then go back to that drawing board and make it work better next time. Gentlemen, that is what I had to share with you today. Remember those six principles. Do not get offended. Learn. If you mess up, make it right. Do not seek other people's approval. Understand your emotions. Execute relentlessly. And learn from your mistakes. Those are seven through twelve of the twelve that I've actually now shared with you. The first six again can be found at orderamann.com slash F.F.N. is in Friday field notes. F.F.N. 040. If you have not already listened to that, remember to guys to check out our live event, The Uprising, which can be found at orderamann.com slash uprising. So you can claim your spots. I hope to see you there. Until next week, remember the principles of masculine sovereignty. Implement them in your life and become the man you were meant to be. Thank you for listening to the Order of Man podcast. You're ready to take charge of your life and be more of the man you were meant to be. We invite you to join the Order at orderamann.com."
