Join the millions of listeners on the iHeartRadio app. Free never sounded so good. Hi iHeartRadio. Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Ooh, welcome back in. Now number two, Tuesday edition Clay Travis Buck Sexton Show. Appreciate all of you. Go download the podcast. Go get the iHeart app and you can listen to this show anywhere on the iHeart app. You can certainly download the podcast on any of those platforms as well.

We've got all these different places where you can also find us on pretty much any social media platform from YouTube to Rumble to Instagram to Twitter and beyond. You can become a VIP at clayandbuck.com and you can see us on video. I don't know that there's a lot of gain to that but hi, I'm waving at you right now. I hope that you are blown away by this hit. Alright, so Buck, we have got... I'm going to pat us on the back here a little bit. We've got a situation where we were several weeks ahead of where the news cycle has been. We told all of you that Trump was going to be charged in federal court and I went on the air. We've talked with all the candidates. You heard Buck just ask Nikki Haley, hey, are you going to part in Donald Trump in the event that you were elected in January of 2025? And Buck, I did a deep dive on the South Florida jurisdiction and I'm sure we're going to be talking about the legalities on this a great deal. I would be very surprised if this federal court case can happen and be resolved before the presidential election in 2024. By which I mean, I think it's highly unlikely that Trump would be in prison or that anything like that would be going on during the election itself. You'll see how expedited this can be. We'll maybe get some indication of that with the hearing that we will have today. But based on everything that I looked at, I wanted to look at several things. One, where is this jury pool going to come from? And they haven't even officially decided whether it would be Palm Beach or whether it would be Miami-Dade County. But in both of those places, we're talking about roughly a 50-50 Democrat Republican makeup. We've lost Miami-Dade County by seven points in 2020. But Miami-Dade County, and you're a perfect example of this buck, has become more Republican in the two years since the 2020 election as COVID brought so many refugees from other parts of the country. Many of them read voters. Okay. Vivek Ramaswami, who is running for president, has jumped on what I would say the Clay and Buck pardon train. And he became, and we gave him credit for this. The first candidate to do what we thought made sense, which was pledged that you would pardon Trump in the event that you want an election. I believe we have the audio of the Vivek Ramaswami going to Miami and saying that he would do exactly that, holding up a piece of paper and saying that he was going to sign it. Let's play that cut for you now. And then we'll react to that as well. I want to point this out. We're willing to have every presidential candidate on the show. Chris Christie's team has not responded to us. Maybe they don't want to come on the biggest radio show in the country to talk to the more just possible audience of voters. I don't know, but I'll just put them out there. Imagine some of the Chris Christie people are listening. We extend the olive branch. You don't want to come on. That's your call. I mean, especially you hear the interviews that the questions that were there, no fair minded person would think we asked an unfair question of Nikki Haley. I'm telling you in advance that what we asked Mike Pence tomorrow will be completely fair. It's not attacks, disguises, questions. It's not gotcha. It's not, you know, why are you an awful person? Discuss, right? We're giving everybody a fair shot to come on and talk about what they want to talk about. And so if Chris Christie is Mr. Brawler, Mr. ready to throw down. I mean, can we, you guys should hear this is what he's out there saying. Should we let everybody play that before? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, I think this is more. We know what Vivek is saying. I mean, Vivek is running for the Trump cabinet. I mean, it's a nice guy and a lot, you know, that's fine, but Vivek is not going to be president. Chris Christie is running to prevent Trump from being president. That seems to this kind of opposite ends. Yeah, let's play Chris Christie, who was on CNN last night, right? The town town hall, I think was it last night or the night before? And he absolutely savaged Trump. Here's what he says. You can listen to it play it. I've known him for 22 years. The only thing he understands is force. The only thing he understands is coming right at him and making your case. And if these other candidates don't want to do it, the American people and Republican primary voters have to start to understand this. When did we get to the point where always blame our adversaries for the weakness of our candidates? Oh, it's the Democrats fault. It's the DOJ's fault. It's this person's fault. It's the media's fault. How bad it's his? He hasn't won a damn thing since 2016. Every time loser, 2018, we lost the house, 2020, we lost the White House, we lost the United States Senate a couple of weeks later in 2021. And in 2022, we lost two more governorships, another Senate seat and barely took the House of Representatives when Joe Biden had the most incompetent first two years I've ever seen in my life. Loser, loser, loser. Now we're getting going. It'll be different this time. Why? Why will it be different this time? These arguments need to be made and I'm not afraid to make them for two reasons. One, I'm not afraid of him. And two, it's the truth. I just why if he's going to take, I mean, he's he's throwing haymakers. Let's be honest. He is he is calling Trump out. He is saying Trump is a he's saying Trump is a loser and a liar. That's what he said. He's running as a Republican and that is what his claim is there. Well, he's got to come on shows like this one and explain to Republican voters with people who are going to ask him real questions about why he's making these allegations or how he's going to back up the claims that he's making and not just go on MSNBC and have lips clap for him. And that's, you know, if you're not willing to speak to Republican voters, why are you know, you're going on CNN, you're going on morning Joe, what are you really, what are you really doing? And this is one of the things you see is that people who oppose Trump from the right, somehow a lot of them turn into liberals. What else to say? This is there's like the sliding scale of, you know, if someone steps up, they fight Trump and it doesn't work. And then all of a sudden they're going on morning Joe and they're like, you know, trans rights are human rights. And I think that men should be able to compete against women. And it's like, well, how does this happen? It's so well said. And we told you it's going to happen, right? All those big interest groups, the Lincoln project and bulwark or whatever those places are called Democrats, they're Democrats now. They initially, that's right. They initially buck were like, Oh, Trump is a existential threat to democracy. And then they owe their entire existence to Trump. And so if Trump weren't the nominee, they would pivot and say, well, actually, you know, Ron DeSantis is the biggest threat to democracy and all those things. It's interesting as the nominee shifts. Chris Christie is interesting to me. Do you know Chris Christie personally? I don't even know if I've, he may, I don't think I can't remember if I've ever, I don't think I've ever interviewed him. I don't think he's ever come on any show I've done. And I mean, I've interviewed everybody other, you know, other than lives who won't talk to me. Um, but he kind of predated me having my own. Yeah. I've never met him and I don't think I've ever even interviewed him. I was curious just because he's New Jersey and you grew up in New York and like he was the, oh, you mean I met him? Yeah. I mean, I grew up. I knew Trump a little bit growing up. I knew Giuliani growing up and met them when I say knew them. I met them. I saw them in places. So you don't have a personal, because I know a lot of people that I talked to who I respect in the New York, Connecticut, New Jersey area who let's be honest, don't have a lot of Republican success stories to tell. And so they really became very enamored of Chris Christie. And I do not know. I don't think I've ever met Chris Christie in person. In fact, I will say this. I know that when Chris Christie and left politics, there were some conversations, a huge sports fan and he thought about a little bit, I think pivoting and just saying, Hey, I just, I'm kind of burned out on politics. Now I want to go and talk about, you know, the aikis and the red socks and all this stuff. And so there were people talking to me saying you would love this guy purely from a sports perspective. The reason why I bring this up, Buck is you just heard what he said. He basically, it seems to me, and you guys out there listening can correct me if I'm wrong, you're right. I think correctly deducing Vivek is running. And I like Vivek. We've had him on this show. Vivek is running in some way to be a member of the Trump cabinet, potentially VP, right? Or treasury secretary. I mean, that's, that's the whole game. Great job of it. And but he's he doesn't, he's not really running to be president, right? If you show up in Miami outside of the courthouse as Vivek did and you stage your own press conference saying that you will, uh, that you will part in Trump, I actually agree with him 100%, right? Cause I started this argument before anybody else did it. Now he's leading the charge and I give him respect for that cause he's, he's arguing the same thing as me. It feels to me though, like Chris Christie has made the decision. I am going to run for president, but primarily during that campaign, I am going to be the guy who says Trump is a liar. Trump is a loser. I'm going to attack Trump unlike anyone else. And the reason I'm asking this buck is can you think of anyone that actually did this in 2016 as like the crux of their campaign? I don't and I can't, I know people said negative things. And I said, Cruz went off on Trump like in 16 buckets seemed like everybody thought, I'll avoid attacking Trump and then hopefully it'll end up me versus Trump. And then I'll win in the end, right? Like that was the theory, I think of a lot of guys and gals who ran in 2016 in 2020. Obviously no opposition here in this race, it feels like Christie is the first person to enter the race just to attack. So, so here's, I mean, here's where I think this is all heading to. If a candidate believes that Donald Trump won in 2020, why are they running? This is going to become a central part of this fight. If you're going to say, you know, let's, let's just say like, you know, Kerry Lake is not going to run against Donald Trump, right? We all know that. Kerry says very openly, I don't think I'm putting words in her mouth that she thinks the election in 2020 was it was unfair and that if it hadn't been unfair, it was stolen. It was stolen. That is she will say it is stolen. Okay. If a candidate thinks that it was stolen, why is the candidate running? Because then obviously Donald Trump should be the only the only one. So this is, I think we're heading toward that being a part of the primary fight as well. And up to this point, you haven't really heard very much talking about Chris Christie's obviously introducing that as his primary. That's his primary motive attack against the president. And I wonder, are there any, you know, I put this out there. Are there any, you don't even have to be a Chris Christie voter. Is there anyone listening to this who approves of Christie at this point in the race is happy that he's in? I'm wondering. Great question. Or, you know, I'll put it out there. 800-282-2882 because, you know, I've asked, we've had people call us if Vivek is their guy. And, you know, it's just our opinions about maybe Vivek does think that the way to win is to just be very favorable to Trump. And I mean, I think that's, I would say that that's highly, highly unlikely. But, you know, we don't know. No one can tell the future. We've had people that their favorite candidate never can pick their favorite. That's the whole point of a primary is Vivek or their favorite is we had some people saying it was Mike Pence. I'm just put it out there. I'm wondering, is anyone going to call in? And I'm not saying call in so we can argue with you on this. I'm just wondering, call in. If you're glad that Chris Christie is in the race, I would like, I would like to hear from that person. Um, I think right now there's a chance that we might not get a single phone call about it. Again, I don't know. That's why I put it out there. It's why we have a couple million of our friends listening in. So we'll see what they think at one point you would agree, Buck, as somebody who was in the Northeast, Chris Christie was the saving the lion, the night in shining armor for East Coast Republicans. Like he was the guy, right? He people woke up and realized that teachers unions act as you know, thuggish entities, bringing more and more money for themselves, benefits for themselves and higher taxes for residents with not a care about the children they're supposed to be educating teachers unions. I'm not talking about teachers, the way the unions operate in places like New Jersey and New Jersey is a particularly bad in New Jersey. You know, there've been documentaries done. There was actually one that was a pretty good. It was called the cartel many years ago about the teachers unions. I forget the guy who made it or also give him credit, but I'm calling out his documentary. He goes, he sees all these teachers, union administrators who are driving to work in Mercedes Benz and they're making $250,000 a year. You're like, what do you do? Like, what do you do here? And you got very high property taxes in New Jersey. Christie was really good on that. Or any of you thinking that he's a good voice in this race or are you going to vote? I mean, would you vote for him? I'll put it out there because big tent, big discussion. I'm just wondered if anyone feels that way. I, I would not bet that the phone lines are going to going to be jumping off the screen right now. That's my sense of it. 800-282-2882 is the phone number. Love to hear it. Chris Christie, throw it in some punches. If you're exercising to get into shape, you know, I'm trying to fight the dadbod before I even become a dad. Um, you know, that sort is that comes though after a good day or two of working out and getting after it. So even if you're not exercising, you can experience stiffness and that inflammation that just comes from living life. I know what that's like. It was enough for me to try relief factor.

You know, you don't know until you put out the call. You throw off the bat signal for Clay and Buck a lot of Chris Christie talk from folks out there. They're waiting right now. Let's get to it. So I stand corrected. I didn't think we'd get that many. Um, Robert in Las Vegas. What have you got for us, Robert? Hey, hey, good to talk to you guys. Thank you. I'm not, I'm not saying I'm a Chris Christie fan, but in the, in the actual clip that you played, you're calling, you're saying, um, he's calling Trump a loser. And let's have a mind to find out why in the clip you played, he made pretty clear why he's calling the loser. Yeah, I don't see loss of Senate. You lost the election. Loser, loser, loser. I think correct. I think we're saying his larger game plan. Yes, it's clear what he said in the clip. Right. We're saying is the larger game plan here. I don't think Chris Christie thinks he's going to be president. Is he trying to angle for a spot in somebody else's administration? Does he just really hate Trump? Like what is his motivation? Robert, he used the clip. Do you think what he says is true is really what you, you agree with his assessment? What you can't disagree. That's the fact. You're there. There we go. There we I'm going to tell you right now, Robert, there are a lot of people that disagree right now listening with the Trump is a little bit. I appreciate you calling in. And I think what he's saying is to be fair, Robert saying he lost in 2020, whether they cheated or not, he lost, right? So that's we are, we are dealing in the world of facts here. Let's see. Michael in Florida also on Chris Christie. What do you think, Michael? Um, well, I am a DeSantis fan because I'm a Florida resident. Every single person I know is, but in fact, we hate to see them go. But if we have to lose them, being president would be the only good way to lose them. Um, as far as Christie, I'm glad he's saying it. I wish more people were. And I don't, I think part of the value of Christie brings to the table is the recognition that Trump has lost. He is great in something. And he did great things for the country. I admit that it, I will give him his props that he deserves, but he also has his negative and he just not only does he not overcome his negatives, he doubles down on him, you know, whether it's Twitter stuff or is it like, Michael, we got to go to a break. I appreciate you calling it from Florida. Um, and, and yeah, look, a lot of every flirty and that I talked to and I am a flirty and now they think governor Ron DeSantis has done a phenomenal job as governor. That's for sure. Um, play a lot of, I mean, getting, I mean, look, I know it's just the calls, but if we, we read the tea leaves, so to speak of the phone lines, a lot of support, the Chris Christie message. I was not expecting that. We'll take some calls on Chris Christie, allow people to continue to weigh in, but we got South Carolina representative Nancy May. She's up next, uh, first female graduate of the Citadel. We will discuss all of this and more with her when we come back, but in the meantime, want to make sure that all of you out there understand that get refunds.com can make you a bundle.

Clay Travis and Buck's Exon on the front lines of truth. Welcome in Clay Travis. Buck's Exon. Joe, we're joined now by representative Nancy Mates of South Carolina. And I got to start this off by saying I completely and absolutely loved your going to war with crazy man Keith Oberman, who regularly jumps after Buck and myself as well. And I just for people who did not see it, I'll set it up and then you can, you can, you know, knock it off the tee here. But basically you tweeted that Hillary Clinton got a different standard of justice than Trump did and that she was able to get away with destroying her emails and Oberman came back at you and describe exactly what happened. Well, he said that I was hallucinating. He said that I was wrong, but she didn't take a hammer to anything and that I was hallucinating as if I were on drugs or something or high, I guess I don't even know. And then it was beautiful. It was, I love Elon Musk. The community notes went in, in fact, checked him and I fact checked him with CNN videos where they were fact checking that it actually happened. Did Hillary Clinton and her staff take cameras to their devices, their phones, their iPads and they use bleach, but on the server, the answer was yes. And fanically, yes, it actually did happen. It's called obstruction of justice. And we were able to fact check him, but also community notes on Twitter. Did the same thing. It was, it was beautiful. Congresswoman Nate, mace, thanks for being with us. Trump is going into court today. He's doing the whole checking in. I don't, they're fingerprinting him. I don't think they're doing a mug shot and then he's going to be in front of a judge going to plead, not guilty to 30 plus counts here. What do you think the position of the various candidates in the Republican primary should be on this matter? The vet, Ramaswami, saying he's already committing to a part in if he were to be president, do you think that's the right approach? And and just how do you think that everybody should be viewing this? Well, in this case, and people understand, like, I've had my ups and downs with Donald Trump, but when you look at this at the outset, when you look at the timing of these indictments, the first one happened the day that the oversight committee got access to the SARS reports, the second indictment happened when we got access to 1023 showing bribery with Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. The next one will come down when they, when we released it, when the tapes get released, I guess, but when you look at this from a very high level, this is the executive branch utilizing their power, wielding their power to put away, walk away for life. Like this is a death sentence for Donald Trump to keep Joe Biden's number one political enemy from the presidency. I mean, that's at the end of the day, that's what this about. This is about because we can argue. Oh, sir, my dog is going off. We can argue about how a mishandling of documents, you know, but Hillary Clinton, she sets the standard with how documents are handled and she obstructed justice, didn't get indicted and they're indicting Donald Trump. They're arresting him and today, they're awaiting him today to keep him off the ballot in 24 at the end of the day. That's what this is about. And I don't care if you're Republican or Democrat or independent. That's what is happening in this country today. It should not be. And I think it's egregious. I think that the other candidates need to support Donald Trump in his arraignment today. I mean, I think it's a whole other argument on how we handle documents and the Presidential Records Act and all that. But the precedent we're setting today is unwarranted. We should not be doing this, especially during a presidential election, especially to a former president when Joe Biden got away with classified documents. Mike Pence got away with it. How are they Clinton? Like, what are we talking about here? You're just trying to do this to lock them up, put them away for jail for life. Um, in nobody else's held to the same standard. It's crazy that this is happening in the way that it's happening. So how does this play out? 2024. You have, I think laid out a bunch of different arguments for, Hey, you've got to win back suburban women, right? And Buck and I talk about this on the show a lot, the persuadable voters. Um, you represent a district that has persuadable voters. How does this play in your mind with those voters out there who may not be following this as intensely as most of our listeners are? And you just laid it out. I mean, clearly two systems of justice is going on. But how do you make that appeal to these moms that are out there running around with their kids super busy every day and they're going to look up in October and suddenly make a decision next year who to vote for. How do Republicans take back the White House? What do we have to do in your mind? I'm trying to show a path here. You got to be able, you can't just, you can't just be able to speak. Maga, you've got to be able to support and speak suburban mom too. And I've tried to show a pathway to 24 in talking about the issues that women care about because at the end of the day, and I heard from some independent voters and the independent minded people that aren't supporting the former president just yet. They're supporting somebody else in the primary, but they don't like what they see happening in our country right now. They don't like what Joe Biden is doing with the executive branch. Wielding and weaponizing their power to throw somebody a presidential candidate, a political enemy in jail. And I am slowly seeing that it's taken a while. And my instincts are that we need to show it for what it is, but also at the same time as Republicans, we have to show women that we care. We have to, while we're talking about the issues of life, we have to talk about birth control and protecting women who've been raped or girls or victims of incest, doing all the compassionate, caring things that suburban moms care about and want us talking about. And I, you know, last summer or last year in my, my race, I'm a very purple district, even though I'm South Carolina, we're along the coast, but our district was not a Republican district last summer. It was heavily, let me, and we need Democrat on a generic ballot last summer, but we were up by almost double digits at time because I was talking about the issues that mattered to women voters, particularly highly educated suburban women, suburban moms who maybe aren't pro-life or as pro-life as I am, but they understood and respected the position I was taking that I struck out and staked out and said, I care about women and I care about life. And they, they were satisfied and can live with that because I'm willing to work with other people that might even disagree. And that's going to be, it's going to be a really abortion is going to be, and women's issues are going to be very important issues to us in 24 if we want to keep the house, if we want to flip this in and if we want to win back the White House. Congress, when before I let you go, clearly your dog, not a Hillary Clinton voter, not a fan. I'm just wondering what kind of dog? She's a havenee, her name is Liberty and she loves freedom in the Constitution. And DC with me this week, you know, marching around and taking votes if we get to vote today. She's around with us up here on the Hill this week. Two things in your background that I want you to tell our audience who may not know you, Nancy, you worked as a waffle house waitress. I'm wondering what the best waffle house story you have. Second part of this. You can think on that for a second part on this. You were, I believe the first female graduate or among the first female graduates from the Citadel. Would you go to fabulous school in South Carolina? Would you have ever believed? I'm curious when you were in school at Citadel that the entire Democrat party would believe that men should be able to compete in women's athletics and that that would be their dogma. What's crazier? Your experience at waffle house as a waitress or the Democrat perspective on athletics? Oh gosh. Well, definitely in the Democrat perspective on athletics, I remember, you know, I'm a high school dropout, a drop of the school at 17. My father's retired army general. I said, you're going to stop going to school. You got to start going to work. That's when I took up the job at the waffle house. I will tell you my favorite stories at the waffle house when, or when I was on the morning shift and the guys that were coming off their night shift at work and their wives or their family or their kids would meet them at waffle house for breakfast when they were getting off their shift or the cops that would come in for a cup of coffee as they were going to work like that community feeling and meeting real people with real stories and real lives and real jobs like that was awesome. But at the Citadel, like I used to say when I graduated, you know, I was like, I'm not a feminist. I didn't do this to be a feminist. Like my father's a graduate of the Citadel. I went to prove my own, you know, my own, my own strength, my own potential there. I didn't go there for any other reason. But now I'm like, well, gosh, conservative women are feminist now because we want women to achieve things. We don't want men to take away the achievements of women today. It's so crazy to me that this is where the conversation has gone. And now we're, we're the feminists. I just, it's mind boggling that they want to, you know, give these achievements away to men. And it's like someone had told me in the 90s when I graduated in 99 from the Citadel. I was the first woman to graduate from there in 1999 that it would have been okay. It was 154 years where women had never been there and that if a biological male somehow put a dress on, then it would be a woman who could achieve that experience. Like I don't think so. Not happening. We want to make sure that our women and girls are protected in their locker rooms, on the fields and academic achievements, everything.

When I do chores, that's kind of my, or when I try to force myself to do slow steady state cardio, which is like the worst thing in the world. So a good podcast. So how do you do slow steady state cardio? Is that like that? I do. I do. Like very. Like high incline walking. So if you're learning to know, I go at like, which shut up. What is this? What is this? What is this? You make money for being an old guy and you do high incline walking. I don't even have to have heard of anybody incliding the new walk. Excuse me, sir. I put on a 20 pound weight vest and I walk at a 9.0 elevation and a 3.5 speed and it is quite effective and easy on the knees. And as I'm saying that out loud, it does make me feel like I'm getting older, but it is effective. Clay's being a jerk today, everybody. I think first of all, you're in the Kamala Harris fan club. Now you're walking on elevated elevated. I know if you're, if you, I don't know what age. You can, you can get on a treadmill and walk. But I know it is definitely older than you are. Like if I looked over it, I would be like, oh, he must be warming up. He's going to start running. You, you, you keep this up. We're going to have to have some kind of a, of a public bed here where you have to go. 30 minutes, 9.0 elevation, 20 pound way felt on at 3.5 and see what you look like at the end of it. I'm not saying I could do it. All right. I'm not, I'm not in any way saying that this is not difficult to do. I'm saying that if I were in the gym and if I were like looking around at what everybody's doing and I saw a non gray haired man walking on a treadmill, I would be like, what did this guy just, what? Is he recovering from, you know, a serious injury recovery? Is that's when we're that he has long COVID and he can't breathe? Like what is his, what is it? What is this situation here? I just, I would have never bet that you were a walk on the treadmill for exercise. I'm just trying to tell everybody about our excellent podcast and this is the, this is the heat. This is the trash that I get, you know, oh boy, you know, it's just baby steps, you know, baby steps toward now that's actually not really the analogy I want to go for. Consider we're talking about walking slowly. Does Carrie walk your, your wife? Does she ever walk on the treadmill? Does she run beside you? Like, like just kind of like you, like a whippy look like while you're running. She does like wind sprints and it does, you know, yeah. It's like my wife. And we have a little bit of condition. And meanwhile, you're on the treadmill, you know, walking clay. You got everything is relative. She's just happy. I'm not there. You know, I'm not sitting on the couch pounding Twinkies. You know what I mean? Like, you know, better than, you know, that's very enjoyable. All right. Anyway, we were very much talking about the podcast situation, which is subscribe to the iHeart app is the best way to do it. Download the iHeart app wherever you can. If any of you out there, by the way, want to, want to weigh in on how steady state elevated walking is actually good for weight loss, feel free to call in and yell at clay. The jerk. I don't even think you can lose weight by walking. You can't. That is not true. There's no one who's gotten skinny because they walk all the time. I'm, I'm, I'm, the fitness influencers listening. You're going to tell you you're talking, by the way, this is what I do after I lift weights, but that's a whole other thing. So I'm just throwing this out there. And we do have some calls, not on that topic. And I did want to get to them. I think we got, yeah, you guys are telling me different sides of the coin here, right? All right, let's start with Tyler in Miami down here in Miami. What's going on, Tyler? Yeah, I just wanted to throw in my two cents to the rationale as why Chris Christie would throw his name in the hat and come out swinging at Trump. I think there's an agenda in time will tell which route he takes. People run for president for four reasons, to win, to get an appointment on their party's cabinet, to push one or two major issues to the public stage or to be relevant in the media and public. I think Chris Christie obviously is not going to be, he's not going to win. He's not going to get an appointment. He just wants to be relevant so he can conduct interviews or menu the spotlight, write a book, get speaking gigs, but also he could do well on a panel, a major media outlet. He'd get a Chris spot with CNN or MSNBC, maybe the token conservative for their panel. That's all I said, Tyler. Have you ever walked on a treadmill? Last night. How old are you? See? See? Oh, Clay, you have, you have poked the dragon. I have my in trouble now. If I just like to overrule the next nest, I'm just going to, I'm going to be able to check my email. Clay is used to watching elite 20 year old athletes work out from the outcake world who are like deadlifting 600 pounds. For those of us like weekend warriors, okay, a good heart rate elevation on the steady state treadmill is better than the alternative. See, I was going to give you credit if you were on the elliptical, but I've just never heard of a man who was not like over the age. It was not over the age of 65, like voluntarily going to the gym to walk on the treadmill. Walk outside on the street. Then all right. Back to politics. John and New Jersey, a new Jersey and John, what he got for us. Mega Ditto was Clay and Buck. Mega Ditto's. I'm a big fan of the walking as well. I just, I'm going to have to resign from the show. I'm just going to get deludes with walkers on treadmill to our cabinet. The memes alone are worthless. The army of treadmill walkers are coming after you. Anyway, go ahead, John. Go ahead. Sorry. Yeah. The reason why I support Christian, it's the term that still has me in Twitter jail right now, is he's performing service by punching Trump in the mouth. And after doing that, some of the other candidates will start to do it too. And I have a Trump report with Faye the way that someone else will arrive. And I think Christie with his whole big speech, big America, big ideas, that's just in case if he manages to take Trump out and nobody else rises and even the last one standing, maybe he will run for president. All right. Thanks for calling on that one. Clay, we're going to return to all of these topics. Sir, we're going to have a lot of lines. You have any thoughts for Clay out there? Walking battalion, walking brigade, 800-282-282. The White House had a pride celebration yesterday, Clay, and, uh, cause a little problem for them. We'll talk about it in just a moment."
