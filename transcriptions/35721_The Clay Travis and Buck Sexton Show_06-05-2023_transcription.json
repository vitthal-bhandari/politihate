    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast Welcome in appreciate all of you hanging out with us as we start a brand new week Monday edition clay Travis bucksxton show We have got a lot to discuss with you throughout the course of this program Bill Maher Elon Musk interesting conversation We've got Another bank failure. I don't know how many people are paying attention to this But two of the three biggest bank failures in American history have happened in the last six weeks Bernie Sanders, I can't believe this is real said he wants to confiscate every money a piece of Additional assets anyone has over 999 million dollars Justice Alito thinks he knows who leaked the Supreme Court opinion really interesting conversation That he had with the Wall Street Journal, but I want to start with this If I had told you in 2010 let's see we could go back in time buck. Let's say we go back in time all the way back To 2010 Obama's first administration if I had told you that every Single Democrat in the entire country Would believe that men who decide that they want to identify as women Should be able to compete and win women's athletics You would have probably thought that I was crazy now Some of you might have been pressure enough might have been good enough at forecasting the predictive models to say this is where we were headed But remember at that time gay marriage wasn't even legal Obama ran in 2008 opposed to gay marriage and Now here we are 13 years later and every single week Men are winning winning women's athletics and it's important to recognize Just how much of dogma this has become that even people like Chuck Todd But Chuck Todd obviously pale, you know Minuscule in terms of his impact compared to Tim Russard I believe the man that he replaced but I do know this Chuck Todd is a monster sports fan He understands the difference between men and women and their athletics But on meet the press The dogma of transgenderism Has so taken over this country that even somebody like Chuck Todd is now Primising questions on the idea that the concept of men and women is an artificial gender binary He had Vivek Ramaswami on and I give credit to Vivek Ramaswami for this He's been going on as many different shows left-wing or otherwise as he can and he ate it in a bed I think in some way Don Lemon getting fired because we played the audio for all of you of Don Lemon kind of losing it when he was discussing race relations with Vivek well here is meet the press Vivek Ramaswami is in studio And look whatever you want to say about Vivek he is a Highly trained very well educated man of a science background He has been involved in biotech companies and he gets pressed here by by Chuck Todd on the idea that there are Anything other than men or women listen below the age of 18 I think it's perfectly legitimate to say that we won't allow genital mutilation or chemical castration through puberty blockers But how do you know it's that again? How do you know are you confident that you know that gender is as binary as you're describing it? Are you confident that isn't a spectrum? I am I am this as a scientist well There's there's two ex chromosomes if you're a woman an ex and why that means a lot of scientific research out there That says gender as a spectrum Chuck I respectfully disagree gender dysphoria for most of our history all the way through the DSM 5 Has been characterized as a mental health disorder, and I don't think it's compassionate to affirm that I think that's cruelty You know clearly they've started to talk more openly now about What's going to be the position on body identity integrity disorder people who? Think that they should be able to identify as not only disabled, but they should be able to disable themselves There are people who very much believe and this is obviously an extreme mental illness right as I say this It's almost hard to imagine anybody would think this there are people who think they should have a limb removed There are people who think they should be paralyzed that that is who they are as individuals they identify that way and We haven't been able to hear from the left any Explanation for why that's all that different from somebody who says you know I'm actually a boy remove my breasts and try to create a you know fake male genitalia for me you remember for a while under the Trump administration they were doing this thing They were doing this thing where they would say There's no evidence for that right there Whenever they would talk about something that Trump would assert or if if Trump had an opinion about something the media would just start inserting and everything Without evidence without evidence The people who are identifying as women are also doing so without evidence Growing your hair long and putting lipstick on does not actually make you a woman It makes you a man with lipstick on and long hair But even this notion of being able to identify as What does that even really mean and I think that we're seeing as well how important this is to the project of the left because They keep pushing this at the mode in the most extreme ways Including in blue states now where they're creating these sanctuary jurisdictions for Adolescents to run away it is now the law in Washington And I believe also the law in Colorado that if you run away from your parents and you run to one of those states and you claim that you are a You're transgender There's a delay if not a block in notification and no one will stand the way of you having a transgender You know surgery or puberty blockers. They're they're focused on this on a policy level And I think it's important the reason I wanted to play that Chuck Todd clip is this is meet the press So it is supposed to be the most august high end. This is their theory I mean not anymore, but right I get it But that is the theory the premise under which Chuck Todd is acting there is now sort of the buy-in you know if you sit down at a poker table You have to be able to put a certain amount of money out on the table. You have a buy-in The buy-in now for anyone in media is to accept the premise that Boys and girls men and women is not an actual gender binary and that there is a long prism in The way that people identify themselves and Buckwell I was sitting I was out in Vegas over the weekend had a great time one of my good buddies getting married Congratulations to Todd Furman who I've worked with for a decade or so in media sports media And he and his wife Nicole. We had an awesome time but On Sunday, I went out to lunch and I was sitting there with my wife getting ready to head back There was probably a 20 year old sitting at the table next to us. He was wearing a protect trans youth t-shirt and He wore still in Las Vegas in a casino a mask to both walk to the table in between when he was drinking like wearing a mask clearly Sort of deranged behavior in my mind right to still be wearing a mask to be 20 years old Otherwise young and relatively healthy and he was wearing the protect trans youth t-shirt And I was sitting there thinking the buy-in for Democrats Every single day becomes crazier because just think about it What why would there be a connection between wearing a protect trans youth t-shirt and wearing a mask Logically, it doesn't even make any sense. It's all about signaling Obedience it's branding what I call the apparatus But it's and this is why it was so important for them during covid And when we all really saw this It was important no matter how stupid it was for people to do the dumb things that we all knew were dumb Because you weren't doing it to protect yourself or because you even believed it you were doing it because the good people Fauci etc told you to and so it's a signaling mechanism and it's the same thing now with this focus on You know protecting trans youth or whatever the on the t-shirt and I would just say clay to your point about the median chuk-tahd Yeah Let's understand that we're just a little ways away here from chuk-tah I mean what does anyone think a chuk-tahd segment now as you point out It is an august platform that has basically been destroyed But what would be his position if we were to show him some of the lives of tik-tok gyrating You know transgender You know cross dressers in front of small children for the special drag queen story hours that they keep doing they keep pushing This is so important to them Most people would never even heard of this till a few moments ago Chuk-tahd would be required to say that he sees nothing wrong in this And that this is just trying to be more inclusive and he would fall back into the language that all the rest of the commies Are supposed to use what's more likely clay ten years ago No, none of these people would have said that gender was a spectrum correct none of them right not a single one Isn't it fascinating how if you were a democrat in the media? Ten years ago you would have all you would have all been like yeah Look gender is not a spectrum and somehow they have all transitioned you could say to uniform 100 belief in this idea that changed so very rapidly based on no evidence whatsoever Who is the big democrat out there right now? Who's on one of these platforms who goes guys gender is not a spectrum at all? This is crazy. I mean you may feel a fine one or two, but they're no longer in good standing with the democrat party They are now apostates because it is like a religion And that is what you are seeing happening right now in real time with this and a whole range of issues the other thing I wonder buck is Where are we gonna be in ten years? Because that that's that's what really I can't get past Robert F Kennedy jr. To my knowledge is the only democrat and we can question whether he even really classifies as a democrat now Who has been willing to come out and say Women should not have to compete against men in women's sports. He's the only one What are democrats going to be required to say in a decade? Because whatever you think of republicans and whatever you think of the right There's actually a great deal of diversity of thought on a lot of different issues On the right democrats now enforce dogma in their party left us do In a way that frankly I don't know has existed in any of our lives and that's scary and it's chilling But it also makes you wonder buck. I mean Barack Obama in 2010 and every other democrat when they were in power would have laughed at the idea of What south park made fun of right the macho man randy savage concept which is so well And funny To get on the show it makes me we do need to play it again But they would have all said no, that's laughably absurd Where are we gonna be in ten years? Think about it as crazy. Can I try to answer that by the way? Because I think it's yeah I think it's worth it. We come back. That's a heck of a tease. What is next buck tell us where we are headed Uh and and where this all goes because when I see that 20 year old who was sitting next to me In las vegas and the protect trans youth wearing his mask my thought was What would that individual not be willing to do because those two things should be totally unconnected right 20 year old wearing a mask and also a protect trans youth shirt They shouldn't be connected, but that that is the signaling that is the social virtue Necessity to be a left-winger now.

That's my patriot supply.com The torch of truth passed and still lit every day The clay Travis and buck sexton show welcome back to the clay Travis and buck sexton show We had just left you with a bit of a cliffhanger a moment ago Where is it all going? Uh with the trans agenda, which as you know Uh stretches all the way up to biden himself and the biden white house. This is not fringe left wing activists who are pushing all of this alone This is now a central effort of the democrat party um, and If you're wondering is there any sense of stepping back from this and maybe clay we could talk about this 12 year old Who got in trouble for wearing a there are only two genders t-shirt and massachusetts when we come back in a second, but first here um, dylan Mulvaney who Uh is the bud light The bud light destructor I think fair to say Um, dylan movaney Says that any journalist who misgenders him well, i'll let dylan say it play one like the articles written about me using He pronouns and calling me a man over and over again And I I feel like that should be illegal. I I don't know. That's that's just bad journalism It should be illegal To refer to I want everyone to understand this is someone that Major corporations have made a millionaire have made nationally and globally famous And this person thinks it should be a crime To refer to him as a him Now clay had had uh, we talked with this a moment ago where where is all of this going? um The focus on children here clay is really instructive I think about what the next steps are supposed to be Because any person who has not yet fallen victim to the mind virus here of wokeness as it pertains to transgenderism Understands that the stuff they're doing with the kids at these drag shows just go in the libs of tiktok account Go watch the videos. No sane person could defend this stuff. Why do they keep doing it? And why do they keep defending it? Um, it's just a matter of time before they're going to try to pass laws that suggest that parents Um are engaged in child abuse if they don't gender affirm their child And so then here's how the system will and i've already said the other stuff Which is completely true, which is that eventually the left wing activist will say if you're not attracted Like if you're a straight guy who doesn't find dylan movani, you know hot You're a bigot that that's already started, but the children thing is much more Um frightening. I think to people that that see what's coming You're going to have a situation where the system schools media tiktok whatever Convince is your child that he or she is trans and if you don't affirm it at home clay as a parent You're engaged in child abuse. Maybe your child has to be taken from you That's where this is heading. That is where this is going I almost feel like the only way to respond to this now Is by aggressively applying the same logic to race I was thinking about this over the weekend as I was sitting next to that, you know protect trans youth mask wearing 20 year old and in a las vegas casino And Obviously that was the the way that that person is virtue signaling that's going to be in his mind attractive to somebody else So you're the kind of guy who wears masks and wants to protect trans youth. I'm interested in you, right? What if we're all trans racial Is that the way to destroy identity politics and really blow this thing up because no democrat That I have heard from Has been able no left wing person Can justify Why agenda is a choice and it's a spectrum but race is defined and you have to be a particular member of race Like if I decided today that I want to be latino Uh, doesn't everybody have to respect my choice Well, what would happen if you had a lot of You know white kids applying to college Who all of a sudden identified as as Hispanic or or black on their applications in large numbers Yeah, how do they actually police that as and how do they? Determine who counts and who doesn't? I don't think you could it's a fantastic question. We'll build on that a little bit more Is this the way to destroy it by just ridiculing it? Increasing number of people out there are trying to save money because inflation's hitting everybody in the pocketbook You know one way to save a lot of money for just about everybody is by making a better decision when it comes to your cell phone service There right now pure talk has a 30-dollar a month package for unlimited talk text plenty of fast data That's an incredible offer right now for everybody trying to save money. This is good old fashioned american company They'll save you a lot more money than verizon t-mobile or at and t will without the carriage expense that comes as well They support our veteran ceo as a us veteran himself And you can switch that number in as little as a few minutes by dialing pound 250 say clay and buck 50 off your first month dial pound 250 say clay and bucks start saving now Welcome back in clay travis buck sexton show. I want to play a couple of different clips um, but my wife Who is let me give her a little credit to going to graduate next week from vanderville law school So I didn't want to mention that she was finishing her law degree because I didn't want to blow it up And I maybe i'm a little bit early, but she is scheduled to graduate next week, but she just texted me. She's listening Um, what happens one day if dylan molvaney decides to switch his gender back to he Because gender is fluid. She's asking me does everyone arrested for the crime of misidentifying him Get out of jail. How do we keep up? Do we get flipped back and forth? I mean this is pointing out The profound absurdity of this and ultimately democrats recognize it buck Because if you try to apply the same rules Of transgenderism to race and you just say well you should be able to be transracial I'm a white guy, but if I want to identify as a latino or a latina latinx, I guess they would say uh, woman Why can I identify as a woman? But I can't identify as latin or black or or asian or whatever else right the entire uh sort of kabuki theater of this It collapses as soon as you start to apply the logic to basically anywhere other than gender And as we've talked about on this program buck Gender is actually far more real than races, right? Because many people out there They get their dna analysis and they find out uh, oh, I thought my family was was all Uh, you know from italy or I thought my family was all from africa And it turns out that that's not true at all. You're elizabeth warren and you're just pretending to be something that you aren't And by the way, she was never uh Really punished for that. She got away with the whole thing. So she's actually I mean it she managed to elevate herself dramatically Um from where she would have been in in academia all the way up to being not only a senator But a presidential candidate without that without that x factor of a racial advantage that she created for herself Elizabeth warren would not be a name that anybody knows. It's just obvious It's it's quite clear and your point about what we can do about this. I've thought for some time That the only way to end this madness now the supreme court I think in About six weeks or so is going to say that uh racial preferences in college admissions Are unconstitutional, which is really the most obvious thing Imaginable, right? I mean this is a straightforward a situation as you can find Um looking at somebody and saying, you know, you are black this other person is white or this person is Hispanic and this person is Uh, you know asian american and i'm going to give one of them Something better than the other person that is the definition of racism they can try to change it a million infra ways We all know this right But if you what what's going to happen is the private institutions are going to find ways around this That's why they're dropping sat's this is why You know, they they are already trying to figure out to make it such a holistic process They're going to turn these universities into like a country club situation who gets in who doesn't man Whatever we say, how do you know? It's kind of a feeling we get right now the racial makeup of the schools will stay exactly the same by the way that So it won't be a quota, but the numbers will stay the same. I can guarantee you this harvard all these places now How can you deal with this? Well? Make them tell you that you don't count to your point about transracialism You don't count as On on what basis? You're self identifying on all of these forms and you know write an essay about how you know, you really feel like you've Established, you know, you're you're you're in you it or your your Eskimo Heritage in high school in a way that's profoundly affected your life and you are now a native american Like go with it, right? I mean just run with it and see what happens. What are they gonna do? They're gonna say I mean all you if they try to press you on this one say, okay Let's look at my 23 me right find something that you got, you know, I think i'm i'm like, you know 2% Says 2% african I got a couple other things in there and low percentages. I think there might have been wait. You're an african american I mean 2% time that I mean look I would you're an african american I mean, I see this is my like are they gonna say sorry? You don't qualify because you have to what you have to be what percentage? I know it's the drop of blood standard I was making a joke about this recently my sister got her 23 and me or whatever it is And I don't know what exact, uh, you know replica i'll get I need to get it done again She was 1% Middle Eastern So can I start saying assuming the same thing is true for me as a middle eastern man? I believe you could say as a black man and if somebody pressed you on it if somebody pressed you on it How would you be able to prove if you said hey my great great grandma? Was uh was black like at what it really it does point to the absurdity of the diversity inclusion myth Are they going to give you a blood test to determine whether you qualify as black or not? Doing it based on skin color There are people who identify as african american who are Very light skin. Oh, so it can't just right it can't 100% so it can't just be well you're too You know, what what are they gonna do? Right? I mean, how do they actually police this? It's it's racist What's up? It's super racist because they're gonna be like you're not dark skinned enough correct Qualify as being black and then you're like well do you need to hold my picture up next to somebody else who you are counting? I'm just gonna say if one this is very it's by that's very solid. It's gi. This is using the tactics of a linsky against the alinsky Um because you over your overwhelming the system you're finding the weaknesses and then you're basically jamming up the gears If you had enough people, you know enough, uh, you know white and asian kids applying to college Claim that they actually identify as a an advantageous race Which is the reality of college admissions in america today I don't know how they would you know be able to to change or or intersift through this I'm not really sure what would happen. That's the only way and the reason that it doesn't happen I think it's one people haven't really thought of it, but also they're afraid of Like being shamed I think by their peers for gaming the system the system's already worthy of shame It's already being gamed. It's just being gamed against you if you're one of these individuals So go for it. I say let it let it uh, let it all rip Well and speaking of game systems We'll play this 12 year old when we come back Which I think is really really good and goes to the essence of what kids are being taught and I give credit to this 12 year old but first Gaming the system if you have not heard this this is south park They basically decided that the new greatest women's athlete of all time in a stroke of pure genius Was going to sound just like the macho man randy savage So if you have not seen these clips and you want to be entertained South park started ridiculing the idea that men could identify as women and become female champions Years and years ago. It now has passed the point of satire. This is real life Listen as the macho man randy savage on and if what percentage of our audience? Puck do you think knows who the macho man randy savage is maybe I need to even explain that Oh, well, I mean, I think a lot but if you know the guys were our age for sure know who he is So the macho man randy savage 1980s era wwe at the time ww f i think he was the second the second greatest wrestler of his era After whole coke and you think that's fair. I think that's fair Uh, andrew the giant fans rolling over in their grave to the snake roberts There there there are a lot of a lot of superstars in that era but macho man and miss elizabeth his wife and manager Um, by the way, we dressed up as macho man and miss elizabeth my wife and I did a couple of uh halloween's ago Fabulous costume idea by my wife, but listen to this as south park ridicules what has now become Democrat dogma if you're a man and you identify as a woman you're a woman you're a champion listen Swanson how does it feel to be competing today? I can't tell you how free I feel now that I've started identifying as a woman Now that I can compete as female i'm ready to smash the other girls And is it correct you just started identifying as female two weeks ago? I'm not here to talk about my transition. I'm here to kick some Let me tell you something dingleberry david parry i'm gonna rule up the other women here I'm gonna smoke them. I am the strongest woman this state has ever seen I mean they made this before You had nc double a champion men who were competing against women so South park uh life imitating art on that when we'll come back into this and uh, We've we've also uh got to talk we've got this 12 year old who got sent home from school for his gender's t-shirt We'll discuss this in a moment But you know my friends the harpry a heartbeat of an unborn baby can be heard within five weeks of conception The harp begins to format conception of course and just three weeks in the life of that unborn child That's already beating at five weeks of babies harpie can be heard on an ultrasound That's where the network of preborn clinics steps in to help that unborn child They've been rescuing 200 babies every day from abortion simply by providing a mother With a free ultrasound and allowing her to hear her child's heartbeat and see their perfectly formed body in the womb Preborn needs our help to save these precious unborn children from abortion for just 28 Dollars that cost of an ultrasound experience at a preborn clinic Your donation could be the difference between the life or death of a baby And if you become a monthly sponsor you'll receive stories and ultrasound pictures of the lives you help rescue All gifts are tax deductible and 100 percent of your gift goes towards saving babies to donate use your cell phone and dial pound 250 Say the keyword baby.

I think on some of these issues with elon play for we must protect free speech Um and free speech only matters It's only relevant when it's someone you don't like saying something in his life because obviously speech that you like is It's easy. Um, so it's uh, and it's the thing about censorship is that sure for those who would advocate it Um, just remember at some point that will be turned on you Everything about the left is premise though on They think that they'll stay in power and therefore double standards won't fall back on them There won't be a downside for them, but clay we had mentioned this as well a 12 year old massachusetts public school student here telling the board About the day that he was sent home from school because he wore a shirt that said there are only Two genders play clip two. I was told that people were complaining about the words on my shirt That my shirt was making some students feel unsafe. Yes, res on a shirt made people feel unsafe I was told that I would need to remove my shirt before I could return to class When I nicely told them that I didn't want to do that they call my father Thankfully my dad supported my my decisions came to pick me up One of my shirts say five simple words. There are only two genders I have been told that my shirt was targeting a protected class Who is this protected class? Are their feelings more important than my rights? I don't complain when I see pride flags and diversity posters hung throughout the school Do you know why because others have a right to their beliefs just as I do He of course knowing more about free speech clay that apparently the entirety of the democrat media these days Which is this to me perfectly buck epitomizes Where we are now Because think about this the 12 year old is the rebellious one It's not discussed enough all the 1960s during the era of the Opposition to the Vietnam war and the grow your hair long in the hippie era They were trying to fight against people in positions of power now all of these kids are actually being meek Syncofence right but basically going out there and supporting Whoever is in a position of power Such that a kid who's 12 Who wears a t-shirt that says there are only two genders that sent home? Easy question for all of you out there if the kid shows up in a rainbow flag t-shirt Is there any school district in america? That would have sent this kid home and said your shirt is inappropriate if you wore like I said When we were out in las vegas a protect trans children t-shirt like the 20 year old sitting next to us in a restaurant was wearing Is there any way that that would have caused someone to be sent home? Of course not this kid is the actual rebel And it is rebellious think about how wild this is it's rebellious to say There are two genders which is among the most Clear biological realities in life And let's remember if he had went if he had gone into that same school with a t-shirt on that said Only women can get pregnant The exact same people would complain they would use that unsafe Term right that's oh it makes me feel unsafe Because that then creates this bs Oh, it's about safety and not about suppression of speech and censorship Um, but these are the games that the left plays because they have no standards only double standards as we all know Um, but clay this was uh, so the kid obviously he gets it and we can see what's going on I would just note They want you to say things that are on it's not about even you have to take an opinion you don't agree with Now you have to say things that are objectively false to be in good standing This is the root of totalitarianism. I know that may sound a little bit like You know hyperbole. It's not the beginning of a totalitarian society is the forced embrace Of lies all across the board. You have to say things. You know, we're not true Some people are pushing back on this clay. I just I don't even know about this hat tip To our team and uh and produce your uh, produce your greg for finding this one Do you know about this guy ryan web? This was this is remarkable there is a white Ken now he doesn't identify his white anymore to be clear A white councilman in indiana. This was the story of the daily mail just a few days ago sparks Wait, yeah, it was just it was just uh, it was like two days ago sparks outrage after proclaiming himself a quote lesbian woman of color who is living life as my true self here is a local indiana news report on this play Delaware county councilman ryan web announced that he now identifies as an indian american woman Since that announcement he's received some support but a lot of backlash many calling him childish Despicable even calling for things like execution in a statement web gave to it made he says quote It is unfortunate that I cannot simply be given the same space and respect to explore my identity that so many of those targeting me demand for themselves It's possible. I may change my mind down the road The process of identity exploration is complex and oftentimes at the end of our personal journey We end right back where we started web goes on to tell it mate. This is just his true authentic self I on what basis on what basis can they tell him now clay? I'm amazing. What's the argument? He by the way? He also he put a facebook post up where he said I'm excited to bring some diversity to the council until today. We didn't have any females of color or lgbtq I a pc plus on the council I I think this is the way you have to attack this Because by their own logic this man is a hero as a lesbian indian woman I mean this you should have to say they should have to celebrate this Why shouldn't they have to celebrate his his affirmation of his true self on what basis That I honestly believe that this is what has to happen and and by the way on that t-shirt There are only two genders Your point change it to anything else in science What if you just started arguing water freezes at 36 degrees Right if if if you can get people to deny biological and scientific reality You can get them to believe anything, but congratulations that lesbian indian woman true hero"
