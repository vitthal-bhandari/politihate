    "text": " Music Good afternoon America and welcome to the Dean's List. We are back at it again today in shining the light of truth on the intentional dumbing down of education in this country. It's intentional, it's on purpose, it's not due to incompetence, although they are incompetent. But they're doing it on purpose. They're doing it because they know the only way to take things over. The only way to remake things, to reset things and their image and their fashion. The only way is to have an uneducated populace. It's to have uneducated individuals coming out of K-12, coming out of our universities. And we're shining the light of truth on it today. We are sounding the alarm. We must wake up. I'm happy you are on board. Thank you for joining us. I am Dean Bowen. You're listening to America Out Loud Talk Radio. Our email is the Dean.List at protonmail.com. Reach out to us. We have questions and comments. We do enjoy reading the emails. So keep them coming. The Dean.List at protonmail.com. Or you can follow us on Instagram. The Dean's List 33. Yesterday we started looking at this article. It's an article from 2021. It's what's a couple years old. And it's an article that Joshua Phillip and Ella Kett-Linska. They wrote based upon an interview they had with Alex Newman. And it's Newman's assertion that dumbing down education is the key to dismantling America. And in the article, he is really talking about a communist takeover. He's talking about this joint takeover really between Russia and China. And other nations that are part of the bricks. The point is that America right now is the sole superpower. But if America can be removed, then other nations, other countries can kind of step into the void. And the way to remove America is to dismantle the things she was built upon. The ideals that make up her foundation. And these ideals are in the declaration that all men are created equal. We're endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights. And that among these are life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. And it's the job of governments, the role of government to defend these rights. These are foundational principles that we believe. And those foundational principles have to be removed. In order for America to fall, the foundation has to be removed. And so how do you do that? You do it by, through education, you do it by teaching the kids something else. And it's really been an ingenious two pronged approach. Prong one was to change the way we look at the law based upon Darwin, based upon evolution. Let's look at the law differently. Let's not consider the law to be fixed or concrete or, you know, or an edict from God. Let's consider it to be something that can evolve and can change, you know, because societies change. And so, you know, the societies evolve. Humanity evolved. So, you know, therefore the law should probably evolve. So we started looking at the law differently. And then that allowed the Supreme Court to, to recraft essentially the first amendment. That's where they started. And they were able to recraft the first amendment, which says that Congress should not establish a religion or, you know, they, they can't respect the establishment of a religion. That that's not the job of Congress is to not to oversee or sponsor a state run religion. That's, that's, that's the first amendment. But, you know, in addition to that, people have the right to express freely. They're religious beliefs. And they've been able to recraft the way it's defined. To now mean that you can't have a free expression of religion anymore in the public square because that's akin to Congress establishing a religion. And the whole reason, the whole, the whole way they were able to redefine that first amendment was based upon this whole idea of evolving law case precedent. The law should shouldn't be fixed. It should change. That's the first, the second prong, you know, something very akin to that has been happening in our public education. Once, you know, once we could kick out prayer, once we could kick out the foundational principles of prayer and the Bible and religion and morality. Then we could, we could start doing really the, the same thing in K-12. It has been a, a, a decades long to prong approach. Our eyes are open to it. My question is, is it too late? We're here sounding the alarm. Is it too late? That is the question of the day. Is it too little too late to just be here talking about it? I don't think it is. I don't think it is too late. You know, we have, we have families and individuals in California that are, that are changing policies at the, at the board of education level. Within communities, granted, you know, the leaders in California are fighting that, they're fighting that change. But we have people doing it. We have people who are not willing to roll over. As long as you have people that are willing to fight, in my opinion, it is never too late. It's, you know, it's this whole idea of the steward of Gondor, you know, screaming to his men, abandon your post and Gandalf knocking him out, jumping on his horse and riding through the, through the city, telling people, you know, return to your posts. Go back, fight, return to your posts. It's, we're in that moment. We're in that moment. As long as people are willing to stand up and fight, in my opinion, it's not too late. So what do we need to do? Should we, should we vacate, you know, should we leave public schools? Should we, you know, homeschool, should we, should we find a Christian school, a classical school, should we start schools? Yes, I would say yes to all of those, but what about the people that, that don't have the ability to flee the public school? I guess that's what we're talking about. I guess we're talking about taking, taking back school boards and taking back instruction. That's where we're at. It, you know, we, we also needed a several pronged approach to this whole thing. To this whole battle that we're in. This article here that Epic Times is, is interviewing Alex Newman. I kind of got through halfway yesterday. I'd like to finish a little bit of it. And then I would like to segue into an example. An example, another unfortunate example of the degradation, but also the fight. An example of the fight. So Alex Newman in this article is talking about Dewey. And how John Dewey was influenced by Darwin's theory of evolution. It was Dewey's belief. And by the way, if you missed yesterday Dewey is called the father of American progressive education. So this guy is really the, he's the tip of the spear behind all of this. You know, he, he was a Marxist at heart. He despised the declaration of independence. He despised individual freedom. He thought we should all, you know, be bound up in the, in the collective of the state. That was his opinion. And he feels like this should be taught in schools. And it was his opinion. It was his belief that parents should be quote, weaned from the traditional tutelage of parents. That, you know, we've got to separate the kids and the parents. We can't have the kids being taught by the parents anymore. We need to start teaching the kids. And he saw this, this open ability. This, this open playground. If, if you will, in our education system. He wants to wean parents from the tutelage, or wean kids from the tutelage of their parents and he sees this available to him in K-12. And he's thinking, all right. If we can get teachers on board with this. If we can slowly but surely get teachers on board with this idea. We can take it over. We can make it happen. And he started raising people and teaching people. He started teaching disciples. So when he was long dead and gone, he had people to take over the operation. And it's been ongoing for decades. Alex Newman noted that do we advocated in his writings for a system that in reality would dumb down the population. But do we didn't say this explicitly? But that's what he wanted. Do we assert that there is no need to teach kids how to read right and do the math? Does that sound like Oregon? That absolutely sounds like Oregon. Oregon is like, yeah, we love John doing. Why would we teach kids to read right and do the math? Instead, do we recommended that what kids really needed is to be properly socialized? Yeah, we don't need to teach them to read or to write or to do math or to think on their own. They have to be properly socialized. All right. Let's pause here for a moment. Think of the of the biggest attack on homeschool kids. What is it? What is the number one thing that you hear when you say I'm homeschooling? Go ahead. What's that one thing that that people say to you? I'm listening. Yeah, you got it right. The number one argument or the number one complaint or the number one question is simply this. Well, how are they going to be socialized? How are they going to be properly socialized if they're just at home with their parents all day long? How are they going to be awkward? They're not going to really know how to handle themselves because they're not properly socialized. I am so tired of hearing about homeschool kids not being properly socialized. And it's become a joke. Comedians joke about it and it's funny and we all laugh. I mean, we all probably know that homeschooler who is completely awkward. All right. But I promise you that individual is awkward whether no matter where he or she is at. It's not because they're homeschooled. The homeschooled children have the capability of carrying on conversations with adults. It's true. They have the capability of leading other students when they're in a group because they're homeschooled. And because they are actually properly socialized being around adults more often and learning from those adults. Seeing, oh, this is how I should handle this. And I'm sure that we're doing something that we need to do. Do we believe the opposite? He said, we don't really need to teach them to read, right? And do the math instead? What they really need is to be properly socialized. They need to just be totally immersed in this collectivism so that they will understand that they need to work for the good of the whole. The good of the collective as opposed to their own individual benefit or the benefit of their family. And I said, Dewey did not like the declaration. He didn't like this individual responsibility. He didn't like this idea of rugged individualism that we're out here working for ourselves. You know, when you work for yourself, you better society. You better your community. You better the country. You better the world because it's not a selfish thing. It's not a selfish aspect. It's not selfish to want to work for yourself and to better yourself because if everybody had this thought and this idea, then the whole community would be better. Now, it becomes selfish if I want to better myself at your expense. That's, you know, that's where selfishness kicks in and I shouldn't be bettering myself at the expense of worsening you. The ultimate attitude should be the rising tide lifts all boats. If I'm out here bettering myself and you're bettering yourself then and she's bettering herself and they're bettering themselves, then the whole community is being better because of it. And doing it like that. He didn't like that. He wanted everybody to be trained to be working for the community, not for themselves, but what that does is it takes away from the community. It actually degrades the community. It degenerates it. That is communism and action. You know, we saw this at, at Plymouth Rock, the pilgrims land, they're not really sure what to do. And they have everything in common. They, they had this garden and everybody was supposed to, you know, work the garden and then all the produce was to go to everybody. You know, but if you go back to the writings, what Bradford found was that not everybody was working the garden. The young healthy member like, I don't, I have to go work the garden. I mean, I, I'm just going to all of my labor is going to go to this person. So I'm not going to work the garden today. And, and he found that that nobody worked the garden and everybody was suffering because that's what communism does when you work for the quote collective, the collective suffers. So, Bradford said, you know, you got to go do it for yourself. If you, if you don't work, you don't eat. And it's, it's Bible. It's a scriptural principle. And so then everyone started working for themselves. They went to the garden and they, they, they, they took what they, what they worked for. And it bettered everybody. But capitalism is a thousand percent better than socialism than Marxism than communism. You know, but we've had communists, Marxists overtake our education system for decades. And just like, you know, Grushep told Eisenhower, we will, we will take over your country about even firing a shot. We are watching that unfold before our very eyes. Like we're watching everything else unfold. The, the purposeful dumbing down of education or watching it happen before our very eyes. And it's been happening for decades. And we have John Dewey to think for it. And then his ilk and these disciples that, that he raised in his image that once he was dead and gone, they could take over the process. And here we are. All right, we're going to pause for a break. I, you know what, I could just, well, I will keep going. I'll keep going on the other side. I'm happy that you're joining us today.

Welcome back to the deep list. I am Dean Bowen. We are listening to America Out Loud Talk Radio. We are happy to have you on board with us today. You can find us here on America Out Loud Monday through Friday, 2 p.m. Eastern Time. Or you can listen to us on iHeartRadio. Or you can download the America Out Loud app, the Talk Radio app, and you can catch us live there on the app or on the podcasts. The show usually goes to podcasts the next day and you can find us wherever you find your podcasts. Or you can also go to AmericaOut Loud.News. Go to the show page, scroll down. You can find every single episode. Every show is there listed. I encourage you to go through the shows and find the five part series that we did in support of the Matt Gates bill. As we are talking about the dumbing down of American education, we have Matt Gates out here who is proposing this bill. It's the Protect Prayer in Schools Act and he is proposing that prayer come back in. And he cites these reasons why. So we went on a five part series to historically defend that bill and to historically defend why prayer should be allowed in schools. And in there, we get into how we got here. We talk about what happened between 1776 and now. How is it that we started in complete and utter freedom? But here we are and now our education is being dumbed down on purpose. And so we get into that and I encourage you, find that, go back and listen to it. I'm not sure if you're interested in the history of the history. There's a lot of history in there. I was hesitant at first to, I guess, to dive in and get so historical. I didn't want to put people to sleep. That's not the goal here. The goal is to shine the light of truth, not to put people to sleep. But I continually get feedback on that five part series and people are thanking me. We didn't know it. So I encourage you, whether you like history or not, go find the five part series, listen to it. I think you will be happy about it. You'll be better because of it because the more we realize where we came from, what the truth of the matter is. And how we got here, I think it helps to open our eyes up. I think it helps us to pay attention better. We got people like John Dewey who believed that we didn't really need to teach the kids how to read, write and do math. I mean, it's okay as long as the elites know how to read, write and do math. That's all that matters. I mean, John Dewey, he can read, write and do math, but we don't need the kids to do it. Because the kids just need to be properly socialized because then they can do what we asked them to do. The kids need to be properly socialized so they can perform the work that I want them to perform so they can do my bidding. All right, back to the article. As an example of Dewey's approach, Newman cited the state of Oregon for testing for proficiency requirements to graduate from high school have been discontinued. So a student who was unable to read, write or do any math can get a high school diploma. But wait, Dean, I thought that just happened. I thought Oregon just secretly made that a law and this article is from 2021. Yes to both. Because the governor in Oregon. In response to the pandemic in 2020. She she produces this executive order, which puts an end to all requirements for freshmen and sophomores. The freshmen and sophomores because of this panic. You know, they're going to get behind. We're going to suspend the graduation requirements. As they pertain to proficiency in math, reading and writing, just suspend them. They're all done. That that was in 2020. That's what Alex Newman is referring to in this 21 interview. That Oregon is their following Dewey's example. And so what just happened a couple of weeks ago is Oregon took her executive order and then they made a law. They signed a bill. That it is it's law. Now it's not just executive order. It is law. The Democrats. In the state house in the state Senate, along with one. Rhino Republican who knows where his head is at. And they they passed this law that they were going to suspend. They're only going to suspend it for three years. Dean. It's it's fine. I mean, they had to do this. They had to suspend it. So they could properly look at the requirements to see if they were too tough or not. Ultimately. And you know, the representative from from the governor's office said, essentially that, you know, the assessment is unfair. These proficiency requirements, they're unfair. Because children of color cannot do it. They can't do it. They just can't do it. They're not smart enough. Are we are we are we paying attention? I hope we are. I really do. I hope we are. I know this audience is. I know this audience is paying attention. We we are we are living this. We are watching this in real time. We're watching this unfold in real time. So people in Oregon, the question here is. What what are your plans? What are your plans to to offset this? You have some decisions to make. You can you can pull out of the public schools and droves. You can find yourself a homeschool co op. If you want to if you want to find a classical Christian school, if you live in Oregon and you want to find a classical Christian school, reach out to me. I will pull up the database and we will talk through it. You want to find a homeschool co op. Reach out to me. We will help you along if that's if that's the route you want to take. But what if you can't? What if you can't homeschool or you know what? What if what if you can't afford Christian school or private school? I get it. All of these issues are real. These are these are real time issues. I understand it. What is the option? The option is to is to fight it. How do we fight it? We fight it at the school board level. We show up. We show up. We show up. Maybe we get a recall petition going for this governor and every single Democrat who signed off on this ridiculous law, because they want your children leaving high school. Stupid. They want that they want them leaving stupid. They want them. They don't want them to read right. And do math. That's for sure. Newman pointed to the national on back to the article. Newman pointed to national assessment of educational progress data, which shows that less than a third of public school students are proficient in reading, writing arithmetic or any other core subject. A third of public school students. 33%. Less than a third are proficient. So that means. 66% of our public school students. Are not proficient. In reading, writing, math. Science. History. They have no idea what's going on. Mark burliner professor at Emory University wrote in his book that on history exam on the history exam of the 2001 national assessment of educational progress. So this is 2001. This is 20 years ago. 57% of students scored below basic. Only 1% achieved an advanced score. 50. This is 2001 mind you 57% scored below basic. John Taylor Godo, a senior teacher and educational researcher in New York City said in his book. Pick up a fifth grade math or rhetoric textbook from 1850. And you'll see that the text were pitched then on what would today be considered a college level and we talked about that. I gave you the mental math. I, you know what? I, I just, I mean, just for the sake of fun. If you missed the last two days because I've given you this mental math question for two days now. Here it is on day three. This is from an elementary math problem. 1877. And the kids had to do this problem in their head. They couldn't use pencil. They couldn't use paper. They had to do it in their head. On a farm, there are 60 animals. All right, that's, that's easy enough. I got 60 animals in my head. Horses cows and sheep. Okay, I'm with you. For each horse, there are three cows. For each cow. There are two sheep. How many animals of each kind on your mark get set. Go. Do it in your head. Do the math in your head. This was expected of elementary students in 1877. And I've been putting this out there for two days out today's day three. For three days now I've been putting this math problem out there. Time yourself. See if you can do this in your head in 10 minutes. 30 minutes an hour. Can you do it at all? That's the, that's the question. Okay, here's another one. A boat worth 864 dollars. Of which eighth of it belonged to a quarter of it belonged to be. And the rest belong to see. But the boat was lost. What loss did each sustain. The boat having been insured for $500. Do that math problem in your head because this was expected of our elementary students in 1877. This is what we're talking about here. This is what John Taylor Godo. A senior teacher in New York City. Said you go ahead pick up a textbook from 1850s. And what our fifth graders were learning would be considered college level now. It's college level. This is college level thinking. And college students can't do it. I mean, I shouldn't say that because I'm not asked a college student. But I, it's my prediction. I don't, you know, that's my prediction. They can't handle it. Absolutely cannot handle it. Thomas soul and American scholar and senior fellow of the Hoover Institute at Stanford observed the following. It is not merely that Johnny can't read or even that Johnny can't think. Johnny doesn't know what thinking is because thinking is so often confused with feeling in many public schools. So soul is referencing a book entitled Johnny can't read. This, this comes from. Or it was called why Johnny can't read it's 1955. The author was a man by the name of flesh. F L E S C H. And he, he wrote this, this book really in response to the. The change in our phonics system. And again, we have John Dewey really took to think for this. There was a. A reverend in the 1830s who developed. Ultimately a way to speak to deaf people and it was. It was to take words whole words and, and to have signs for them. So since, since the deaf have no conception of a spoken language. They could not learn a phonetic or sound symbol system of reading. And that's how we taught our children. We taught them phonetics. We didn't teach them words. We taught them the individual sound that letters and combined letters make. And that's how we taught them how to read. Deaf students, this, this doesn't work because they can't hear. So instead they were taught to read by a purely site method consisting of pictures juxtaposed with whole words. Thus the whole word was seen to represent an idea or image. Not the sounds of the language. The written word itself was regarded as a little picture much like. You know how it is in the Chinese language. In 1837. The Boston primary school committee. Decided to adopt this, this type of reading. By 1844 the results were so disastrous that a group of Boston school masters published a blistering attack on the whole word method. And it was thrown out of the schools. They thought, Hey, let's try this. I mean it. You know, we'll just give it a shot. 1837. They incorporate it. They run it for seven years. By 1844 the results are disastrous. The kids are certainly not reading any better. They're reading is atrocious. They offer this blistering attack and they throw it out. And it was called the look say method, because you would look at a word and then you would say the word. The look say was kept alive, however, in new state schools, where it was taught as a legitimate alternative to the alphabetic phonics method. So progressives got ahold of this idea. Progressives like John Dewey, who felt like, you know, we don't really need to teach our kids to read and write and do math. Why don't we teach them the whole word method. And let's not teach phonics. You know, this is how I was, I was taught, you know, see dick run, see Jane, you know, you do whatever and you would. You learn the words. I learned words instead of phonics. And I'm worse because of that. I can tell you that right now. So in 1955. Robert Fleisch writes this book, why Johnny can't read. And here's what he says. The teaching of reading, all. All over the United States and all the schools and all the textbooks is totally wrong. And flies in the face of all logic and common sense. It is a foolproof system. All right. Every grade school teacher in the country has to go to a teachers college or school of education. Every teachers college gives at least one course on how to teach reading. Every course on how to teach reading is based on a textbook. Every one of those textbooks is written by one of the high priests of the word method. The old days it was impossible to keep a good teacher from following your own common sense, practical knowledge. Today, the phonetic system of teaching reading is kept out of our schools as effectively as if we had a dictatorship with the all powerful ministry of education. Because our teachers have to go to teachers colleges where they are learned how to use whole word and not phonetics. This was in the 1950s. Oh boy, I know it. I know what our heads are spinning. It's a lot to take in. We're going to take a break because some of you might need to take a deep breath. We'll pick it up on the other side.

And this topic is upsetting. It is. It just, it just makes me angry. You know, when we go back through history and we see how things were changed, we, you know, a classical education at Waterbrook Christian Academy, we teach our students to read by using phonics. Because it's the way we used to do things. A classical education goes back to the way we used to do things. And this is why classical education is on the rise. I've got an article here in my stack of stuff, which just talks about the explosion of classical education. And I am a firm believer in it. I think if you can find yourself a classical Christian school. And if you can't find the classical Christian school, find a classical charter school. It's better than nothing. But ultimately, if you could get a classical Christian school, you're going to really get the best of everything. And my opinion and my humble opinion. So phonics was ordered. It was something that the progressives did not want. John Dewey did not want phonics to be taught because he, he believed it. We don't really need to teach the students how to read, write and do math. Let's just, let's just socialize them. Let's get them acting how we want them to act. And there was this whole word method. Of reading that was used for, for deaf children, because they could not hear phonetically. So they would look at the word and it would be juxtaposed to a symbol. And this was adopted in our public schools. This whole idea of what they called word say, the word say method. Rudolph flesh, that's his name, Rudolph in 1955 writes this book called Why Johnny Can't Read. And, you know, he talks about it. He basically calls out this word word, say method. And then he explains how it's been happening and that this is how new teachers coming into the system are being taught. Because who took over the colleges and the universities, the progressive left. And so now they're teaching the new, the new teachers who are then going to go into into K-12 schools. So in this textbook, he, you know, he calls them out or not in textbook and this book that he's written. This is a portion of the book. He says it's a foolproof system. All right. You know, this whole system of word say and that it's being, it's being taught to the new teachers so then they can teach it. And he uses some interesting language here. He says every course on how to teach a reading is based on a textbook. Every one of those textbooks is written by one of the high priests of the word method. And the old days it was impossible that keep a good teacher from following your own common sense and practical knowledge. Today, the phonetic system of teaching reading is kept out of our schools as effectively as if we had a dictatorship with an all powerful ministry of education. Yeah, he is spot on. He, he, he is, he's spot on. The educators were furious with him. He made them appear and look stupid and incompetent. You know, at this point in time Dewey and his disciples are dead and gone, but their disciples are still alive and well. A gentleman by the name of Arthur Gates at Columbia and William Scott Gray at the University of Chicago because ultimately that's where Dewey went. He went to the University of Chicago, which by the way is a cesspool. All right, that's just my own sidebar. William Scott Gray at the University of Chicago and Arthur Gates at Columbia. They were determined to carry on Dewey's work. The professors of reading organized the International Reading Association, the IRA, to maintain the dominance of Luxay in primary reading instruction. Today, Luxay permeates the educational marketplace so thoroughly and in so many guises and it is so widely and uncritically accepted that it takes expert knowledge by a teacher or parent to know the good from the bad. So, Dr. Flesch wrote a follow up book in 1981 and the follow up book was entitled Why Johnny Still Can't Read. And here's what he wrote. 25 years ago, I studied American methods of teaching reading and warned against educational catastrophe. Now it has happened. So in 1981, he was saying, you know, it's upon us. Educational catastrophe is absolutely upon us. Our kids can't read. Carl Shapiro, 1970, wasn't in the eminent poet professor who taught creative writing for 20 years. This is what he said to his audience. Even these best students have fallen victim to this dumming down process. So this dumming down phrase was even being used in 1970. So we've been watching the dumming down happen literally for decades. So Carl Shapiro says this. What is really distressing is that this generation cannot and does not read. I'm speaking of university students in what are supposed to be our best universities. Their illiteracy is staggering. We are experiencing a literacy breakdown, which is unlike anything I know in the history of letters. And I think case in point is the federalist papers. You know, we have college students complaining. The federalist papers are so hard to read. I've complained about it. I've complained about reading the federalist papers. I'm like, man, this is. But yet farmers in upstate New York were reading the federalist papers in 18 or 1787. 1788, they're reading the federalist papers, which were debating the necessities and the importance of the constitution. And these men are reading that perfectly. And yet we struggle reading the federalist papers. The seniors in our government class at Waterbrook Christian Academy. It's a tough read for us because we're not used to having this kind of reading. We're not used to. To being taught in the way that reading used to be taught. We're not used to seeing these words. We're not used to. You know, we're not used to any of this. Our kids go to college and the professors are complaining because the kids are illiterate. I mean, they can read. Don't get me wrong. But they're illiterate. They can't read well. Dewey and his ilk have succeeded. And dumbing down education. And it's been so gradual. It's been happening really, you know, under the cover of darkness. And now we are to the point. We're in Oregon. They've just decided, let's just throw it all out. We don't need it. I'm telling you parents in Oregon. You have some choices to make you really do. You have some important choices. What are you going to do? Do you leave the public system altogether? I mean, that would that would make a statement, but then you have a place to go. You have to have a place to go. You've got homeschool co-op options. You have private school options and I get it. There's some money in private school. I mean, you have to be able to afford it. But you have some decisions to make. And these are the most important decisions that you are going to make. How your kids are educated is the most important decision that you can possibly make. Yep. Absolutely. I'm going to go back to this article with Alex Newman. I got sidetracked when Thomas Sowell said it's not really that Johnny can't read or even that Johnny can't think. Johnny doesn't know what thinking is and that is in the reference to the book I was diverted to. Because Sowell says thinking is so often confused with feeling in many public schools. And this is what public schools have done. They have succeeded in confusing thinking with feeling. Let's focus on the feelings. How do you feel? You know, that's what this social emotional learning is all about. How do you feel? My feelings were hurt. I mean, I just, oh boy, don't get me started. Charlotte Thompson, I serve it. A former senior policy advisor to the US Department of Education wrote in 1999. Quote, the reason Americans do not understand this war is because it has been fought in secret. And the schools of our nation targeting our children who are captive in classrooms. The wages of the war are using very sophisticated and effective tools. Instead of learning basic skills, children are taught in schools, critical race theory. Children in kindergarten are taught that they may have been born in their own body. And they can take pills or undergo a surgical procedure to reflect their true selves. And so that's where we are. This is the, this is the place that. This is the place that we've come to. The dumbing down of our education is a very real thing and it has been real for decades. It's been real since the 1950s. And even prior. It has been real for maybe a hundred years. And so now we're. We've hit a point where schools already have been in the state of the state. And so now we're. We've hit a point where schools aren't even going to measure. At least in Oregon, they're not going to measure proficiency. In reading, reading and arithmetic. And that's what do we said in the beginning. Let's just socialize. That's all they need. They just need to know how to interact with one another. Ultimately. I mean, they, you know, they just. They just. It's code for. It's code for. It's code for. It's code for. They just need to know how to do what we want them to do. They need to take orders. And they need to be thoroughly confused. They need to be completely confused to the point that they don't even know what gender they are. If we could get them that confused or they don't know what gender they are, then we will have. We will have hit gold, my friends. And it is evil. That they would be confused. And it is evil. That they would want to. You know, we, we send our schools off to a place and we do it, trustingly. We trust the people in charge and we have faith and we believe that they're going to do right by our kids that they're going to teach them. The things that they need to know. And today, the buzzword is we're going to teach them the things that they need to know so they can succeed in a global environment. They can succeed in a global economy. You know, but in 1957, they weren't worried about that, at least not in in Millington, Michigan, the placarered. That we want worthy law-abiding, God-fearing citizens. That was the cause. That was the sacred purpose. That's what that school said. I talked about it in a previous shows. You can go back and find it in the podcast. There's a plaque hanging on the wall. The Millington School District here in Michigan. 1957. The school board makes this declaration that they felt like they had a sacred purpose. And their sacred purpose was to develop worthy law-abiding, God-fearing citizens. And they further went that they felt the sacred purpose was in conjunction with the family and the church. That the three entities together, the school, the family and the church were united in one cause. And that one cause was to develop worthy law-abiding, God-fearing citizens. But the Marxist playbook said, you know, we want to take over education and we've got to do it by taking over teachers' unions. We've got to take over the textbooks. We've got to, you know, take over the colleges so the new teachers can be taught, well, if you want them to be taught. And we just, we saw that example here in terms of phonics. Something as simple as phonics. We're still teaching them how to read. But we're not teaching them how to read well. And therein lies the difference. Oh, they're still getting an education. They're just not learning it well. And that's what they want. That's exactly what they want. They want to have our kids stupid. As I have repeated, they want your, they want little Johnny, little Sally, little Susie to come out of education without an education. To come out of schools, not having been schooled. To come out completely dumb. I can read, but I tell you what I can really do. Yeah, I can, I can do that dance move on. TikTok. That's what I can really do. I'm so good. Watch me. Watch me do this dance move. That's what they want. That's, you know, they don't want them reading the Federalist Papers. I mean, you can try to read the Federalist Papers, but we don't want you to be able to understand it. We want you to lack the understanding of understanding the Federalist Papers. Because then we can get you to lack the understanding to understand the Constitution. And if you don't understand the Constitution, then we've got you. Because then we can take your country. Oh, it just seems like such a large conspiracy theory. I think this has been going on for decades and for decades. Right under our noses. It just seems like, oh, that's a big conspiracy theory. You know how many people would have to be involved in that over how many decades would have to be involved in that for that to actually be a thing. You know, I don't know how many, but I mean, they do. They know how many and they've been pulling it off. They've been pulling it off, right? Yeah. And real time, it's happening in real time right before our very eyes. I am not going to get to the clips I wanted to get to today. I wanted to hear from a lady by the name of Erin Lee. And her story is it's something else. She, her daughter was transitioned. Unbeknownst to her and her husband. And she, she caught it. She caught it early on. And her story is something else. Maybe we'll get to that. Maybe we'll get to that tomorrow. She, she just goes into such detail and she's out there. She's out there fighting the fight. After what happened to her daughter. She's out there fighting the fight and her daughter is coming alongside of her. And I really want you to hear her story. So maybe tomorrow we'll be able to, to play those clips and dive into it and earnest. Well, that's all the time we have for today America. I am grateful that you have joined us. Get out there and encourage your friends and family to get on the Dean's list. Let's unite to renovate the image."
