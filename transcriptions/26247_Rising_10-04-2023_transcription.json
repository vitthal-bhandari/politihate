    "text": " Good morning and welcome to Rising. We have a wonderful Monday morning show planned for you all today and it's so wonderful to see Batcha. Angar Sargan. Hello Batcha. Good morning, Robbie. How was your weekend? Mine was very nice. Easter weekend, of course, didn't really actually do very much and was hoping for slightly warmer weather, but, you know, no complaining. No complaints. How was yours? Good, good. I have eaten a lot of matzas, so, you know, very excited for that to pass. Alright, well, what are we talking about on the show today? Well, we've got a big show coming up. Let's get right into it. The Department of Justice has opened an investigation after a trove of top secret defense documents spread on social media last week. The documents, which first appeared on Discord about a month ago, detailed US intelligences extensive spy campaign, even against key allies, including Israel, South Korea and Ukraine. The leaks also reveal the US military's extensive involvement in the day to day logistics of the war in Ukraine, leaving some members of the intelligence community rattled. They say the relative freshness of the documents, some of them are around just a month old, about 40 days old, means that their leaking could have dire consequences on US and NATO operations in Ukraine. According to the Times, quote, while President Biden has barred American troops from firing directly on Russian targets and blocked sending weapons that could reach deep into Russian territory, the documents make clear that a year into the invasion, the United States is heavily entangled in almost everything else. So, Robbie, when I saw this news, I had sort of two main thoughts. My first was, you know, so what does the revelation of this extensive US spying operation deep in the Russian war machine and Russian government and every level of basically the Russian intelligence operations? What does that mean for Evan Gershkovich's release? I mean, you know, another humiliating, humiliating moment for Vladimir Putin. You know, does this make it more or less likely that we can get that Wall Street journalist home? And I just fear that this is not going to be a moment that Putin will be open to negotiations. Of course, this confirms what a lot of us already knew, which was that the US was providing intensive on the ground support, everything from the weapons themselves to coordinating locations within Russia that are going to be targets. So the question, I think, becomes, you know, at what point does Russia view this as, you know, not a Cold War anymore, but a hot war between the US and Russia, which, of course, would be disastrous. Right, really it's confirmation of a lot of things that we kind of, you know, that we suspected we know the US has a vast spying intelligence operation. We know that we deploy that against not just hostile or ostensibly hostile nations like Russia, but we spy on Israel. We spy on our friends too. And they do that to us. That's, you know, the way the modern intelligence world works. But we are seeing, we see from this intelligence, yes, the level of detail and involvement US forces have in planning the Ukrainian war. And, you know, some of these distinctions that are being drawn well, US troops are not specifically supposed to fire on Russian forces or advise on things that would affect the interior of Russia. Like, are these distinctions Putin is going to make? Is he going to say, oh, yeah, yeah, well, the US hasn't declared war on Russia because they're only involved in the X, Y, and Z ways. I don't know. If you look at this, you would, you know, conclude that we're basically, we're assisting, we're sort of directing the Ukrainian resistance, which, like, look, if you think that's appropriate, has Congress authorized that, has Congress, the body of our government that is responsible for declaring war, did they authorize the president to carry out a war against Russia, defensive Ukraine? No, they didn't. So I think it's, it can be confusing on that level. I also just kind of find it frankly interesting that, however, when we don't know exactly how these documents leaked in the first place, it could have been, you know, there are a number of countries we share a lot of intelligence with, Canada, Australia, the UK, etc. It could have been one of those actually, kind of someone there with access to the information who shared it. But it was on Discord for a month before anyone really noticed it, and it became a story that, wow, there's these intelligence documents out there, which I think just goes to show, it's just kind of wild how big the Internet is, that, you know, you could publish something on the Internet in a public place, Discord, a public forum, a platform for discussion, and have it not actually, like, attract the attention of the government or the news media or the people who would say, hey, wait a minute, that's our secret stuff, we don't have anybody seeing that for a month. That's kind of wild. Right, and it's important to note, I think that there are two competing versions of the documents. Pro-Russian sources have shared a version of the documents that has the casualty count for Ukraine and for Russia, but the pro-Russian version appears to have been doctored to have swapped the numbers and make it look like the Ukrainian casualties are much higher. So according to the documents being shared by the, you know, the news media in America, at least, the ones that appear to be the original documents show that Ukraine has had 17 soldiers killed in action compared to Russia's 42,000, I believe, was the number of people. And the casualty numbers, of course, much higher casualty numbers for the Ukraine were somewhere like 170,000, and then for Russia, I think up to 225,000. But in the pro-Russia sources, there's been a doctored version that flips that and has the Ukrainian casualties, you know, somewhere like, you know, 90,000 killed in action, which we don't believe to be the case. So, you know, very interesting and very important to keep an eye on, you know, which of these are verified and which of these are not. I will say another extremely interesting thing that has not gotten a lot of attention is that according to our spying on Israel, it appears that the Mossad was very heavily involved in encouraging and even, you know, instigating these mass protests that we saw against Benjamin Netanyahu's proposed judicial reform against the Supreme Court. And make of that what you will, I assume there's going to now be a big conversation about the deep state in Israel as well because the Mossad historically has never interfered in domestic politics. So that was a really interesting piece of the puzzle. And of course, the South Korean piece. I mean, South Korea is not going to be happy to know, and for the world to know that we were spying on such a close ally. The deep state element of, yeah, the Israeli angle is fasting to see if that country, you know, increasingly has this, the same kind of thing we're seeing here in terms of intelligence officials, national security officials, kind of the government bureaucracy working against the President, which is obviously what a lot of Trump supporters think and can present some credible evidence for, you know, was happening here in terms of, you know, the dissemination of the kind of Russian interference, Russian collusion narrative that took on social media that was really pushed by people in the FBI and national intelligence gathering. A lot of that ended up being overstated, but so deeply affected the discourse in a negative way for the elected President, Donald Trump. So to see that taking, I guess it's not really surprising. I wonder if every country has their version of a, you know, a permanent federal bureaucracy or whatever they call it, working sometimes with counter aims to the elected political officials. It's very, very interesting. And I think troubling, you know, this is not a, this is not a pro-democracy trend, I would say, where a permanent bureaucracy of so-called experts works against the interests of the people actually voted into office by the citizens of the country does not seem like a democracy maximizing the kind of media creatures bought into it, say exactly the opposite, that they're defending democracy by doing this kind of thing from the political appointees. It doesn't make sense to me, but that's the way the narrative breaks on that one. I will also say, I think it's very interesting who, who leaked these documents, right? I mean, in whose interest were these documents leaked? I mean, you know, for people like us who are sort of skeptical of our level of involvement in this and want to see some sort of negotiated, you know, peace settlement, right? Do these, does the leak of this document, the knowledge that we've, you know, acquired from them, does that make that more likely or less likely, right? Which would help us kind of answer who would have done this, right? Who saw this as in their interest? Because you could sort of see both sides of it, right? You know, on the one hand, I think it's not great for Ukraine that, you know, everybody has all of this information about how deeply embedded the U.S. is it's going to force certain questions just like you mentioned, Robbie, about, has Congress authorized this. Of course, unfortunately, they have not done enough to voice, if there is any opposition to it, there's not been much voicing of it that sort of humiliating walk back of the progressive letter. You know, on the other hand, you know, you could, what possibly could the Russian response to this be other than to dig in further, right? I mean, it's not a great moment right now. I mean, so it's just interesting to think about how this complicates our involvement further and what happens next. Yeah, does not seem like something that's going to get us closer to peace, unfortunately. Yeah. All right, we will have radars coming up next. Stay tuned. On Friday, Brianna Joy Gray and guest host Ina Steppmann covered the Mehdi Hassan Mattayevi interview in which they argued about the validity of the Twitter files reporting. Let's watch some of that. You talk a lot about the election integrity project in the Twitter files, which Stanford and the University of Washington founded to monitor attacks on our elections. And you say some stuff about them that a lot of your critics say is not true and that affects your credibility. You said the EIP was founded in response to the government dropping its proposal for disinformation. Governments were there you are. We're quoting you on screen. It wasn't. It was formed two years earlier. You suggest it was government funded, even though during the 2020 election that you're covering, it wasn't. You say they labeled 22 million tweets as misinformation in the run up to the 2020 vote. They didn't. They got they flagged 3000 election misinformation tweets for labeling. So you were only 21,997,000 off. And you also claim the EIP was let me finish the question. You can come back in. You also claim the EIP was partnered with the government's cybersecurity and infrastructure agency, SISA, to censor Twitter. But you mix up SISA, C-I-S-A, a homeland security agency with the Center for Internet Security, the CIS, which is a nonprofit. In fact, you added an A to C-I-S. I think people can see it there in brackets to make that false claim. It's just error after error, Matt, on just this one type. What the other ones aren't? No, 22 million from their own report. Yeah, it came from reporting much to it. Do you know what the 22 million number is, Matt? Can you tell me? Because we checked. 22 million is the number of tweets about election misinformation that were just that they just mapped how many tweets were they? The interview spurred an ongoing Twitter discussion with Taiby, Hassan, and others, particularly around two errors that Medi-Hassan targeted in Taiby's reporting. Taiby actually promptly corrected those. Medi tweeted. My last word on the C-I-S-A, SISA, SISA, Matt, Matt Taiby, this is quoting from Medi-Hassan here. Matt Taiby suggesting a nonprofit was an intel agency to try to prove government collusion censorship wasn't just a typo or minor error. He said it to Congress under oath. It was key to his thesis. Will he be asking Jim Jordan to correct the record? So then the intercepts Lee Fong interjected, and he said, Medi, you obviously haven't read the reporting here. SISA is the DHS agency that partnered with EIP. Here's an email of a SISA employee discussing an EIP ticketed misinfo report to Twitter employees. Matt got it right. Robert, talk us through the SISA. Sure. So SISA is the cyber security, let me head it up, cyber security and infrastructure security agency that is a government agency. The center for internet security is a nonprofit. Both were involved here and I think Matt wrongly tagged SISA when he met SIS in one of the, you call it SISA, then you call the other one, CIS. This is a little confusing. Wrongly tagged one of them. But both were absolutely involved in this kind of flagging of tweets. And this goes to my larger criticism of what Medi Hisan was doing. First of all, Medi Hisan is not a good faith actor on any front. I don't know why Tyve, I'm good on Tyve for even agreeing to do this interview in the first place, but it was hectoring. It was badgering. He talked over him. He didn't let him finish. He didn't let Tyve elaborate on any of his points. He got his team, combed through the Twitter files, and yes, he did find a couple mistakes that Tyve had made. These mistakes are regrettable. I think they have a little bit to do with the format of this thing. Frankly of unrolling the Twitter files on Twitter itself and then on sub stack. If this ran in a magazine like Reason where I work or Newsweek where you work, it would have been an editor would have taken a couple passes at it and you would have caught I think some of those things. That's a legitimate criticism. Don't get me wrong. But it does not at all override what has been shown in this reporting, which is a massive effort, coordinated effort by people who work for the government, journalists, political figures to pressure Twitter on election issues, on COVID and other things. With the Hamilton 68, a fake list of Russian bots where everyone was accused of being a Russian bot and Twitter itself knew this list was inaccurate and felt like they couldn't effectively say anything about it because they weren't under so much tremendous pressure from the media. That's still real. The FBI flagging joke accounts, joke tweets about the election, that still all happened. So I don't know the framing that met like Mediasson, one a couple rhetorical fights. He's also he's the author of a book called win every argument. I guess he wins every argument by just like talking over you or nitpicking a few minor details. Again, that's that's fine. Anti-82 is credit has corrected those things. But the narrative of the now I'm seeing all these mainstream people pretending like the Twitter files has been debunked and there's nothing to it. And there was nothing to see here, which is totally not true. It's just it's completely it's it's a false portrayal of what was done with the Twitter files. Yeah, I mean, I've said it before and I'll say it again. Matt Taibbi is the best journalist, the greatest journalist of his generation and great journalists make mistakes because they take big swings at things. And the sign of whether you're a great journalist or not is not whether you make a mistake, but whether you correct it, which he immediately did. And it is so clear this coordinated attack against him from people like Hassan from people like Debbie Wasserman Schultz, right? This just unbelievably intense reaction to his reporting, which of course stands despite a few errors. You know, it's it's so telling about how important the Twitter files actually was because it revealed, you know, what nobody wanted to admit, which was this, like you said, this coordinated effort by leftist and liberal elites to censor things they didn't like on the Internet in order to protect the American people from thinking their own thoughts and thinking independently about the most important issues of the day. Mm. Journalists Glenn Greenwald weighed in on this discussion citing a March 2023 Pew Research Survey showing that a majority of Democrats approve of the FBI CIA and the DOJ, while Republicans disapprove. That's a shift that has occurred over the last several years. Greenwald tweeted, the reason liberal journalists are so bent on maligning Taiby and the Twitter files is because they showed FBI, CIA and DHS are working to censor the Internet. They're not rising against Taiby, but in defense of those agencies, which polls show their audiences love. Their audiences love them. They invite people who worked for those agencies on as guests all the time, in particular to disseminate the Russian collusion narrative, the idea that Donald Trump won the incorrect idea that Donald Trump won because of the prevalence of Russian sympathetic accounts, many of which were fake or planned by the Russian government on social media, that that was what swung the election. That became the popular mainstream narrative for processing the 2016 election after the election. And in 2017 and 2018, there was just a crescendo of voices talking about on cable news and in respectable mainstream outlets saying that this was all, this was social media, particularly honestly, Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, not taking this issue seriously enough, is how we got Trump. And since then, we've had so much good reporting that totally undermines that, that shows that the influence was not nearly as widespread or pernicious as people made it out to be. Accounts that were accused of being Russian are actually just real people with real, like they actually like Trump. Sorry, it's not everyone who says I like Trump, is because you're like a Russian robot or something. That idea, I think, is being defeated. But there was no accountability for the people, including very senior commentators like Medi Hisan on MSNBC and other places. And I think he's tried to say that he never had much to say about Russia gate. And then I think people have shown, well, that's not true. Here are examples of you accusing various people of being succumbing to Russian influence. So that channel was really responsible for that narrative taking hold, and there has been no accountability for that. So that's a difference here, I think. Taibi, great, you got him on a couple things. He's admitted and corrected those, does not take down the overall idea. Sadly for them, they want to take down the idea that federal bureaucrats and the media had a bad, negative speech crushing influence on social media. They want to make you forget that or say, maybe we were wrong about that. But no, it's true, it happened, we have the receipts, we've seen it, we should not forget about it. And Matt Taibi was one of the few who knew that Russia gate was a hoax from the beginning. And so it's like, they can't forgive him for that, right? Everybody else was getting this wrong and jumping on the bandwagon in order to get cable TV hits. And he knew from the beginning that it was wrong. And he knew that because he's a great journalist. And that's also why he went on many as on show. I mean, he knew what it was going to be like. He knows who this person is and what his character is. And he still went on because he felt that that was the, what seems like he felt that that was the right thing to do as a journalist to defend his work. So I just think that he really comes out of this, the victim, I mean, badgering somebody over two, these are tiny mistakes. I'm sorry. And then the majority of the Twitter files, extremely important reporting, you know, whatever, you know, you and I have debated about like the level, does it rise to the level first amendment? Those are really important debates to have. But you cannot, I mean, this is one of the big stories of the year. And Matt Taibi got it because he is, like I said, and I'm going to say it, one of the things that he's been doing. And then one more time, the greatest journalist of his generation. Well, there were some additional developments with Taibi, Twitter and Elon Musk that we're going to talk about a little bit later in the show. So stay tuned for that. More rising right after this. Robbie, what's on your radar? Well, Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit against Fox News is headed to a jury trial later this month following a decision at the end of March, which a judge ruled that the case should survive Fox's motion to dismiss. Quote, the evidence developed in this civil proceeding, Judge Eric M. Davis wrote, demonstrates that it is crystal clear that none of the statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true. Now, the judge is correct about that and it's worth repeating. Claims that Joe Biden stole the election from Donald Trump via Dominion Voting Machines or any other conspiracy theory are false. Biden was the legitimate winner of the 2020 election in the various claims put forward by Trump and his surrogates, Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, etc., amounted to nothing. There is no evidence of those claims and conservatives who took them seriously made a big mistake. But in a society that values the free exchange of ideas, the proper response to bad speech is to counter it with good speech. Dominion has every right to set the record straight and I understand, given all the lies spread by Trump and Powell and Giuliani, why the company would want to hold those people accountable. But Dominion isn't just suing those people, it's also suing Fox News, the media company that interviewed Powell and Giuliani and others, inviting them on their programs to make their arguments. Now, were some Fox hosts too credulous of the stolen election claims, especially Lou Dobbs, whose show was canceled and it was effectively fired? Sure, would it have served them and their audience well to push back more aggressively? Yes, although I would note that Tucker Carlson, after giving Sidney Powell every opportunity to present her case, totally eviscerated her evidence-free claims. Let's watch. We simply wanted to see the details, how could you not want to see them? So we invited Sidney Powell on this show, we would have given her the whole hour, we would have given her the entire week actually, and listened quietly the whole time at wrapped attention. That's a big story. But she never sent us any evidence, despite a lot of requests, polite requests, not a page. When we kept pressing, she got angry and told us to stop contacting her. When we checked with others around the Trump campaign, people in positions of authority, they told us, Powell has never given them any evidence either. In order to provide any today at the press conference, Powell did say that electronic voting is dangerous, and she's right, we're with her there. But she never demonstrated that a single actual vote was moved illegitimately by software from one candidate to another, not one. So why are we telling you this? We're telling you this because it's true, and in the end that's all that matters, the truth. It's our only hope, it's our best defense. Now, viewers can make up their own minds about whether various hosts took too long to effectively respond to the election fraud claims, which again, I want to be crystal clear, are false claims. What Rudy Giuliani said was false, what Sidney Powell said was false, what Donald Trump said was false. But okay, maybe just sue those people because it's the work of journalists of news programs to cover the news, to interview people, even if they're saying really provocative and far out things. You don't have to think the way Fox handled this subject was perfect, I certainly don't, but as someone who hosts a news show and interviews controversial people, people like Seymour Hirsch, who in the mainstream media is desperate to discredit, I'm worried about the precedent being established here, that the platform, the news show, could be liable for defamation if it does not scrutinize its interview subjects in the exact manner that the targets of those interview subjects would ideally like. If the news organization can be held liable for something a guest says, the guest isn't able to offer ironclad proof, how would that effect say this shows on reporting on Nord Stream, how would it affect coverage of COVID, a subject on which many people, even experts, passionately disagree about the implications of the available evidence? How would it affect reporting on potential criminal misdewings by powerful people, like former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, Jeffrey Epstein? Now Dominion is seeking $1.6 billion in its lawsuit, and let's say Fox can pay that, no problem. But what signal does it send? What about the next lawsuit from someone who's mad about which guests a media company had on to discuss an issue? Maybe the next target isn't as big and powerful as Fox, maybe it has a settlement without fighting it out in court. We should be really worried about the potential chilling effect here. The First Amendment offers a robust protection of free speech because we recognize that unfettered speech is vital for a democracy. That includes the right to occasionally get things wrong and to explore ideas that don't pan out. If the punishment for doing so is too great, people, journalists, we'll be too afraid to ask dangerous questions. Will that make us better off? I don't think so. I don't think that's the country we want to live in. So I've been wanting to weigh in on this for a while, not because I'm sympathetic at all to those ridiculous claims which are all false. I'm not sympathetic to the people who made them, Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump. But I don't like this trend of trying to do indict an entire news organization and all the journalists that work there. When I think having provocative discussions is important, the freedom to do that without risking massive financial loss is my mind important for American democracy, important for the principles of free speech. And this case threatens to upset the balance that allows people to say provocative, questioning, important, challenging things, not necessarily even because the details here, but because this pushes the envelope so that the next time it's a little harder to speak and to dissent and to discuss. That's what I'm worried will happen if there's a massive verdict in Dominion's favors, even though I totally agree that they were maligned by the individuals I've mentioned. Yeah, I mean, if someone is hired by the president to do something, the fact that you don't like it doesn't make it not news, right? And so what's effectively happening here is Fox is being punished for the fact that its viewers and perhaps some of its hosts wanted this to be true, right? It's not for the fact that they spoke about it, it's that they didn't speak about it in a Condemni enough terms, right? Because clearly it met the bar of being of interest to the public, right? I mean, clearly this was something that was newsworthy that was happening in our nation. Like you, I don't think that it's true. I don't think the election was stolen. But the president believed it, right? And that made it newsworthy. And so they're being punished for the fact that, you know, their audience wanted this to be true and that they spoke about news that the left knew was false and was right was false, that their audience wanted to be true and that they gave a platform. And that is just, that's just like my policing your mind, right? Like that's policing, you know, we don't believe in that in this society, right? And I could not agree with you more. The free press, right? One of the hallmarks of a free society in a democracy is so important. In fact, the Supreme Court ruled on this very issue in Sullivan v. New York Times, right? I mean, this is a ready law. So it's really just, I think in a 10, they know they're not going to win. It's an attempt to humiliate Fox News and punish them for their success. And the reason they're successful is because they don't insult their viewers. So I mean, it's, I am so glad you spoke about this and so eloquently and that clip of Tucker taking down the Sidney Powell claims. People have just memory hold that. I mean, they just act like that didn't happen. But there was a lot of skepticism voiced. I mean, I think Tucker did it, did the best job of it. And he did the best job of it. And it was very courageous because his audience didn't want to hear that from him, right? And he still said it. So I agree with you. Yeah, that was probably no segment more important than that one for setting the record straight among conservative voters and Trump supporters. And I just, I think it's so dangerous to get to the place where, because we interview people on the show. I don't always agree with them. Often I don't agree with them. And you're going to go out. You're going to, basically the theory of this lawsuit is to associate the guess views with my own because I didn't make, I wouldn't have made my views clear enough in a way the person suing the guess would think I should. Like that gets into some very dicey, really dicey waters. 100%. But if enforced would put us in a place where we could not, we could not run our show the way we want to. We could not have the interesting conversations that our audience demands and that we want to have as professional journalists. Right. And I'll just make one more quick point, which is that, you know, there is a debate among journalists when you're interviewing somebody deplorable, right? You know, what you're, obviously your job is to fact check them. Obviously you don't want to just give them free rein, right? But how combative the interview should be, how much you should let them hang themselves versus how much you should intervene to tell the audience, oh, this is right, this is right. This is not right. Those are journalistic questions. Those should not be legal questions. But this lawsuit is setting up a precedent where if you want to avoid getting sued for billions of dollars, the law somehow gets to decide those questions. That's very dangerous. I'm not, I'm not willing to see that conversation to the law. That's a journalistic and editorial conversation. 100%. And that's what's really at stake here. Honestly, it's free speech itself. So we will continue to follow that lawsuit with great interest and concern and we'll have more rising right after this. Pachio, what's on your radar? Last week, Chicago voters went to the polls to vote for their mayor in a runoff election that followed the ouster of Mayor Lori Lightfoot after just one term. Lightfoot is the first Chicago mayor to lose reelection since 1983 and many saw her shocking loss as a referendum on rising crime. Crime in Chicago was up by 20% over the last five years between 2021 and 2022. Crime increased by 41% with theft, carjacking and homicides all up since 2019. Lightfoot's miserable showing a third place, winning just 17% of the vote was viewed by many as a reflection of her inability to protect the residents of Chicago. Especially its south and west side areas where gang violence is rampant. Chicago's largely white north side on the other hand is as safe as it's been in a generation. But the surprises were not over yet. The man who won the runoff last week, Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, ran to the left of Lightfoot in the initial election and initially supported the defund the police platform, though he later recanted. He campaigned on raising taxes to support mental health resources, education and housing and had the endorsement of Chicago's teachers union. Meanwhile, his competitor Paul Valis, also a Democrat though a moderate one, ran a tough on crime campaign that netted him the endorsement of the police union. And it was he who took first place in the initial election, coming away with 33% of the vote, a massive 13 point lead over Johnson's 20%. But Johnson managed to close that lead and then some finishing with a 2 point lead of 51% to Valis's 49%. Though it's important to note that just 35% of the city's residents voted in the runoff. Still, it is notable that faced with the choice between a defund the police candidate and one who had the backing of the Chicago police department, one third of the voters of a city experiencing the deadliest period in a quarter of a century went for the defund guy. Not just that, Chicago is a deeply segregated city and the crime is heavily concentrated in poor black and Hispanic neighborhoods. And irony of ironies, the area's hardest hit by violence voted overwhelmingly for Johnson as the Chicago Tribune reporter Jake Sheridan pointed out on Twitter. Johnson seems to have gotten many of Lightfoot's voters, particularly her black voters. A W.B.E.Z. analysis of the first round of voting found that the voters who initially picked both Valis and Johnson over Lightfoot lived in Chicago's safest neighborhoods and were more likely to be quote white college educated employed living in households earning more than $100,000 a year and sending their children to private schools. Johnson kept many of those voters. He did well in the upscale areas like Hyde Park and Logan Square. But voters in black neighborhoods seem to have played a decisive role in picking Chicago's next mayor. And despite being disproportionately targeted as the victims of violent crime, they went for the guy least likely to target criminals by something like a 27% margin, polling from March found that 55% of black Chicagoans favored Johnson as opposed to just 28% who wanted Valis. What gives? For starters, 46% of registered black voters hadn't been contacted by either campaign. Moreover, while 50% of black voters said reducing crime was the most important issue, 30% listed police reform as the second most important issue for them. The winning message seems to be the one Eric Adams himself a former cop successfully ran on to beat two progressives in New York two years ago. We have to have zero tolerance for violence, whether it's committed by criminals or by cops. Here to help us unravel further, what's the matter with Chicago is Raphael Manuel, head of research for the policing and public safety initiative at the Manhattan Institute. Thank you so much for joining us, Ralph. It's so great to have you. So I think a lot of progressives are probably looking at this data and scoffing at people like me who say that, you know, progressive policies hurt the people they claim to represent most and last. And laughing at me and saying, you see, this is what they actually want. They want defund the police. They want, you know, to revert resources from cops and from policing towards, you know, mental health and housing, et cetera, et cetera. Are they right? Not quite. I think they're partially right in so far as a, you know, a meaningful number of voters in the precincts, most affected by crime, did pull the lever for Johnson. It's not clear, however, that they did that on the basis of what he was saying about his approach to crime or public safety or disorder. The other thing that I think a lot of these analyses ignore is probably one of the most important things, and that is the voter turnout numbers. I mean, you know, the maps of who went for which precincts went for Johnson, which precincts went for Valis, you know, are instructive as far as they go. But one of the things that they don't tell us and that they don't show is who actually participated if you're looking at the pool of eligible voters. And the other thing that you find is that in the areas most affected by crime, that is the South and West side precincts with the highest homicide rates, highest assault rates. Those are the areas in which you saw the lowest levels of voter turnout in the city. You know, looking at levels of between 13 and 20% of eligible voters turning out to participate in that election, compared to, you know, upwards of 20% of eligible voters turning out to participate in that election. Compared to, you know, upwards of 25 to 35% in some of the other parts of the city on the north side. I do want to correct something though that you said in your lead up to this, which is that, you know, yes, north side precincts are generally safe, especially compared to the South and West side. There's no question about that. However, those precincts have seen a really significant increase in serious crime and disorder in parts of the city where that was kind of unheard of, not that long ago. I mean, I've lived in Chicago from 2012 to 2015. We did not have the number of shootings that you have seen along the magnificent mile and in, you know, the Gold Coast and, you know, on North Rush Street in places where violence was was not a very common thing to see. So I do think that the deterioration of order on the subways in Chicago of order on the streets and some of the more densely populated shopping districts has certainly shocked the conscience of people. Who were able to kind of live in their bubbles up until recently, which probably explains, you know, the higher level of interest in this race in some of those precincts. But one of the things that I think we have to deal with is that residents living in the South and West side enclaves that have been struggling with elevated crime levels for a really long time just no longer see these political races, at least the mayoral race, as a meaningful way to address that. I mean, and it's hard to blame them for that view. I mean, you know, for one thing, Kim Fox had already won re-election. And, you know, I think if you're taking a sober look at who actually impacts the, you know, the situation on the ground with respect to public safety the most, I think, you know, there's a good argument to be made that the DA in that district has way more power than the Chicago mayor will. I mean, she gets to decide who gets charged, what they get charged with, what kind of punishments is her office going to pursue. All of these things are going to have a real impact and that race had already been decided. So, you know, it's not crazy to me that other issues ended up overtaking the overall decision for some of the voters living in those districts most affected by crime. What, you know, what should be done? You know, what hasn't has to happen? I get to connect in voters, my, the voters who are worried about crime to connect it to a certain political choice. I mean, yeah, I mean, it's, you know, it's one Democrat or the other Democrat, right? The reality in Chicago. There's going to be some level of continuity between the approach to crime and other things. You know, what needs to be, what do advocates need to do to bring voters into the fold in making that issue matter? Yeah, I mean, as I said in my pre-election piece, leading up to the final vote in the runoff, I think, you know, this is, you know, I kind of predicted that Johnson was going to win, in part because if you looked at the pool of undecided voters, they shared a lot more characteristics with the sort of prototypical Johnson voter than they did with the ballast voter. And one of the things that I said at the end of that piece was that I think the message here is that, you know, folks like me who are relatively skeptical of the criminal justice reform movement need to be able to do that. And so, I think the other thing that I think is that the Republican Party's political reform movement need to do a better job of connecting the dots for the everyday voters so that they can better understand, you know, how these policy positions are going to ultimately impact crime on the ground. Yeah, that's, that's a really hard thing to do. It's an uphill battle in part because things are already so bad. I mean, you know, we saw a significant increase in the level of serious violent crime in Chicago over the last couple of years. And so, you know, when you're talking about parts of the city that have long been home to significantly elevated levels of concentrated violence, you know, I think it's you're facing an uphill battle when the task is convincing them that, you know, simply participating in an election is going to make a meaningful difference. You know, and so I do think it's on people like me to just continue to make that case and marshal the evidence to connect those dots because I do think that that argument is the winning one. What I don't want to see is for cities like Chicago to have to deteriorate even further before people finally try the thing that they hadn't been willing to try. What about this question of police reform? I mean, I do think that, you know, Heather McDonald's data is very compelling. You know, she makes that argument that, of course, they're going to be more negative interactions between cops and people if they're just more overall interactions and they're going to be more overall interactions in an area that's plagued by crime, right? I find that very convincing. At the same time, you know, people who do have these encounters with the cops routinely and do see police reform, right? You know, 30% as the second most important issue. Do you think that should be part of even a tough on crime messaging in order to convince people that it's safe for them to go with the tough on crime candidate? Absolutely. I mean, you know, I do think that we've kind of reached some points in which the debate about public safety becomes unproductive in the following respect, which is that you draw this binary between people who are quote unquote tough on crime and people who are soft on crime. And one of the things that I try to make clear in the way that I speak about these issues is that you don't have, it's not an either or you can have both ends, right? So the idea that we need to be drag net in our approach to law enforcement, for example, is something that I've rejected. I've long argued that whether we're talking about incarceration or proactive policing, you can actually be very, very precise, you know, in using those tools more like a scalpel than a hammer by using data and deploying resources to the places most affected and doing the kind of statistical and social network analyses that will help you to identify who the main drivers of crime are in a given jurisdiction so that you can marshal your resources to going after those people without or at least having minimal effect on the vast majority of the population, which of course is law abiding even in the most dangerous parts of that city or any city. And so, you know, drawing these bits of nuance out in the debate as it progresses moving forward, I think is going to be really, really important for folks who are on kind of my side of the issue. And that is to say folks who see traditional institutions of law enforcement, you know, police, prosecutors, corrections officials as necessarily playing a central role in any crime fighting plan that is going to have a snowball chance in Miami of succeeding. And so, yeah, I do think that that's been a problem, but it's a hard problem to fight against because one of the things that we have to deal with is that in the age of social media where everyone has a smartphone and where you can make something go viral and around the world in a matter of seconds, you know, you're going to be able to pick out one outrageous incident, you know, for every day of the year, but in a country of 330 somehow a million people, that doesn't mean that those things are common, but it's very easy to create that perception. And that's something that I think, you know, folks on our side of the debate, I've had a really hard time with in terms of pushing back on that. And so, you know, I'm not really sure where things go from here. I, you know, I do worry about the future Chicago. I worry about the future of cities like, you know, Philadelphia and Baltimore and Louisville and, you know, lots of the other places in America that are struggling with really vastly deteriorating levels of public safety. You know, what we do about that, I think, is the same answer that we had in the late 1980s and into the mid 1990s, which has continued to make the case use data and show and prove, right? I mean, in the parts of the country where, you know, these decisions are actually made to go with the tougher approach, the, you know, the more sane approach is, I like to call it. You know, we have to be able to have a record of success. You know, why that is is because I think the history of the crime decline is no longer as compelling to people, in part because a lot of the people pulling levers and gluing loose today just weren't around for that. Rafael, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you, Batcha, for your radar. More rising after this. After months of international investigations into who blew up the Nord Stream pipelines, much speculation remains about the culprit, whether it was Russia, a pro-Ukraine group, the U.S., or another power, according to a New York Times report published Friday, suggest a quote, maybe in no one's interest to reveal more. In its latest report on the sabotage, the Times spoke to a Danish commanding officer who said digging into it could fuel mistrust, adding, quote, there are strategic reasons for not revealing who did it, as long as they don't come out with anything substantial, then we are left in the dark on all this, as it should be. Journalist Glenn Greenwald zeroed in on this part of the piece, tweeting, quote, the New York Times after feeding the public several BS versions of who blew up the Nord Stream and environmentally devastating act of industrial terrorism now announces it may be in no one's interest to reveal more. He followed up by pointing out the Times piece may offer a clue, and not only that, but U.S. diplomat Victoria Newland's testimony in a January hearing in the Senate could be one too. Let's watch that. Senator Cruz, like you, I am, and I think the administration is very gratified to know that Nord Stream 2 is now, as you like to say, a hunk of metal at the bottom of the sea. So you can't say it's in no one's best interest to know. It's to not know. It's in the best interest of the responsible party, not to know. So is that a tacit admission that the responsible party is someone, you know, aligned with the Ukrainian side of this? If Western officials, U.S. officials keep saying, we don't want to know more. You can't handle the truth. That suggests there's some blame there, right? Right. You know, I initially felt that it was unlikely to be the U.S. only because I think President Biden has been struggling with the price of gas. But you know, I've been talking to people in the industry and they don't think it would have influenced that. So I sort of want to walk back that that skepticism a little bit. I think it's really important to point out that Newland was the one who revealed that the U.S. had, you know, invested $5 billion to bring about a certain price. And that the most secure and prosperous and democratic Ukraine after the Maidan Revolution, right? Which sort of, you know, made it seem like potentially one of our, you know, regime change instances. And she was also, there was a leaked transcript of a phone call she had with the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine in which they were talking about who should and shouldn't be in the next Ukrainian government and talking about who they would be in the U.S. best interest to have elected there. So, you know, she's really one of these people who's very much associated with the U.S. attempts to turn Ukraine into a U.S. client state, right? Which is something that Russia has seen as a very aggressive move on our part. And many people feel that this was one of the reasons that Putin felt that, you know, the invasion was necessary. Now, of course, I don't support the invasion, the bloodshed. You know, I don't think that this was justified, but at the same time, you know, for the person who is so heavily identified with U.S. overreach in Ukraine to be coming out and weighing in on this and saying how glad she is, you know, that Nord Stream was destroyed. It really, it doesn't look good to say the least. It reminds me of the Hillary Clinton line about Gaddafi. The we came, we saw, he died, that whole thing, you know, where she kind of glibly is happy about that outcome. It was a barbaric, horrible outcome for the leader of Libya that did not then result in Libya becoming a nicer place, right? Then ISIS was ran rushed out of the country. There were executions. It was, you know, civil war resulted. It's kind of that. Like, let's be careful about applauding wholesale destruction. Look, I get that like you, I am totally unsympathetic to Russia and what Russia is doing in the course of this war, but we are not at war with Russia. Congress did not authorize against a war against Russia, did not apparently have any knowledge about what happened with Nord Stream. So maybe it didn't happen, the way that Seymour Hersh has laid out and we've interviewed him on the show. I think he, you know, makes a compelling case, but we have not seen the documents or had the conversations that he had. Obviously, he can't explain who his sources are, so I can't, you know, cosign it without seeing it. But I think there's a lot of, I would have a lot of suspicion about, if not US officials, then Ukrainian officials who have shown that, you know, they can pull off all mannerity. They, you know, they pulled off, they blown up bridges. They allegedly probably pulled off an assassination within Russia itself. That, I think, speaks to them having more capabilities or more capacity than a lot of experts expected to anticipate it of them at the beginning. And, you know, they're obviously the party in this dispute with the most, you know, with the most upside or the most to gain and the most to lose since they're, you know, they're in the process of being invaded. They can't afford to play it safe, I would say. So that's kind of where my suspicions are pointing at this juncture. Now, was that with what level of US involvement, understanding knowledge, would that action have theoretically happened? I don't know. It could be a high level of coordination or knowledge. It could have been a kind of, a, we're doing this, maybe, you know, burn after reading kind of scenario. But that's where I would be looking to find out information. And we want to know, we should know, we deserve to know this whole, we'd be better off not knowing. That's the attitude of the deep state, of the national security establishment, people who want to hide from you things that they're ashamed of, because they don't think you'll agree with them. They don't think the citizens would authorize it. That's a terrible way to govern, just terrible. Yeah, I mean, obviously many people want to know what happened there. And we should keep pushing for more information about that. I agree with you. I think the most likely culprit is some, you know, Ukraine entity that was got a very heavy assist from an extremely sophisticated intel organization, be it the US, be it the UK. We just don't know yet. We don't know yet. But I agree with you that, you know, who stands to benefit the most from this is clearly Ukraine. The idea that Russia would have done this, I think, is just preposterous. And I, but, but yes, don't tell us that we might either. No, like no one, like even the people who don't want to pin blame on the US in the mainstream media in places like the New York Times, we keep citing their stories, they're not saying it's Russia anymore. They were quick to point the figure at Russia, but nobody's trying to make that case because as you said, it's not, there's just nothing to it. There's no evidence of it and it's not something in their interest. So that is, I think that's a, I think that's a really important kind of the narrative changing in real time. It's important to know when that happens and why it happens. Russia did it is no longer the narrative that, that the media and the people they, you know, rely on for sources in the administration and national security. They don't want you to think, they don't want you to, they know that's not persuasive. They're not trying to persuade you of that anymore. And that's interesting. Right. And I will just say shout out to people like rising and Glenn Greenwald because, you know, there were times in our very recent history where we were told it's in no one's interest to know this, no one's interest to know that. Believe that we have this, believe that we're doing this correctly and there was just nobody, you know, established enough to, you know, say absolutely not like that. No, that's not how it works. The American people have a right to know. And it's, you know, we're living in a golden age of independent media and it's exciting. It's just such a patronizing attitude. I mean, it's the attitude of so many, you know, the kind of spy masters, those sorts of people that, you know, we have to, we have to guard these secrets because you can't handle them. No, no. I'll tell you what's good for me to know. It's good for me to be informed. The citizenry gets to decide these policies. We have to be fully informed so that we can vote for people. Political figures who say they are going to implement the policies that we approve of. It betrays a lack of confidence that what they're doing, the deep state type people, is persuasive and is supported. They probably, they realize it's not. So they have to keep it cloak and dagger. They have to keep it hidden because they don't want you actually voting on it because they're worried that they can't persuade you because a lot of people on all sides of the political spectrum are sick of the kind of the nation building, you know, what happened in the Middle East. That's something, again, people in both parties, both parties, average people don't agree. Think those policies were a huge mistake and don't want to repeat them anywhere across the globe. So, so they, they, you know, they're like, well, we're not going to let people vote on it. We're going to keep quiet what we're doing. And that is, again, a terrible threat to democracy, even though those people are the ones always saying they're defending democracy somehow. We will have more rising right after this. Independent women's forum Spokeswoman and former college swimmer Riley Gaines says that she was attacked and barricaded inside a classroom at San Francisco State University campus last week. This was after she was giving a speech criticizing transgender athletes competing against biological women. Let's take a look. Transcribing! Just here. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. Transcribing! I'm coming. I'm good. I'm good. Tell her to pay us. Tell her to pay us. If she could go. Ten bucks each. I don't know. Question two. That's a very true. Question two. I got paid for this shit so we can get paid for it too. On the public campus that we attend. I swear we've been so much the end goal here. We're cooperating so much next. So, so they need to do their job. We're going to be creating a plan. It's here. I can't speak to all of you when we're over talking to each other. We're not going to let her hold. SFSU released a statement claiming the attack was mostly just students quote peacefully protesting and that it required quote tremendous bravery to confront the speaker. Well, gains appeared on Fox News yesterday to reject the statement. Let's watch. Welcome to both of you. Riley, I'll start with you. Why were you barricaded and what happened to the people who assaulted you? Well, first of all, nothing has happened to the people who assaulted me. The campus police did nothing. The student or the dean of students was there and did nothing. There will be no repercussions unless I have something to do with it. I will be pursuing the Galaxian. These people need to face repercussions and I was barricaded because after my speech and ambush of people entered into the classroom turned off the lights. They attacked me. I got escorted out of the room and immediately pushed into that room that we saw on the video and I was trapped in there for three hours. So incredible story here. So Riley Gaines was speaking. She was able to give her her talk at the campus about, you know, why and she competed against Leah Thomas in swimming events. She was speaking about, you know, why she thinks it's just it's not fair to female athletes to have to compete against transgender women in the arena and swimming and anything. So she was she gave that talk. The student, the activists, the protesters, I believe tried to make a lot of noise, but she was able to talk. And then after they shut off the lights, they chased her. She says she got she got actually punched. She got hit. And then she ended up having to barricade in a room for three hours. We were playing some of that footage. That was like a hostage negotiation. The protesters would not let her leave the room that room that she was barricaded in. And so that was an administrative figure trying to say, what can we do? What could we give you to get you to leave so that she can exit the campus and someone said, like, give us each $10 or something like that. Really horrifying stuff. Obviously San Francisco State University is a public university. That means it has to follow the First Amendment. It is supposed to allow any student group can invite speakers, even controversial speakers, even conservative speakers, even people who disagree with the students on campus. I don't know. I don't even know how many people actually disagree with the views Riley Gaines expressed there, but it's beside the point entirely. She has the right to speak. Really, really disturbing to have an incident like this. She says she was hit twice by a man, not even a transgender woman, but a man. So they have arrived at a situation where their ideology justifies actual men, biological, cisgender men, punching women. And that is justified in the name of protecting trans rights. When your ideology has arrived at a place where it justifies men punching women, there is a sickness afoot. We are regressing as a society. It is so appalling. It's just so appalling that a young woman, a tiny woman, would need an escort of, you know, when she finally was able to leave the campus, you know, six hours later, there was 10 police officers around her because of something she said, which is a view that is shared by 83% of Americans. This is absolutely appalling. I mean, there's just absolutely no justification for what went on there, the violence with which she was greeted from the silence's violence crowd. I mean, they've really turned it on its head, right? It's just so difficult to watch this. This is not a left-right issue. You know, this is a fringe, fringe, fringe ideology that is justifying heinous things in the name of protecting people, most of whom don't even want this kind of a thing. It is really appalling. And I'll just say one more thing, Robbie, which is this is what happens when the great civil rights fights of yesteryear have been fought and won because these kids still have that revolutionary fervor, but they don't know what to do with it because this is an amazing country where most of the time, most of us believe that every person should be treated with dignity. And we agree when that doesn't happen, that it's bad. So they're left over with that fervor of youth and they don't know what to do with it. And this is what they end up doing with it justifying men beating on women. So I did a little additional reporting on the story since this used to be back in the old days. This was my beat was the campus kind of free speech shutdown stuff. So I contacted first of all, I saw the New York Post said this was organized by the University's Queer and Trans Resource Center. So I contacted them and they denied involvement. They said the protest was organized by an individual who is not an SF State student and is not part of the Queer and Trans Resource Center. Take that for what's that's worth. I also contacted the University itself and they gave me a statement from the police department of the University that said there were no arrests related to the event. The disruption occurred after the conclusion of the event which made it necessary for police officers to move the event speaker from the room to a different safe location. Sounds like it was a little, you know, there's no arrests. Nothing, nothing, kind of like a tone that nothing bad happened. Maybe there should be some arrests, I don't know. And I also wanted to point out this is something that the foundation for individual rights and expression fire, which is a campus free speech watchdog group. Actually, they broaden their mission now. They don't just do campus free speech, but free speech everywhere. They point out that they have criticized very recently this campus, SFSU, for investigating a professor for showing a depiction of the Prophet Muhammad in class. A textbook free speech issue, right? You are allowed to do that even if it offends Muslims or anyone else, but they are subject subjecting a professor to investigation, transparently violating his academic freedom and free speech rights. At the same time, what action are they taking to guarantee the safety of a speaker coming to campus who was threatened by progressive activists. It's a pretty shocking example of misplaced priorities. So the fire says, stop investigating that professor, investigate the people responsible for that treatment of Riley Gaines, which, yeah, they should do that. But you know that they won't. And what's interesting is that, you know, of course they wouldn't do that at a private university because a private university at this point is just, you know, a luxury consumer good for the scions of the elites, right? So they serve, the administration serves to service these kids in the ways that they have been serviced their whole lives belonging to this elite, right? So of course they don't believe in anything except for that. But this is a public institution, right? Our tax payer dollars are going to funding this institution, right? They are supposed to view the American public at least as a stakeholder in the education they're supposed to be giving these kids, and that is clearly not happening. So it's really that combination of campus culture. And, you know, there's no saving American universities at this point. I don't think. What I think the left view should be is to make sure that people don't have to go to college in order to have a dignified life because these kids are not learning anything that they need that's going to make them better Americans and better citizens. There's nothing going on there that's in the public interest at this point, as far as I can tell. And when people say we want free college, I mean, that's what they want more of. They want more students going through. I mean, what do you think it's like to be a kid in that audience who agreed with Riley, right? What is it like to witness this after that, right? I mean, my God, you're never going to speak up. You know, I mean, the caught there. You want to make the cost of speaking your truth, the truth that 83% of Americans agree with, right? That, you know, trans women should not be allowed to compete in women's sports. Despite the fact that most Americans want trans people to be protected from discrimination, this thing they don't want, that is a mainstream view. And they want to make it impossibly costly to express that view. And we have to go back against that. And so another mainstream view, even on a, even on very liberal campuses, it's a mainstream view that even if you disagree with the person, they should be allowed to speak. So there are probably a lot of students on that campus who wanted to hear the perspective of a Riley Gaines type person. Maybe they agree. Maybe they disagree. But they don't think she should be met with violence, certainly. That is a fringe belief even on college campuses. It's in the research I've done on this in previous reporting. Fringe even on very progressive college campuses. But the tiny minority of students who think, or activists, or, you know, professional people on campus, who think it's their job to engage in defensive violence against views that they don't like. It's a small number of people, but they get their way, and no one stops them. And that's what's so frustrating about it. They're not, they don't have any sort of majority on their side anywhere, but they get their way time and time again. Very disturbing. We'll continue to follow that, and we'll have more rising right after this. Twitter files author Matt Taivi announced on Friday that he may be leaving Twitter and remaining on Substack. He wrote, quote, of all things I learned earlier today that Substack links were being blocked on this platform on Twitter. When I asked why I was told it's dispute over the new Substack notes platform, since sharing links to my articles is a primary reason. I come to this platform to Twitter. I was alarmed and asked what was going on. I was given the option of posting articles on Twitter instead. I'm obviously staying at Substack, and we'll be moving to Substack notes next week. Coin to Mediaite, when Substack announced their new feature that looks similar to the, quote, Twitter style short, must company remove the ability to share Substack links or embed Substack posts in tweets on the platform. In a Substack chat, Taivi said this will likely make the Twitter platform unusable for him when asked by Doug McLaughlin if he asked Elon why this is happening. His response was, I have no reply. The ban is breaking up is what it looks like. And I see that Elon, it's, I mean, alleged that Elon actually unfollowed Taivi as a result of this. Taivi kind of suggesting that there's not going to be any more Twitter files reports. He's, I think he's kind of, he's lost access because he has to come to the news. It's going to be on Substack instead. I think it shows, so two things. First, it shows that Taivi absolutely has integrity. He was criticized by, we talked earlier about Mediuson going after him. And he was said like, you know, why won't Taivi stand up to Elon Musk or criticize Elon Musk? Well, he actually just did. He said this is a bridge too far. I can't defend this treatment of Substack here. I'm not, Substack's been good to me. I'm not going to betray them. So I'm sticking with Substack. Sorry. No, thank you. It also shows, unfortunately, and I'm very sad for this to be the case. I was happy when Elon took over and signaled he was going to have a different approach on Twitter. And I think he's done, you know, great work demystifying having trans-sustered Twitter. He's done, you know, great work demystifying having transparency about the previous Twitter administration. All that said, this was a really stupid shooting himself in the foot. Punishing Substack. This is exactly the kind of sensory, you know, really unnecessary, cruel behavior, arbitrary, that we didn't like about the previous administration. Elon is kind of succumbing to like every worse impulse he could possibly have for how to govern this thing. So it's really unfortunate. It deserves criticism. And this might be the last straw for Twitter. What do you think, Batcha? Yeah, I mean, why is it that, you know, Matt Taibi has seen us somehow, you know, biting the hand that fed him and Elon Musk and not the other way around, you know, in Taibi, Musk got, you know, I'll say it again, the best journalist of his generation to expose, you know, the malfeasance of the previous Twitter regime, and then turned around and started, you know, basically penalizing him for posting his work on Substack. You know, Musk is trying to turn Twitter into the Musk machine. You know, he's trying to make it the perfect app for himself, which means that there's, you know, a lot more old memes going around, a lot more, you know, you know what posting and so forth. But, you know, what Twitter was before was a place where journalists shared their work. And now, I mean, we've all noticed it. If you share your work, if you share a link, even, I mean, not to Substack, if I share a link to an article I've written, that has much less engagement than just posting, you know, because he doesn't want people leaving the site. So I can understand from a business point of view why that makes sense. But it's, you know, he's not going to get, you know, millions and millions and millions of normie Americans who have never used Twitter before to use Twitter now because there's more, you know, posting from right-wing trolls, right? There's not a million more Elon Musk's out there who are just looking for, you know, a nicer version of 4chan, right? It was, it had a very specific purpose. It was where elites went to share their work with other elites, political elites, chattering class elites, and so forth. And that's why it wasn't profitable because its value add was for people who were not really there to spend a time time on theirs as much as they were to be engaged in. Exactly what Matt Taiby was engaging in. Like losing Matt Taiby from your platform, you're the loser, right? Unfollowing Matt Taiby, you're the loser. And I just want to say, like some of us were onto Musk from the beginning, never bought into his claims of being a champion for free speech. And in fact, many Hassan's question to Elon Musk about Twitter's current suppression of anti-regime critics in India is a very important question, just like I wish somebody would ask Elon Musk about China. And we know now that he's been asked by the Chinese government to stop tweeting about the lab leak theory, which apparently he has complied with, right? So I just think that he's never really quite been the good faith actor that a lot of people hoped he would be, people who had been censored as conservatives. But I don't think he's doing a great job leading this platform. I don't even think it's a good business decision. I mean, obviously Elon Musk knows and has forgotten more about business than Robbie Swave knows about it. I don't want to offer any expertise I don't have, but it seems like it's not going to, in the long term, pan out, if you drive off, if you drive away, people like Taiby, people, you know, journalists, commentators, because part of the premise of Twitter, I think why people like it is you can interact with those people. I could interact with people a lot more famous and important and influential than I was. I could do that earlier in my career when I had almost no platform, right? With a good point, with a tweet that was pithier that made sense, you could get someone to respond to you, and that was kind of neat. It was like a republic of letters kind of thing going on, where it was actually, even though it is the platform for the elites, it was one of the better ways for non-elite people to have conversations with elites, and they're there hanging out, and sometimes you can get into it with them, and they'll push back, and that was kind of the fun of it. I think that's when Twitter was operating at its best, so by driving all those people away, it's not going to be, then everybody else is going to want to use it more, because part of the fun is interacting with influential people. It was the place where people with inflated egos would give in to their worst temptations and respond to little people who hurt their feelings, and that's what was great about it. You could vote, you could troll, you could bait a person who was quite famous into getting into a stupid argument with you. He drove them all away. The thing was it was where they would go to, yeah, they did bad stuff there. It's so funny to sit here like eulogizing the days in which there were all these people like, you know, ganging up on people and being horrible, but the value of Twitter has clearly been lost for a lot of us, and it will be interesting to see what happens next. When you've lost Matt Teiby from your platform, it's worth a lot less, I mean to me, and I think to a lot of other journalists as well. I'm going to be checking out this sub stack notes feature. I mean this shows how censorship backfires, this Streisand effect. I'm now more curious about what sub stack is doing. If it's mimicking Twitter, that's like a good thing because I used to really like Twitter, and I think it's gone downhill. Some of this stuff maybe could be fixed, and Elon didn't he say he was going to put a CEO in charge of Twitter? I think the sooner that happens, the better, because Twitter is his favorite toy, but he's not doing it the platform any favors, so this is sad to see this little breakup. Maybe it won't be permanent, but I feel it might be. More rising right after this. For over half a century, the American public has been warned they're being targeted with misinformation and disinformation campaigns. From McCarthyism back in the late 1960s to the Hamilton 68 established in 2017 after Donald Trump's historic upset in the 2016 elections. In his recent piece titled a guide to understanding the hoax of the century, writer Jacob Segal explores 13 ways of looking at disinformation and how the government has poured billions into fanning the flames of so-called hoaxes. Here to elaborate on this piece is Jacob himself. Welcome, Jacob. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. So tablet has emerged as one of the most important publications in terms of really providing space to countermand this, exactly what you describe in the piece, the sort of censorship campaign, the hoax of the century. Why don't you tell us a little bit about how this piece came about and then give us the sort of cliff notes summary for people who haven't had a chance to read it yet? I would say that the piece emerged really directly out of the kind of tablet milieu and out of conversations I was having with other tablet editors, Alana Newhouse, David Samuels and other tablet writers like Lee Smith and Lee in particular really broke open the Russia gauge story at tablet. And from the very beginning, from early February 2017, I believe Lee was already pointing out what we all now know to be true, which is not simply that the claims of collusion between Donald Trump and Kremlin were false, but that they were the products of a deliberate deception led by intelligence agencies, US intelligence agencies, that is working in coordination with democratic party operatives and kind of cut out organizations like Fusion GPS and Perkins Coise. This was a worldview, a sort of grand unifying theory that was very much in some sense collaborative, but the particular aspects of the disinformation system also came out of my own experiences dealing with the big data solutionism that I saw in Afghanistan and the ways in which data and information systems came to replace traditional sources of wisdom, statesmanship, strategy, and I think that's very much what happened with this information. It was an attempt to control all information, a strategy of kind of digital omniscience as politics. You know, I think it's important always to remind people of how popular that narrative became that Trump won because of Russian influence predominantly on social media, actually Facebook. This idea that was put forth by intelligence officials, former intelligence officials seized upon by the mainstream media and then hammered home night after night after night from the 2016 to 2018 period. And I don't know this, genuinely. Do the people who read that, who watched that night after night, has it sunk in for them that we've now had all this subsequent great reporting that the influence on social media was not nearly as vast as we thought, that it wasn't targeted at the exact right voters, that a lot of people who were flagged as Russian bots or not actually Russian bots, you know, that the disinfo cops have gotten wrong time and time again. I'm not, that's well known to viewers of this program. I don't know if that's something that the audiences of like MSNBC and CNN have actually had to reckon with, because I'm not sure the hosts have reckoned with it yet. Look, the answer is no, they haven't reckoned with it. And also that you've just hit on what is really the great crime here. And the great crime is not simply the deception. The great crime is that tens of millions of Americans were co-opted and brought into that deception and made copes and spiriters, essentially, because they, you know, for reasons that I think are quite understandable, trusted the, you know, the US intelligence community, they trusted the MSNBC hosts, which is maybe, you know, a distinction not worth making anymore between MSNBC hosts and the US intelligence community. But the point is that tens of millions of people who are not crazy ideologues, who are not professional spies or partisan hacks were brought into this because they were told that the president was a Kremlin expert. The president was a Kremlin agent by people who they were supposed to trust. And this had a profoundly destructive and deranging effect on the American political landscape that we're going to be living with and seeing the wreckage of for decades. And my question would be, you know, you describe a sort of very totalizing view, almost a hegemony, a hegemonic view, right, a collusion between all of these different entities like you say, I totally agree with you. What already is the difference between, you know, is CNN is MSNBC capable of bringing a skeptical lens to anybody they interview from the intelligence community, right, jury jury's no longer out. At the same time, we do have in America, very robust, conservative media atmosphere ecosystem that has been quite skeptical of a lot of this from the beginning. We now, you know, we have, we're having hearings in Congress from Republicans pushing back on exactly the stuff that you're pointing to here. And of course, you know, former President Trump's base who never bought into it in the first place. Do you not take seriously the idea that there is a very robust resistance to the resistance taking place, you know, on Fox News, on top radio and conservative podcasts and now, you know, in the, in the, among Republicans in the house. I do take that seriously, but I think what you're describing is a resistance with little power over the decision making and sense making apparatus in the United States. So this is not to suggest that it's without power. It has clearly its own power, both in financial, you know, in economic terms, it generates a lot of money. And there's some degree of representation inside of Congress, though, frankly, not all that much, even if it's increasing, but that robust resistance to the resistance, which first of all, you know, grew in part as a result of the kind of hegemony of the resistance is also extremely exponentially excluded from the actual, I shouldn't say the actual from the official centers about in the United States. And if you look at the language that was used in this war against disinformation from the very beginning by the agencies that were leading it like the State Department's Global Engagement Center and later by Department of Homeland Security. In fact, this is the language used in the Democratic National Committees. I believe it's the 2020 platform, but the bottom line is they refer to a whole of society effort. And what they mean when they talk about this whole of society effort is that they're yoking together both the federal agencies, Silicon Valley tech platforms, Wall Street, funders, and the universities and the press. The hegemony is not conspiratorial. It's not particularly, or it's not for fetch at all. Actually, it's the way they describe it. It was their aim and they achieved it. I always say not to, you know, not to totally despair, don't totally give up hope. We have America has, the U.S. has something that no other country does that offers a robust protection for dissent for not criminalizing misinformation or whatever you want to call it. That is obviously the First Amendment, a tool for protecting free speech that has gotten more fine tuned over time. The Supreme Court is very pro-free speech, very First Amendment. However, the problem we've seen now, and I do think some of these things going on, come close to violating the First Amendment, if not doing so outright, talking about the amount of pressure placed on social media companies by government bureaucrats to censor speech. But, you know, some of it's willing on the part of tech. It runs the gamut from how willing it, you know, how willing do they really think it is when they're also being threatened with, you know, they're getting summoned to appear in congressional hearings where they're going to, you know, the political figures are going to punish tech companies for not going along with what the bureaucrats are telling them to do. So the First Amendment is a good thing. We have that, but it's not been enough so far to prevent this total criminalization of speech based on a false perception that misinformation is so, is so, the people saying that are in fact misinforming people about the extent of the misinformation problem, but they're not going to be held accountable. But what we are looking at is specifically explicitly a new system of political power intended to replace the United States Constitution and constitutional protections. So the whole premise of misinformation and disinformation is that the notion of free speech enshrined in the Bill of Rights is antiquated can no longer be upheld in a, you know, borderless digital era in which information itself is now deadly and attacks take place in cyberspace through memes, et cetera. And this is literally the view that's been expressed by, you know, the former Clinton White House officials by numerous disinformation experts in a New York Times magazine piece from 2020 that I cite in my piece for tablet. So the idea that the disinformation censorship apparatus is intended to replace the previous old American system of free speech, which is now antiquated and a kind of relic is quite explicit. It's built into all of this. And I agree with you about the strength of the First Amendment protection and Supreme Court's position, and I would never counsel despair ever in any circumstance. But I do counsel honesty. And what we're looking at here also is a technical means of circumventing that, because if you carry out these campaigns of mass automated censorship that are occurring outside of the public view without any transparency. Through these very opaque and convoluted mechanisms like the election integrity project and these sort of ostensibly independent nonprofits that are really government cutouts, you're not making the actions available for constitutional or legal checks because you're hiding them. Very sobering. Can you can you can you can you how you mentioned that you're seeing echoes here to something you observed when you were in Afghanistan. First of all, thank you for your service. Can you just draw that out a little bit explained to us what it was that you observed that you see now as the beginnings of this movement. There was a total lack of strategic vision in Afghanistan by the time I arrived, certainly in 2012 and I think for some time before that so the United States had explicitly abandoned the idea that victory was achievable and in fact, in the kind of fashionable or sophisticated defense establishment thinking of the time victory was a kind of outmoded idea and postmodern wars didn't achieve victory. And so the bottom line is we had no reason to be an Afghanistan. You know, especially after 2004, I'm not making an argument against the initial invasion. That's a whole different question. But I am saying that by 2012 when I had arrived and there was obviously a lack of any ordering strategic vision that put sensible achievable goals in place. And we were all invested in these very obvious untruths and delusions like the training of the Afghan National Security Forces, which, you know, I was writing about this in 2013. I was writing about the Holowness, the very first article I wrote when I got back from Afghanistan was about the Holowness of the Afghan National Security Forces and the fact that they were cutting side deals sensibly in many respects, cutting side deals with the Taliban who they understood would be the power that would remain after the United States left. Now, I'm not that smart. I certainly didn't have access that other people didn't have. I was just saying what anybody could see who was in Afghanistan during the period I was there. The way that this relates to the disinformation apparatus is that the one of the primary means of sort of covering all of this up at the time was this absolutely kind of almost otherworldly system of surveillance. And information control where we just acquired so much data about everything in Afghanistan and fed it into these centralized databases that were constantly receiving more data through not only, you know, drone or what was called ISR surveillance, but also through things like biometrics and through reports that were being fed into these systems that basically the idea that information control was its own means of winning the war or of accomplishing something that if we could just sort of get all of the data in one place, whoever controlled the most data was the victor, this became the sort of unspoken assumption of the war. And of course, what that led to is what we all saw, which was a chaotic, if in my opinion, still entirely correct US withdrawal from Afghanistan that led to the Taliban regaining power essentially without a shot being fired. So we had the most powerful information control systems ever known, ever created. And that's what they got us. Very insightful. Jacob, thank you so much for spending some time with us. We really appreciate it. Thank you for having us. CNN host, Don Lemon received more controversy last week after a report from Variety revealed allegations about him like sending threatening messages to a colleague from a burner phone and repeatedly exhibiting misogynistic and diva-like. CNN disputed the claims in a statement that slammed the report as riddled with patently false anecdotes and being based on unsourced, unsubstantiated 15 year old anonymous gossip. A media industry executive who previously worked at CNN told Fox News that, well before the Variety article appeared, it's been one of the biggest mysteries in TV news why CNN keeps Don Lemon around. He waits poorly. He is a source of constant embarrassment. And his new morning show is an unqualified disaster. Another CNN insider told Fox News, there are plenty of people just as talented and popular with viewers that are not such a heavy lift, with another insider adding that it's no secret that he's done quote, moronic things. Plenty of people indeed. Caitlin Collins is set to host CNN's coveted 9 p.m. slot this week in a suspected trial run and we'll be watching to see if she gets the permanent prime time position like Lemon once had before being moved to CNN this morning. Robbie, I tend to be of the opinion that if we're learning about all of this it means that CNN wants us to and that there's been a sort of green light given for the good 15 year old gossip because they're sort of ready to move on. What do you think? That's, you know more about it than I do. I guess that could be the case. It could also just be like so apparent to everyone that he, again, it's alleged but that he mistreats the staff that he yells at people that he doesn't have, that he doesn't get along with his co host. Good for Caitlin Collins. I'm sure she wants the coveted 9 p.m. slot because it's A because it is coveted obviously and B because that would move her out of this morning show that she shares with with Don Lemon where he doesn't even respect the journalism she is doing. Remember when she interviewed James Comer about the weaponization of the federal government and then and then Don Lemon came in to to say that you know why are we even doing this? Why are we bothering to interview Republicans? He has contempt for the very process of journalism that some people at the network are trying to engage in in order to bring in more people, you know, bring CNN back more to what it used to be and he stands squarely in the way of that goal. And you know obviously says things like, you know, the past year prime remark, that kind of stuff. So it wouldn't be surprising to me if someone had management has finally figured out that showing him the door would be a good move, but I've thought that was going to happen before it never has. So so maybe they know something I don't know. Caitlin Collins is extremely professional and she is exactly the tone that I think CNN is striving to return to. She's very, very moderate and and composed and controlled in the way that she engages with very, very difficult topics. She's an incredibly impressive journalist. I will say I was very impressed last week with how CNN handled the the Trump indictment. There you wouldn't have expected it, but there was a lot of skepticism around, you know, what was revealed on that front and again when we remembered like the old CNN where people sort of had moderate views and were able to express them and discuss them. I agree with you that that morning show is a disaster. I watch it a lot. Trying to get a sense of where the news channels are headed every day and you know what they're what they're going to cover and the it is very awkward and difficult difficult to watch. So, you know, it does it is interesting, you know, and interesting to CC and and try to find its footing. I remain of the opinion that, you know, I don't want CNN to fail. You know, what we want is, you know, an ecosystem full of very good media outlets competing for the viewers across this country. And so, you know, seeing them try out different things, you know, I will be very excited to watch Caitlin Collins 9 p.m. show. Yeah, I will too. And, you know, some sense of balance. I have the sense that things have gotten a little bit, you know, more balanced there. They're trying some things. Obviously, they've been trying to this whole Bill Martin. What do you make of that so far that, you know, including him in some material from his show is now is now airing on CNN, after it airs. And, you know, Jake Tapper did that very long interview with him. And I'm a big fan of Bill Martin, his perspective. I don't know that it's quite the right fit. It's because it's weird because he's primarily still on HBO. What do you think they're doing with that? Right. So, well, so first of all, the tragedies that even as they're sort of trying to move back to the center, they're still hemorrhaging viewers. So their viewership is now down way below even MSNBC, certainly below Fox. So it's not helping, right? Once they lost the trust, people went to, I guess, Fox or MSNBC and they're not coming back. So they're going to need a real shake up there. So in terms of the Bill Martin, the overtime segment that is now airing on CNN, I mean, I've never seen it live on CNN because I think it's Friday night with Shabbat. But I believe it's the 11 minute overtime segment that you can get for free without commercials on YouTube. So it's never really made sense to me. I don't know if it, because I haven't watched it live, but my sense is it's exactly that YouTube segment broken up with five minute commercial breaks over the course of a half hour. So it's not surprising to me that nobody's watching it. It did not get the viewership that they were hoping. You know, I do think Bill Martin interests politically an interesting person for them to be thinking about. I mean, but it would be to bring back the whole show or bring back politically incorrect or, you know, poor loin real time. Just getting the overtime to give them a taste of something they can get on YouTube doesn't seem to be working. Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more. All right, we'll have more rising right after this. Budlights recent partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney is the focus of recent controversy and target of right wing backlash and VC news reports. 26 year old Mulvaney, who now has over 10 million TikTok followers and 1.7 million on Instagram was one of Budlights partners during the NCAA basketball tournament. Hope I said that right. Last week Mulvaney shared a sponsored post on her Instagram promoting Budlights March Madness contest. Let's watch some of that. I kept hearing about this thing called March Madness and I thought we were all just having a hectic month, but it turns out it has something to do with sports. And I'm not sure exactly which sport, but either way, it's a cause to celebrate. This month I celebrated my day 365 a womanhood and Budlights sent me possibly the best gift ever, a can with my face on it. In the following days, video circulated online of consumers dumping their Budlight products in the trash and destroying beer cans and VC reports. American songwriter Kid Rock posted this video of him shooting at Budlight cans in response to the Mulvaney partnership. Let me say something to all you and be as clear and concise as possible. I don't know about that response from Kid Rock. That's a little violent imagery for my taste, even if you think that perhaps Dylan Mulvaney is not the ideal spokesperson for the world. I mean Dylan Mulvaney sounds like she doesn't follow basketball or drink beer beer. It'd be like you and I, Boccha. Should we be the new spokesperson for the Budlight for NCAA basketball or Budlight? When are we going to get our ideal to rep some product we know nothing about and we're not the right representatives for the demographic? I demand sponsorship. I demand corporate sponsorship, Boccha. Yeah, that video did strike me as a little bit too violent. I feel that the implication is just a little bit too close to shooting the one that has Dylan's face on it. And I often criticize the language around the transgenocide, which I think is a bit of a hoax, but videos like that certainly don't help. I mean, it doesn't help. It was too violent. At the same time, I mean, who does Ann Hahn Hamer Bush and Hahn Hauser Bush think is drinking Budlight? Do they think that there is a huge appetite for that among gay men or trans people or women? That's not their constituency. And to fundamentally misunderstand who this product is for, who enjoys this product. It's one thing to try to chase a new constituency, right? A new consumer base. It's another thing to insult your current consumer base. And to act like Dylan Mulvaney is not a controversial figure is just ridiculous. And it just shows that sort of disconnect between woke corporations on the one hand and then the normie consumer. You see this across the board. You're seeing this with Disney. You're seeing this now with Budlight. It's just a fundamental mismatch between, it would be almost like if you were trying to, it is hilarious. But let's say you wanted a commercial for a cruise ship, right? What could be more middle America, normie? It's not the kind of thing that the kinds of elites who are totally bought into this extremely far left trans agenda are into. You have to understand who your consumer base is. And when you insult them, they're going to boycott your product. And that seems like totally fair. Again, I'm not into the shooting the thing. I think that went a little bit too far. But to boycott, to say vocally, you have fundamentally insulted us because this is not how we see ourselves. And this is a controversy and we're on the other side of it. I mean, they sort of made their bed. Well, to play devil's advocate to that, I'm not a big fan of boycotts in general. That's something the progressives used to do a lot over boycotting this product over Israel or something like, that's something that comes up a lot. And I'm always like, well, you're boycotting this, but you don't care about X, Y, and Z issues. Or companies that don't want to headquarter or move into or have employees in states where there aren't sufficient civil rights protections for gay people or trans people. They want to boycott the state, but then they don't care about they're not going to boycott China or Saudi Arabia or anything. So I tend to roll my eyes at boycott efforts. And I think a lot of conservatives did too, although now, yeah, I'm here talk. We should boycott Bud Light. We should boycott Disney. Does that ever add up to anything? It is a little bit in Florida with Disney because the governor, Rod DeSantis, is able to exert some actual legal pressure on them. I don't know if enough conservatives have ever actually risen up and gotten, I mean, maybe it's happening in some broader sense with Netflix is not going to cancel. I think that the truly outrageous stuff is some of the woke pressure is not, the companies are realizing we don't actually have to listen to these people. I don't know about boycotting individual products. I upgraded to Spotify Premium after they refused to cancel Joe Rogan just because I wanted to express my support for their backbone, which is so rare these days. Let me put this to you, Robbie. What if the cans came with Dylan Mulvaney's face on them? Would you then understand why, let's say, a Christian family that used to very much enjoy this product might say, look, we don't want our children being exposed to this, young children are impressionable middle school children. At some point, do you think that it's fair to say, maybe not in an organized way, but just in a private way, this is not a product we want in our home. Another example is my grandparents never allowed anything in the house that was made in Germany. They just felt like this is too soon. We don't want this in our home. Is there any version of that that you would sanction that you would understand? Well, I mean, I guess I'm not saying I don't understand. I mean, everybody can do whatever they want to do, buy whatever product you want to buy. People are free to enact whatever grievances they have. It doesn't matter to me. I'm not going to buy Bud Light because I don't really drink a lot of beer, and it's as simple as that. I buy a lot of wine, and probably I would not pay any attention to whose face you put on the bottle. If it's a kind of wine I like at the price point I like, it's like nothing else really matters to me, but I think I'm just kind of allergic to the... Well, I say that. I'm sure you can find some example of me getting outraged about something and say, I don't have nothing to do with this anymore. I just can't think of any off the top of my head. But no, people should do whatever they want, and companies should listen to their customers. I understand... This feels very needless because Dylan Mulvaney even seems to admit or concede to not being exactly the right representative of this product, which makes me think it's just kind of a stunt. They want people to be mad at them, or be mad at... Like, ha ha, we poked you in the eye, and you got upset about it, but I also just don't care. But I guess I understand why people don't care, but it feels designed to make people upset, but then I don't know. And I think this is a very live debate on the right. I've seen people posting... People have said to me as well, this is a distraction from the real issues that the right needs to be focused on. They're focusing on this instead of on things like how to support railroad workers, how to support workers more generally. They're feeding you the cake of these fairly and raging... This is what people have said to me. It's enraging sure, but this is a huge distraction from what the right should be focused on, which is catering to, delivering for the working class that is now their base. And instead, what they do is hype up this nonsense that elites get really worked up over because they don't have real economic concerns to care about. I think that's fair. The woke messaging, if it's trying to make conservatives mad, one response would be for conservatives to just not care. And then it doesn't have the desired... I'm not touching you, stop hitting me. Right. Whereas with Dylan Mulvaney, it seems almost like conservatives watch her videos more than liberals. I mean, every time there's a new video, you have some daily wire commentary on it. Sometimes all the daily wire hosts are commenting on it on the same day. And I wonder what percentage of those 10 million TikTok followers are working for the daily wire. In that sense, it seems to be totally symbiotic relationship, right? Like Dylan gets the attention that Dylan wants and the daily wire gets the views that they want, right? But the working class gets left out, of course, and their real issues, again, become forgotten and ignored. That's a great point. Such a great point, Bacha, which is why I'm so sad to announce the next thing before we go for the day. Bacha, why don't you give everybody the very sad from my perspective news? Yeah, me too, me too. I'm going to have to be stepping away from rising. At least for now, I'm focusing on a few projects at Newsweek. And will not be joining you on Mondays anymore, although, of course, hope to stay in the rising family. I think this show is just the bomb, and I think you're wonderful, Robbie. And I so appreciate the time that you all have spent with me and allowed me to spend with you and hope that we will stay in the family together. And I'm excited to come on as a guest once again when we can set that up. Absolutely. We'll be happy to have you back anytime. I understand. This show is a full-time obligation. I also write for Reason Magazine. You also write and edit at Newsweek, and it's a lot to do everything. So totally understand that you're going to work on some other things. We will love to have you back at some point in the future as we too try to figure out how many days a week we're doing, what things exactly. But it's been so wonderful spending these last many Mondays with you, and we'll be following your work, Bacha. And for those of you at home, be sure to like, share, and subscribe so you never miss any content. And for those who like to listen while in the go, we're now available anywhere you can find podcast. I'll see you back here tomorrow."
