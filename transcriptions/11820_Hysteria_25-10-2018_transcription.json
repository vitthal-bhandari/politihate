    "text": " Hello and welcome to hysteria. I'm Erin Ryan with me this week. Here in D.L. Hello. And Grace Harro. Hello. I'm going to do some weird ass voice. If you're in a voice pick. Then we check in with Alyssa Mastemonico in a new uterus weekly and Blair and Z-Way return with their segment, Let's Get Uncomfy. We've also got updates on some female candidates we've highlighted and as always we end with the Fills We'll Die On. So ladies let's just get into it. We're getting close to Election Day. Getting close to Election Day always kind of feels like how I'd imagine it would feel to get close to a black hole. Like my body is stretching out. I can't escape it. Nothing makes any sense. The laws of physics don't apply. I feel like I'm going to turn into spaghetti and break into a million pieces. But the good news is the difference between Election Day and a black hole is that you can escape Election Day. It comes and if you do your job you get out in one piece. If you don't you're fucked. But if you do your job you get out in one piece. And Vote Safe America is here to help you navigate the awful black hole that is the media cycle and the days leading up to the election. Right now Vote Safe America has a new interactive voter guide that can help you get smart about everything on your state's ballot. Here's a funny story. So my boyfriend was talking to me about looking over California voting stuff and he was like we can sit down and go over it together and you can tell me you know you can tell me about what you know the candidates and stuff and I was like actually you can just go to Vote Safe America and he responded like oh I thought that was something we could do together. I was like no no no no. Look I could help you but like just go online. My dear. Just go online and search for the bell. Anyway but it is impressive. It is so impressive. I am delighted and astounded and I don't know every single person who put this together but it is so cool if you haven't checked it out it's really really really amazing. Yeah and it's like you can see just in very plain English not scare language. You can see exactly what each candidate you know who they are what they stand for what the different ballot measures are. The ballot measures part is the part that I like the best because like the numbers mean nothing to me. There's some weird stuff in California. Have you voted yet? I have not voted yet. Okay so we're voting on daylight savings time this year. Yeah very very fancy. Get rid of it. I said yeah me too. I said I'm a hard pass on daylight savings time. Get rid of it. Mine has been sent in already so. Oh yeah and somebody somebody also put a note in here. It's not a big deal. I voted already. Yes. M. V. D. just. Somebody put in here they made dope cookies. Was that you care or was that was me? Oh it was me. It did make the dope cookies. Oh yeah. Yeah in the box. Love the cookies. They have the date on it and everything. Yeah delightful. Yeah it was great. It kind of became incorporated into you and that's why you voted. The cookies like imbued you with the assets and the mocha. Yes it was the cookies that made me vote. That is that is kind of not been for cookies. And it not been for those. I don't know if I would have been swayed. Let's get into quick news. There's a lot of stuff today. First I want to talk a little bit. I mean we're getting close to Halloween and you know I'm wearing a shirt today that says Wolfman, Mummy, Frankenstein, Dracula on it. Oh wow. Yeah I have a Halloween one that's got a little picture of a ghost on it and then it says I'm not your boo. That's cute. It's cute. I like it. Karen what's your Halloween shirt? I don't have one. We got to get you a Halloween shirt. They sell them at CVS. You can buy Halloween. Oh wow. And your idea. Yes. I just wear my underwear from CVS as a hat. I'm crazy. That's my costume. Well there are some witches doing witch stuff and they placed a mass hex on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during a New York protest ritual. The spell which was live streamed on Facebook as you know typical spell stuff. You live stream it right naturally. And Instagram. I think Instagram is the witch year of the two. For sure. It's more visual. Yeah it's a little spooky. Like just the process of scrolling feels a little bit spooky like you're moving your finger up and down. It's a wand. Yeah and I also think when I'm looking at it I follow some influencers and I spend the whole time looking at Instagram thinking like who's taking these pictures. If you're sitting on a bench looking at a window like you staged this. There's something so spooky about how much everything on Instagram is just staged. If it's a candid shot it's like you that was like take 15. But regardless the spell was live streamed on Facebook and Instagram on Saturday and it also targeted quote all rapists and the patriarchy which emboldens rewards and protects them. They cast a spell on the patriarchy guys. I think I think we finally saw. I love it. I love it. I don't like this. You don't like it. I don't like this. Okay all right. First of all witches have been around since the 1600s and now they're casting hexes and spells. It's still not working. Right. It's still not working guys. Okay counterpoints. My mom does this is that maybe this is a Mexican mom thing. All of our Mexican listeners Latin American listeners tell me if this is applicable or just my mom. She does voodoo on people. She's got little voodoo dolls in our freezer. This is a real thing. What? Yes this is a real. In your freezer? Yeah and I don't know. I think they're made of hot dogs. I can't really see them. Well because it's in her freezer and my parents freezer in Houston. So but I just there's these little wrapped up these little like these little nuggets that are wrapped up in aluminum foil that she sticks in the very back of the freezer. And she always tells me there's somebody in my life that I don't like or that's bothering me. She will do voodoo on them. So she's a good on there. She does this. This is real. When I was in second grade I had a friend who was kind of artistic and she made these clay figures like these like little clay figures. And then I remember she was like and then she she used one as voodoo and she poked it in the stomach and then she was like and then she was like somebody's gonna get a really bad stomachache at lunch. And then she she got a really bad stomachache at lunch. No. It's real. It's real. Well it also you know be careful what you put out there. I know we'll love threes right. I will say that I have to my own credit I have never invoked the use of my mom's voodoo because she's like it's very powerful stuff. So I'm always too scared because I believe that I believe that it could end up coming back to me. I don't want that shit. Well here's here's my take on this. I think that not every single not every single thing that feminists do needs to be designed to like convince people to agree with them. I hate that idea like no we're not convincing anybody to do good. It's like fine. Maybe this is just for catharsis totally you know maybe this is just for maybe this is not for you. Maybe this is for me. Yeah. Maybe this is a way for women who joined in casting a spell on Brett Kavanaugh to get together and and feel like a part of a community and acknowledge that they were part of a movement and pee into jars and pee together. Absolutely together. Yeah. Exactly. But at the same time I think to gear to gear in this point if witchcraft was so great then you'd think it would have been more effective. But what if witchcraft has prevented like calamities that we don't even we can't even think of. Ooh there's the premise for your YA novel. What a lame grace. What if no witches. What if no witches though. It's way worse it turns out. So one thing I wanted at one point I wanted to make is like yeah of course cast spells on your enemies all you want but also do stuff that like has a proven track record of working like voting. Yes. I think voting is is important. Canvas sing making sure your friends are voting. And and if anything is happening where you are that is interfering with people's ability to vote you should make a big fucking stink about it like in Georgia right now. You know it's a national story that people are interfering with the right of black people to cast their votes. And the fact that it's a big news story might actually change the outcome of the of the election away from what the vote suppression party wants to do. So you know cast spells all you want but also you know fucking vote. Get in there man. So hysteria has been doing something in the last few weeks. We have been highlighting female candidates that we're excited about. We've been talking about ballot measures and states that affect women's health. We actually have a few updates from a few of the candidates that we have been highlighting. So here we go. Let's start with Shari Stavids. Shari Stavids. She's a candidate for K S O three. So here's the update aside from navigating a tough race. She's been the subject of racial harassment from a local GOP official who threatened her saying your radical socialist kickboxing lesbian Indian will be sent backpacking to the reservation. It's a tongue twister. Yeah. It's it's mean and also a tongue twister. That official has since resigned. But this is the kind of rhetoric and vision for Kansas that Shari is fighting so hard to change. Early voting is underway in the sunflower state. So make sure you cast your vote for Shari Stavids. Also can I just make a quick note radical socialist kickboxing lesbian Indian. I want to hang out with that person. That person sounds awesome. It sounds amazing. It's a tongue twister. I would say it's it's it's a lot of words to put this was an email I think. I think this guy sent this in an email for sure. I was like you didn't say these words out loud. This wasn't on the Today Show that's for sure. They wouldn't have had time to think that up. That kind of reminds me of like the Republicans telling Beto like oh he's a punk rocker who got a DUI and lives in Texas. Cool. I kind of want to hang out with that guy. Yeah. As long as he's turned his life around he's not driving drunk anymore. Yeah. But but still playing that guitar. I want to hear that shit. We also have some updates from Carolyn Long. Carolyn Long. Yes. Candiday in Washington's third district. So the latest campaign finance report for her race was released and showed that she raised this is amazing. Nearly triple the amount of GOP incumbent challenger. That's right. She brought in more than one point seven five million dollars. That is amazing between July and the end of September. Yeah. And that's not only it but she just recently got endorsed by former vice president Joe Biden and he said Congress needs more people like Carolyn who understand that working families need champions protecting their access to affordable health care and building an economy that works for everyone. Oh that's great. Love that. Because that's good news all around. That's much more upbeat than the Shari's David's update which is I can't imagine how tough you have to be in order to withstand that. Like good for her. So we have another update from Angie Craig who is a candidate for Minnesota second after a glossy in style magazine profile last week. Good for Angie Craig sent spent the weekend in back to back debates with GOP incumbent challenger Jason Lewis who by the way sucks. He utterly sucks. Paul Paul show that that's my scientific opinion. Paul show that the race is leaning in Craig's favor but of course nothing can be taken for granted with just days left out until November 6. So Angie Craig is up. So that's that's awesome. Yeah Minnesota people really you know really can bring it home for Angie Craig. So that's not Minnesota nice either. That's that's that's just nice. That's just nice. I also I also love the way it's like nothing can be taken for granted with just days left until November 6. I was like at crooked media November 6 is the high holiday. The high holiday of the year guys we're recording a hysteria episode the day after election day and I guarantee you that I will not have slept and it's all for our listeners. Oh I love that and for democracy. Yes. Oh God. Okay personal political so this is a story that broke over the weekend and when it broke it it just it sucks. It's a shitty story from a shitty group of people trying to do shitty things. The Trump administration is quote spearheading an effort to establish a legal definition of sex under Title IX. The federal civil rights law that bans gender discrimination and education programs that receive government financial assistance. That's from the New York Times. The definition would narrowly define gender as a biological immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth. The Department of Health and Human Services which by the way if you're paying attention to AJS not that exciting it's not that exciting a department but the Trump administration has been quietly staffing it with fucking zealots. Like since day one just zealots when it comes to women's health and when it comes to sex. AJS is now insisting that key agencies like labor, AJS, justice and education need to adopt a uniform definition of gender as determined quote on a biological basis that is clear grounded in science objective and administratable. That's really interesting because they love science when it allows them to exclude people but they don't love science when it might require them to reign in fossil fuel consumption. But regardless the now science loving republican. The agency's proposed definition would define sex as either male or female unchangeable and determined by the genitals that a person is born with. Any dispute about one sex would have to be clarified using genetic testing. Okay so this is aside from any Obama era policies that extended to school restrooms, healthcare access, federal prisons that for the most part recognize gender identity as an individual's choice from the New York Times. The new definition would essentially eradicate federal recognition of an estimated 1.4 million Americans. Transgender people and allies took to social media to protest the administration's recent efforts using the hashtag won't be erased. Karen when you first heard about this what were your thoughts? I read one of the articles that was by a young girl. She was talking about her experiences and she interviewed high school students who were you know affected and for me that really hit because it's like oh yeah there's like there's people in high school there's people who are young people who are essentially being told by an administration that oh you might not matter or you might not exist. Yeah it's just it was very disappointing and it was very poignant I thought to hear the perspectives of those children. Yeah I mean Grace do you think that the point of this I mean there was an article in the Atlantic recently that was the headlines the cruelty at the point. Do you think this is another example of the people who a certain ilk in the Trump administration just wanting to beat up on a group that their base likes to see beaten up on? I do. I think that I think what you're pointing at is something that I'm trying to keep in mind with with regard to the fact that every week there's a new put upon minority group and that is not to to I say that because I think what we're seeing is an attack on the other generally and and and and what is so disheartening about this is Karen to your point there are so many young people affected by this particular demonstration and yeah I think that that there is just sort of a base level of cruelty and it's because change scares this administration and it's because it comes from a place of wanting to keep a status quo that doesn't actually exist and it's because there's a desire to forget the fact that multiculturalism and that a variety of of backgrounds is what kind of makes up the fabric of this country. I also just think that this is pretty arbitrary and I don't get it. I don't get I don't get scientifically found it. No there's no reason also like either. Yeah what about intersex people like it's it's the they're trying to evoke science in something in a way that is totally contrary to all the science around gender and sex. Exactly exactly and it makes me also realize that all this makes me want to do is to reach out more to trans people and to help them more because you know we we are our I think a heteronormative group here at hysteria today and all of us are allies and all of us care very deeply about this cause which is why we wanted to bring it up but I think that we can't regardless of what platform we have and what platforms our listeners might have we can't hear enough from the trans community especially in light of this because if for whatever reason they are not visible enough to consider to be considered as valuable and important to our administration then that that means that we are not doing our job to to force their voices out there as often as possible. One of the things I was thinking about is that I think that the bet that the right is making here is that the people in power will abandon the people that don't have power and one thing I will say is you know to our trans and non-binary listeners if you have stories of how this is affecting you personally you can get in touch with us and we'll share it on a future episode if you give us permission hysteria at kirgit.com I also want to say that like you know if you're a person who's in an empowered group it is your responsibility to use your energy and your power to lift other people up in moments like this you might not be a person one of the 1.4 million trans people in this country but if you have the energy to fight for them you have to it is like the only morally defensible position to take you have to fight for these people. I had somebody close to me in my life family member I sent an article the other day about the surge of voters that were popping up in Houston the first day that voting was was allowed and he was like yeah oh I didn't see that because I'm on a media blackout until after the midterms and I was like really you're just not gonna and he's like no no no it was like the whole Kavanaugh thing just made me like too freaked out so I'm just just not just gonna ignore the news and that to me is one of the most reprehensible views that we can take as as a nation and as individuals too if you are ignoring what's happening in the world around us you're doing yourself a disservice and you're doing you're doing the disenfranchised the disservice too so that's why I will say we have to seek out these stories no matter how gruesome they are and we have to inundate ourselves with as much information as possible especially if it's hard to take and especially if it's not pleasant because otherwise we can't stand up for the people that don't have platforms in that that are voiceless. You can read more about this yourself under the hashtag won't be erased but we also have some organizations that can help out. Yeah so you know what are things that you can do if you're a cis or hetero folks to support trans intersects non-binary folks during this time you can number one this is very big kind of the theme of the episode is vote November 6th aka the um D-Day democracy yeah the the the D-Day of crooked media literally people around here will be like can't hang out until after election day I have been saying that yeah people are like after the election after we'll get drinks after the election yeah it's like it's like the holiday time if you need help figuring out your polling location what's on your statewide ballot then uh votesaveamerica.com is available as a great resource for you and number two is donate there's organizations like the transgender law center trans lifeline lambda legal trans-latinna coalition the national center for transgender equality who are fighting to protect the rights of trans people and could use the additional resources now more than ever there will be the contact information in our show notes so if you go to crooked.com you can check it out yeah and again you can get in touch with us at hysteria at crooked.com and we're happy to direct you to resources or you know listen to your story and if you're comfortable with us sharing it on a future show we're happy to do that as well all right we have to take a break but when we come back we're going to check in with alissa with uterus weekly and then we're going to check in with Blair and Z-way and a new lexicat. and we're back with more hysteria let's let let's get into what's going on this week with the government and reproductive rights you know it's funny you and i were texting this morning and you were like it doesn't really seem like there's been a lot going on and when i was on my way into the studio today i was thinking about it and i realized it's because there's been so much going on true and every other week that a kind of normal week of assault on reproductive rights is just like something we shrug at now i know it can't be just like filler it can't be the coronation of the news no the coronation of the news some people really like coronation so i do too but we know it we know what it means yeah totally so so one thing that i i want to talk about this week with you is that the trump administration is trying it again so uh you know they say the definition of insanity is trying something the same way over and over again and expecting different results well the trump administration when it comes to reproductive rights is trying the same thing over and over again but in their case they're getting some new results and uh in this case they're working to expand the religious and moral exemption uh that applies to the obama care era birth control benefit and they want to expand that exemption to every employer now alissa it's early in the morning for me and i woke up like an hour ago can you explain that to our listeners in plain english so well first i appreciate you thinking that powell's is on a different time zone um you're sleeping you're sleeping on east coast time alissa true i've been up for hours so here's the bummer about what trump's doing and like we were just talking about you know you get onto twitter you turn on the news and you're like oh we're doing bad things with the Saudis and Jared Kushner is on television talking about why it's awesome and why we can't judge people and how nobody's guilty until proven innocent that like this stuff lies totally under the radar and so when you look at it what he's doing and this is something that we talked a bit about actually on uterith weekly back in june which is they're expanding not just religious exemptions for covering birth control but moral and when you start talking about moral it's there there are no boundaries on what someone could consider moral grounds for denying women um you know access or health care coverage for birth control and so he has done this it's going it could affect over 55 million cisgender women and who knows how many trans or non-binary um but the thing is like what are we gonna do he this is back in june do you remember the woman at wall green her name was nakot Nicole artega back in arizona yep she goes into get her prescription and the pharmacist says i'm not going to give it to you because i i oppose abortion and she was less than 10 weeks pregnant was told her fetus was not viable and this was prescribed by her doctor and for no reason other than the pharmacist not wanting to do it she had to go above and beyond to ultimately secure the prescription and so that is a micro example of what's going to happen across the country with him putting with trump putting these two new rules in effect saying that companies uh non-profit or for-profit don't have to cover this so this means that if i was working somewhere and i still wanted my noobering which i use the last time i had to buy a noobering that wasn't covered by my health insurance it was 35 dollars that's a lot yeah yeah i mean that's that's something that's really interesting interesting like horrible interesting interesting like i want to lie down in a quiet room and not talk to anybody interesting under the proposed trump plan which doesn't have a plan for implementation but right now it's kind of caught up in the courts but they're trying it again under the proposed plan employers would not have to register their moral objection anywhere right would just be able to stop and that's uh that's something that's really disturbing and it's and it's only birth control it's not other types of medications it's not viegra like if you find old men boning gross then you're not allowed to morally object to that um because because honestly it's none of your business what your employees are doing with their sex lives as long as it doesn't interfere with their ability to perform their job also you know that i was thinking about the pharmacist thing i was reading something the other day and i'm sorry i didn't send you this link so i'm just going to kind of brief you on it the the the sort of uh pharmacist moral objection thing is happening everywhere and all the time recently it happened in michigan um a woman who went to a mire shout out to all the people from the midwest who know mire stores well a woman who went to mire uh was having a miscarriage she was prescribed a miscarriage drug and the pharmacist refused to dispense it to her which is like has nothing to do with abortion it's just another way that the drug can be used so they wouldn't dispense the drug even to be used for something that was completely not something that it's okay to morally object it you can't morally object to a person having a miscarriage it's a natural thing that happens you know yeah they're just doing so much so fast that it's impossible to keep up with and then you look at this new article which we were talking about which is abortion killed by mail mhm yeah there's a um a large percentage of american counties don't have abortion clinics and a lot of states have so few abortion clinics that women who live inside of those states effectively have to go elsewhere in order to obtain that sort of reproductive health care and an interesting thing that i did not know is that while abortion is still knock wood legal here in america um self-managed abortion is considered criminal in many states and so if you need to go get the pill like going to the hospital and getting an abortion is one category trying to seek one apparently by using a pill which is considered self-managed is is actually criminal in some places and so dr rebecca gompert who's a Dutch physician has been keeping up with the plight of the american woman and has been trying to help and it's pretty convoluted could you follow i mean it's like you need like a venn diagram and a flow chart to figure out how this works yeah you need one of those kind of uh true detective season one style garage diagram so figure it out for sure so dr gompert's is she's like she's a Dutch doctor so she's able to write prescriptions so what she does is she has a screening site on the web uh called aid access where women who are under ten weeks pregnant and live within an hour of a hospital who who fit the the online screening process for for qualifying for this medication uh those women will fill out a form on her website she will call in the prescription to an indian pharmacist it's she trusts that she trusts and the pharmacist will fill the prescription and mail it to the patient in the u.s so it's actually kind of murky whether or not this is legal because uh it's not technically legal to get prescriptions by mail generally speaking especially from a foreign country right um but it is it is illegal and there are distribution requirements on one of the drugs that's required in obtaining a medicinal abortion um so you know and and some of the the pushback on this is that you know it can't be safe to get drugs through the mail it can't be blah blah blah but the reality is that uh carrying a pregnancy to term is is much less safe than obtaining a medicinal abortion only according to the daily beast only 22 women have died over the course of the the drugs use and it's very common it's about one third of all uh first trimester abortions so 22 people out of the millions who have used the drug to obtain abortions is not a very big number but yet people are hand bringing over safety why do you think that is alissa well well because you can you i guess in today's day and age you can hide behind safety and you can hide behind morality um but it is the the safety argument is i guess if the the pill here's the thing if they just let women get the pill in the united states it would be fine because they're both fda approved mmm miss they're so hard to say miss a pro stall and miss a pristone or fda approved they're considered essential medications by the world health organization yeah and the reason that if women are doing this through the mail that it might not be safe is that if they have an ectopic pregnancy or they have side effects the reason it's not safe is because if they go to a hospital to address their side effects they could be arrested for having secured pills from another country to have an abortion which would be considered self-managed abortion right and that's and that's enough and especially you know if you're in a marginalized population like if you're an undocumented person and you're trying to obtain an abortion that's in an entirely new world of of danger and it's something that you know i know people would say that we're being hysterical for saying women get arrested but women have gotten arrested 21 women have been arrested and some of those women who were arrested were imprisoned i mean it happens it happens here it happens elsewhere and it's just something that we need to keep an eye on one thing i wanted to talk about quickly before we went is um you know there are other parts of the world that said America believe it or not even though the the news here is just like a suffocating wet rag um but northern ireland is a place where abortion is really restricted and it's proving in real time how reduced access to abortion impacts women's health uh basically there's this big uh there's a there's a large study around um how women who live in northern ireland deal with having abortions and they will put off having them they will uh they'll make risky decisions around their health or around their health care and they'll just generally do things that they shouldn't have to do to obtain abortions in a part of the country where um it's it's not legal so that's uh that's something that's going on elsewhere if i'm sure we have listeners who are in ireland northern ireland if you have anything on the ground you can get in touch with us what do you want one interesting thing that i thought about the ireland story which is you know sarah ewert who is the one suing the government is she said women shouldn't be forced through the courts to have their rights realized i just thought that's a nice naga to end on yeah it is and it also reminds me of something z-way said earlier in uh the life of hysteria when she said that the line uh for justice should not be about going viral to paraphrase what is what z-way said the road to justice should not be through going viral all right i'm for that yeah i'm for that as well let's uh keep fighting the good fight enjoy paulo also hope you're uh your sleep gets back to normal stupid keep it hysterical girl i will talk to you soon bye bye so hi guys it's z-way and blaremonie we are here new york city east coast hysteria bringing you a topic some realness some segments and our segment is called let's get unconfied you see how we did that in new nucin it's because we're in agreement film all right let's say a chat about the caravan currently on its way to the united states blare definitely and um let's also acknowledge that there will be some sensationalism in the media but we're here to bring you some factual facts exactly because we know that people like to stoke the fear of white americans you know anti-immigration rhetoric but we don't subscribe to that narrative we subscribe to logic and reason in facts and subscribe to hysteria which you should if you don't already crooked dot com but anyway okay so there is a caravan headed from central america from hong dorris from other central american countries that are you know experiencing an extreme amount of violence and safety and kids themselves are being um pretty much sent up north for a better promise for a better future and so presently the u.n i think estimated that there are over 7 000 migrants headed toward the us and of course trump is turning this into a political conversation making it a be all end all for positions on emigration not just for the united states and for people running for congress but for countries that are receiving aid from the united states totally and the crazy part is that the united states of america advertises itself as a land of opportunity right so this is like getting pissed at people for coming at home depot looking for a hammer you know these people are just looking for a better life and to demonize them that isn't kind and it's like you know demonizing people for coming to home depot looking for hammers after you ruin their house let's not forget about how the united states destabilize quite a bit of central and south american countries in their conquest of shoring up the world against communism against trade so if we look at you know panama for looking at venezuela for looking at chile argentina etc we know that the united states has ruined a couple people's homes and now folks are looking for a new place yeah they're they're fleeing violence and poverty they're just looking for safety really it's it's really tragic and so z-way before we hopped on um the pod you were telling me that you're a first generation immigrant i am and so how does it make you feel to see the immigrant conversation becoming so villainized and politicized this definitely gives me cause for concern i just the all these people are the same whether they're from africa south america from australia from europe as many americans and sisters are from they're just looking for a place where they can work and provide for their families um and that's always been the case that's why the pilgrims came here you know that's why columbus came here he was looking for opportunity in land and spice as i guess i guess he stumbled upon america by accident anyway point is they just want something to provide and give their children and i don't think that we should demonize these people i think we should help them definitely yeah but you know as i was saying trump is bringing in all these ultimatums and one of the ultimatums is against mexico denying aid um during hurricane season which is extremely harmful um trump is just like this miser who i mean we all know he's garbage i don't need to belabor that point the crazy thing about this caravan is that it actually happens all the time in fact there was one as recent as april that ended up dissipating from a thousand people to two hundred people right so there is clearly a crisis for immigration as far as people being trying to flee their hazardous and dangerous but we should have a plan by now this is we're not just making it up as we go along like we can't just scream build a wall in our shower and consider that this all solved we need to have concrete plans and i know that mexico has some plans in terms of handling the migrants definitely and you know the us did have a couple plans you know back in i think 1990 the congress did allow the president to make uh sanctions for people or not sanctions but allowances for people who are fleeing from um you know violent situations people who are coming as refugees granting asylum um but mexico has taken a different turn they've been a little bit harsher so what mexico is doing is basically trying to you know quote-unquote ensure the safety of my grants make sure that people are being tended to often what happens in the united states is that people are you know their fear their sphere of deportation and so people don't go for medical care they don't go for emergency care but in mexico there's a little bit more humanity in the way the policies are being handed down totally so for example one of the policies is that they'll have anyone seeking refugee status must apply individually and wait up to 45 days at a migratory station while they're processed now that's good and bad because we're excited that they're even accepting refugee applications but 45 days is a long time if you're totally in a different country from where you're from you don't have food you don't have water you're at these migratory stations but they're going to be overcrowded and that's really hard for if you're raising a child you're just trying to bring your little newborn baby to safety or you're a child yourself you know this this is really frightening frightening for me because it sounds very similar to the immigration detention facilities that we're seeing in the united states and while you know under trump they're more in the media but this is something that happened to under obama and my concern is what are the conditions of these places that folks are being held we look at trump is like this new dismal era for immigration but obama didn't necessarily grant asylum to a wide swath of people um did accept refugees but still deported quite a few people and families so it's difficult to look at this like you were saying as just a trump issue when this is you know these policies that we're seeing from mexico those aren't directly coming from trump those are policies that mexico has had as far as detention as far as deportation anybody for for anybody who has entered um mexico unlawfully um or clandestinely and the united states is really following suit so it's kind of um more than that more than all these different policies swirling around it frustrates me to see how resistance folks have lost sight of this i feel like uh immigration was huge in the news you know patrisso kumo climbed the um the statue of liberty and then after that i feel like the concern for migrant children for families that have been separated fizzled out because the the new cycle shifted and still many of these families are separated i think trump is a reflection of america's ugliest flaw right so to say that he is the deporter in chief trump is you know it's a historical but he definitely he reflects this anti-immigrant anti-brown and black people anti non-white rich and we see that in either rhetoric that he's stoking for the midterms it actually breaks my heart when i think about the fact that people are being galvanized by this rhetoric against immigrants right it's like i'm motivated by like celebrity tweets that'll get me enough that'll get me to the polls like that's fun yeah but people need to like hate those that they've never met they're afraid that a man from nijir named baba tunde will steal their job and that's what motivates them in their voting process it makes me sad and even more than that there's like vigilantes across the border i remember when i was in school at louisiana state university there was this huge rhetoric about people who you know like bellow students who were so upset about this um this rhetoric of you know a foreign or coming into the united states that people are taking up arms or i don't know if it's the present thing but uh i know it did happen in the past around 2015-2016 there's actually a story about um long and a long island people are like hoarding guns because they're afraid of ms13 as if ms13 is going to march through their doors but that that's that's really what's the media narrative that we're reading from these super right conservative websites and tv organizations media likes and claire and so people are afraid yeah so i think like the biggest what we're coming down to is that these this rhetoric it's not only harmful to people because they're going to be an immigration detention facilities for more than 40 days in places that they don't know like just seeking a better opportunity but it's what it's going to do to people who are here in the united states as far as the narratives you know anti-immigrant policies we're seeing the backlash against trans people because of similar narratives of fear totally it's a talk about identity politics we've been you know chastised by the right for believing that as a black woman i am entitled to have my beliefs and in touch not feel uncomfortable in certain spaces this is identity politics when you're saying you should hate this migrant group because they're stealing whatever from either because they're violent these are not even based in fact and it's such a shame it truly is you know i i really love when i see um protesters who are you know old women and they'll just like look at a congressperson and they'll just say shame shame i know it's very game of thrones and i'm feeling it you know i think this is a moment of shame for america and for american media especially who's reporting um in authentically on this and so i think it's important to reach out to organizations that are doing this work undocu-black um the just alliance for black immigration the media organization we are me too just doing amazing work reporting on these struggles and making it you know rooted in material fact and not in fear yeah i think it was tommy who tweeted today or yesterday that the story is the lies and i think that's a really interesting way to approach trump's approach to immigration is that he's lying and there's got to be some culpability in that and some accountability in that because it's it's dividing us definitely but let's talk about the accountability you know people are saying you turn your your clocks back uh early november and then on the six you're going to take your country back uh november six so accountability is key and i think the accountability is going to come on november six or whenever your voting date is so we can take back this country not from a mythologized foreigner like the you know right-wing media is trying to make us fear but from these bigots who are dividing us as a country and i just went to vote save america you're wearing the merch right now i had wearing vote save america hat vote save of america shirt vote save america shoes love it i got it all over my bodice awesome and so i went to the website and i actually got a little calendar invite for where my pool place is so i'll leave voting i it's right by my house i'm
