    "text": " Hard hitting medical truth, cutting through conflict and confusion to the understanding you're searching for. Join Dr. Peter McCullough, world-renowned medical expert and practicing physician for this edition of the McCullough Report. Your life may depend on it. Let's get real, let's get loud. On America at Lautock Radio, this is the McCullough Report. And I'm Dr. Peter McCullough. I want to pick up on the issue of transgender medicine and dedicate this issue towards it, since we have a terrific guest later on in the program. And I've been following this along in Texas, Texas through 2020-2022, developed a Senate bill. It was Senate Bill 14 that restrict transgender youth from accessing gender changing care, that is, hormones and surgery for individuals under age 18. Now this was signed into law by Governor Abbott, and it was set to go into effect September 1, 2023. And then a legal fight ensued. And Texas families brought this forward, and I am reporting from the Texas Tribune's daily newsletter that at the heart of the fight was the new ban on puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender children in an ongoing debate. And whether those treatments help or hurt youth with gender dysphoria, there was a two-day hearing over an attempt to block the law that was set to occur on September 5. And in fact, that lawsuit did prevail in actually getting a stay on the law going into effect. And that, you know, this was reported August 15 of 2023. So what occurred next was reported on, you know, on August 25, 2023, that the law was going to go into an effect despite, you know, despite this, you know, this legal attempt. And then a district court judge stepped in. So on August 25, the state district court judge Maria Cantu-Hexel wrote that state bill 14 quote, interferes with Texas families, private decisions and strips, Texas parents of the right to seek, direct and provide medical care for their children, end quote. So in response, the Texas Attorney General's office filed an appeal with the Texas Supreme Court, a move that automatically paused Cantu-Hexel's injunction and will allow the law to go into effect September 1, 2023. The Attorney General's office said, such medical treatments are unproven and pushed some legal activists in the medical and psychiatric professions in a statement announcing the appeal on the 25th. Following the state's appeal, the plaintiff filed an emergency request asking the Texas Supreme Court to again temporarily block the law. And on August 31, 2023, the state's highest court denied that request, ensuring that state bill 14 will take effect September 1. Now this is important because it's now September 5, 2023, when I'm doing this recording. So we've had four days of blocking transgender care in Texas. Now that Supreme Court filing done by the Attorney General was assisted by myself. I was asked by the Attorney General's office to write a brief which I did, an expert report, summarizing the data and I can tell you here on this program, the information is clear that we have a situation where the hormone treatment for transgender medicine. So in the pre-pubital phase, gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists are used and they effectively block the surge in hormones that transform a pre-pubital boy into a man. And then the same thing for the transition from a pre-pubital girl to a woman. And these hormones in multiple studies published make the kids sick. They have increased rates of headaches, acne, weight gain, sleep disturbance, nausea, make them feel unwell in more than half of cases. So the use of straight up androgens and estrogens after puberty, which is often done, if the decision is made to try to live out a fantasy of being in the opposite gender after puberty, those hormones also make the teenagers feel sick because it's unnatural for a boy to take estrogens, for instance, unnatural for a woman to take androgens. So here we have a situation where again the pre-pubital drugs, the post-pubital hormones, they simply make the kids more ill and the parents need to understand that. That's in my expert report. And then I moved on to the surgeries and I think it's important to cover the surgeries. Let's take the girls first. The girls having mastectomies, the mastectomies done in the normal breasts of a young woman are complete mastectomies. So every bit of breast tissue is excised out, scraped down to the pectoralis muscle. And then the skin is tightened around the pectoralis muscle and the nipples are attempted to be repositioned. This causes a binding effect and there's easily a 30% more complication rate with this type of mastectomy. This is very different than a mastectomy that a woman would get for breast cancer. And what we know here is the complication rates are high with infection, abnormal drainage that occurs and then later on, contracture and binding. So you'll see these incisions which bind the chest forward and the chest can't be fully expanded. So the mastectomies are disfiguring. For the girls down below, the procedures that are done include one called metoidioplasty. Metoidioplasty is an attempt to enlarge the clitoris. It can be made somewhat larger but not to a full-size penis by any means. And it doesn't have a sexual function of any degree. Another procedure is a phaloplasty. The phaloplasty is carving a large amount of tissue out of an arm or a thigh and making it into a cylindrical penis. The penis then is overlaid on top of the clitoris and then urine is attempted to try to drain through this new tissue. As you can imagine, it's very, very complicated. It gets infected. The urine doesn't drain completely. The phaloplasty leaves either the arm or the leg permanently disfigured. Importantly, these procedures are likely to be sterilizing. We know that the hormones themselves would be sterilizing. But as a girl decides to live out of fantasy as a man, she's giving up her future fertility in almost every case. Now let's take the boys. What do the boys do? Probably the most benign thing that boys or young men can do is get breast implants. Nowadays, silicone breast implants are used. For the boys, they're typically put just underneath the skin so they don't go under the pectoralis muscle because the pectoralis muscle is bigger. They go underneath the skin and they do look like female breasts. They have all the characteristics of it and those procedures are relatively uncomplicated. The procedures for the male genitalia are far more concerning. One procedure is ochectomy or simply castration. That's chosen in about 5% of cases and that will permanently obviously end any hopes for fertility. It's been done throughout history. We know that there's been in the Bible you read about eunuchs, for instance, who are castrated so they can be around women in a concubine or a harem historically. The next procedure is a pnectomy that's simply removing the penis. Cutting it off and sewing it shut so there's no penis there whatsoever. Then the urine has to drain out through a stump. The next procedure is called the penile inversion vaginal plastic. There the penis is open long wise. It's called this tissue is quart out and then it's inverted and it's stuffed back inside the pelvis as a blind ending pouch. Again the problem is urine drainage and there's no way that it manages normal secretion so it tends to get infected or have a bad odor and doesn't drain urine appropriately. These procedures are all sterilizing for the young boys. Very complicated the procedures I mentioned have 30, 40, 50% complication rates. Most of the data come from the Netherlands and Europe that have had a history in doing these procedures. I do find it interesting that Finland, the Netherlands, the UK, multiple countries now are banning transgender medicine having such a bad experience with it over the last 5 to 10 years. Some of you may be following famed psychologist Jordan Peterson in Canada and he summarized this on a lot of his podcast. I refer you to him on this. He's taken a strong stance that transgender medicine creates more harm than good. I've had on our program Dr. Mariam Grossman and planned to have her back who's the world's most famous child psychiatrist. She's said very clearly that the best treatment or cure for gender dysphoria or gender ambiguity in a child who's struggling is to go through natural puberty. That way it's cleared up, it's clarified. A boy becomes a man, a girl becomes a woman. There's always some degree of gender dysphoria or uncomfortableness with one's gender as they approach puberty. The other important theme in all of this, and I made it clear in my expert report for the Texas Attorney General, is that a lot of the interest in transgender medicine is driven through autism. We learned through analyses, multiple analyses, they're all my courageous discourse sub-stack that autistic children are far more likely to feel ostracized. That's a major driver for being suggestible and then when they're approached by counselors or by peers or others, they can be convinced that they're in the wrong gender, they're in the wrong body and they should try to change their body into the opposite gender. Then a paper was published by Warrior and colleagues analyzing people in the LGBT community. It turns out that they test very high for autism. We know the back analysis on this suggests that autism is playing a major role. Then finally, the autism advocacy network, they are strongly supporting transgender medicine and they are working to try to overturn these state bans on transgender medicine. autism is driving the transgender-agenda autism in the 1960s. It was one in 10,000 and now it's one in 36 and becoming ever more common. As we have greater and greater numbers of autistic children and young adults, we can expect this drive for transgender medicine to continue. In the net analysis, there's far more harm than good and no good doctor or nurse or psychologist would participate in transgender medicine. The true role of gender affirmation is actually affirming the gender at birth. That is a little boy who's born a boy needs to be affirmed through the course of childhood that he will become a man. The same is true for a little girl, that she will be affirmed by the parents and those at daycare and child care and school. That's what gender affirmation is to affirm the gender at birth. Gender affirmation is not to encourage people to change their bodies to try to live out a fantasy as the opposite gender. Everything I've said applies to children, those under age 18. Once individuals become adults, I recognize that there's a small portion of individuals who do find the same sex more attractive and become homosexual. Over the course of adulthood in medicine, I've always taken care of these patients my entire career. I've taken care of transgender medicine patients and obese people and thin people, people of all different racial and ethnic groups, taking care of prisoners, criminals, CEOs. Medicine is the most diverse and accepting of all the professions. I speak on behalf of all the doctors, the allied health professions and nursing, that we take care of each and every patient without any prejudice, without any degree of racism at all. We would never be prejudiced against individuals who are in the LGBT community. If they make this decision as adults and they're willing to pay for these procedures and surgeries, I think it's perfectly fine. Now in 2016, the Obama administration wrote into Obamacare that gender change procedures, hormones and surgery would be paid by the federal government, CMS, Medicare, Medicaid and had to be paid by commercial insurance. I personally think that's wrong, that we shouldn't have to foot the bill for these types of choices. They are elective choices and we'll have to leave that discussion for another day. So I want to move on to the back side. Our featured guest today is Dr. Stanley Gofar, performer dean of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. His personal friend of mine for several decades and he's going to introduce his viewpoints on this, how he got into this great controversy in medicine and his new not-for-profit organization to take a look at, do no harm.

Join us as we explore the most important issues of our time. AmericaOut Loud Talk Lead. It's a fight for the soul of humanity. I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, your host of AmericaOut Loud Talk Radio and courageous discourse. It's my great pleasure to welcome to the microphone, actually the virtual studio, Dr. Stanley Gofar, former professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and a dean of education there. He has taken up the charge on protecting in many ways civil liberties, guarding us against racial discrimination and importantly being a voice of reason in the transgender crisis. Dr. Gofar, welcome. Hi, Peter. It's great to be with you. It really is. Give us an update. We had you on AmericaOut Loud Talk Radio, but some of my video audience has not had a chance to meet you. Just really quickly, just give a brief introduction of your career where you are now. Sure. Well, I was an academic physician at Penn, as you mentioned, for over 50 years of professor of medicine there. The foreologist worked with you on some very interesting projects that we had in the past and medical issues, always respected your judgment and your heterodox thinking, which was always extraordinarily valuable. So I congratulate you for that. I finished my career as the associate dean for curriculum and I became very upset with what I saw as trends in medical education where diversity was starting to become more important than getting the best and the brightest students to become physicians and to promote faculty based on their clinical acumen and their research productivity rather than their views on how political ideology should play out. That led me to write something in the Wall Street Journal that produced a big explosion on MedTwitter, something called MedTwitter. And then I wrote a book after that, a title of the book was Take 2 Asprins Called We Bought My Promounds About My Concerns About Healthcare and Medicine. And then we started Do No Harm in April of 2022. And with a view that let's do something about these issues and let's not just talk about them. So we've had an organization that I think has been very active, particularly in two areas. Besides just trying to inform the public as much as we can, we've been active in the legislative and the legal world to try to make changes in some of these areas. I've been delighted to talk to you about them. Tell us a little bit about the aims of the organization. So we see ourselves as really being most interested in making sure that people are treated as individuals rather than as members of a group. So our view in healthcare has been that there's this progressive view to treat black patients as a member of a group of minority patients that need to be treated differently from all other patients rather than treat them as individuals and identify their problems. And that's led to this idea that there ought to be separate protocols for black patients that there should be so-called health equity, which means treating black patients differently than white patients in order to achieve some sort of elimination of healthcare disparities, which will definitely not be something that's going to be successful. And so we're against that and we're against all manifestations of this notion of treating people as part of the group. And then we saw that the same thing was happening with the so-called gender affirming care. Now we focus specifically on children and the idea that children will suddenly decide that they really need to change their gender or to be treated with puberty blockers and the hormones and even ultimately surgery. And again, it's this where instead of being seen as individuals with individual problems, typically lots of psychological problems that produce this desire, they're being treated as, oh, you're a trans kid. And as soon as they say, I think I'm trans, they're started down this pathway of transitioning, ultimately leading to God knows why, probably personal disaster for many of them. And as someone just said to us recently, one of the members of SEGUM, which is the Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine, a really wonderful group that's really fighting against gender affirming care, said, you know, this probably isn't going to stop until the body stops to start to pile up just the way it happened with the opioid epidemic. So we're trying to prevent that from happening. But in each case, those are our goals, our goals are to get rid of this idea that people ought to be seen as members of a group rather than as individuals. Well, isn't this members of a group stand? Isn't this somewhat weaponized? For example, a child who has gender ambiguity, if there's a claim that that child is a transsexual, then it's weaponized to make the case that, well, you have to respect them as a different person. You can't do anything else. They've basically self-declared in a unit, and therefore, once the declaration is made, it kind of drives the whole agenda. Yeah, absolutely. I think, you know, you've had Dr. Miriam Grossman on your show, and she's written a wonderful book that you've made sure the public was aware of, so-called, lost in transnation. And she outlines all this, where it becomes a train. And there are a bunch of people that, unfortunately, now are starting to benefit from this physicians and other healthcare workers, and institutions are benefiting from this, unfortunately, probably on the basis of some monetary rewards that they're getting for treating these patients. But also, I think they're true believers, and they've traded in evidence-based medicine for opinion-based medicine. And- How can that be at these academic institutions? You know, do no harm. That goes back to the Hippocratic oath. And no surgeon would do an operation on a normal body to do harm. And no medical doctor would prescribe hormones to a normal body with no disease. Yes. You know, it's a very interesting sort of social phenomenon. And you know, John McWhorter in his book talks about woke religion, and it's sort of become a creed amongst these people. This is a real thing, that every child that thinks they're in the wrong gender is in fact correct, that they are in the wrong gender, that this is a common medical problem instead of an extraordinarily rare phenomenon that probably only truly influences a handful of kids. They may have- They may be some children with real developmental problems. The way they develop with their ideas about sexual attraction and other sorts of things. Dr. Bailey, a professor at Northwestern, is laid out. Many of these abnormalities in sexual development, but clearly for the vast majority of these children, as you've pointed out on your show, this is some sort of social phenomenon where there being- It's a trend amongst kids. Why the medical world has adopted this is really hard to say. I think it's mostly been a few activists that have pushed this idea. Somehow it's become a known phenomenon that these are an oppressed group of people. Through critical race theory, any oppressed group of people needs to have special kinds of dispensations and treatment in a special fashion. Anybody who argues against that is then seen as either a transphobe in the area of transgender medicine or as a racist in the area of sort of so-called healthcare disparities. It's all nonsense. It's a gigantic lie. It's totally nonsensical. People that are concerned about these children's welfare, not people that hate transphobes. Our organization says nothing about adults who want to go and change their body. I think it's a bad idea for many people, but they're adults and they have a right to make these decisions. Why the healthcare world has sort of gone down this path? I think if you act a visit, push that people are afraid to speak up. They're afraid to be labeled as racist or transphobes and therefore it's better to keep quiet and let a few people carry out these kinds of activities. But Stan, this is going on at really top tier medical. Is it going on at Penn? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. Children's Hospital of Philadelphia is a leader in this field. The great famous one now has been the Washington University of St. Louis, one of the great medical centers in the country and the world. The whistleblower there, Jamie Reed, who signed a declaration of affidavit where she was a worker. She's a woman of the left. She has a partner who's a transgender person and she just felt like she could not stand anymore with these children being sort of railroaded into this pathway of puberty blockers and hormonal treatments and even surgeries. That's one of the great institutions in the country in the world without question. University of Washington, Seattle, another famous institution. They have a website where they specifically say we do not provide any psychological care and they're trying to promote transgender changes in the community by giving primary care physicians some algorithms and how to care for these children. It's clear that this is a group that needs incredible psychological support and really should not be treated as if this is just another minor medical problem. Yeah, I featured on this program data that show that this gender journey actually changing genders increases the psychiatric burden of care, increases mortality of all causes. And Stan, it's astonishing that doctors would do this and nurses would participate in doing this. I was told by a family medicine doctor that on a family medicine board exam now, there's a question about a child with gender dysphoria approaching puberty and the correct answer is to start puberty blockers. Yes, yes. We actually highlighted that on our website that we had someone who gave us a source who gave us that tip as well. Yeah, it's really quite extraordinary. And the latest sort of area you want up to date of what we're actually up to has been our attempt and the attempt of others to try to get medical societies to really look at the evidence right now that argues in fact that this sort of transgender affirming care should be stopped. Now, as you know, and as you've reported for countries in Europe, Sweden, Norway, Finland and the United Kingdom now have severely curtailed any of this transgender treatment for children. It's not they haven't eliminated it and the opponents say, see, they really haven't eliminated it because they understand that there is a historical condition that affected very rare children who there was some rationale for putting them through some sort of changes. We're talking about something that happens one in a million. Now it's like, you know, it's like 10,000, or it's supposed to be the ones who are being affected by this. And so we're really trying to get American medical professional societies to look at this issue. And we've written extensively to the endocrine society, which is made up of adult endocrinologists as well as pediatric endocrinologists, to get them to do a systematic review of the current literature, which will show that there is no good evidence to support this treatment just as these European countries have understood. And now recently, Leora Sapeer and the Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine have pushed the American Academy of Pediatrics to do a review. And they've agreed to do such a review. The endocrine society has been resistant and we've tried to get any members of the endocrine society, some of them are members of our organization, Dunoharm, to put pressure on their organization. They should be doing science and they should be doing careful evaluations instead of affirming this as being an acceptable treatment. In the face of these four major progressive European countries, not known for their conservative viewpoints, looking at their own experience and saying, you know, we think we're harming more children than we're helping and we need to curtail this dramatically. Yeah, I think certainly they should look at the actions of those countries. It was very prominent in the British Medical Journal announcement that puberty blockers would be banned during the childhood years. Now, one of the things that struck me is on the surgical outcomes. So you and I are medicine doctors. So we're used to outcomes from medical studies, but the surgical outcomes, in my view, need to be carefully reviewed. I've seen astronomical rates of surgical complications, need for reoperation, you know, unintended consequences of these surgeries regarding urologic manifestations of problems urinary leakage. You know, taking and doing an operation on a normal human body and making it better is very hard to do. And you know, there are some techniques that, you know, adult people choose women, you know, can certainly she choose and do plastic surgery to influence their appearance. But beyond that, in a growing child, it's very hard to do an elective surgery in a normal body and anticipate what's going to happen in the outcomes. And it's certainly not good. I can give you an update from Texas. There was a bill passed and finally signed into law by Governor Abbott banning transgender medicine, essentially before the age of 18. And that was set to go into effect September 1, 2023. And then immediately the American Civil Liberties Union filed an injunction against that. So the law, the ban is currently state. And now it's in the courts. Stan, what is it about the American Civil Liberties Union? They were absent during COVID when those people's rights were taken away from them all over the place. And suddenly they're out in force on the transgender crisis. What is it about the ACLU and transgender that is really driving this? Again, I sort of go back to this is a worldview that describes the critical race theory and critical race theory specifically says now it talks of it's in the context of race, but it's extended through so-called intersectionality to many other groups. Any group that doesn't represent white men basically is a group that's being oppressed by white men. And therefore any group that you can identify that you could possibly come to support that is considered to be oppressed will be a target of such support. And I think it's that mentality. So the mentality is, and the other issue of course with many of these groups that are supporting this is for years they supported gay rights. And once gay marriage became something that was acceptable and approved and no longer seen as some sort of, by at least the country from a legal perspective as any sort of a deviant kind of behavior but represented a normal judgment that people could make and it was acceptable in society. These organizations had to find something else because otherwise they're funding with dry up. And that's part of it. I have no doubt that that's part of it. So now they've decided this is a group that transgender individuals who certainly have been discriminated against. There's no question about that adults and they shouldn't be discriminated against if they don't do any harm to anyone else. I understand that. But suddenly it became not only something to say let's make sure that they're not discriminated against. It became something to celebrate. And the same with the gender affirming children. It's something to celebrate because now you're speaking up for an oppressed group. And we should speak up for oppressed groups when it comes to something that we really can do something about or there are oppression is something that we can relieve. But we shouldn't be speaking up for groups that are actually producing harm like the individuals who are pushing gender affirmation care, so-called gender affirmation care for children or groups that are pushing treating physicians as racist people in order to improve the outcome for black patients when in fact that's not the problem. That's not what black patients have disparate outcomes at all because of the way physicians are treating them. But rather it's a very complex genetic cultural behavioral kind of issue that really needs a very different kind of approach. You know, I'm going to say we want to see people do better. We want to see these children do better. We want to see them get much better health care than they're getting in terms of their psychological care. If they decide they need to undergo gender transition, we want to see D-transitioners, kids that have gone through gender transition and have realized that it wasn't for them and that they were really harmed by. We want to see them get proper care. Right now they don't get good insurance coverage and they're sort of ignored by all these organizations that have guidelines for how to put children through transition but not what to do once they want to stop undergoing transition. So that's what we're interested in. We're interested in better outcomes. We're not interested in stopping things. We're interested in a better outcome for people and the current approach is to either gender affirming care or this idea of treating black people differently because of their race, because of their skin color. These are bad ideas that are just harming people. They're not benefiting anyone. You know, I think a lot of people don't know this but the physician workforce is probably the most diverse workforce in the modern day economy. My son just graduated from medical school and 9% of his class were white male. Yeah. Now theoretically, if they got to zero white males, they'd be 100% diverse. So the inverse of diversity is zero white male. But boy, it's hard to get more diverse than that. It's slightly more weight. It's a very interesting thing. One of the things our organization is very interested in is this idea that we need to have racial concordance between patients and physicians. That's one of the arguments for increasing the number of various minorities going into medicine because that's going to improve outcomes. And it's interesting if you look at the newspaper reports or even the tones put out by the double AMC, the regulatory body for American medical schools, they claim that there's good evidence that that improves health outcomes for black patients. And the truth is there is no good evidence for that. There is only one study that shows that there's any effect of the race of the physician on the health outcome of the patient, the black patient, that's a positive study. And that study is a study of neonates in Florida. It's been roundly criticized as not really being accurate because they could not assess how sick the children were cared for by black physicians versus white physicians, neonatologists. And that's it. The rest of the literature just does not support this idea. And yet this has become the rationale for organizations like the American Medical Association, but the Association of American Medical Colleges to say we must increase the number of minority physicians because that's the only way we're going to improve the health care of black people. And it's nonsense. It's not true. There's no evidence for it. And yet it's just another example of sort of the being lie coming to an important aspect of American life, the health care system. You know, and there's very little room to go. It's almost all minorities right now. So like I say, it's only 9% white men. If my son's class is any representation. So there's very little room to go to become more diverse. So Stan, let's transition now to some updates. But you, I'm on, I joined your organization. Do no harm. I think everybody listening is interested in this topic should donate, support your organization. I joined fully. And you've been sending out some email updates that I've been interested in. So I should update our audience on your developments. Yeah, there've been a lot of developments. Here was one really nice one recently, which is in Kentucky where we have a nurse, Laura Morgan, who's worked with us. Laura has a very interesting story that was actually written up in the Wall Street Journal of a few months back. She was a nurse who worked at Baylor and White Clinic in, the, Scott and White Clinic, I'm sorry, in Texas, and she, which is part of Baylor Medical School. And she was, she was fired because she was right in the bias study that she had to take. She had a course that she had to take and implicit bias and then take a quiz afterwards. And she refused to say that she thought that physician bias and nurse bias was the basis for poor outcomes. And she was fired because of this. And she's sort of taken it upon herself to really be conscious of what's gone on around the country for nurses and Kentucky Nursing Association demanded that nurses to get their license renewed have to take implicit bias training. And she fought against this. There was a story in the Washington Examiner about this. And we just heard that the Kentucky Nurses Association has decided to eliminate this. Now, this issue of having physicians and other healthcare workers take implicit bias training is another strong approach that's been taken by many organizations to get rid of what they call systemic racism in healthcare. We know that implicit bias training is a total waste of time, money, and that in fact it has the opposite effect when it's been really looked at. It tends to get people more angry because they feel like it doesn't represent the way they deal with their colleagues or with patients. And that's not to say there aren't people in the world who treat other people poorly, but this doesn't mean that it's a systematic problem. It means it's an individual problem if it even exists in any numbers. So that's been a big win for us. We're very pleased about that. The other thing that we've been involved in, of course, is we've been helping to support these laws that have blocked transgender medicine. And it's now been our efforts have been led to at least 18 states now and others are on the way, mostly in the Midwest who have passed laws. Now, you mentioned the fact that in Texas it's been enjoined. And one of our people, one of our efforts in fighting against the endocrine societies position is that what typically happens in these, when the laws are enjoined, is that the judges do this because what the judges say is, well, you talking to the complainant saying, how can you tell me to stop these to pursue these laws when all these medical societies say that these laws are a good eye, that these efforts are a proper. And we want the judges to understand that this is not really what the science shows. And once we can get these societies to speak up and say, you know, we've looked at it carefully and we're not so sure that this is the best thing, that will help these laws to be enacted and to become effective. You know, I guess what was going through my mind is, are there any exemplary high level medical centers that have said, no, that we're not, we're not going in on this? Well, we forced some to do it. I mean, the one, for example, Vanderbilt, Vanderbilt has now said that they're not going to be doing this anymore because, you know, Tennessee has passed the law. I mean, that's the problem in order to get these, these centers to step up and do the right thing. We've had to have laws passed in the states to say that this is against the law in your state. And unfortunately, is it going to drive people to go to other states, possibly, you know, but I think what we're hoping is that these institutions will understand that they really need to give these children psychotherapy. And we're not saying the children shouldn't be treated. They should be treated with psychotherapy. As Dr. Grossman said on your program, you know, the way to treat psychological problems is with psychological treatments, not with surgery. Oh, yeah. And Stan, she said something else that really stuck with me. She says the best cure for gender dysphoria is let the child go through normal puberty. That normal puberty changes not only the body, but the mind and really secures a man and a woman and they're all their characteristics. So it's so common to have some ambiguity, some discomfort, you know, emotionally, physically approaching puberty. I think everybody, you know, has gone through that. But the idea to intercept a child and then irreversibly change them with hormones and surgery, I can tell you as a doctor, I couldn't go along with it today. I actually had an interview in the library at University of Texas, Southwestern and Dallas and I graduated there as a top graduate. And, you know, I was chosen as the top 30 graduates in the history of the school. It was a wonderful honor. But do you know that that center is also participating in transgender matters? And it's something I can't be proud of as a doctor. Yeah, no, I know. It's the best and the brightest are involved in this, which is just bizarre. And I think someday, I think you've had Cola and your program as well. Haven't you have? She's the young woman who works with us who's a D-transitioner. So just to tell your audience her story, she was a tomboy. She had autism and she readily speaks about this. And then she went to her pediatrician and they said, yeah, you're a trans child. She said she was interested in that. She felt alienated from her peers. So she ended up starting on puberty blockers and then hormones and then had her breast removed when she was 16. That's one of the things that the people who support this keep saying is that we're not doing any of these surgeries on children and yet here are the children that they've done the surgeries on. And then she realized that was a terrible mistake and that she now has lost her breast. She has, as you mentioned, surgical complications. She has weeping wounds to where she had that. She has lots of genital problems, lots of urinary tract problems all related to the hormones that she was on. And now she's a really brilliant, very, very lovely young woman. She testified in front of Congress and it just illustrates this issue that there are people that are really being harmed by this in a really awful way. And yet the best and the brightest institutions are allowing this sort of thing to go on. It's a very strange phenomenon. To tell you what else we're up to, we're also supporting a lawsuit that just was filed in California. We decided to take on a blue state as well, not just the red states. And we have one of our senior fellows, Dr. Marilyn Singleton, who's a black physician. She is an anesthesiologist and she's now, I think, retired. And she's suing the state of California along with another physician because she does not want to take implicit bias training as a requisite for her to get her license renewed. And there are several states in the country that are sort of demanding this, including Massachusetts and Minnesota, I believe, or Michigan rather, Massachusetts and Michigan. And so because this, you know, A is a big waste of time. It's a big waste of money and it sends a terrible message. You know, if the idea is that we're trying to get patients to trust their physicians and to trust the health care system, to go around and tell them, you know, we've got to make sure your physician is trained because we know they're biased against you and we've got to do all we can to eliminate this bias. It's a terrible dynamic to impose on the American people. And yet that's really what's going on. So that lawsuit was just filed and we're going to take it right through to conclusion. It's one of four or five lawsuits that we've been involved in all with the same theme of not trying to get money out of anyone, but trying to get them to change practices that are clearly, you know, against American constitutional thought, treating people differently based on race and excluding, you know, whites and Asians from access to things like medical scholarships and employment opportunities. That's the sort of thing that we're against. And, you know, Dr. Ed, Mr. Ed Bloom, who was the head of the Students for Fair Admissions, the group that Sue Harvard and UNC had their case supported by the Supreme Court recently. He's one of our board members and we're very proud of that. He's a wonderful person and that idea that we want to make sure that there's no discrimination going on in this country in any way, shape, or form. That's what our legal strategy is all about in our legislative strategy as well. Yeah. Give us a bit of an update on your group in terms of, in members affiliated with it, in terms of what's going on in Capitol Hill. Yes. Well, you know, the thing is, of course, as you well know, healthcare is really a state run activity. So most of our legislative efforts are aimed at the states. Having said that, there are oversight functions that the federal government has involved in. We recently worked with the House Oversight Committee on Education to get them to query the accrediting agency for medical schools to ask whether they really demand that schools engage in various diversity activities in order to gain to maintain their accreditation. Because that's one of the things that the medical schools have said. If you stop us from focusing on diversity as opposed to meritocracy, we're going to lose our accreditation. That always seemed to rather bizarre claim. And so we spoke with the House Committee and the committee was very interested. They did their due diligence and the head of the committee, Dr. Fox, from North Carolina, the member of the House of Representatives, sent a letter to the LCME, the liaison committee on medical education, the accrediting agency, to ask them, you know, what's the story? What is your diversity requirements? And they reported back that no, they really don't have any. It's up to each individual school. So this idea that this is some sort of requirement of accreditation is nonsense. So that's been one example of our work on Capitol Hill. But most of our efforts have been at the state level, as I mentioned, in Tennessee, in Kentucky, in Kansas, Missouri, Utah. We've done some work in Texas and in Wisconsin. So in Ohio is another target that we're going to have to try to get both laws that prohibit DEI. I'll just mention some of the DEI efforts that we're engaging with. We want to stop this idea that positions need to take implicit bias training and other kinds of DEI courses to get devices. We want to have transparency in medical school admissions. If the state-funded medical schools are taking in kids because of their skin color, as opposed to who's really the most qualified, we want the members of the states to know that their tax money is going towards that. So we want that to occur. We want these schools to stop spending money on DEI bureaucracies by bringing in consultants that cost huge amounts of money. For example, in Tennessee, we know that the state spends over $3 million at the University of Tennessee in their DEI bureaucracy. And this is money that, if they're worried about how students can pay for medical education, spend those $3 million on scholarships for medical students, don't waste your money on this sort of thing. So that's what our legislative efforts are focused on. And then, of course, in the gender affirming care, it's to stop this treatment and force careful study of the issues and come to some point in the future where only children that would benefit from this, the rare, rare child that might benefit from this, is the one who goes through this, and that this automatic treatment of kids, as soon as they express some gender unease, that they get put on these pathways, that this is stopped, no longer is allowed. Yeah, Stan, it seems like this quickly got into the courts. Have you ever been asked, or your group's been asked to just be at a debate at one of the major medical meetings regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion, or regarding transgender medicine? And is this ever something we can have a counterpoint at at a major meeting? You know, I was once invited right before the COVID epidemic to come to the AAMC and to state my opinion, because I had written a few things at that point. But then COVID hit, and now it would be totally impossible. As you know, as you've been canceled, I've been canceled in many arenas. And you know, the view is that, again, unless you're labeled a racist or a transphobe by your peers, your peers are suspect. This is, you know, McCarthyism now brought to the other end of the political spectrum, and anybody who, who, G.E.S. Keep, it has a taint of thinking, I think, just logically or clearly, is viewed as someone who has real moral flaws in their character. And that just can't be allowed. We could not be allowed to speak at these organizations. And it's to their utter shame, I think, that they don't let people like you stand up there and state the issues for them. Just have a, we used to be able to do that. And I agree with you, it was before COVID, it seemed like to me everything was fine. And then we went through the pandemic, and now there's just, there's no point, counterpoint on any of these issues. I just want to spend the last few minutes and get your commentary on all of this, what's called gender indoctrination in the schools. The teachers are reporting pornography and the K through 12 textbooks, sex clubs after school, bathroom controversies, men and women's sports. Stan, how does all that relate to what we've been talking about? Yeah, no, I think it's all part and parcel of this idea of the way that people interact with other people is through either an oppressor, a pressy, and that that's, when you really strip it all the way, it's kind of this, you know, this Marxist view of there's an elite group that is imposing its will on others and this is a pushback for it. You know, our organization has been very careful about sticking in our very narrow lanes of, you know, healthcare and children's transgender alterations through either social transformation or the various medicalization. We haven't strayed into these areas. People are not sensing what it's like for the vast majority of kids who have to be exposed to this and in the worry about the rare child that is the transgender person or the person that's seeking to seek a bathroom that's different from their gender. So it's sort of become this terror controlled by the minority of what majority life is like. And I think, you know, you have to worry about the minority, you have to make sure people aren't being oppressed, but at the same time, I think the majority does have rights and the majority does have the opportunity for privacy. And I can imagine, you know, any of us that have grandchildren or children of a tender age, thinking that they're going to be exposed to this stuff, you know, the discussion goes on amongst adults, but it's the children who are suffering over all these kinds of approaches. And I think what's gone on in the schools has been absolutely outrageous. And, you know, organizations like parents defending education and no left-turner education, these are very powerful organizations. They're mostly mothers who saw what their children were being exposed to and said, this is absurd. We don't want this. And you don't have a right to impose this on us. And the schools don't have a right to tell us how to raise our children from a moral perspective. Their job is to educate them about history and civics and math and science, not to give, not to determine what their personalities are going to be like or what their moral values are going to be like. And that's for parents. That's a religion. And that's for the family to determine those things. It certainly is, Dan, we're going to have to leave it here. This has been a great update. I want to congratulate you personally as a friend and an academic leader for really having courage and stepping forward in a time where it seems to me as if, you know, an unnecessary crisis has come down upon us and it does have these threads of authoritarianism, totality, authoritarianism, censorship, stripping away of civil liberties. And no one can really figure out what's behind it. But gosh, we are all affected by it. The vast majority of Americans, people in health care, we're uncomfortable right now. And I think you're showing the world how we can have civil discourse, how we can do things reasonably and rationally. And actually how we can use the tools of the legal system as well as legislation to try to get some balance. So Stan Gulfar, thank you so much. Thank you Peter. That means a lot coming from you. So thank you very much."
