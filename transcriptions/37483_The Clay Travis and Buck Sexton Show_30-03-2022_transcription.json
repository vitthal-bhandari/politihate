If you're 19 or older with chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes, COPD, or heart disease, or are 65 or older, you are at increased risk for pneumococcal pneumonia. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about PrevNAR 20, pneumococcal 20-valent conjugate vaccine. It can help protect you against pneumococcal pneumonia in just one dose. Even if you've already been vaccinated with other pneumonia vaccines, PrevNAR 20 may help provide added protection. PrevNAR 20 is approved for adults to help prevent infections from 20 strains of the bacteria that cause pneumococcal pneumonia. Continue to prove it may depend on a supportive study. Don't get PrevNAR 20 if you've had a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine or its ingredients. Adults with weakened immune systems may have a lower response to the vaccine. Side effects include pain and swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pain. For full prescribing information, please call 1-855-213-2138 or visit PrevNAR 20.com. Have you heard about Vivgard, F-GART TIGAMOD-alpha-F-CAD? Ask your neurologist if Vivgard could be right for you and learn more at Vivgard.com-slash-learn. That's v-y-v-g-a-r-t.com-slash-learn. Brought to you by Argenics. Now we have the Disney situation. Let's just be quite clear about this. Disney has decided that it's going to put out statements attacking the governor of Florida Ronda-Santis, but also the state legislature, which is Republican majority right now, passed this law about not indoctrinating children into sexual identity and gender ideology and all this other stuff, at least until the third grade. That's all that it says. Nursery school through third grade. Please don't teach kids about trans and pansexuality and bisexuality and cisgender identity and all this stuff. Just like let kids be kids and let parents introduce children to that in their own way, on their own time. Don't get ahead of them. Why is the left so freaked out about this? I mean, I got to tell you, the blue haired, masked up in their profile photos, Twitter, Roddy are coming after me big time right now. They're very upset with me because I pointed out that this Disney situation is not only about what the executives at Disney think about themselves, their politics, their own families. They want to use Disney content friends. The great American content company of Walt Disney Co. To indoctrinate your kids, they're saying this out loud on video to lots of people in the company watching. Now, I'm not, I'm not making this up. I'm not exaggerating it. They are saying this out loud. Isn't it amazing? You wonder why did they get so upset about this bill? And why is it that even Ron DeSantis is formidable press secretary, Ms. Christina Poussaint has had to point out that there seems to be a grooming aspect in mind for so many of the individuals here who want to indoctrinate children into certain belief systems when they're in kindergarten or first grade. Think about that for a moment. Sexual identity politics to a kindergartner. When I was a kindergartner, I thought I was a stegosaurus some days. I didn't expect that I'd have people trying to, and we've seen some cases, maybe not just indoctrinate, but gender transition small children change their name without telling parents this stuff is happening. It's happening in schools in this country. This is real. Here is Disney president of content, Carrie Burke. You've got to hear this. Play clip 10. I'm here as a mother of two queer children, actually, one trans gender child and one pansexual child, and also as a leader. And that was the thing that really got me because I have heard so much from so many of my colleagues over the course of the last couple of weeks and open forums and through emails and phone conversations. I feel a responsibility to speak, not just for myself, but for them. To all of us, we had an open forum last week, a 20th, where again, the home of really incredible groundbreaking LGBTQIA stories over the years, where one of our execs stood up and said, you know, we only have a handful of queer leads in our content. And I went, what? That can't be true. And I realized, oh, it actually is true. Just to use her terminology, this is deeply concerning to the president of content at Disney that there aren't enough queer leads. Now, this is one of these times where I always wonder, well, the term queer, what she is using here. At one point, people treated that as though it was a slur, right? But now it is being used again. So this is the word we're supposed to use. It's really tough to keep up, is my point. What words are allowed, what words are not? They'll attack you. And let me tell you, as Dave Chappelle has dubbed them, the alphabet people, the alphabet activists, they're ruthless. They're ruthless. They are drunk with power. They're able to destroy people's careers and lives based upon the most minor offense against the constantly changing agenda, particularly of the trans agenda. And yet, here we are, this is Disney. This is not the MSNBC comment section, a section. This is Disney. I mean, this woman refers to her own, she says, I have a child who is trans and a child who is pan gender. Now, pansexual rather. Now, first of all, nobody knows what the heck pansexual means. And I think it's so funny, all these blue-haired lives, because I pointed this out on Twitter, they're attacking me. And I'm trying to explain to them, no, no, no, I know you think you know what it means, but it's absurd. Pansexual is supposed to mean attracted to somebody irrespective of gender, to which I say, okay, so now we have to do this thing where there are 37 genders, and you're attracted to all of them. But how do you know that? If you don't even know what all the 37 genders are, oh, well, you're just open to anything and everything gender-wise. Hmm. Okay. How is that different than bisexual? Oh, because there aren't two genders. Oh, actually, I disagree. Ah, so this is a make-belief term that in that sense, right? There are people who will say they're attracted to men and attracted to women. Pansexual then would mean expanding that to attract it to anybody regardless of their gender and beyond two genders, you see. This is what the term actually means. So the head of the head of Disney content, the president of Disney content, remember, this is the person who, if you write, you know, if you're trying to come up with a screenplay, if you want to work with Disney pictures, she has final say over what gets made. Think about that. She is involved in the creative process for what kind of cartoons your kids will see under the Disney seal. She's saying she has a transgender child and a pansexual child. So here we are. What are the chances, by the way, that that's not a reflection of her ideology as infused through her children? I'm just going to put that out there. She just so happens to be a wacko leftist who happens to have children that have have gender preferences that 99% of America has to look up and say, wait, what is that pansexual? I think it's hilarious to these activists, oh, sorry, you're so ignorant. They make up these terms. If I make up a word five minutes ago, or if I decide that I'm going to widely apply a word that was in the fringe of psychiatry in the early 1920s or 1930s, which is what they say about pansexual. No, it's not reasonable to have an expectation that any person would know what the heck they're talking about. But she keeps going. And remember, this is about policy for a major company that is picking a fight with America's best governor, Ron DeSantis. Disney is picking a fight over a law right now in the state of Florida where I am currently sitting. And Disney is also telling people stuff like this, playclip 11. We have many, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories. And yet we don't have enough leads and narratives in which gay characters just get to be characters and not have to be about gay stories. And so that's been very eye-opening for me. And I can tell you it's something that I feel perhaps had this moment not happened. I as a leader and me as my colleagues would not have focused on and going forward, I certainly will be more so. I know that we will be and I hope this is a moment where shoot the 50% of the tears. Sorry, I'm coming. We just don't allow each other to go backwards. It's almost crying as she's talking about this. Because half of Disney lead characters are not members of the LGBTQIA plus, and that is the acronym community. She's crying. This is a very wealthy influential adult female who is crying because half of cartoon leads are not trans or non-binary or non-gender conforming or pansexual. And as I keep saying, this is a Disney. This isn't at some conference of women and gender studies associate professors in Oregon. This is Disney. And there's more. Oh, there's more. She's not even the only one who's talking about this kind of stuff. I'll come back in a moment and remember, they want, you're seeing this now. This has been exposed. They want your kids to be brainwashed with this stuff through content and yes, through school. That's what's actually going on right now in the country. That is what is happening. They are saying it out loud. Coming to more of that a second, you know, there'll be a time when you're considering the purchase of gold or silver, you've probably already given it some consideration.

So here is equality Florida executive director Nadine Smith telling Disney employees that Governor DeSantis, well, I'll let Smith say this play 12. When we react to this, a lot of us are reacting from the pain we experience to being isolated stigmatized in school. We're also reacting from the reality that when they can erase you, when they can criminalize your existence, when they can demonize who you are, the next step is to criminalize you and take your kids. Okay. So there are activists that Disney is hiring to speak to their workforce telling them that conservatives in the state of Florida and people like Ron DeSantis want to take away their children. Think about that for a second. So, you know, they're going to turn around and say, Oh, you guys are exaggerating and this isn't so big a deal. It's not so bad, whatever. They want to steal your kids. They say, well, that's going to get people very, very concerned, isn't it? Right. They're hearing this from someone that Disney's brought in. They're paying to teach them about all of this. And here's even the White House is Deputy Press Secretary Kate Beddingfield. Play eight. Both the president and Secretary Cardona spoke out very forcefully against the law. The president also put out a statement yesterday about the tragic impact of this kind of law, an incredibly vulnerable population. And he said that, you know, by signing this bill, the governor has chosen to target some of Florida's most vulnerable students and families all while under the guise of parents rights. So the Department of Education, as you noted, will continue, will monitor this law upon implementation to evaluate whether it violates federal civil rights law. And obviously, we will come back to you as we have more information on that. Oh, okay. Under the guise of parents rights, I hope the Democrats stay with all this stuff. I hope the Democrats continue to be the party of men and women's sports and teaching children. And I mean little kids, kindergarten, first grade, about pansexuality, cisgender identity paradigms. And I mean, think about this for a second, folks. Our school system doesn't do a good enough job teaching a majority of people to read and write and do simple arithmetic. But the left wants to make sure that little kids are being taught that there are, you know, dozens of gender identities out there. And that sexuality is in constant fluidity and you can be attracted to anyone at any time, at any reason, you know, or through pansexual ideology or whatever, whatever. I mean, it's, it's all just, you see, you notice how it is really kicking at the load bearing walls of civilization, how that's all just a part of this to destroying the family, destroying basic, basic norms within society. And for what? For what? I just want to bring it all down. They seek the destruction of the society that we have lived in up to this point and the replacement of it with something else. I mean, that is behind all of this. Just remember that. That is what's really going on here. And it's, it's appalling that there are so many people, so many Democrat elites who just go along with this absolute utter madness. It's, it's really crazy. And I got to tell you, I'm, I have to wonder at what point, you know, Democrats will give up on some of this in advance of the midterms. Oh, here is just because they're going to get annihilated if they keep this up. I mean, they better or else, you know, time to find another country to live in folks. Here is a Ron DeSantis who has been phenomenal on this issue and is not, not going to step back, not going to step down. Ron DeSantis, man, he is showing us how it's done. Play clip nine. I think they crossed the line. And you know, people asked me, you know, kind of about, you know, their posture on the bill. I said, you know what, if we would have put in the bill, that you were not allowed to have curriculum that discussed the oppression of the Uighurs in China, Disney would have endorsed that in a second. And that's the hypocrisy of this. And, you know, we're going to make sure we're fighting back when people are threatening our parents and threatening our kids. Absolutely the right thing to do. He gets it. He knows what's going on here. He understands what the other side is trying to get away with. And it's important that we don't let them. It's important that we don't let them lie about what's in this bill. We don't let them continue to brainwash children. This is a fight that we should have. Okay, this is about the future of the country. Talk about the lockdown of schools, which was clearly based, not on the science, but on what the Democrat teachers unions wanted, because they are thuggish, lazy, Democrat operatives running these teachers unions. It's appalling. We'll talk about that in a moment.

So we have, this is remarkable, Republicans expose uncommon CDC teachers union ties on COVID school reopening guidance in the report. This is on foxnews.com. And here's what you need to know. Republican lawmakers just sit in the house select sub subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis are releasing a report today revealing a CDC control and prevention official testimony claiming the agency coordinated with teachers unions at an extraordinary level in crafting its school reopening guidance despite the agencies earlier claims that such coordination was routine and non-political. And the interim report exclusively reviewed by Fox News Digital. Republicans wrote that emails between the American Federation of Teachers, the White House and the CDC show that the AFT's cozy relationship with the Biden administration's political leadership at the CDC positioned the union to impose line by line edits to the reopening guidance despite the CDC's past practice to keep draft guidance confidential line by line edits. Whatever the teachers union wanted, the teachers union got and that meant that meant the suffering of children and parents by the way who were left totally in the lurch when all of a sudden now they couldn't have their kids in school anymore. They had to figure out childcare situations for them. A lot of parents still had to work. A lot of parents were essential workers and that meant that they weren't able to just zoom from their couches. Libs don't care teachers unions money for politicians votes for politicians. Democrats want what they want. That's all that matters. Didn't matter about this. They forced the abusive children with masking after forcing the misery of children with the shutdowns of schools for months and months really over a year. And they should be held to account. Please, please remember this going into the midterm election, everybody and tell everybody who will listen. The teachers unions ran rough shot over the science and made the Democrats shut down the schools and the Democrats like the compliant little toadies of the teachers unions that the Democrat Party and Fauci and the CDC are. They went along with it. It was wrong. It was unethical. It was immoral. All right, that's it for today's Buck Sexton show, my friends. Thanks for hanging out with me.
