Gay rights icon Harvey Milk was a child molester and a peterist known for shacking up with troubled teenage boys. One of his long term boyfriends and please note the air quotes around that term was 16 years old mentally ill and suicidal. Milk was in his mid 30s at the time of this relationship again the air quotes. The gay rights hero prayed upon boys of this kind. He brainwashed them. In fact, he had a real affinity for brainwashing as he was friends with and a defender of cult leader Jim Jones once writing a letter to Jimmy Carter describing Jones as a quote man of the highest character. Milk had cult followers from the People's Temple working on his campaign and most of them would go just a few months later to commit mass suicide at a compound in South America. So that was Harvey Milk for you. But in spite of all this, in spite of Harvey Milk being essentially the Kevin Spacey of his time, the creepier, were meant to celebrate and honor him because he advanced the gay rights cause. He was a martyr for the cause were told even though he was murdered and he was murdered. But he was murdered when he was a city supervisor by a disgruntled employee for reasons that had nothing to do with homophobia. And the same guy also killed the mayor who was straight. And you never hear about the mayor poor guy. Nonetheless, Harvey Milk was gay and he was killed and that's enough to make him into the Jesus Christ of the gay rights movement, a man who died for the homophobic sins of all mankind. Since then, the mythology of Harvey Milk, again, the middle age man who sexually preyed upon high school boys has grown and expanded and been literally cemented into the public consciousness in the form of statues and memorials and all kinds of things. A few years ago, the post office proudly unveiled its new commemorative Harvey Milk, Harvey Milk stamps. And yesterday, a Navy ship, the USNS Harvey Milk was christened in the San Diego harbor. And there to do the honors was trans Navy veteran Paula Neera. Let's listen to that. Paula, would you please christen the ship? The United States of America, I christened the Harvey Milk. May God bless the ship and all who sail in her. Okay, wonderful. And Paula there sounds and looks just like a woman, right? Now, the good news is that USNS Harvey Milk will one day soon become a very inclusive and progressive coral reef at the bottom of the Pacific when it's destroyed by China in our coming war. Indeed, on the same day, that's a biological male named Paula was christening a ship named after a child molester. The Hill published an article revealing that our government is unnerved quote unquote by China's growing military capabilities from the article. It says America's defense establishment has watched threats from Beijing rapidly grow in multiple areas, including recent hypersonic missile tests and expanding nuclear arsenal, strides in space and cyber and seemingly daily threats to Taiwan. We're witnessing one of the largest shifts in global geo strategic power the world has witnessed. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Mark Millie said Wednesday when speaking about China's recent military advances, quote, they're clearly challenging us regionally and their aspiration is to challenge the United States globally. The potential shift in the global balance of power is worrisome to us officials and lawmakers. Yes, worrisome. So worrisome that the Defense Department is preparing us for this inevitable confrontation with a world superpower by recruiting and promoting women, emphasizing tolerance and diversity and focusing on the threat posed by the, you know, 25 white nationalists in the country, 23 of whom are federal agents, by the way, worrisome indeed. But aside from the implosion of our military, which is right now collapsing under the weight of its own wokeness, it says something about our broader society that Harvey Milk is the kind of man we honor. You know, a person in San Diego, a spectator in San Diego over the weekend, might have witnessed the coronation of the Harvey Milk Love boat and then walked downtown to pay respects at the George Floyd Memorial all in a day, you know, nice, nice day out on the town. These are the sorts of people we pay tribute to now, a cult loving peterist and a violent felon. And it's not just that both men were deeply flawed and guilty of horrific evils, though they were, is that neither achieved anything tremendously significant in their lives. And both are remembered today, mainly because their deaths proved useful to the left. They are victims and we are a culture which celebrates victimhood. Now, it would be bad enough if we were just tearing down the Columbus statues and military memorials, just taking the founders names off of schools and so on. If this was a general reaction against quote unquote problematic historical figures, problematic because they were men and not angels, sinners and not gods. And the end result was that we don't memorialize or honor or remember anyone out of an over abundance of shame for our fallen nature and a belief that no man can possibly be worthy of such treatment and death. If that was the case, it would be bad and it would be unhealthy. And I would resist it, but it wouldn't be nearly as bad as what is actually occurring. See, we're not experiencing a simple erasure of history as much as a reordering of it. So we're not getting rid of Columbus, Jefferson and Washington. We're replacing them and all the rest of our traditional heroes as well. When Mount Rushmore is finally blown to smithereens and it will be new faces will be carved on the mountainside. It won't be left alone. The new faces of George Floyd, Harvey Milk. It's hard to know who else will make the cut. I mean, the litmus test is that you must be worshipped by either BLM or the LGBT lobby. And you must have a compelling victim story. Whether the story is true or not. And most of the time it isn't. It doesn't matter if you accomplished anything. Accomplishments of anything are discouraged. Virtue is irrelevant also. So what we find is that all cultures need their mythic heroes. That's a need for a culture. There's a reason why every human society since the dawn of civilization and possibly even before that has built monuments to its ancestors. It's an irresistible human impulse that we all have. We must have some idea about our past. Now we cannot live in a pastless, futurless void. We have to know where we've been. We have to see the footsteps in the sand so that we know where to go. And what's true of individuals is also true of societies. You become what you admire. And so recently we followed the footsteps of great men who achieved great things. And so we continued to produce more great men who would blaze a path for the great men to come after them. But we don't care about greatness anymore. Actually, we hate it. Our heroes now are Harvey Milk and George Floyd. That's who we admire or are told to admire. And so that's who we will become. Now let's get to our five headlines. Well as we get into the holiday season, maybe you're one of those people that thinks ahead of time for Christmas. What gifts are going to get?

You know, pretty good weekend. I on not to brag about being a great husband or anything, but one of my anniversary gifts to my wife and I gave her was on Saturday, you know, I said go I got her booked her a day at the spot. And I told her to go to go to spot. She did. And so I took over with all the kids. And, you know, we we had a lot of fun. We for example, we just kind of went into the garage to look for random things to play with. And we found some old plastic storage bins. And my kids said, can we take the plastic sports storage bins out back on the on the grassy hill and try to sled down the grass in the storage bins. And so that was like two and a half hours of fun. And the other thing we did is we played hide and seek and I play hide and seek with my kids all the time. And and and you know, up until now, the thing I liked about playing hide and seek with my kids is that I always win. And I would and I'm I might not surprise you to learn. I'm not one of those dads that lets the kids win. Like you're I'm not gonna let you win. You got to beat me. And so I'm probably like 200 up until today up until this weekend, I was 200 no as a as a as a hide and seek player against my kids. But now they've gotten older and they're playing the game on a more psychological level. So it was my turn to hide. And I was hiding. So I picked a I picked a great hiding spot. I'd already planned it out. I was in this great hiding spot. They were never gonna find me. And then I hear this this loud bang down in the down in the living room. And my son starts screaming out that he's hurt himself. He's like screaming and crying. I heard myself. And so I come running out to check on him. And he says, ha, ha, just kidding. So he he was pretending to hurt himself to flush me out of my hiding spot. And I thought you little this this is I'm here playing checkers and now you're playing 40 chess. That's that's that's psychological warfare. And I fell for it. And then they tried it again the next time I was hiding, they went in the kitchen and started banging around and saying, Daddy, we're playing with the knives. That time I did not come out. I was I was wagering that they were just kidding about playing with the butcher knives. Unfortunately, they were. But even if they weren't, that was a risk I was willing to take. All right. We'll start with this from the daily wire to say sold out Houston music festival attended by an estimated 50,000 people turned deadly on Friday night after a headliner began to perform. The Associated Press reported the crowd gathered for the two day event in NRG Park at Astro World. They suddenly surged toward the stage during a performance by rapper Travis Scott. And he was not just the performer at this Astro World event. This it's his event. He puts the event on I believe he has an album named called Astro World. So this is this is his event that he puts on. And it says, quote, they started surging towards the stage squeezing fans so tightly together that they could not breathe or move their arms and killing eight people in the chaos, hospitalizing several others. According to the outlet, as a timer clicked down to start the performance, the crowd pushed forward. Nick Johnson, a high school student who attended the concert told the AP, everyone was passing out around you. Everyone was trying to help each other, but you couldn't move. You couldn't do anything. You can't even pick your arms up. It just got worse and worse. Now, keep in mind eight people. And I mean, this is this has been a pretty big story in the news. I don't know how it's not a bigger story than than it's being treated. Eight people, mostly kids died at a concert. But remember, you know, prior to this, what I think was considered the deadliest and most catastrophic music festival ever was Woodstock 99. And in that, I believe that was like a two or three day festival. There was 100, 200,000 people there and three or four people died. And it was a big deal at the time. I can remember it distinctly. Yeah, three or four deaths with that many people. This is eight people in a crowd of 50,000 in a span of a couple hours died. Officials called off the event about 40 minutes after law enforcement observed concert, concert goers going down. Authorities said a mass casualty incident had occurred at 938 PM. According to the use of Chronicle, concert attendees said Scott appeared to play his whole set and finished at 10 15 PM. And Travis Scott is the boyfriend or whatever. I don't think they're married of Kylie Jenner, one of the Kardashians. There's, there are a lot of weird reports coming out of this concert. And I don't know how much of it is true or not. One thing that you heard early on, kind of the rumors circulating online is that people were being injected with some unknown substance. And this has been at least partially confirmed. There was, there was a security guard who was briefly rendered unconscious after feeling a prick on his neck. And then he was, they woke him up and they found markings where he had been injected by somebody. And there were also reports of many, at least several people going into cardiac arrest. It's not clear if that happened during this surge or before it or if it had something to do with what sparked it to begin with. But yet people being injected with drugs, apparently other people being trampled to death. And the videos that you see online now, and I'm not going to play them, but you can go, you can go find these videos. There's many of them circulating. Travis Scott is up there continuing the performance. Now, early on, I read reports saying that he stopped, he stopped multiple times to try to tell the crowd to back up. That was the report. Anyway, that's the claim. I have not seen any videos of Travis Scott stopping the concert. Doesn't mean he didn't do it. I haven't seen those videos. The videos I've seen show Travis Scott up on the stage while there are kids collapsing all around and medics rushing into the crowd. And he's continuing to perform. But now he says that he's very upset about it. And he put out a statement on Instagram the next day talking about how devastated he is. And I don't know, you watch this and tell me if you find it to be sincere. I just want to send out prayers to the ones that was lost last night. We're actually working right now to identify the families so we can help assist them through this tough time. You know, my fans, my fans, like my fans really mean the world of me. And I always just really want to leave them with a positive experience. And anytime I can make out, you know, anything that's going on, you know, I just stop the show and, you know, help them get the help they need, you know. I could just never imagine a severity of the situation. Yeah, I find his reaction somewhat unsettling. I don't really eight people just died in front of you, man, at your concert. Eight kids were just trampled to death. And this is his reaction. It sounds like he's, you know, it's, it sounds like the kind of statement that you have if you had to cancel a concert or something because something happened and people were, you know, and you had to issue a bunch of refunds and people were inconvenienced. And so I could see that. Yeah, really, really sorry about that. You know, really, really, really unfortunate. When I watch that, especially as he's right, he's not taking his hands off his head the entire time. That's kind of a tell also that someone's not being entirely sincere. They keep rubbing their face and everything. So he's got all those tells, but it's, it's, and he does it in black and white. He takes the time to change the filter on it to make it black and white. This is someone it seems to me trying to seem devastated and saying that they're devastated, but doesn't really seem that way to me. One thing you have to remember about Travis Scott, some background on this guy is that he has a history of riling up the crowd at his concerts, intentionally encouraging them to rush through security barricades. Now, I don't know if he did that during this concert, but he has a history of doing that. I've read some accounts from security guards who've worked Travis Scott concerts and how he'll kind of turn against them during the concert and encourage fans to bum rush them. There's another video very disturbing from a few years ago where he was Travis Scott was crowd surfing and some kid in the, it looked like he was 14 or 15 years old, maybe younger. Some kid grabs his shoe. I don't know if intentionally or not. And the Travis Scott loses his mind on this kid and starts calling for the crowd to, you know, f him up to beat the kid up for taking his shoe. Enlisting a crowd of people who are many of them already drunk on drugs, they're kind of out of their minds because that's, that's the environment at these kinds of concerts. It's an environment intentionally designed to make people sort of lose their senses. And he's sicking this, this mob on this kid because it took a shoe. Meanwhile, I'm sure this guy has 500 pairs of shoes at his house along with a couple dozen backstage for all of his outfit changes, wardrobe changes. So that's the kind of guy he is, which means I put all that together and I, I put this on him. I don't know how I put this on him at least to the extent that you blame Alec Baldwin for shooting the cinematographer. I mean, it wasn't just his fault. There were other people involved, but you're the one holding the gun and you didn't check it. And so this falls on you. Travis Scott, this is your concert. It's up to make you to make sure everything is safe. At the very least, if eight people die, it means that this was a massive failure in planning and logistics and making sure you had enough security there. And that goes to you. You throw an event and eight people die because at a minimum, because, because of poor planning, yeah, this guy should be arrested and charged already. Shouldn't even be a discussion. And then you add into that all the, you see some of the pictures from the, from the event and you hear some of the accounts and there's a lot of just weird satanic imagery everywhere. I was listening to one account from a girl that was there saying that it was just, and she's not, she said that she's not religious, but it felt weird and satanic even to her, even the kind of music they were playing. And all of this stuff is designed to make, as I said, it kind of makes people lose their senses, lose their mind in a certain way. And it's designed to have that effect. And then you add in all the drugs and everything, even more so. All right, let's move on to this. Aaron Rogers, the quarterback of the Green Bay Packers, got COVID and the assumption immediately once he was diagnosed with COVID is well, that means that he wasn't vaccinated, which that's not a safe assumption because we know that vaccinated people get COVID all the time. In this case, it turns out that yeah, he wasn't vaccinated. Now he had previously said earlier or before the season when he was asked about it, he said that he'd been immunized. But he didn't specifically say that he got the vaccine. Everyone took that to mean that he got the vaccine. And now it turns out that he didn't, he admitted that he didn't get it. And this has made the media very, very upset at Aaron Rogers. He is public enemy number one in sports. And so if you watch football yesterday or over the weekend, you saw a lot of segments like this. Here's Terry Bradshaw, a former quarterback himself in the NFL, now a NFL commentator. Here he is addressing Aaron Rogers and Terry Bradshaw is like on the verge of tears because Aaron Rogers didn't get vaccinated. Let's listen to this. I give Aaron Rogers some advice. It would have been nice if he'd have just come to the Naval Academy and learn how to be honest. Yeah. Learn not to lie, because that's what you did, Aaron. You lied to everyone. I understand what you were doing was taking stuff that would keep you from getting COVID-19. You got COVID-19. I've remeck them as a cattle D warmer. Sorry, folks, that's what it is. We are a divided nation politically. We're divided nation on the COVID-19, whether not to take the vaccine. And unfortunately, we've got players that pretty much think only about themselves. And I'm extremely disappointed in the actions of Aaron Rogers. I'm not mad. I'm disappointed. You lied to us, Aaron. You lied to us. Do you think maybe if he did lie, and I'm not saying I necessarily agree with that characterization, but if he did, maybe it's because you're not owed the truth, Terry Bradshaw. Why should you be told? If I lie to you about my medical history, it's because you have no business knowing that. If someone on the street comes up to me and says, hey, have you taken this drug or got this medicine? I could say whatever I want. Sure. I took it. You don't have any moral right to be angry if you find out that I wasn't telling the truth. Like you lied to me. Well, it's none of your business. Why are you asking the question? Why is it Terry Bradshaw's business, whether Aaron Rogers got the vaccine? We're so accustomed to this now to demanding that people reveal their medical history, at least as it concerns COVID, that many people have come to see this as normal. It's not. It's none of your damn business. If Aaron Rogers lied to me as a member of the public about his vaccination status, I don't care because I don't care if he got the vaccine or not to begin with. Okay. The thing about the truth is that given the circumstance, you're not always owed the truth. Like there are private pieces of information about a person's life and their history and the things they do with their body where that's not a truth that you're owed. They don't owe that truth to you. Now, whether that justifies lying, well, that's a whole ethical, interesting debate that we can have, but you certainly are not. Terry Bradshaw is not owed that piece of information. And meanwhile, you can't help but make the comparison here because Aaron Rogers is getting killed by the sports media right now. You also have to understand that this is, it's pretty rare for them to do that. It usually takes a lot for NFL commentators and for ESPN to go after the most high profile stars. And one of the reasons why they usually don't do it is because they're all friends. And so it's awkward. And so that's why they don't criticize each other. But also because these are, you know, Aaron Rogers makes Terry Bradshaw a lot of money because he's an NFL commentator and people tune in, people don't tune in to hear NFL commentators for them. If people are interested in football, then they're going to be interested in what the commentators have to say. Aaron Rogers is one of the guys that makes people interested in football. So he's a highly bankable star. He makes a lot of money for all these people. They all know him and are friends with him. And so normally they let a lot slide. It is pretty unusual to hear something like what you just heard. It's so unusual that when another NFL superstar quarterback by the name of Deshawn Watson of the Houston Texans, when he was accused of rape by like 20 women or more than 20 women, we have not seen any moments like what you just saw there with Terry Bradshaw. They talk about it. It's, it is discussed a little bit. And they're very circumspect about it. And they say, well, we got to do the investigation. And we'll see this and that. And there haven't been any moments like that. So I'm going to talk about that. Henry Ruggs is a NFL wide receiver of the Las Vegas Raiders. Last weekend, he got drunk and drove his car 156 miles an hour and slammed into another car and killed somebody. And there were no moments like that. So the sports media are far, far, far more angry at Aaron Rodgers for not getting the COVID vaccine. Then they are at Deshawn Watson for raping 20 women, allegedly. And we've got to throw the allegedly on that, except that there's again, like 20 women have come out against him. All of them massage therapists and all of them telling basically the same story. And when that happens, I think you could basically drop the allegedly. Okay. Now you've got it's 20 to one. And they're all telling the same story. There's a real pattern here. So the Sean Watson allegedly raping 20 women. Henry Ruggs killing somebody last week. But sports media, far, far, far more angry at Aaron Rodgers for not getting the COVID vaccine. And before anyone attempts some desperate maneuvering here by, by segue, well, you Aaron Rodgers could kill, he could, he could kill way more than just one person by not getting the vaccine. Except that if you're vaccinated, as we've said a million times, if you are vaccinated, and you trust the vaccine, then you shouldn't have to worry about Aaron Rodgers infecting you. Unless the vaccine doesn't work, in which case, why should Aaron Rodgers get it? And if you're not vaccinated, then that's a choice you've made. That's a risk you've decided to take. And you still can't get mad at Aaron Rodgers. No matter what, there's, there's no grounds to be mad at Aaron Rodgers. Unless you're trying to be an ethical purist here and, and the reason you're angry is that he lied to us. Yeah, he lied to you. Deshawn Watson raped 20 women. So, I don't know, you decide, you decide who we should be taking a task here more. Staying on the vaccine subject, White House Chief of Staff Ron Kline trying to justify the vaccine mandate made a very interesting, by interesting, I mean, stupid analogy. Let's listen. I'm quite confident that when this finally gets fully adjudicated, not just a temporary order, the validity of this requirement will be upheld. It's common sense Chuck. If OSHA can tell people to wear a hard, hard hat on the job to be careful on chemicals, it can put in place these simple measures to keep our workers safe. We will find out if the courts agree. A hard hat. Okay, Ron, let me explain a few differences here. First of all, if you are working a construction site, then most likely you're a relatively young male, and most likely you're in pretty good physical shape, which means that COVID poses very, very little risk to you. However, a large object falling on your head, even if you are a young, physically fit man, that will still kill you, or at least cause brain damage. So on a construction site, the risk from a falling object is much, much, much, much greater than the risk of COVID. So that's one of the reasons why you wear a hard hat. Also, the other thing about a hard hat is you put it on your body, and then you could take it off. It's not a substance you inject into your body. Now, Ron Kline, just looking at him and his physique, doesn't strike me as the kind of guy who's done a lot of construction or spent a lot of time outside. So maybe he doesn't really understand how hard hats work, but that's what they are. It's a hat that you put on. You can take it right back off. So this is not a requirement that people inject a substance into their body. A hard hat serves a certain purpose. And the other thing about a hard hat? No side effects that you have to worry about. None at all. You don't have to worry about any long-term side effects. Any short-term, it gives you hat hair. Okay. So that's the side effect of a hard hat is that it gives you hat hair and your hair looks a little bit weird when you take it off. That's the side effect as opposed to any drug that you put in your body. There are going to be many more significant side effects than that, potentially, for any drug that you take to include the COVID vaccine. Okay. But they've been grappling around for analogies. Really, this whole time hard hat or a lot of times you'll hear the, well, it's like wearing a seatbelt thing. But there's no analogy that they can real... none of the analogies work. Because all the analogies they reach for, they're looking at temporary, minor measures where you're doing something. You're taking a safety measure for a specific purpose. And the amount that it mitigates your risk is a measurable thing. And it's just, it's not analogous to taking a drug, especially to the government forcing you to take a drug. One other clip I want to play kind of on the same point here. Do we even have this? I think we do. Oh, yeah, we do. Rochelle Walensky. She's the CDC director. And as we, you know, get into flu season and everything, now she's suggesting that, hey, even if you're not worried about COVID, maybe you should still wear the mask for the sake of protecting yourself against the flu. The evidence is clear. Mask can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by reducing your chance of infection by more than 80%. Whether it's an infection from the flu, from the coronavirus, or even just the common cold. In combination with other steps like getting your vaccination, hand washing, and keeping physical distance, wearing your mask is an important step you can take to keep us all healthy. Get vaccine facts. We can do this. Okay, cool. So just wear the vaccine or wear the mask until we've cured the common cold and then you'll be good to take it off. Why didn't the CDC ever suggest this before? Did Rochelle Walensky and the CDC, did they just discover that the cold exists or that the flu exists? Did they, the existence of viruses that can be transmitted through the air? Have they, have they just discovered that? Or did they just now realize that masks, do they not know about medical masks in the past? If it's a simple, no big deal measure, why was it never suggested before COVID? But this was a conspiracy theory before. Remember, if I suggested or you suggested, as many of us did, predicted that the mask, this is going to become a lifestyle that is that they're going to try to impose on us from the top permanently. We have to cover your face forever because COVID is all of the reasons given for wearing a mask because of COVID. All of those reasons apply to the cold and they apply to the flu and everything else. And if they were making that argument for that, then they're going to say it's for the flu and they're going to say it's for the cold. Only when we made that argument in the past, up until right now, that was a conspiracy theory. And now you have the CDC coming out and saying exactly that. So that's the way it always works. All right, next, SNL had some hilarious abortion content on Saturday night. It's from the report from the Daily Beast. It says Saturday Night Live's weekend update had a lot of ground to cover this week, especially given that Ice Cube, a celebrity whom Keenan Tonsen has perfectly impersonated before, lost out on a $9 million active gig in the Sony Comedy Oh Hell No because he refused to get vaccinated. Okay, but who cares? Skipping ahead, it says the real standout was, and this is an article that's they're very much impressed with this bit. They're taking a positive view of it. The real standout was Goober, a clown played by Cecil E. Strong and styled to look a lot like Lynette from the Children's Series, the big, comfy couch. The reason for her appearance, to respond to these stringent Texan law that effectively bans abortion after six weeks, because just one day before she turned 23, she had a clown abortion. So that's the character. She's a clown who had an abortion, and this is supposed to be funny. Let's watch a little bit and find out if it is. The Supreme Court heard arguments this week in women's whole health v Texas about the controversial Texas law that essentially bans all abortions after just six weeks. Here to cheer us up, well, this can't be right. Goober the clown who had an abortion when she was 23. So Goober, you had an abortion when you were 23. Hey, whoa, slow down. I'm a clown. Let's clown around. Hey, smell this flower. You're not going to squirt me, are you? Or would never. Okay. I had an abortion the day before my 23rd birthday. Okay. It seems like you do want to talk about your abortion. Well, actually, I really don't, but people keep bringing it up. So I got to keep talking about freaking abortion, but it's a rough subject. So we're going to do fun clown stuff to make it more palatable. Hey, what's a balloon animal? You want a giraffe? That's right. I'm Goober and I wish I didn't have to do this because the abortion I had at 23 is my personal clown business. But that's all some people in this country want to discuss all the time, even though clown abortion was legalized and clowns be weighed in 1973 here. I mean, as always with SNL, the most offensive thing about it by far is that it's supposed to be a comedy show. And it's just not funny at all. I, it's certainly, I'd have to acknowledge there's a real challenge when you're trying to make a funny joke about the slaughter of 60 million children. That's not an easy thing to do. I'm not sure that there are any funny jokes you can make about it. But that definitely wasn't it. And in, you know, we hear from, from the, from the Goober, the clown, well, I, and this is what we always hear. This is the, the line we always hear from pro-abortion, especially the feminists. Well, I don't want to talk about it. Why do you guys keep talking about abortion? No, but, but you do want to talk about it. It's all feminists ever do is talk about their abortions. Like they want, they walk through the street shouting, I got an abortion. Everyone, I got an abortion. Let me tell you about my abortion. But then as always, if you say, well, you know, I really don't think you should have got that abortion. That's not a good thing. Why are you talking about my abortion? This is my business. Why are you so obsessed with it? Why are you obsessed with my body? I'm not even, I'm not sure even what point they were, they were trying to reach here because I take two points away from it from this bit. One, the most direct thing, the most obvious implication here is that abortion advocates are clowns. And I agree with that. But then there's also, you know, what you find here is this kind of classic image of the, you know, the, the tears of the clown, right? The clown who puts on this kind of wacky persona and they put the wig on, they put the nose on and everything, but they're hiding their deep despair. That's the classic image of, of the clown. And that is in fact, what lots of post-abortive women do. And especially post-abortive women who are shouting their abortions, the feminists, the probe, the abortion advocates, okay? You spend any time or you go to a conference of, you know, a feminist conference, Planned Parenthood or something, I wouldn't recommend it. But you're going to find nothing but the, but Goober the clown there, a bunch of Goober's running around. All of them talking about how great it is that they got an abortion, how happy they are about their abortions. Isn't it so wonderful? But this is an act of massive overcompensation. They're trying to hide the, the deep despair and loneliness that they feel. So is that, was that the point? Is that what they were, I don't think that's what they were reaching for, but that's, it's actually a very good point. In some ways, it's kind of a powerful bit, but in exactly the opposite way that they attended. Abortion advocates are clowns in general. And yes, this is what, this is what a lot of these feminists do. They've got the, you know, it's kind of like the, the classic meme that you see online of the guy holding up the smiley mask, but behind it, he's crying. That's, that's it right there. That's, that is feminism, especially feminism when it comes to abortion advocacy. Because there's really no way that this, despite how they try to fool themselves and, and the rationalizations that they come up with, you know, there's, there's just nobody who, especially as they get older and they get to the end of the life, I could tell you this, there's not a single feminist on their deathbed who had an abortion or one or two or three or five abortions or whatever, who's going to be lying there on their deathbed and saying, Oh man, I am so glad I got that abortion. Thank God I got that abortion. Thank God. I'm not leaving any progeny behind. Thank God I'm leaving any, any other people who are going to be lying to me. Thank God I'm laying here alone with no one to mourn me because the only people who would have mourned me, I killed. I can guarantee you there's not one single feminist saying that. That's all. It's always a good litmus test. It's a good way to decide if you're making the right choice or not is to just imagine, okay, I make this choice 50 years from now or 60 years from now, hopefully if it's that long and I'm laying in my deathbed, am I going to be happy about this choice that I'm making right now? And if the answer is obviously no, then probably not a good choice to make. You know, well, there's a lot of women who have and it's certainly in the future, just generations of women who are going to die alone with no one to love them, leaving no legacy behind, leaving no imprint on the world at all. It's pretty sad. That's a very sad thing. All right, let's finally finish with this a little bit a little bit more lighthearted. This is from the Daily Mail. It says, this is the report anyway, again, I report you decide, okay? It says he's supposed to be committed to reducing emissions, but when President Joe Biden produced a little natural gas of his own at the COP26 summit, it was audible enough to make the Duchess of Cornwall blush. An informed source has told the mail on Sunday that Camilla was taken aback to hear Biden break wind as they made polite small talk at the global climate change gathering last week. The source said, quote, it was long and loud and impossible to ignore. Camilla hasn't stopped talking about his. So I don't know what's going on. It's almost like we, it's almost like there's a 78 year old man in office. I'm not sure, but he's this guy, according to the reports anyway, he's just ****ing and farting all over Europe. It's a real problem here, especially with, you know, with, with pollution being the, being, being as bad as it is. He's, he has cropped us did all of Europe. What, what's, what's happening? Well, again, I know what's happening. He's a, he's an old man. And there's no way, like, there's no, there's no, and I'm just trying to imagine, first of all, I need to know more about this, okay? Because even in the Daily Mail report, I read the whole report with great interest, and then it kind of moves on and it talks about the climate change summit. It doesn't, doesn't give us any more information. I need to know more because Joe Biden is standing there allegedly, and he lets out this massive fart that goes on for minutes. Apparently does, is there a pause in the conversation? Or does he blow through it and keep talking, pretending that it's not happening? Is there any acknowledgement of the fart after the fact? It sounds like he does this a lot. Hopefully he's, he's kind of got accustomed. He knows what, what tactics to use to distract from what's just happened. I don't know. A lot more information that we need. But this, this just makes us proud as Americans, doesn't it? No, one, one weekend he, uh, poops his pants in front of the Pope, allegedly the very next weekend. He's farting in front of the Duchess of Cornwall, all of all people. Makes me very proud to be an American. All right, now time for the comment section. The sweet baby game. Jim says, I'd like Matt to acknowledge that he occupied Stolen land in Loudon County in that lady's basement. That's, that land was not stolen. That was, that was given to me fair and square. So there would be no land acknowledgement for, for me in, in reference to Loudon County. Ethan says, Matt is definitely the type to text back K and not think anything of it. I would never do that. I would spell it out. Well, I would, okay. You know, the letter O and then K. I don't, I don't, uh, cause I, I don't, I don't speak that way. Okay. I text the way that I speak. So I'm not going to say to someone K. I'll say this whole thing. But I'll certainly, we'll have no problem with that. I'll just text back. Oh, that's what I like about text measures. I'll do the same thing with emails too. All the time, I'll respond to an email. Yeah. Cause if the email's a question, Hey, you know, Matt, I hope you're doing well. I hope this and that and how you kids do it. And by the way, here's my question. My answer back will be, uh, yeah, or no end of, end of email send. Because that's the whole advantage of email texting is that I don't need to do any of that small talk. Um, Mark says, Matt, I was thinking you should get a second dog. So yours has a buddy to play with. No, that's, that's, that's the last thing that we need. You know, we're actually having a problem with the, with the dog. At least it's a problem for me. I'm going to throw this out there. If there's any dog whispers, this is a serious thing. There's any dog whispers in the audience. Maybe you can give me your, your insight. So the issue is, I think I, I, I mentioned this like a month ago that we got, we got the dog, we adopted the dog, and then we had the dog for three days and I went away for a week. Um, and I came back and every time I walk in the room, the dog would bark at me because it's like he bonded with his pack and I'm, and I wasn't in the pack. And now where it's a month later, has not changed. So my wife started saying, well, maybe you need to feed the dog and give them treats. And you know, so you're constantly groveling and sucking up to this mangy beast in the house. And I said, you know what, I'm, I'm so tired of getting barked at. I will do that. So I feed the dog. I get in treats. Come here, little boy. Here's, here's your, here's your treat. And, um, maybe I'm being sarcastic about it. And that's probably maybe he's picking up on that. I don't know. But it hasn't changed. It's actually gotten worse. Every time I walk into a room now, he barks. It's like he has not, I'm, I have not earned my place in the pack in my own house. Um, so if anyone has any, in all seriousness, if anyone, because it's ruining my life. So if you have any suggestions on what to do about that, let me know. Tracy says, I'm sitting here dumb founded as to how people could just know someone for three hours and do that hookups are an insane practice. Referring back to the day, port, and I think, um, yeah, hookup culture, well, you know something, Tracy, the fact that you would not want to be sexually active with someone who you just met and have known for three hours, that now puts you, that's, that's its own sexuality. I think that's what they call demisexuality. Now you're a demisexual. Did you know that? If you prefer to have a, you know, some kind of emotional involvement with someone, at least, to, to know something about them, if that's even bear, let alone, you want to be married first. Now we call, now that is, uh, you've got your own letter in the LGBT alphabet. You're a demisexual, whether you want it or not, you know, that, that has become, that used to be where you're a normal healthy person. But now that's just one variation. That's one sexual variation among millions and they're all equal. Um, Jack says, Matt, after seeing your most recent anniversary slash vacation photos has occurred to you that the only door toward necessary to defeat all of your internet adversaries is, have you seen my wife? I win. Um, yeah, I do, I, you know, I, I do have a very attractive wife, which I do think, but I try not to use that in arguments because it would be weird to do, but I do think that sometimes. Um, and, uh, let's see, yo, yo, yo says, I feel your pain, Matt. I bought my girlfriend a nice bottle of white wine and she poured seven up into it. I was literally speechless. Poured seven up in the, is that even, is that a thing that people do? That to me seems like a breakup offense. You know, my wife were married. The fact that she wasted my very nice burden by putting in tea, that's a, that's the kind of thing you work through. We're going to counseling for it right now. Um, but seven up in wine to me, especially it's, it's early on. That's kind of like a red flag. I already, you know, I've, I've been with my wife for 10 years. I know this was a momentary lapse of judgment. Normally she has a great amount of respect for whiskey. She would never normally do that. So I have all of that background, but if you're just dating someone and they're pouring seven up in their white wine, I hate to say, but I think that's, I think that you got to cut that rope. I hate to say as you heard last week, the daily wire made one of the biggest announcements it will ever make that it's filing a lawsuit against the federal government. This is an unprecedented move for the daily wire, but staring down the face of an increasingly authoritarian president leaves no other options. Our senile leader has ordered that large employers must require their employees to get vaccinated against COVID or submit to regular testing. The daily wires lawsuit was filed by the, uh, Dylan law group and Alliance Defending Freedom. They do a lot of great work and they're helping us with this in the US court of appeals for the sixth circuit. The lawsuit alleges that the Biden administration lacks constitutional and statutory authority to issue the employer mandate, which would seem they obviously do because look, this mandate is absolutely unconstitutional and we're not standing for it here at the daily wire, but we need your help.

Now let's get to our daily cancellation. Today, we're going to cancel equality. This has been a long time coming. Equality has been asking for it and now the moment has arrived. Of course, every day there's some new lunacy concocted in the name of equality. You can just Google the word equality on any given day and you'll be guaranteed to find a headline like this one. Here's just the most recent example. From the New York Post, it says UK primary schools ask boys to wear skirts to promote equality. Reading on it says a grade school in Scotland asked male and female students and teachers to wear skirts to class to promote equality. We want our school to be inclusive and promote equality in email from Castleview Primary in Edinburgh said to parents, the Daily Mayor reported on Wednesday, boys as young as three years old were asked to participate by wearing a skirt. It says we're keen to spread the message that clothes don't have a gender and that we should all be free to express ourselves as we choose. Teachers wrote a message to parents according to the outlet. Now equality here is just the cover story as is so often the case. An adult who asks a little boy to put on a skirt has no doubt other intentions and motivations. He's probably a pedophile is what I'm trying to say in case I wasn't being clear enough with the insinuation. But this is still one more instance of the sort of madness that the West's obsession with equality has wrought. It seems to be infecting schools especially some school systems have done away with grading systems because of equality. They've abolished gifted and talented programs in the name of equality. Equality has put an end to most of the games we used to play in recess and gym class. Of course equality is what has opened the girls bathroom to boys. Equality has wreaked havoc and education. And there's a reason why the education system in particular is concerned with equality. We'll get to that in a minute. But this extends far beyond education. Everywhere our society is being restructured around the concept of equality and along with its dysgenic offspring, equity, tolerance, inclusion, all of them, all kind of related. Currently the equality act is working its way through Congress, a piece of legislation which seeks to legally abolish once and for all the biological differences between sexes. But those differences cannot be abolished. So instead we will simply be forbidden from noticing or acknowledging or in any way acting upon or in response to those differences. So overall it's clear that we are an equality obsessed culture. Before we talk about why equality obsession is bad, it should be, I think it would be illuminating and useful to discuss why the obsession exists in the first place. Where did it come from? You know, why this society's passed, you go through human history, you didn't have this. But why, why for us? Why are we so obsessed with equality? That's a large question, not one that I can answer completely during this segment. But here are two major factors. First, we are a self-obsessed narcissistic culture. And equality ironically is a major concern of self-obsessed narcissistic people because they wield equality as a negative force. They're constantly worried that other people are advancing beyond them, succeeding more than them, getting more out of life. And so they call for equality as a means to chop everybody back down to their level. You'll notice that so often the person calling for equality is not calling for others to be raised up to his level, but for everyone to be lowered down to his level. Equality is kind of a weed whack or cutting the blades of grass that grow higher than the rest. And it's often the lower blades pointing to the higher ones and saying, get him, cut him down to size. It's not fair that he's growing faster and higher than me. We know that leftism is the religion of self-worship. It's an ideology of narcissism. And so it's no surprise that a society dominated by leftism would also be preoccupied with equality, with especially negative equality of this kind. The second factor can be found on the other end of the spectrum. It kind of approaches from the opposite direction. While equality is very often a tool used by narcissistic losers to prevent others from succeeding, it can also be born from confused and misplaced empathy. Like I said, this is kind of the opposite thing here. This is where much of the equality in the school system originates. Not the Scottish kids wearing skirts. As I said, that's just perfect teachers using equality as a cover, but the erasing of grades, the abolition of playground games, the abolition of gifted and talented programs and so on, that is all at least partly misdirected empathy. And you find it in the school system so prominently because the school system is run by women. Okay, this is a part that media matters is going to love. So make sure you click this part guys. Equality is in many ways a feminine virtue. It's a woman's virtue. It's something women tend to care about much more than much more than men. Women are more worried about, you know, making sure that things are fair, that things are equal, that nobody feels bad about themselves and nobody gets hurt emotionally or physically. That's something that women tend to be concerned about. Much more than men, men are more competitive. They're more results oriented. They're much more likely to take a, you know, made the best man win approach. But as men are driven more and more out of education, this voice, the voice that says to the crying child who got his nose bloodied during dodgeball, hey, rub some dirt on it. You'll be fine. Now get back out there and try to win the next round. That voice has been almost entirely silenced. Now a kid gets his nose bloodied playing dodgeball and so we say no more dodgeball for anybody. It's over. Now we have a system where there's almost no competition, no harshness at all, no toughness, no winners or losers. Kids are coddled, they're muddered, they're pampered, and they're not remotely prepared for the realities of life. It's not just in the education system. As men are minimized more and more replaced, driven out of positions of leadership and so on, all that means is that our society will be increasingly revolving around feminine concerns like equality, tolerance, inclusion. You find this in parenting as well. You need the balance in parenting. You have the mother who typically is again going to be very concerned about making sure things are fair. It's going to be the much more empathetic voice and you need that that's very important. But you also need the masculine fatherly voice that embraces competition, that embraces risk-taking. That the kid scrapes their knee and he's not going to run over immediately. He's going to say no, you don't need to cry about that. You'll be fine. Get back out there. Children need both. But increasingly as men, as we have fatherless homes and families where there's no masculine presence, kids don't have that balance. So why is it a problem? What's wrong with equality? Well, the problem with equality is that it's a fiction. It's a mythology. There is no equality in the world. The only place where equality is supposed to exist is in the legal system. Okay, we're supposed to all be equal under the law, meaning that nobody has granted special treatment or favors. But even there, it's still really a fiction. We do not have a legal system that treats everybody equally and we never have and we probably never will. It is at best a theoretically attainable ideal in the legal system. We're probably never going to get there, but we should try. I agree with that. Outside of that realm, equality neither exists, nor is it attainable, nor desirable because everyone is different. Everything is different. You will not find two apples in a barrel that are the same or two grains of sand on a beach, much less two people. Take two people at random and compare them. And one will be uglier, fatter, dumber, less virtuous, less creative, less generous, et cetera. Hopefully all of those lesser qualities will not be found in the same person, but you never know. We're all a mixed bag and for some of us, the mixture is better than others. This is all undeniable. The advocates for an equal society, a society where sameness is opposed upon us from the top, from people who are themselves above us, unequal, by the way, these advocates know that we're not really equal, yet they argue that we should live as though we are. Our system should be built upon the false assumption of equality. Equality is a story that they tell and they insist that we live as though the story is true, even though we know it isn't. In the most extreme kind of example, you've got a man who identifies as a woman and harasses and harangs lesbians who don't want to sleep with him. They'll say that he's equal to the same as biological women. And so they ought to be attracted to him the same way that they're attracted to other women, but they're not because equality is a story. It's a stage play. And the equality advocate demands that everybody play their part go along with the script. Even if it's all fictional. So that's my issue with equality when you boil it down. It's a lie. We're not equal. We weren't really created equal either with all due respect to Thomas Jefferson. We're equal in a very abstract and spiritual sense in the sense that we all have dignity and worth as human beings. Sure. But outside of that, we were created very unequal, very different, with vastly different qualities, characteristic traits and abilities. And thank God for that. Imagine how boring and dismal and pointless life would be if everyone you encountered was merely a carbon copy of yourself. Imagine if there was no one better than you on Earth, no one to look up to or admire, no role models. That's the leftist utopian vision. But the vision is nightmare. And it's not real and never can be. And we should stop pretending that it is. And that's why equality today is canceled. A segment that I'm sure will garner rave reviews and everybody will agree with me. And we'll leave it there for today. Thanks for watching. Thanks for listening. Have a great day. Godspeed.
