Welcome, one of all in here out there all around the world to the Late Show. I'm your host, Stephen Colbert. It was an absolutely, I mean, everybody's in a great mood. It was a beautiful spring day here in New York. The sun was shining in the sky, the flowers were blooming in the fields, the discarded face masks were blowing in the streets. Speaking of which yesterday, President Biden signed a House bill immediately ending the COVID-19 national emergency. The emergency is officially over, ladies and gentlemen. This means... I'm not sure what it means. I'm not sure what it means for our health, but here this means that we here can finally get back to some of our favorite pre-pandemic Late Show segments like Subway Blind Taste Test. Is it a Brooklyn-bound F-Train running express on the D-line? Then, then this morning, Biden was off to the Emerald Ireland. The trip is part diplomacy and part homecoming because Biden's ancestors came to the US from Ireland in the mid-1800s when Biden was just a teen. Ahead of the trip, oldie but a goodie. Ahead of the trip, CNN caught up with some of Biden's Irish cousins to ask about their famous relative. Good kids. Good kids. Love those chips. I love it. Anyway, thanks for the nuggets. You guys get the shamrock shake all year around here. Send them under your Uncle Joey. Would you back state side? We only get them in March. My favorite flavor, green chuck. Biden. Biden famously incorporates Irish poets into many of his speeches and has been called the most Irish president since JFK who became the first serving US president of his Ireland in 1963. And like Biden, the crowds went nuts when JFK recited some classic Irish verse. There was an old fellow from Dublin whose flatulence was rather troubling. He said to a lass, you can tell I passed gas because my bath water just started bubbling. So, yeah. So anyway, anyway, Biden's over in Ireland all week and you know he might just want to stay for a while because state side, we are looking at a complete collapse of our judicial system on Friday. A federal judge in Texas suspended the FDA's approval of an abortion bill. Evidently, this judge thinks he knows more about medication than the FDA, which is why he's the star of the new CBS drama, Dr. Judge Legal Pharmacist, Refill Overruled. The medication in question is a widely used pill called Miffa Priestone, which has been on the market for more than 20 years. You can't just randomly ban things that have been around for decades just because you don't like them. You know how I know that? Mel Gibson. What? It's been four days since this judge announced the ban and America, she don't like it. According to a new Ipsos poll, 70% are opposed to it, including 82% of Democrats and 53% of Republicans wait a second. Democrats and Republicans agree on something? That feels weird. It's like one of those unlikely animal friendships where you see a deer and a lion. It's kind of neat, but it feels unnatural because, you know, one of them is going to get snacky. And it's not just human people who are against this ruling. It's also corporation people. A letter condemning the judge's decision was signed by more than 400 liters of the pharmaceutical industry. That's right, baby. America is standing shoulder to shoulder with our heroes at big pharma. Okay, okay, that makes me anxious. And I hope they have a pill for that. And they do. In this group letter, the pharma fellows point out that Miffa Pristone has proven to be safer than Tylenol, nearly all antibiotics and insulin. So it seems like there wasn't much about protecting public health in this ruling. We ingest way worse stuff than medication. Have you tried fried Oreos? They are schedule one controlled delicious. And the pharma bros are upset about the precedent this ruling sets, explaining if courts can overturn drug approvals without regard for science or evidence, any medicine is at risk for the same outcome. And if there's one thing big pharma doesn't like, it's you taking away their ability to sell you drugs. Try it and they will bring the hurt. And then they will prescribe oxy for the hurt. Side effects include them making a lot of money. This ruling hasn't gone into effect yet and is being appealed. But as a precaution, states like Massachusetts and California have begun stockpiling the pills, and Washington's Governor Jay Inslee has bought a three-year supply in case of a ban. And you can follow his adventures on the new CBS drama, Dr. Governor legal pharmacist. Now streaming on Paramount Plus. Paramount Plus, a mountain of fine. He's also a cop, okay? With all the problems this country is facing, the GOP is laser focused on what matters to Americans most. Toilet stuff. In recent months Republicans in Iowa, Arkansas, Alabama, Oklahoma, and Tennessee have all passed bills addressing bathroom use for trans people. What is the obsession with who's in the bathroom? My house only has gender neutral bathrooms. Everyone uses them and the only complaint I've heard is that the Rolling Stone and the magazine rack is from 2004. The latest anti-trans bill is down in Florida. And one of its fiercest advocates is Republican representative and school principal who's edible kicked in right in the middle of picture day. I'm looking at society today. And it's like I'm watching an X-Men movie. It's like we have mutants living among us on planet Earth. And you know, some people don't like that, but that's a fact. We have people that live among us today on planet Earth that are happy to display themselves as if they were mutants from another planet. This is the planet Earth. There's a lot to unpack there. First, the X-Men are from planet Earth. Second, if you're against trans people, why would you compare them to incredibly cool superheroes with laser eyes, indestructible skeletons, or who control the weather with sexiness? Most importantly, the entire message of all of these movies that society should accept everyone no matter their differences. Stan Lee himself said he created the X-Men characters as a metaphor for civil rights, and the franchise is explicitly a gay rights parable. So Barnaby is purposefully misrepresenting these X-Men movies unless his mutant power is being a dumbass. Right-wing nut jobs aren't just mad about trans people using bathrooms, they're also mad about trans people drinking beer, because some conservatives are boycotting Bud Light over its partnership with the trans activists. Come on, guys, the only reason anyone should boycott Bud Light is if there's anything else to drink, like Bud Light Lime, which is delicious. The charge was led by a conservative thought leader, Kid Rock. Grandpa's feeling a little frisky today. Let me say something to all you and be as clear and concise as possible. Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw also tried to get in on the dumb. Some Bud Light's stupid ad campaign, so guess what we're going to do? We're going to throw out every single Bud Light we've got in the fridge. All right, well, I guess that was easy. Got him, no Bud Light. However, Internet Smarties did point out that Crenshaw has a lot of carbok, which is owned by Anheuser-Busch, foiled again by corporate hegemony. I'm done with Nestle Elstik to Kit Kats. They owned that. Fine, I'll just chug some coffee mates. Seriously, that too? Okay, one bowl of puree and a dog food, please. No way. Fine, then I'll just drink this bottle of Garnier-Fruc-Tiss moisturizing shampoo. What? You got a great show for you tonight. More Late Show Pancho. After this.

And you know I've written you saying like what about having a down day. I'll look at your Instagram feed. Oh that's so nice. How much work goes into that? Like how much of your time or is it all kind of spontaneous gender? Well it's just Mo grosser in me and we just the two of us she had worked with me for a while and suddenly I was like guess what we're doing Instagram. And so she shoots it and cuts it and puts all the music and makes it fun. And you're cooking dance with your mom. And yeah we just do silly things. I don't know. Yeah. We just catch little slices of life because she's with me anyway. Oh that's lovely. Yeah. Your mom lives out in LA? No just when she's visiting you know mom loves a moment in the spotlight. If she were here. She does she? Oh yeah. Did she ever perform? Um Pat Garner I think once at Northeastern State in Oklahoma. Yeah. Because I asked because my mom wanted to be an actress. Yeah yeah I'm kind of vicariously for me. It was very fun for her. Yeah. Yeah she loved this. Yeah my mom likes it. I took my first set of like my proof sheet of headshots to my first agent and my mom had jumped into last minute to take photos with me just because she was there because I said you come I feel so much more comfortable when you're around. And so my my agent had a jeweler's loop out. She goes don't show this one. My mom was in the photo. Don't show this one to anyone. They're gonna cast her. Oh exactly. Yes exactly. Um okay Jennifer Coolidge you know I knew you. Jennifer Coolidge. I knew you back in the 90s when we first met mid mid 90s and Jennifer Coolidge recently told reporter she always wanted to play a dolphin. Oh yeah. Okay. And the reason I say I knew you back in the in the 90s is because after we knew you and you were a babysitter briefly you went to LA and we thought oh oh poor Jen we'll never see her again. And you almost immediately booked this. Do you know can you tell me what this is? Okay there was. You posted this after Jennifer Coolidge said that. I just recently posted this. It was a show called The Return to Fantasy Island starring Malcolm McDowell and I went as a guest star just as we met as guest stars on Spin City. I had an illustrious guest star career and I played a dolphin who was also a girl who was also a dolphin. Okay. Yes. So Jennifer Coolidge wants to play a dolphin and you posted this. What's your name? I'm Michael. What's yours? How? People can't pronounce it in English. So just call me Sally. Michael. Michael. You're a dolphin. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I mean I can help her out. You know I can give her some tips. What was some of your backstory? Did you do a ride along? How did you get your answer? I did. Do you know what I had to do? They needed me an un-equarium so they took me to the north shore of Hawaii and they put me in this huge aquarium with a hammerhead shark and a tiger shark. No way. And I swear to you this is when you're an expendable young actress. And I took a scuba thing and I sat on the bottom they would roll camera. I sat on the bottom of the tank and I watched because I had to go through a tunnel and I didn't want to meet the hammerhead in the tunnel. And they said they've been fed. You're fine. So I sat on the bottom and I breathed through this thing and when the hammerhead got to where I was okay I would do the take and at the top of the take I had to tread water at the top of the tank. Knowing that the hammerhead shark bun up but I mean I was but I did it. We have to take a quick break but don't go anywhere because we'll be right back with more Jennifer Garner everybody stick around. It's the star of the last thing he told me on Apple TV Plus. It's Jennifer Garner everybody. Now you've gone from being a dolphin to being an executive producer of the new show. The last thing he told me it's a mini series based on Laura Dave's 2021 book. And what's it about? 65 plus weeks at the best on the bestseller list. It is such a killer book if you haven't read it please rush out and get it right now. It is about a woman who is married to the love of her life. She married late in life. He disappears and she is left with his daughter her stepdaughter who's a teenager played by beautiful and gallery rights. We have an antagonistic relationship but we both love the same man Nikolai Koster Waldo. Can you blame us? And we have to work together to figure out this mystery. So there's a thriller but also at the center of it it's two women who kind of learn to love each other and become a family. But that was so good. That and a dolphin too. One after another. I'm just not going to doubt it tonight. You've got your own children. You've got teenagers and without any specifics. The eye rolling daughter there. Have you had any training with that?
