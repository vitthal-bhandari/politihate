    "text": " Happy International Women's Day. I am a woman. I know what a woman is. Therefore, celebrates everything. Subscribe to the channel. Listen to the podcast on Apple Podcasts Spotify wherever you listen because I am a woman. Hear me roar. All right, guys. Question of the day today. Does beauty terrify you? Seriously, when you see a beautiful woman or you see something that's beautiful, do you become scared or intimidated by that? What about goodness? What about acts of beauty? Does it terrify you? I want to talk about that seriously. Plus, later on, we're going to talk about trans activists. I think the name is Eli or Ellie Ehrlich was allegedly encouraged illegally sending hormone drugs to children. I saw this tweet and I was outraged by it and you will be too. All that and much more today coming up on Candace Owens. All right. So you already know my morning routine, get up early, workout, then meditate and pray also reading passages from various books. Today, I was very struck by a passage in C.S. Lewis. It's basically a calendar where it has a bunch of quotes from all of his books. I want to read this one to you and I really want you to think about it. It's going to be a great discussion afterwards. He wrote, we must guard against the feeling that there is safety in numbers. It is natural to feel that if all men are bad, as the Christians say, then badness must be very excusable. If all the boys plow in the examination, surely the papers must have been too hard. And so the masters at the school feel until they learn that there are other schools where 90% of the boys passed on the same papers, then they begin to suspect that the fault did not lie with the examiners. Again, many of us have had the experience of living in some local pocket of human society, some at particular school, college, regiment, or profession where the tone was bad. And inside that pocket, certain actions were regarded as merely normal. Everyone does it, and certainly others as impractably virtuous and quixotic. But when we emerged from that bad society, we made the horrible discovery that in the outer world, our normal was the kind of thing that no decent person ever dreamed of doing, and our quixotic was taken for granted as the minimum standard of decency. What I've seen to us morbid and fantastic so long as we were in the pocket now turned out to be the only moments of sanity we there enjoyed. It is wise to face a possibility that the whole human race, being a small thing in the universe, is in fact just such a local pocket of evil, an isolated bad school, a regiment inside which minimum decency passes for heroic virtue and utter corruption for pardonable imperfection. That is a passage from the problem of pain. That is the title. Now, why was I struck by this? Well, first and foremost, saying that we must guard against the feeling that there is safety in numbers. We somehow believe that, okay, if everybody's being a bad person, then obviously anybody that's being a good person, something's wrong with that person. They're way too virtuous. I don't know why they're like that. And I also like that he brings up that point that when we see people being good, it can sometimes make you uncomfortable. You go, that is just an impossible standard to live by because all of us are being bad. And I got thinking about this because one of the strangest things about having a public platform is realizing what stirs up controversy. So sometimes the controversy is understandable, right? You're wearing a white lives matter shirt with Kanye West and you're in Paris, obviously, that is going to drum up a lot of controversy. And you are ready and you're willing to respond to it. But the more bizarre controversies for me are the ones in which I've done nothing wrong, right? I'll give you a couple of examples of that, which you may have seen the public. So first and foremost, there was the YouTuber Mr. Beast. We covered this on a past show where people were angry at him for doing charity. He was quite literally finding people that were blinds paying for their procedure. Suddenly they could see and he was showing people online. Look how amazing this is. How many people that I have helped? 10,000 people can now see. People got angry. Oh, why are you telling us it? It's not altruistic for you to tell us that you did an active charity. I experienced this on a very weird level when I showed people my pantry. A woman got angry because I had organized my pantry, honestly, it's a work of art. It's so beautiful. You can look at it and she said, I just don't like that. She tried to problematize my pantry. First she problematized what I was wearing. Remember I was wearing a Mickey Mouse shirt and she said, this means you support Disney. It's so ridiculous. It was a comfortable sweatshirt that I purchased at some shop in Munich. And then when that wasn't problematic, she said, well, you know, I just don't like displays of excess. This is a pantry. It's just food. It's an appreciating asset. I bulk buy like everybody else does, obviously, because I know that these are the things in my household that somebody that cooks six to seven days per a week, we go through food pretty quickly. Why are you actually angry? Why has my beautiful pantry made you so upset? It's a weird thing. Similarly yesterday, I told the story about something that I felt so proud of in the retrospect that most difficult, by far, bar none, the most difficult professional decision I had ever made, which was walk away from a million dollar contract with Hashette because I didn't like that they were suggesting that I needed to distance myself from Trump to write a book that nothing to do with Trump following January 6th. I did this at a time that was very difficult. It was a household in which I was the only one bringing an income because my husband, as I told you yesterday, my husband is an immigrant and was not able to work until he secured a work visa. So he had a savings account. I was the only bride and winner and this was the first time I had ever seen that kind of money on paper. A girl that came from nothing being offered a million dollars and turning it down, yes, I cried. It was a lot. I didn't know what I was possibly doing, but I knew that it was moral. For some reason, a few people, not many, I'll be honest. Everyone was very kind in the comments, but a few people said, oh, well, I'll read you exactly one person who wrote this. She wrote, I very much respect when someone can't be bought, but let's be clear. Candice turning it down a million dollars is probably very different than most of us. She's married to a very wealthy man and was never going to be left poor. Now, why did Scarlett Winters write that under the video? Why did she write that? It's such a strange thing to write. Why would that be the first thought that you have? Well, if she did it, it's because her husband's father has wealth, which, by the way, he worked for his entire life. He also came from nothing. But let's just go with this narrative. My husband's father does have money. First of all, this is an ignorant comment. I don't know how ignorant people can be about how wealth and richness works, but what actually doesn't happen is that the day that you get married, you don't get a call from your father in law and just, Candice, welcome. We will transfer all the funds to you. You are now a very wealthy girl. Congratulations. What do you think happens? Do you think that when my son, I've worked for everything I have, that when my son gets married, I'm just going to transfer money into his account what weekly, monthly so that him and his wife can have a nice life. Do you think that's what rich people are doing? That they're just funding when their children become adults and get married. They just fund their lifestyle so nobody has to work anymore. I mean, how honestly, do you really believe that? No, that's not how it works. Let me tell you, I hate to let you down. We have to work for everything that we have. So we had my husband saving from his time when he worked in the UK. We had my savings from my time working here in the United States from the time that I was young. That was all we had. Parents didn't wake up and buy us a house. They did normal parents did and they helped us a little bit with the wedding, not all the way, but a little bit with the wedding. And that's it. Good luck. Live your life. But the reason this person wrote the comments was not really about me. She wasn't actually trying to suggest ignorantly that somehow I'm accepting wealth transfers from overseas. She wrote it because it revealed something about her. Let's take a listen to Jordan Peterson describing this phenomenon. Because beauty is absolutely terrifying to people because beauty highlights what's ugly. And so if you start to make your room beautiful, then everything around that isn't like that just starts to glow in the worst sense. So is that dangerous then? Oh yes. It's terribly dangerous. That's why people are afraid of beauty, but it's the greatest thing you can do because it puts you in alignment with like beautiful things are beautiful for a reason. Right. That beauty has depth. Like it's real depth, man. That's what gets you in touch with the transcendent and the divine is beauty. You introduce that into your room. You're playing with fire and people will resist it. So Scarlet Winters needed to resist something that was actually a good act. Why? Because something was glowing inside of her and ugliness was glowing. It said to her probably what she felt on a spiritual level was that she would have taken the a million dollars. That's it. I would she was sitting there thinking I would have taken the a million dollars rather than say that I'm going to attack Candace and make up something that just isn't true. This is what people felt when they watched Mr. Beast curing the blind. They went by it had money. I actually wouldn't be doing that. I'm probably a more selfish person. So I said I'm going to attack Mr. Beast for doing good acts publicly and displaying those good acts publicly. This particular says it sounds exactly what happened when this woman saw my pantry, which I spent weeks upon weeks organizing. She thought, I pantry isn't that organized. It glowed inside of her. Why doesn't my pantry look like this? Oh, well, you know what? It's because I don't have to. This is actually just excess. But how much food is in that pantry? Shame on Candace. No, shame on you. If you can't look at things that are objectively good, look at things that are objectively beautiful and just appreciate them. And rather you feel that you have to slug mud on it and shame on you. That's all I'm going to say about that. Thomas Sowell once said, It is a way to take people's wealth from them without having to openly raise taxes. Inflation is the most universal tax of them all. Here's the deal. The Fed keeps raising rates because it's the only tool they have to keep inflation under control. It's not working. You can't spend your way out of inflation. You've seen the impact on the stock market and you've seen the impact on your savings. Hedge inflation by owning gold, birch gold, buy gold and get a free safe to store it in. That's right.

I'm about to inform you. According to Eli's website, he's an internationally awarded writer, activist and public speaker. In 2011, at the age of 16, he co-founded the Trans Student Educational Resources, which is an organization dedicated to transforming the educational environment for trans students through collective action. According to his Twitter bio, he's a PhD candidate at UCSD researching political philosophy, social movements and trans history now. Eli, according to his Twitter feed, is also a criminal. You're not going to believe the tweets I'm about to read to you. It is disturbing how out in the open these trans agenda minded people are. They don't care. They are willing to come after your children and to inspire your children to harm themselves. Eli Erlich tweeted this, I ordered four times more estrogen and testosterone blockers than I actually take. You should too. Several states have now banned trans medicine for minors, but we won't let a single young person go without medication. We'll provide care ourselves if youth can't access formal medicine. So yeah, we're going to order extra medicine, quote unquote medicine, which we really know just be able to raise your child's body so that we can get the care to them if states have decided that it's illegal. Eli also tweeted this, I'm now a proud criminal in Mississippi for quote unquote aiding and abetting life-saving medicine for trans youth. I realize the risks of posting this, but it's more important to encourage others to share life-saving medications than guarantee one safety. Granted, I'm in little danger in New York, so Eli is basically, you want to talk about aiding and abetting. What he's really doing is baiting Mississippi. Basically saying Mississippi, I'm committing a crime out in the open. I don't care. I am all about getting children, these medicines to block their puberty and to deform their genitalia because that's what these puberty blockers do in the long run, of course. Well, Eli also tweeted this, people keep asking why I'm so openly posting about sharing hormones. It's intentional. I want one, those losing access to know to ask their friends for meds. Two, people with meds to know they can share them at minimal risk. And three, the right to know they can't stop us from obtaining health care. So imagine just being a drug dealer, basically saying, I'm a drug dealer, I don't care. This is the risk that I'm willing to take in order to get drugs. People even knowing that those drugs are now not allowed for certain people because they're minors and minors should not be allowed. I mean, lay their own bodies before they even understand what the consequences are long term for them doing that. And that's all these states are trying to protect children from their allowing children to be children and not allowing warped adults, like Eli Eric, who are openly admitting to the fact that they are criminals, to pursue them. Because Eli Heilich, of course, is a predator. He is willing to prey on children. Well, guess what? My colleague and friend, I was outraged by this. And essentially, I'm astounded that this is allowed on Twitter, someone commented, you know, it's good that it's allowed on Twitter, because these people out themselves, and then we get to take action. And before I could even take action, Matt Walsh, who has been on the case of a transgender more than anybody else in my mind in recent history, Matt Walsh tweeted, Hi, Eli, thank you for admitting to a felony in a state that's actually willing to prosecute. I've been in touch the governor's office already. Do you want to confess to committing crimes in any other red states? What about Tennessee? And indeed, Matt Walsh was already in touch with the governor's office, and they intend to do whatever they can in their capacity to protect children from this predator, Eli Eric, a drug dealer and a predator, who is somehow allowed to pursue a PhD. Now, do we expect that the university is going to do anything? I don't know what I can tell you as I am committed to reporting him if he is a PhD candidate indeed, reporting him to the university, because any person that outwardly says that their drug dealer should not be allowed to be considered as a PhD candidate. Do we agree on that? Do we all agree on that? Do you think that a conservative be able to get away with this? Absolutely not. Conservatives can say that they're a Trump supporter, and they can lose their status in life, right? This person is openly admitting to being a drug dealer. So we're going to find out if privilege exists for these trans people, right? If they have trans privilege, and they're allowed to openly admit to wheeling and dealing drugs to minors, no less, not like you're just selling drugs to your friends, you're saying I am selling drugs to minors, and I am encouraging others to do it. So let's see if the university system will protect Eli Eric. I hope the answer to that is no. Moving on, you guys, I want to talk about the double standard that there is that is in favor of women and against men, and that is as it pertains to cougars. You have heard me talk a lot about how uncomfortable I am when people that are the age of 50 plus date people that are 18, 19, 20 years old, and in Hollywood, it's applauded outside of society. People definitely will give you dirty looks outside of Hollywood society. People will definitely say this is not okay. But I've always remarked on Leonardo DiCaprio, how strange it is. Scott Diesick, I think if there's honestly something wrong with these people, I think they're basically saying I'm not technically a pedophile because this person's 18, but yeah, I'm watching these people on Instagram when they're 17 years old, and they're below the legal age. And the second that they turn 18, I swoop them up. It's gross, it's disgusting, and I'm going to continue to call it out. But I've realized, because someone pointed out to me that there was a double standard when it comes to women that are cougars. People just think it's cool when an older woman says that she's going to pursue really young men. I don't know why that is. I think that when women do things that are bad, it's somehow more forgivable. Forgiveable. But somebody brought to my attention this account Instagram, it's Hela Cougar. This woman is in her 50s. Her name is Patsy Manutee. She is a writer, according to herself, a transformational coach and a yogini. And also, she notes, a chaser of cubbies. And what is a cubbie? A cubbie, obviously, she's a cougar. So she pursues cubbies. And she basically has garnered a following 11,000 people as she takes you through a day of what it's like being a cougar. Being at the gym, trying to look good, just walking on the treadmill, sitting beside the pool. These are some images of her. You can see she is dressed provocatively. She is wearing a very short pink skirt and a bra. She has her belly out. She's in a bikini, and she gets attention for this. And she basically says that I like to sleep with younger men. And besides that's fine. Whatever. They're illegal. They're in their early 20s. That's not a problem. Well, Madonna, who is 64 years old, is a cubby chaser. I think she's been that way her entire life. She was married. I think the oldest person she's ever been with is Guy Ritchie. And he was 10 years her junior. Nothing problematic there. But since then, she's really just dating guys that are younger and younger and younger. And now she has confirmed that she's dating another 20 year old. This guy is 28 years old. His name is Josh Popper. She has confirmed her relationship with him in a really weird post on Instagram. And so I just want to ask you guys the question. How do you feel about this? How do you feel about a 64 year old young woman who likes to date the coaches of her young son? Right? Here is a list of just some of the younger men that she has dated over the years. There was probably most famous among them. Jesus loose. Everyone remembers that. There was a 29 year age gap between them. Rahim Zibat also a 28 year age gap to Moore Steffins 29 year age gap. Abu Kar, Sumahoro, a 33 year age gap. Kevin Sanfio 28 year age gap. Ahlama Leek, Williams 36 year age gap. And Andrew Darnell, a 41 year age gap. Do you think that's strange? Do you think it's strange? I do think it's strange to tell you why I think it's strange because we do know that Madonna wrote fiction fantasies in her book about being a pedophile. We I read it to you guys on the show what she wrote in her book entitled sex how she would have fantasies about a young Latino person. Again, this was a work of fiction. But who even in their fiction mind creates a character that wants to sleep with a prepubescent boy? Madonna did. And as she lives her life, she loves to sleep with younger men. A 41 year age gap. Could you imagine at any point in your life dating someone that's 41 years younger than you? So lastly question. When would you be comfortable dating someone that's 41 years your junior? Is that not odd? But don't worry. She's Madonna. She's in Hollywood and perversion is celebrated. So people will say this is amazing. This is what she likes. She just likes younger men. Yay. She's a cougar. She's got herself a cubby. Nothing wrong with that. It's empowering. No, it's not empowering. It's creepy. And so I would like to put a red flag on that paying attention to Madonna's dating history and realizing that something strange is happening there. And it's probably even stranger than Leonardo Caprio. I don't even think Leonardo DiCaprio has dated somebody that has had a 41 year age gap with him. So a lot of perverts in Hollywood. Moving on, you guys, I want to discuss this Andrew Tate story or a non-story. I think this is really strange. I don't know why a bunch of conservatives are sharing this old clip of him. So I'll give you the background. This began being past Ron Twitter. People saying that it's proof that Andrew Tate is gay or proof that Andrew Tate is a danger to young men. And when I say people, obviously the left hates Andrew Tate. The right also dislikes Andrew Tate. And I think it's because people are taking him too seriously. So let's take a listen to the clip and you can let me know your thoughts in the comments. And then I am going to tell you my thoughts. Take a listen. I recently posted a question on Twitter asking, would you rather have sex with a transsexual, which is a legitimate 10 or a woman, which is a legitimate one? And everyone's sitting there clicking woman, woman, woman, woman, because they think they're going to be gay and they do anything else. But they're not actually thinking about the question. I am so smart. I operate on so many levels higher than the average man. You people are not thinking about the question. When I say a one and a 10, I mean Megan Fox with a that's the tranny or Hulk Hogan with a that's the girl. This is the question I'm asking. Megan Fox or Hulk Hogan. So you're thinking, well, I don't want to be gay. So I just put the girl the number one, do it. You're gonna Hulk Hogan. Okay, there's a he's got mustache and muscles and **** all hairy big dude, six foot five. It's pretty gay to me. That sounds pretty good. I don't care if that is gay. Where's Megan Fox? Okay, he's got maybe you can like scoot it out the way I'm still making Fox. It's just so ridiculous. I can't believe that people are taking this seriously. I saw this tweet from Liz Wheeler who by the way, I love Liz Wheeler. She's another mom. We talk all the time about the fact that we're both openly anti-vax. But I saw this tweet that she authored. She wrote, if you've defended, idolized or copied and rotate despite my warnings that he's dangerous to young men, and you take is now telling young men to have sex with transgendered women, AKA men with penises. And I had not seen the video and I watched it underneath that. Expecting something that was very serious and heavy. And that's something that was just such a clear troll. I mean, I watched this. This is so ridiculous. Obviously trolling. Would you rather his audience is younger men? Oh, what would you rather do? He looks like a Hulk Hogan. This is why I say, entertain to me goes under the category of Alex Jones. They are doing these things for entertainment. They are trolling a lot of times. Then you have people that take them deadly seriously all the time. And we shouldn't do that. I think actually Tim Poole had the right response to this. He wrote, would you rather eat a pinecone or a coloring book? Some questions serve no real purpose. I get his point. We talked about it after that sovereign bra clip went viral, but sometimes it's just like no beef man, but neither. They're both equally undesirable to me. I think that would probably be the answer. This is a false dichotomy. You don't have to do this or do that. He's saying it to be entertaining. He's saying it because he knows that it's going to send people into a tizzy and they're going to comment and say, oh, it's so gamey. Why would you even say that? And that's how Andrew Tate gets followers and more clicks. And so, bait, line, sinker, done. Let's not take these things so seriously. There's not, I don't think that there's any conservatives that are taking Andrew Tate content like they take Jordan Peterson content. And I don't think that he means for it to. I think that he's meaning to be entertaining and funny most of the times. And we don't have to find entertaining or funny, but we shouldn't make everything. We shouldn't take everything so seriously.

All right, you guys, it is now time to jump into some of your comments. These first out of comments are from me discussing, turning down a million dollars. Steve Chaffen writes, I'd say anything for that million. For me, it's life-changing. It must be nice to be rich. I'll go back to working 60 hours a week trying to make ends meet, taking care of my elderly parents, one of them fighting cancer on Medicare. While Steve, I don't know why you thought that why was a millionaire. When I turned down that one million dollars, I certainly was not. As I said, it was the first one million dollars that I ever took. I also don't know why you think that I don't work 60 hours a week. Do you follow me on Instagram? Do you follow the show? What do you think happens? Do you think that this is a clone and somebody comes in and does this work for me? Do you think that there's somebody else coming up with these ideas for monologue and having discussions with you? How many hours do you think I work? And then add on to that the fact that I go home every day and I cook for my family and I have two children and I have all these other responsibilities. What do you think I'm doing? Going to bed and sleeping for 14 hours a day while everybody else makes things happen in my world. Lastly, taking care of the elderly, that's really a good thing to do. Why do I know what's good thing to do? Because I do it. My dad lives with me. My dad is sick and he has something that he's working through right now. On top of everything else, take care of my father. So Steve Taffen, you are ignorant and I hope that you are responsible ignorant. Not saying this to be mean but do not assume that because you see me on your screen, that I don't make the very same sacrifices and commitments as you do, that it was not a huge loss to me, a huge personal loss to me to walk away from a million dollars and I had nothing at that time to replace it because don't forget when I first signed Billy Wire, I had to show that was one day a week. So huge life change. I'm proud of what I did. I go back to my monologue and saying to you, Steve Taffen, that you didn't like what I did because you didn't think and you admit that you had the capacity to do it yourself. Not because what I did was not actually a good act. Moving on, Birdie Girl writes, it's ironic that Owens' book would be about feminism. She has said that working wives emasculate their husbands but she works. The book would be work and the income would further amassically her husband. She didn't mean that. Just wanted to trash feminism. Why does anybody respect her opinion? It's ironic that you set this up with a statement that I've never made. I've never once said working wives emasculate their husbands. You can't, you're literally, Birdie, you're arguing with yourself in a statement all by yourself and then argue the statement that you made all by yourself. I've never once said working wives emasculate their husbands. I have said that it is aspirational to be a stay-at-home mom. I want stay-at-home moms to not feel that they aren't doing enough because culture is signaling to them that they're not doing enough and that just isn't the case. They are doing the absolute most. It takes everything to raise good human beings. If you have the option to do that, you should not feel ashamed. So now that you have it straight, what I actually said, why don't you reauthor a new comment. Next, we have David Langley. He writes, I think it depends upon what you want me to say. For example, if you want me to say something like dogs or predators and cats, then no problem. However, lying in a way that causes true harm, then no. Hey, God bless us all, amen. You know what, David Langley, I'm going to agree with you. If they had wanted me to say something like, I don't know, small, tiny dogs are really cute and not annoying and not yappy and serve no real purpose, maybe I would have said it. Maybe I would have said it. But I do not believe that small dogs are not annoying. They're very annoying because they act all the time and it's very loud and I do not like the way it sounds. So, for $4 million, I'd say Chihuahua was her cute. Next up regarding Tucker Carlson, obviously, he has been so brave in coming out with all of the January 6 footage. 40,000 hours work that his team is plowing through and he is under a lot of attacks left and right. He is correct. It is a swamp. Tiffany Williams writes, although he was escorted in there. She's talking about the shaman. Is that mean it's okay to be there? The doors were locked for a reason. Just because it was allowed, does it make it right to be there? Just because my tax dollars paid up keep it, there are still rules. But I don't think anybody is making the argument that the shaman had a right to be in there. What we're saying is that the portrayals of him as a violent, crazy person who stormed through the building simply is not true. When you then see that at one point, he had 11 officers around them and they helped him find the floor. They tested doors and walked him in. It changes dramatically. The circumstances, it changes dramatically whether or not he committed a federal crime worthy of the years in prison that he is now serving. And of course, he should not be serving years in prison. Honestly, he should have been hit with a simple trespassing charge. Camera Man 6 by 5 writes, mainstream media are already saying that this and upcoming tapes are heavily edited and even doctored. While not a huge Tucker fan, I'm giving him a huge thumbs up on this one. Chuckle Schumer's rant on the Senate floor was priceless. Yeah, if you are on the bad side of Chuck Schumer, you are on the right side of Cana so and I couldn't agree with you more. The idea that it's doctored or edited, that's just completely bizarre, obviously. Fox News would have never allowed that. They've opened themselves up to a lot of lawsuits that they had done that. People are just angry and we're not at the stage, by the way, where they are, Democrats are trying to see whether or not they can convince their followers not to believe their own eyes. Talk about something that is entirely Orwellian. Don't believe your own eyes. You now see the tapes, but let me tell you why it doesn't matter what you saw, but we told you it was true. Lastly, we have a comment from Divine Femrizing11. She writes, I remember when I wasn't as conscious and I thought you were the crazy one. You weren't the crazy one. I was. Thank you, Cana. She was amazing and your strength to walk in truth is so admired and needed right now. These are the best kinds of comments. I love people that were just like me, formerly a liberal, and believing that everything that they heard was true from the mainstream media and then waking up and becoming more conscious and realizing how easily manipulated we all can be. So I really deeply appreciate that comment. All right, guys, you know how this works? The next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on DailyWire Plus. I'm going to be answering your questions and taking a case in my courtroom. So if you are not yet a member, go ahead and click the description and subscribe right now."
