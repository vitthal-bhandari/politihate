Okay, we don't only sell my mittens on Etsy. Etsy Etsy is the play for box mittens. He's really quite a skilled knitter. I don't even know what you would call someone who knits. A knitter. Oh, you got to be careful with that word, God, God forbid. He's a knitter. Uh, he likes to knit. Um, all right. So, um, moving right along. And, uh, Donald Trump are going head to head in a battle for the hearts and minds of same people in America. And one of the things that Ron DeSantis has done recently is he passed a bill and signed it, which makes an awful lot of sense to say, Hey, if you're under the age of 18, we're not going to allow you in the state of Florida to get so-called gender affirming care. Note how good they are at naming things. It's not mutilate your bodies. It's gender affirming care. And for those of you out there who are aware, uh, this is basically the idea that if you're 14 and you decide, Hey, I'm a boy and a girl's body that you don't get to go to a doctor and have them remove your breasts. And it also is the idea of, Hey, let's not allow people to get puberty blockers to keep them from becoming, you know, adults, members of the male or female sex, post puberty. So this is relatively uncontroversial, Buck. And we've talked about this on the show and I do think it's important because we were just talking about the debt ceiling. And I understand that the debt ceiling is a battle and it's important to restrict federal spending to the best of our ability. Cause we just spent more money trying to fight COVID than we did to beat the Nazis in World War two and much of that money was wasted and we've gone from $10 trillion in debt when the tea party got all fired up back in 2010 and now we're over 30 trillion in debt. And so there's no end in sight to this. That's an important battle, but it's a battle where you can say, well, should the federal government grow at a 3% rate or a 2% rate? So you can argue about that. That's a traditional political battle. To me, Buck, the idea of whether or not you are able to, uh, to give a 14 year old surgery to chop their boobs off is truly the difference between right and wrong. And it's important to recognize a couple of things. One, as this whole trans universe continues to spin, the only Democrat that I have heard publicly say men who identify as women shouldn't be able to compete against women and women's athletics is Robert F Kennedy, Jr. Not one Democrat elected in the house, not one Democrat elected in the Senate would oppose that idea. It's crazy. But also now this idea of gender affirming care is absolutely insane. And today at the White House, I believe this is today, Kareem Jean Pierre attacked the idea that you should have to be 18 years old to wait to have surgery that could remove your genitals. Listen, there are more than 600 pieces of anti LGBTQ plus legislation out there. A few hundred of them are anti trans communities. And that matters because we have to call that out. And we've never seen this level. It's historic in the number of pieces of legislation. And I've met a lot of parents of trans kids in the past couple of months who have told me this, these devastating stories, whether they're in Texas or Oklahoma or wherever they are, saying how they now have to seriously consider leaving their state to protect their child. And that's something that we have to call out and continue to be very clear about that these are kids. These are our kids. They belong to all of us. Okay, that is actually from the GLAD Awards on Saturday with Kareem Jean Pierre. But this is pretty crazy stuff to be saying, Hey, we have to call this out. If you're 14 and you want to get your boobs chopped off, this is a human right. I also always shudder when I hear collectivists, which is what the Democrat Party is comprised of talking about our kids. No, they are your kids as in the parents listening to this and parents all across the country. They're your children. They're not, you know, the children of the community. They are not communal in that sense. And the notion that you're going to frame this debate right now, if you're Korean Jean Pierre, as you're going to protect your kids by taking them out of state to get a gender transition. I think about how much research people that I know who are really squared away when it comes to health and wellness, they'll do before any medical procedure, any, you know, certainly any surgery, where am I, what hospital I go into? What doctor am I going to go to? What are the long term complications? What are the prog, what are the prognosis I should expect from this? What are the chances something goes wrong? Is it really worth it to do this? And then compare that with the stories that you can find all over the place of a 12 year old goes in and there is a conveyor belt of go get your trans surgery. There is a, oh, we have to affirm this right away. We have to push you. No one's on to question this. So think about this. Where else in life would you find yourself in a situation where your life can be radically altered for the future? And there's no dissent. There's no outside opposing voices allowed to enter into the conversation, right? There are so many. I mean, think about all the time people spend, which cancer treatment should I get, for example, you know, what, what, you know, how quickly should I move on and how aggressive should we be with trans issues? The left has decided get the kids to chop themselves up and take the drugs as quickly as possible. No questions asked. Push it forward, get it done. And it is truly monstrous and that Kresge on Pierre and these others talk about this stuff. Like, you know, there was some big study that just came out of adults. You might have seen this play of adults, 30% of them to go off the hormones and are at least in some state of detransition because they hate it so much. Yeah. They, you know, what are the chances of people would, you know, you start to look at the long term prognosis for mental health or physical health for adults. You're doing this to kids even at a more formative stage. You know, we have to keep fighting on this issue because it's obviously critical to the agenda of the left. And I think it's evil. I really think it's evil. I think that's the appropriate word for it. I think it is the appropriate word, Buck. And I would just build on that a little bit. How many of you out there had decisions when you were 14 or 15 that you look back on and you're like, I can't believe I did that 14, 15, 16, many of these treatments sterilize children for life. The idea that at 14, 15 or 16, you would voluntarily undergo a treatment that would prevent you from ever becoming a dad or a mom is barbaric. I can't believe that this is even in a intelligent society, a position that anyone could adopt. And yet it is dogma now for the Democrat party that you are not allowed to question to the extent you just heard from Karine Jean Pierre, the White House press secretary, basically trying to say it's barbaric to not be allowing the surgeries to take place and building on that in a larger context. When you are forcing someone to accept a fundamental untruth, which is, Hey, you can change your gender. I really think the conversation needs to shift from adults can make choices. And Buck, you pointed out a lot of those adults even end up regretting the choices that they are making because the question we really should be asking, I think is what have we created in our society that so many kids are so profoundly unhappy in their own bodies that they think the only way they can be happy is by changing their gender? Because you know, when you're a teenager, you vacillate oftentimes your emotions, your biochemistry, everything else. One reason that teenagers are so moody is because there's so much, you know, biochemistry working with puberty and everything that's going on there. And oftentimes you end up in a situation where you feel like you need to take some grand gesture. I'm going to call her out here for a sec, our producer Ali. She said off the air, Buck. She was in a goth chick back when she was in. Did you know this producer Ali was, I believe you can correct me if I'm wrong, Ali was a goth chick when she was in high school. There's a lot of people out there listening to us right now that look at their high school class photos. My kids make fun of my high school class photos all the time because of the hair choices I made, the clothes choices I made. But you make sometimes choices and you're able to go back and you laugh at them and you say, boy, remember when I was dressing up like a vampire for a while? Or I was an emo person or whatever you might be, right? You grow into adulthood and you end up looking back at some of the decisions you made when you were a teenager and thinking, boy, that was really dumb. This is why we don't let people get tattoos, right? Can you imagine being 24 and looking back and saying, boy, you know, that decision in retrospect to chop my boobs off probably wasn't a good one. Like irreversible awful decisions should be opposed by anyone with a functional brain in America. And very often these are irreversible awful decisions. You know, there's an additional layer of this that I think never gets enough enough attention by pushing by telling these 12 year olds, for example, you tell a 12 year old, take the hormone blockers, have the surgery, you know, now and maybe finished some of it when you get a little older, whatever it may be, you're a little boy and you think you're a girl or your little girl, think your boy doesn't. Let's assume little boy who thinks he's a girl. You're 12 years old. They tell you do this, do this because that's affirming who you are. Do they tell them that no one is actually going to really think they're a girl for the rest of their lives? Do they tell them that this is all a lie that we are made to play along with some kind of really twisted and evil joke that people are going to walk around? They're not going to say, Oh, look at that little girl or look at that young woman. They're going to say, look at that individual who something's going on there. Yeah. They're not going to say it's a girl. They're not going to believe that it's a woman. That doesn't happen. And I know that people like to say, Oh, but it's the surgeries are getting better and better. Well, who's the person going to date? How is that going to work? How are you going to explain this to possible mates? Does anyone tell the 13 year olds that Karan Jean Pierre thinks need to be chopping off their breasts and taking hormones right now? Any of these things? No, they do not because this is all about a fashionable belief system for adults who are too cowardly to stand up for children, sometimes unfortunately, including children that are theirs. That's just wrong. It's different with adults with kids. This should be stopped. And I think the states that are taking us and stepping and are doing the right thing. 100% just think about it this way. If you were 14 and you'd gotten to pick a tattoo, what percentage of 44 year olds or 64 year olds are like, man, that was a great decision. I made when I was 14 about that permanent body tattoo I got. Not very many. $25 goes a long way these days on the MyPillow website company does.

It felt like my movements were in the spotlight. In Gresa, Valbenasine capsules is a prescription medicine for adults with TD. It's the only TD treatment that's always one pill, one staly and it's number one prescribed. And people taking in Gresa can stay on most mental health meds. In Gresa can cause depression, suicidal thoughts or actions in patients with Huntington's disease. Pay close attention to and call your doctor if you become depressed, have sudden changes in mood, behaviors, feelings or have thoughts of suicide. Don't take in Gresa if you're allergic to its ingredients. In Gresa may cause serious side effects including angioedema, potential heart rhythm problems and abnormal movements. Report fevers, stiff muscles or problems thinking as these may be life threatening. Sleepiness is the most common side effect. Now that treatment has reduced my TD movements, it's nice. People focus more on me. Ask your doctor about In Gresa or learn more at engresa.com. That's I-N-G-R-E-Z-Z-A dot com. So Clay narrowly averted a bit of a radio disaster today. Really just a more disaster of the home, I guess you could say, a little bit of a challenge to get things done if you are without power. It turns out Clay, why don't you share with them? Just so you all know, we sit here and we're also focused on trying to save the country that occasionally we do forget things like to pay the electricity bill, Clay. Today, this morning at my house, the local electric company knocked on the door and they said, I wasn't here. My wife answered the door. She was like, yes, hello? And they said, hey, I'm sorry. We're coming to turn off your electricity today because you haven't paid since March. But I don't think they've reached out to me, at least not that I've noticed. Now I have a lot of these do not call numbers blocked because I don't want to be getting blown up during the middle of the show. But if my wife had not been here, I might have had to call our production team be like, guys, I'm going to have to rush into the downtown studio. They've been like, oh my god, goodness what? Or more likely they would have immediately reached out because the cameras would have gone down. My credit card expired and it was set up to pay the electric bill and somehow I didn't know and it got to the point where the electric company showed up at the house today to turn off our electricity. So if you're a husband out there today and you're like, what in the world could Clay Travis have done that I can use as an example of how much better of a husband than I am? There's probably many things. If somebody didn't knock on your door threatening to turn off the electricity today, congratulations. You've managed to pay that bill. That would have been an unexpected twist. Is being the repo man among the most stressful jobs in America? Most dangerous, right? It must be one of the most stressful and dangerous jobs. I mean, if it's between bounty hunter and repo man, I think I might go bounty hunter, at least that you're you kind of know what you're in for because some sir, sometimes the repo goes off really easily. But sometimes not so much. Well, especially with the crime rates that we have right now, I would think a lot of repo guys get mistaken for criminals who are just stealing cars or motorcycles or whatever they've got to repossess. Whereas at least if you're dog the bounty hunter, I guess, and you're grabbing somebody physically to bring them back for skipping bail, you know, there's there's an understanding of exactly what's going on, although both those jobs would be tough and evidently being Clay Travis's electric company also a tough job. So I'm glad the company didn't go bankrupt over over my failure. And to be fair, I'm glad we still got power in the Travis household because without this good, good, good, good result, solid result, pure talk, great deal going on.

Welcome back everybody we are joined by Missouri attorney general Andrew Bailey the first on the program. This attorney general thank you for being with us sir. Hey thank you so much for having me on. So we were just talking a few moments ago about what the White House White House press secretary Korea Jean Pierre said about children having to leave states because of transgender care. You which is what they call it we call it you know gender transition surgery etc. You are in the midst of a battle in your state right now over this issue over transgender issues. Can you just bring everyone up to speed with with what brought you to this point what's going on. We're trying to restrict and where does the legal battle lie right now. Yeah absolutely well several months ago a whistleblower from a pediatric transgender clinic approached my office with a sworn affidavit and if any if any part of that affidavit any part of her testimony is true this clinic was doing nothing short of child abuse. I mean it's not really health care it's woke left wing ideology masquerading is health care that's really just gender mutilation and castration and and it harms kids. So we started an investigation was the first of its kind of the nation where we have multi juris or excuse me multi agency investigation in which we marshaled state resources together and we took a look into the clinic and we said we called for a moratorium on these kinds of procedures until we could figure out what kind of safeguards are in place. Well the clinic refused the auspices that they were the only clinic that provided these kinds of treatments the state of Missouri. Well subsequent investigation revealed that's not true there's a shadowy and clandestine network of these gender mutilation clinics across the state and so we had to take action and to that end we promulgated an emergency rule under the cause under our consumer protection statutes to say look if you're going to be doing these kinds of procedures they've got to be safeguards in place the providers have to acknowledge the experimental nature of these drugs have to acknowledge the irreversible impacting negative consequences of the surgical procedures and need to make sure that they're informing patients that in Europe these European nations curtailed these procedures years ago because they didn't want to harm a generation of kids so we promulgated the rule and that really motivated our general assembly to act and so our general assembly had been working on a bill while they were in session and I'm proud to say that shortly after we've promulgated that rule they got the bill done and so we're going to withdraw the rule because at this point the general assembly has banned these procedures in the state of Missouri I'm proud to say and we're going to switch into defense mode and defend the law against inevitable legal challenge but our investigation into these clinics is ongoing because we have to look retrospectively at what happened and whether or not there were safeguards in place or whether or not this was at the end of the day whether or not it was child abuse so we're going to fight the whole wrongdoers accountable and protect kids in the state of Missouri. I appreciate you coming on I'm just curious if parents were regularly taking 13 year olds to get tattoos I imagine that would violate Missouri law. When you go out and you discuss these things with parents I think one of the reasons why having someone like you on to discuss this is so important is I think a lot of parents are flying blind at how commonplace this has been because it sounds so crazy to think about an irreversible gender altering surgery being done on a 14 or 15 year old one that might sterilize them for life God forbid I think a lot of parents are just unaware that this has been going on. And unaware of how dangerous it is there are zero zero FDA approvals showing puberty blockers and cross-ex hormones be safe or gender dysphoria certainly we know that the FDA has warned that they cause blindness brain swelling loss of the density it's dangerous stop and certainly the surgery is irreversible and could cause long term drug addiction where you've got you get into these procedures where you've got to have the medication to just maintain stability and the problem is these kids come into clinics with a mental health condition it's called gender dysphoria they're confused about their gender now our whistleblower tells us that is a clinic where she worked 75% of the kids learned about their gender on tiktok so kids come and say well on tiktok I watched this and I'm confused about my gender instead of talking to these kids and providing those mental health services immediately start the chemical castration and lobbing off body parts it is great. I mean it's absolutely crazy we had to inject a level of sanity in this conversation we took immediate action to restore order and to provide some limited safeguards and we're proud of the work that you're going to simply start to ban these procedures and you're right at the end of the day I have a five year old I cannot consent to my five year old riding the front seat of my car because it's too dangerous and let's think about this from another perspective if I walk into a clinic today and say I walk into a hospital and say well I have leg dysphoria I'm confused about my legs I want you to take my legs off are they going to take out the song start and and that's the time to take my leg off heck no they're not they're going to say wait a minute you need some mental health treatment why is this any different and so just having a rational conversation being willing willing to stand up and fight on this issue to protect kids is really critical that's putting the left woke ideology for what it is which is a danger to entire generation of children. We're speaking to Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey how how young I mean your law enforcement officer right I mean you're somebody who has to deal with the facts as they are when you're talking about these clinics how young are some of the children that are that are having surgical procedures done for this so-called transition. Well we have really serious concerns that at a minimum at middle school age I mean look the way too young and the scary thing is the clinic the clinicians at this particular clinic had testified at our General Assembly a year before saying that they would never refer anyone under 18 for these irreversible surgeries and yet the whistleblower said that happened directly and in fact to obtain parental consent the clinic would bully parents it could Joel parents circumvent resistant parents while they give consent and would say things in front of the child like you want a live daughter or dead son in order to control the parent of reviving the consent that's not real parental consent that's coercion and it injects suicidal ideation into a conversation with a mental health patient that maybe didn't have suicidal ideation before so again this is dangerous stuff it was motivated it was improperly motivated and it puts an entire generation of kids at risk the whistleblower has a lot of credibility she's someone who self-described as a progressive who believes in transgender rights and wanted to work at a pediatric transgender clinic because she wanted to help these kids with transitions and what she saw went too far for her so again if even one tenth of this is true it's nothing short of child abuse I'm proud to live in a state where our elected representatives were willing to stand up and fight side by side with me to put a stop to it. Attorney General before we let you go I want to ask you because there's all also switching topics for a moment here the huge issue of our de facto open border U.S.-Mexico border Missouri doesn't get a lot of attention to the national headlines as a state where there's a big influx of illegals but fentanyl I'm sure is crossing your borders in just completely unacceptable numbers and you're probably dealing with the same epidemic there are there that exist in many other states what can you tell us about what the open border is meaning for your state and what you want to do to combat it. Well Biden is trying to destroy America by opening the border and it's de facto but it's also dejuring look he is perverting the law to allow it to achieve a policy objective that would otherwise not be achievable under the plain text and he's doing that by perverting the parole process it's supposed to be for individualized determinations on entry based on humanitarian concerns and opening that up to a basic like a new visa program to allow it large slots of people in and they're supposed to have a court date and return to court within 60 days of entry under the parole process but instead Biden's not giving them a court date saying you promised me to come back fine come on in and so it's a dejure asylum program as well and so this is scary stuff what it's making Missouri less safe I met a police officer the other night who had been searching a vehicle and had been exposed to fentanyl dust and had to receive dark hands three times to avoid being killed by his exposure to fentanyl we know that human trafficking is on the rise this is dangerous stuff and it's in Biden's destroying America by perverting the law rather than enforcing the law. Missouri Attorney General Bailey appreciate you make the time for a sir we'll talk to you again soon. Hey thanks guys appreciate you talk soon.

contractor so it was really a treat to get to sit down with him and talk for a few hours so check that one out all right we have some great stuff here coming to the here we go V.I this is a VIP but now I want to admit something to you all clay was trying to be funny I don't actually I wish I knew how to knit but I do not I don't even know how to put a button back on a shirt a dress shirt which I honestly want to learn how to do since I married Carrie I've gotten better because I don't want her to know that I'm not great with hammers and nails I like guns but I don't know much about hammers and nails so I'm trying to get better at the home improvement home depot stuff I do cook a lot though I like to cook and I actually enjoy I enjoy cleaning and doing laundry so you know there are just certain things that I like cleanliness I'll tell you this I like cleanliness I also like silence which is weird maybe for radio guy but I like quiet but some of you're writing in about my my ability to knit and I wish that was just clay being clay and and and having having some fun with me but Patricia wrote in I thought this is really interesting one of our VIPs my father was a lieutenant in the army Air Corps during World War II he spent 18 months in a German prison camp I watched and listened to my father talk about knitting and unknitting his socks because he was an officer he was not allowed to work so he learned to knit and play bridge on such a high level that he only had a few friends that would play with him he shot the moon more than anyone I know he was wicked good these stories were shared with me from time to time I was just a little girl by the way I still wear the stocking hat that he knit for me these wonderful treasured memories will proudly be shared by our daughters only real men knits he says well I Patricia I I'm all about it I think I think being able to knit any any creative constructive skill is to be appreciated and it gives you a sense there's something really special about learning things that are new that are useful I love learning new stuff one of the best parts about this job is that whenever I learn something really interesting there's always this little little firing of the synapses in my mind that goes oh this is something maybe I can talk about on the radio sometime so it's always encouraging encouragement for me to learn new cool stuff so that when I'm on air I can even just throw in the mix of a conversation something that you will find interesting too so I but that's also true about more hard skills crafts being able to do stuff the doing of stuff and and that's I think something that more and more people are realizing you get a real satisfaction from it like I said my probably my favorite craft is is the is cooking I do like to cook food and I will still I will go to my end saying that I make amazing you know scrambled eggs and and steaks and I'm pretty good at that stuff right the proteins I've got down but I do wish that look I'll tell you I thought about learning and my family members would laugh at me right now because they're like really but I think woodworking would be really cool and not just because Ron Swanson was so good at it in parks and recreation and that was his thing I think woodworking is really cool I've played an instrument growing up but I never talk about what the instrument is I like to keep people in suspense on that one but I was I was pretty good would not really not good good like professional or or even high level amateur good but I was okay I could you know carry a tune with my instrument so anyway I did not learn how to knit and I want to and I'm probably going to try to teach myself how to sew buttons on because I just just the other day I had to do something on TV and the button on my cuff came off and that's you know I should learn how to fix this myself these are skills that people should have we've got some calls up here Dan in El Paso Texas right along the board of their Dan what do you got for us thanks for taking my call I wanted to remind everyone in the story where in 2020 Democratic congressman Adam Schiff was forced to release over 50 individual transcripts of testimony that were given in front of the house intelligence committee in 2017 closed hearings and under oath testimony under oath was given by ship and other officials mauvema officials that were saying at the time on various media outlets that there was evidence in plain sight of collusion of Russia and the campaign and Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential campaign under oath every one of these people testified they had no evidence of any such collusion Adam Schiff did not want to release these transcripts because in so and so they proved Adam Schiff and others in the Obama administration was liars the people that were involved did that testimony under oath included Adam Schiff James Clapper Andrew McCabe Ben Rhodes Samantha Power and Susan Rice you're right I mean I remember that shift was testifying about this behind closed doors and when it came to the possibility of perjury he had to speak the truth because he's a he's a shifty lawyer that shift thank you for calling in appreciate it and yeah I think I think that more and more people than ever before have woken up to the reality of what the Democrat media is willing to do and the lies that they are willing to tell that they are unrepentant and plan to do it again and that's a good thing because when you understand the record and the motivations of the other side you're more likely to be able to discern in real time is this more of their lies and propaganda or is this the occasional fact they throw in to make it seem like they care about reporting accurately looking forward to hanging to you
