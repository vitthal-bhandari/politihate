    "text": " What's shaking, you Nazis? I'm Dave Rubin. This is the Rubin Report Direct message for February 4th, 2021. And I am very much in the mood to do a show today. I'm actually always in the mood to do the show. It's very rare that I'm not. Sometimes I'm like, ah, another stupid story about CNN, some other nonsensical ridiculous thing happening that I have to talk about. But I do love doing this. I really do. But just sitting down with these stories in the last half hour, reviewing this stuff, we added a story at the last second because there's so much like crazy breaking nonsense. I was like, I am really in the mood to deliver the info to the people today. So let's do it. There's a lot to get to. As always guys, just don't forget to click that subscribe button. Something's going on with the powers that be over at YouTube and people keep getting unsubscribed. So quick before we get to all of it, guys, it's February. And if you're looking forward to a Valentine's Day, but not sure how to stay away from the candy, I've got just the solution for you. Built bar people, not bill bar, built bar. If you can get built bar, if you get bill bar though for, for a thousand I guess that would be pretty good. Bill bar is a secret to eating healthier food while also eating tastier food. Built bars are low calorie, low sugar, high protein, high fiber, great for the keto diet. You can actually lose your maintained weight while indulging in a yummy treat. Healthy has never been this delicious. Built bars taste like candy and come in 18 amazing flavors, including caramel brownie and peanut butter. My personal favorite as you know is the cookies and cream. I am a simple man. Built bars are covered in 100% chocolate, include both nut and nut free flavors and are soft and easy to chew. I know with restaurants finally opening up, it'll be tempting to indulge. But we also need to shed those additional quarantine pounds, which is why built bars are the perfect alternative to pie for the health, conscious guy. Each bar is about 110 to 160 calories. You're going to get 16 to 20 grams of protein, three to five net carbs. It's only February guys, don't give up on the New Year's resolution. Built bars are the answer, go to builtbar.com and use promo code Rubin to get 20% off your next order. Use promo code Rubin for 20% off at built bar.com. And I wonder if you go to builtbar.com and enter code Rubin, who knows what would happen. You know, and we can give that a try and let me know in the comments right down below. Okay, guys, we're doing four stories today. We added one just at the last second because this Jen Pesaki, who she is a piece of work, the White House press secretary. So we had to add a story on that because I saw some video from the press conference this morning and these people that govern us are ridiculous human beings. They are just absolutely completely ridiculous. But speaking of completely ridiculous human beings, the ACLU, the American civil liberties, what does the U stand for? American civil liberties, not university. What does it stand for? American civil liberties, union, union, the American civil liberties union, ACL, they're a union. All right. Well, they used to be a pretty great organization. So let me get the joking part out of the way quick. The ACLU used to be a phenomenal organization. They fought for free speech. There is the landmark case that you've probably heard me talk about before. And I had the former head of the ACLU, Nadine Strassenan, to talk about, which was the incredible case back in the early 70s. I think it was 71, maybe it was 72, which was Skokie, versus Illinois, where a bunch of neo-Nazis wanted to march in Skokie, Illinois. This was a place where I think it was the largest concentration of Holocaust survivors in the United States. And the ACLU actually defended their right to do that. They defended their right to express themselves, defended their right to free speech, despite the intentional provocation, despite the fact that they went exactly to where all these Holocaust survivors were, all of the hurt feelings, all of that stuff. The ACLU defended their right to do it. They said you can't do it violently, but you have a right to express themselves. That's a pretty, what I would say is a deeply moral position to take, and not one that's easy to do, right? It's easy to make easy decisions. It's hard to make hard decisions, right? So the ACLU, which has defended free speech forever, if you've been paying attention, in the last two, three years, has gone completely woke. And they have just absolutely thrown rationality and thought through the window in the name of social justice and just the endless litany of woe gloonessy that you guys hear about. So they put out a Twitter thread yesterday. And now, before I read you the Twitter thread, and I'll editorialize as I'm reading it, let's not forget that just yesterday, we covered a story how on CNN, they had a legal expert on saying that lying is not protected by the First Amendment. Now they did not correct that on CNN because CNN is not a place of journalism. The woman herself, she actually did send out a tweet saying that she basically misspoke. It wasn't really an apology or anything. But on CNN, so if you're an average watcher of CNN, you might think now that they brought on a legal expert who said you're not allowed to lie. And lying is against the First Amendment. Well I want you to work with me here. Let's go through all the lies in this ACLU thread. It's a four tweet thread here. First myth, sex is binary apparent at birth and identifiable through singular biological characteristics. That's actually not a myth. That's true. But here's what they go on to say, there is no one way for our bodies to be. Women including women who are transgender, intersex or disabled have a range of different physical characteristics. Okay, that's just not true, right? When you go and have a baby, what's the first thing they do? The baby, you got a boy, you got a girl. Are these doctors all transphobes? Like what's happening there? They go on to say biological sex and gender are not binaries. There are no set hormone ranges, body parts or chromosomes that all people of a particular sex or gender have. Yeah, again, guys, this is not true and you don't need to be a scientific or a mathematician to figure it out. Guys have penises. Women have vaginas. Okay? That's just kind of right. That doesn't mean that you can't identify as another gender. You can go ahead and transition, in which case I will treat you with respect if you treat me with respect. But telling us that science doesn't exist, no, that's part of the destruction that we're seeing of everything that we once held dear, but no, no, no, no, it's not right. So, that was their first tweet in the thread and basically you can see it's complete nonsense. Myth two will continue with the nonsense. Transathletes, physiological characteristics provide an unfair advantage over cisathletes. Transathletes vary in athletic ability just like cisgender athletes. In many states, the very same cis girls who have claimed that transathletes have an unfair advantage have consistently performed as well or better than transgender competitors. First off, when they talk about cis, what they mean is that if you are born a biological woman and you identify as a woman, then you're cis, like you're cisgendered. You are in the body you're supposed to be in. Now, this is also nonsense. You have all seen the videos of biological males who transition to female and then they crush the girls in wrestling because they are much bigger. They out-compete them in racing. They dunk over them in basketball. By the way, that is not to say that men are inherently better than women. We are born with different things. That gets to myth one that they lied about. We are just born differently. Men are generally stronger. Men are generally bigger. Once you transition, although you still have the same biological body parts, you're generally going to be stronger than all of these people. Congratulations to all of the feminists who are now all about the trans movement who are going to, in essence, have a bunch of biological men winning all of the athletic awards for female. Number two, as well. Here's myth three, which is right off that one. Myth, the participation of trans athletes hurts cis women. Excluding women who are trans hurts all women. It invites gender policing that could subject any woman to invasive tests or accusations of being too masculine or too good at the sport to be a real woman. I mean, I have no idea what they're talking about here. Not that anyone watches the NBA, but years ago I watched a little bit right when it started. There was this incredible woman on the Houston Comets, Cynthia Cooper. She was sort of older at the time when the league just started, but she was phenomenal. I actually did enjoy watching her. There's obviously some very good athletes there. Actually Sue Bird, who I think I thought of as maybe the best WNBA player in their 20 year history, went to the same high school. I played on the street with her a couple of times at the parks and stuff. This is not disrespect to girls that like basketball. Actually Michael, my producer, his sister, is a pretty awesome basketball player. She came here and she, my ass had hoarse a couple of weeks ago, which I'm still pissed about. So this has nothing to do with whether girls are good at things or some girls are better than boys at things or any of that stuff. But this is complete nonsense, excluding women who are trans hurt all women. No, it doesn't. If you are biologically something, then either you should play in the biological league of which you were born into, meaning if you were biologically male, then play in the male league. Or if there are that many trans people out there, then let's have, as we have a male division and a female division, let's have a trans division. But the idea that no, it won't affect biological cisgendered women at all. If you let all these guys in there, it's just like, guys, like give logic a chance, a little air. And myth for trans students need separate teams. So this is what I just addressed. Trans people like all people may experience detrimental effects to their physical and emotional well-being when they are pushed out of affirming spaces and communities. Well, that is true at some level, right? We all like to be part of groups that are somewhat similar to us, right? Whether that's a sport group or a reading club or a knitting club or whatever it might be, which is why I just said if they want their own, if trans people want their own sports groups, so you have your male division, your female division and your trans division, I guess you'd have to have two trans divisions, right? Because you'd have to have female to male, trans division, sports and male to female trans. And if you have four divisions, and I'm sure we can divide that up further, it goes on to say efforts to exclude subsets of girls from sports can undermine team unity and youth derive the most benefits from athletics when they are exposed to caring environments where teammates are supported by each other and by coaches. Look, I think you guys got the point here. The ACLU is no longer anything close to what it was. It is now a woke organization pushing social justice on everybody. I want to just be very clear. I've said this a million times and I know you morons at media matters that are watching this, trying to figure out how you can peg me as anti-trans or something. I have no problem with trans people. If you are an adult and you decide to transition, then God bless you and you know what, I'll treat you with respect. If you'll treat me with respect, that's what I always say. But the simple truth is that if you think you are being four women as you are having biological men put into women's athletics, then you got another thing coming. I'm 44. I have a torn ACL in my left knee, which I'm thinking about getting the surgery for. Actually a few doctors have even reached out because I mentioned on the show once, I would love to play in the NBA. I really would. I know I'm never going to play in the NBA and I know at the height of my basketball career I wasn't even remotely close, even though I do have a pretty good finger roll. But perhaps I will transition to female and play in the WNBA next season or just wait until a washed up 41 year old guy scoring two points a game who was a scrub in the NBA just says, okay, I'm going to transition and I'm going to be a 30 point scorer MVP in the WNBA. Is that what you people want? I know it all sounds ridiculous. It all sounds ridiculous, but this is the ridiculous path they are leading us down. Science does not matter to these people. They have decided to put science reality and facts underneath something known as social justice so that they can rejigger society into some way that they think is better. What it will do is actually destroy women. It'll destroy men as well, right? It will make people resentful actually of trans people and that I think is not what you want. I think that's not what you want. Anyway, don't give money to the ACLU. It's a really embarrassing organization at this point and just because something once was good doesn't mean it always will remain good and I think the ACLU is a perfect example of that. But speaking of sort of the war on reality that I've been talking about for quite some time, the New York Times, which also not really a place of journalism anymore, maybe it was 20 years ago, although a lot of my conservative friends say, Dave, you just weren't awoke to it. You had not realized it yet, but it was crap all the time. I don't know that it was fully crap all the time. I think they used to have more plurality of voices and I also think that we all know that the wokeism thing has just completely infected the entire thing. I mean, even one of the last 20 remaining decent liberals, Barry Weiss, had to leave the New York Times. That tells you how radical it has become. And the New York Times wrote a piece, well, first off, this is a sidebar to this story, but I saw this this morning, Mike Solana, who's an interesting voice on Twitter, who I've gotten to know a little bit, he tweeted out that there was an article in today's New York Times about how they should start looking into censoring, perhaps apps like Telegram and Signal because that's where all the bad guys are going right now. And it's so interesting because it's like, oh, I'm sure some of you remember this, those of you that have been with me for a while. Remember about two years ago when I was on the cover of the Sunday New York Times with Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro and Joe Rogan and Phil DeFranco and Milton Friedman, the libertarian economist, I think he's a Nobel Prize winner, and that we were all leading people to the alt, right? So what the New York Times does is they frame it like, oh, these are all the bad guys, and then you flash forward two years, and now they're writing pieces about, oh, people who might like those guys actually should be censored on these apps too. And we know that parlor was just nuked. So it's like, are they going to nuke Telegram or whatever else? Anyway, that's not even the story I'm covering right now because there's a lot going on here. The New York Times had a piece, how the Biden administration can help solve our reality crisis, and there's a bunch of highlights I want to get to here. hoaxes lies and collective delusions aren't new, but the extent to which millions of Americans have embraced them may be. The muddled chaotic information ecosystem that produces these misguided beliefs doesn't just jeopardize some lofty ideal of national unity. It actively exacerbates our biggest national problems and creates more work for those trying to solve them, and it raises an important question for the Biden administration. How do you unite a country in which millions of people have chosen to create their own version of reality? And finally, Joan Donovan, the research director at Harvard University's Shorenstein Center on Media Politics and Public Policy suggested that the Biden administration could set up a truth commission similar to the 9-11 commission. Man, these people love commissions. They love regulators. They love hearings. It's all drivel and nonsense. Nothing ever comes of any of it. Now what's interesting about this is what the New York Times in essence is saying here, if you don't believe all the news that's fit to print in our paper, right? That was the tagline of the New York Times, all the news that's fit to print. But what they really mean is all the news that's fit to print that fits within our narrative. And if you guys who suffer from misinformation and disinformation and you watch YouTube and you listen to podcasts and you watch the Joe Rogan program, you're scary people. How are we going to reprogram you? And I've done a couple shows in the last few weeks on people talking about how we are going to reprogram people. I mean, this is what they're literally talking about on CNN while they're also talking about how they can get Fox News knocked off the air. This is what Katie Couric, who I suppose was a journalist at one time, is talking about how we can deal with the misinformation and how we can reprogram people. And then the times, but the thing is, we could do the exact same thing here. I mean, this is the irony that these people don't understand. I believe it is my belief as a sentient human being that the New York Times and CNN are basically pure propaganda at this point. They have exposed themselves relentlessly. So I could sit here and literally read the exact same thing from our perspective. Actually, I'll do it real quick and you just tell me if it fits within the worldview that you might have talking about the lies of CNN, the New York Times, Huff Poe and the rest of them. Hokes his lies and collective delusions aren't new, but the extent to which millions of Americans have embraced them may be. Boy, that sounds right. The muddled chaotic information ecosystem that produces these misguided beliefs doesn't just jeopardize some lofty ideal of national unity. It actively exacerbates our biggest national problems and creates more work for those trying to solve them. And it raises an important question for the Biden administration. How do you unite a country in which millions of people have chose to create their own versions of reality? Boy, that's true. CNN and the New York Times really are doing that. MSNBC is doing it too. Let's not forget old Ali Vellci standing in front of a riot with literally a burning building exploding behind him telling us it's mostly peaceful. So they are the purveyors of this nonsense. I don't need a Harvard University professor or researcher to tell me that they're lying to me. They're lying to all of us. Moving on. Okay, so this is the one that I saw right before we started. It's just a piece of work. So Jen Pasaki is the White House press secretary. She's not very good at her job. She seems fairly incompetent, but of course the media loves her. I covered yesterday that CNN is one of their chief political analyst David Axelrod. He thinks she's doing a really great job. Of course he did work in the Obama administration and Joe Biden was the BP in that administration, but he's totally impartial as a CNN analyst. These are serious people doing serious work and bringing you the truth. So Jen Pasaki was asked today more about what's going to happen after we're all vaccinated. And I should just warn you guys, maybe just get into your seat and kind of just really get in there. And if you have a bag near you in case you vomit, you might want to bag and probably move the dog or the cat because you don't want to kick them. Here we go. What we're also trying to do is make our health and medical experts available to ensure people understand and I'll reiterate it here today. It's not just a vaccine is obviously an incredible medical breakthrough and we want every American to have one. But even after that vaccinated, social distancing, wearing masks are going to be essential and we'll need to continue communicating about that through health and medical experts. Even after you're vaccinated, social distancing and wearing masks will be essential. That is what the White House press secretary just told us. Now it's the beginning of February 2021. It was 11 months ago that they told us two weeks to flatten the curve. We all did it. We all did everything. We came home with our bags from the supermarket after we had worn masks and gloves and we washed our food and we did that. And then they locked us down in all the different states and they destroyed the economy and they destroyed lives and they caused people to be suicidal. They caused other people not to go get preemptive medical attention and all sorts of other horrible things and alcohol rates went up and people don't go to the gym and all of these things. Then they continued that with lockdowns throughout the summer. Now they want us to wear two masks, sometimes three masks. Then they'll also tell us masks don't work and they do work and you should social distance while they don't social distance and all of the relentless, endless hypocrisy that these people have have done to us. And here's what I've come to believe at this point. And again, I just want to read you the quote one more time. Even after your vaccinated, social distancing and wearing masks will be essential. Guys, really think about this. Eleven months ago, what were we told two weeks to flatten the curve? We are in a very different world now and that old world ain't coming back. And the conclusion that I have come to at this point is there is a system in place and I don't know everything about that system, but that system is pushing us. It is pushing us to see how far it can push us before we all snap and break. Now that is not a call for violence or anything like it. It is a call for individual responsibility. Do what you've got to do in your life to keep you and your family safe. But this sick and twisted, never ending pushing of how we have to live and what we have to wear and who we can be near and who we can invite into our home. And that a year later, two weeks to flatten the curve. Now we're all going to get vaccinated and we're still going to socially distance and wear masks. It is completely bananas. It is completely bananas. COVID is not a hoax. I actually, I know somebody, I had somebody who, oh, well, I don't want to say too much, but yeah, had someone in my house yesterday who had COVID over the last couple of weeks and she got sick and then she got better. And I know many people that I know that have gotten sick and then got better. And yes, to some people die, some people do. And we know that most of those people are elderly people, 80s and upwards who have two or three other comorbidities. Okay. They usually have diabetes and obesity. Not all of them. And there are some cases that younger people die. Of course there are. There is no perfect system. We cannot protect everyone from everything. If you wanted to be protected from everything all the time, you'd literally never leave your house and you really couldn't even do anything in your house. You'd have to sit in a room quietly in the dark all the time. And that probably wouldn't be great for you either. But think about what they have done here. We know that old people die of this usually with diabetes and obesity. And then what did they do? They said, okay, now you can't go to the gym anymore. Don't go to the gym. Even though we know obesity is part of this thing. Don't go to the gym. Oh, and by the way, order in food all the time. Order in takeout all the time. Let's get, let's get you really soft up there with some sodium. Okay. Can we do that? A lot of fried food. What are you usually ordering in? It's like a burger and fries. It's pizza, tons of carbs, breads, Chinese food, which is usually a ton of sugary and all sorts of stuff. It's like, what did they do to us? Man, freakin' wake up already. It's just wake up. These are not good people. They have some power over us, I suppose. But I don't think for that much longer. I think there is going to be a breaking point. And by the way, we're seeing it, which is why I'm seriously freaking proud and thrilled that we are now less than 100,000 votes away, or signatures away from recalling Gavin Newsom. Recall Gavin Newsom. I'm not kidding. Maybe I'll run for governor. If this thing goes through, maybe I'll run for governor. There's probably far better people than me and my entire platform would be whatever Gavin said, I say the reverse, I wouldn't raise a dime. That would be it. I'll do a YouTube show and see if we can make it happen. I'm not sure. I'm honestly not sure. But get rid of these people. They are not good people. Sue them. Sue Andrew Cuomo for putting all the old people back in the old age homes. Okay. These are not good people anymore and it's not going to stop. And you think, if you think, man, I'm on a rant, if you think it's going to stop, if you think it is going to stop that a year later, okay, two weeks to flatten the curve. Now it's a year later, 100 mask mandate and we're going to keep social distancing and you're going to wear masks and blah, blah, blah, and we're going to partially open things and maybe open them and kind of open them. If you think that once they've pushed you that far that they're going to go, ah, all right, guys, let them out. Come for everybody. No, it will be the next test. There will be super COVID, the UK strain and something happened in Brazil. A guy banged a monkey. Now we're all in trouble. There's going to be all sorts of crazy stuff. That is what is going to happen. We are being pushed to see how much of our individuality, of our freedom, of our liberty we will give away. And I think our founders here in the United States would be pretty freaking depressed on, on how easily we've done it. But speaking of all of that, story number four, which fits perfectly as a segue, the CDC, again, these people didn't want us to wear masks at some point now. They want us to wear masks, believe science, except when science doesn't work, blah, blah, blah. Well, they have released their rules for Super Bowl parties. The Super Bowl is a big football game that happens once a year. It's happening this Sunday. And they've given us some rules related to the Super Bowl and look, nobody's going to pay attention to this nonsense. And you really, I'm not an expert, so don't hold me to account. But if you're doing most of these things, you have a bigger problem. You have more of a psychological problem than anything else. Here's a couple of things they want you to do for Super Bowl parties. If you're going to dare have a Super Bowl party, a Super Bowl party, I think it's Super Bowl, what, like 70 something maybe or 62 or 59, something like that. We've always had Super Bowl parties. People used to get together. They'd eat nachos. They'd eat wings and they'd drink beer. It was the old days, okay? They don't want you to have these Super Bowl parties anymore. So here's what they're saying about the Super Party. Wear a mask with two or more layers to stop the spread of COVID to protect yourself and others. Okay, so now you're going to wear two masks at the Super Bowl party where you'd normally be drinking a beer and eating wings in cold weather. Wear your mask under your scarf, ski mask, or baklava. The baklava? What the hell is baklava? Isn't that a Greek dessert? What the hell is a baklava? Is that a type of ski mask? It's a type of ski mask? A baklava? I've literally never heard of that. Okay, so, all right, everyone pause this first. Oh, you can't pause this live, but I want you to Google baklava right now. Your BLACLAVA. Why would you be wearing one of those two Super Bowl party unless you were going to murder everybody? Which I guess is against their rules too. Your baklava. Your baklava. Okay, so be it. Guests should avoid direct contact. Don't shake anyone's hand, people. If you shake your host hand, you might kill them, including handshakes and hugs with people that are not from your household. Yeah, yeah, you know, hugging and human communication, any sort of touching. Almost everyone you touch will die. Who is the girl in, was it Rogue? I think it was Rogue and X-Men. If she touched people, they would die. Yeah, it was Rogue. Thank you. My fact check is around it today. Rogue, remember Rogue? It was played by what's her name, who was in, you know, what the hell's that girl's name? She was in the True Blood. Come on, help me here, guys. She was in True Blood, the lead in True Blood, that girl. She was Rogue and X-Men, and her power was that if she touched you, she could kill you. So they're basically making us all Rogue and X-Men. Give me that girl's name, whatever her name is. For a virtual celebration, oh, I love this one. If you're gonna have a virtual Super Bowl party, schedule a time to eat a meal together virtually and have people show their main dish, vegetable, or dessert. All right, let's be very clear about this. There are no vegetables at Super Bowl parties. Yes, does somebody always have a little thing of carrots over there with some dip? Yes, they do. And those people should not be invited to parties. I agree with that, okay? Most people can have their own vegan special parties. But hi, I'm on Zoom at the Super Bowl party. It's the second quarter, great game. You wanna see my carrot? Oh, for fuck's sake. Oh, here we go. What's that girl's name? Antipackwit, and that's it, okay. I'm beating you to the punch here. You've got a computer. What's going on? Oh, there it is, Antipackwit, okay. Avoid shouting, cheering loudly, or singing. Clap. Stomp your feet, or bring or provide hand-held noise makers instead. Avoid shouting, cheering loudly, or singing. Clap, stomp your feet. These are, we are, keep background music volume low, so guests don't need to shout. Keep it low, keep it cool. I assume, I'm surprised they didn't give us the type of music we're allowed to listen to. It's sort of a, something moatic, and soft, ambient chill. Check out the chill channel on Spotify. I like the chill channel. Just keep it cool, you know what I mean? Talk like this, like you're in ASMR person. Just talk like this. Oh, did you see Talk Brady? Just through a 17-yard touchdown pass to that guy. I don't really watch anymore, so I don't know who he is. Okay, can I please have a wink now? I'll go sit in the basement and eat it quietly. Thank you. And finally, offer no touch trash cans for guests to easily throw away food items. Yes, it is true. Here at my house, we have one of those trash cans that you have to pull. It's under the sink. You pull out the drawer, and the trash can is there. It is a COVID super spreader. Almost everyone I know that has visited me over the last few weeks is dead now because they touch my garbage can. Latelyn's and Jellie's spoons, that was the Rubin Report Direct message for today. February 4th, was it? February 4th, 2021. May God help us all. I look forward to communicating with you for the rest of the day at rubinreport.locals.com. And tomorrow, our panel will be with Eric Metaxis, Rabbi David Wolpe, and Peter Bogosian. Part two of my interview with Andy No is up right now on YouTube, and the full episode is up at rubinreport.locals.com. Remember, speak quietly. Don't touch anyone. Speak quietly. Don't touch anyone. Or you're a murderer. See you tomorrow."
