    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast our three of clan buck starts right now and Joe Biden's got a problem everybody always got a lot of problems for one thing we just had a breaking news alert the last hour that a Russian fighter jet has collided in international airspace over the Black Sea with a US Reaper drone That's gonna raise tensions a little bit there What's going on? What are the chances of that just? Happening perhaps the the Russian jet was trying to get a much closer look at the drone Who knows we will find out more? Well the Pentagon will tell us some stuff and then we'll find out more beyond that I am sure in the hours ahead, but something to keep an eye on but the bigger political problem that Joe Biden has is that his his party has gone nuts and This is something that you see in a on a range of issues where even Democrats are starting to say some Democrats This is just too much. I can't go along with this and they're not areas They're not fringe beliefs of the Democrat party. They're opposing. They are Things that are coming from the White House itself They're the most mainstream of Democrat positions because in many cases they are now the Mandatory positions that you must hold if you are going to be a Democrat who is held in good standing by the left by the You know the the Jacobins who run that party the radicals the Marxists So that's interesting. That's worth keeping in mind, right? This is now required orthodoxy or a lot of Democrats that are causing problems for them And I had Mentioned this in the first hour wanted to just bring you back to the situation of the Stanford University will Stanford Law School part of the university Aftermath when you had Judge Duncan of the Fifth Circuit who was shouted down by a bunch of of screeching Harpies, I mean just lunatics in that room. I saw the whole video. I can't play the audio There's so much there's so much cursing and shouting that you can just imagine They have a federal judge invited to a law school to speak to them about the law He's actually doing the interpretation of law on the Fifth Circuit You think that law students might think they have Something to learn and even if they don't that they would sit there and be respectful They're supposed to be officers of the court, but really the law schools have become Social justice Activist training centers. That's what they are That's what the the so-called elite loss was I thought it was so funny too that that one of the one of the you know just Childish students said so shouted something like yeah, well you couldn't even get into this law school So interesting. I wonder how many of the people in that room that were shouting at the judge Got in not cuz their LSATs were so high but under the diversity and inclusion exceptions to what the rest of the student body is supposed to achieve in terms of Grades and scores. I would just wonder about that. I Would wonder how many of them are really as smart as I think they are and there's also a difference between cognitive ability or or test-taking ability and wisdom and As all of you listen to this especially those of you who have lived more years on this earth than I have no Wisdom is the most important Wisdom is the thing that really matters and makes the difference and that room had none of it. They lined up Just this is the last day or so reporting from the Washington free beacon that these activists lined up to do a a shame walk of sorts For the dean who apologized on behalf of Stanford University to the judge so now more students are Are Shaining publicly the dean who apologized for the behavior of the childish maniac students That we're shouting down this. This is Biden's Democrat party. That's why I'm telling you this These little activist social justice warriors at Stanford Law School They've been doing this for years now. This is their mentality has been the same stretching back for the last decade and so they're now There are you know, they're people that work in the DOJ and they work for the White House and they're They're in the structures of power They're this is not just student radicals who will deal with the reality of life when they get out They are the Democrat base now. They are the Democrat party This is why Biden is in this Difficult position Not that difficult for Joe Biden because he is a man with no honor or integrity to protect in the first place Because Joe Biden has no integrity to protect he has a lot of latitude for what he can do it doesn't matter What does he believe what should he believe? That's always the Biden response? Who is Joe Biden who do you need him to be? That's how Joe Biden? Approaches everything in politics in life stretching back for as long as he's been a public figure which is longer than I've been alive So he's the right guy for this job, but it's a difficult job Pretending to be something when it counts with the voters while he is something entirely else when it comes to the governance that he Presides over as the head of the Democrat party whether he's a puppet or not doesn't matter. He's still the figurehead, right? so this brings me to this interview he did on the daily show and Here Joe Biden is asked about The there are a number of states that are that are banning transgender surgery for children How many of you listening to this right now had never even heard of transgender surgery including doctors by the way transgender surgery for children until the last Five years made the last two or three years. I think the answer is a lot almost everybody This is new. There are no long-term studies There is no real sense as to how this could be medicine Because this is not studied in any meaningful way. They won't talk about it. They just want to be able to do it They want to be able to do gender mutilation of children and call it medicine and they are you see how they how they have turned on The issue of abortion for example The left a Democrat party Used to say oh, it's just you know safe legal and rare Or oh, we wanted to be something that people women can choose for themselves as a freedom But you know, we're not gonna celebrate it. Oh no, and then eventually they were celebrating it You know take my word for it. You'll see women at these pro abortion marches You know shout your abortion was a whole campaign for shout your abortion a whole campaign for a while celebrities talking about how abortion was such a great decision for them usually women who were actresses who you know were on marriage number five and You know, I've had I made a mess of their lives but anyway, they'll say oh abortion was such a great a great thing for my career. That's usually what they say so they do end up celebrating it and They're willing to completely forget about the morality that is involved and that the loss of life So given their position on abortion, you have to understand if left unchecked the psychological contagion of gender ideology for kids for adolescents for prepubescent children that gender contagion ideology is Something that they will They will go from saying it is rare. Why do you focus on it? It is rare. Why are you making such a big deal of it to it is mandatory and you better celebrate it or else? You know, this is coming the slippery slope as everyone says on Twitter these days is the undefeated champion You know what they're going to do so we stand and fight or we know where they're gonna take this politically stand and fight We stand up and say enough is enough Or the pathway is clear. I bring you Joe Biden good old-fashioned Joe Guy was alive when the second world war was ending right Joe Biden's been around forever He's such a traditional Democrat a a union, you know lunch pail carrying pro-labor Democrat You know all this sort of stuff that doesn't even exist anymore by the way, but it's what they'll say That guy grandpa Joe you can count on him here he is when speaking about gender mutilation of children teenagers 13 year olds 14 year olds Have their genitalia removed and they say transition there is no transition You know Jordan Peterson bless him, you know He takes he takes important shots on important issues you may have seen recently and he got a little profane He got a little fiery on Twitter. He pointed out there is no transitioning of a of a of a penis to a vagina That is not possible for humanity for a human being it cannot be done It is not a thing that is medically possible. So then why do they say we're going to create no they don't and that's for adults They want to try similar procedures involving children. This is madness This is monstrous and Yet Joe Biden good old-fashioned middle of the road Joe here. He is when he's asked about transgender kids play 15 What's going on in Florida is is my mother would say close to sinful? I mean, it's just terrible what they're doing. It's not like, you know a kid wakes up one morning It says you know I decided I want to become a man or I want to become a woman or I want to change I mean, what are they thinking about here for human beings? They love they have feelings they have inclinations that are I mean, it's just to me is I don't know It's cruel and the way we do it is we make sure we pass legislation like we passed on same-sex marriage You mess with that you're breaking the law and you're gonna be held accountable First of all Notice the the Biden go to he has he can't really discuss what it is that his side wants So he does this you know man, we're talking about human beings, you know people who love and feel and Yeah, we all know that buddy. We're talking about not gender mutilating children, which will ruin their lives It will ruin their lives. Okay, start with that. He acts like that's the position of kindness. Oh 14 year old girl wants to be a 14 year old boy because some activist therapist had three sessions with her Let's do it Let's go Take him to the doctor. Oh the parents. Let me ask you this. Do you think Joe Biden would sign a law? That would prohibit parents Stopping gender transition surgery for their kids if a medical professional slash activist decided that it was appropriate I think he would I think he wouldn't a heartbeat. I think that Joe Biden has been a lie his entire public life All it is is lies with this guy. He stands for nothing He is a figment of the imagination of the voters who have been tricked into voting for him who think they're getting something else The left knows they think he's great. He's the Trojan horse. He's the vessel for everybody who's all the moderate He's gonna be normal and everything else. No, he's not Joe Biden exists to be a facade that the left can rely on to make them seem less insane Because of his appearance because of his grin because he's always lunch pale Joe right in the choo-choo into DC every day He was talking about transgender surgery for teenagers and he does the usual con man's people, you know Like I feel is it yeah, exactly these are little human beings who should not be subject to the mass psychosis of less leftist activists and the obvious social contagion that is transgenderism for kids which just has exploded in the last few years up thousands of a percent and We're not even saying look that we're not even talking about adults adults want to you know They want to have you know different surgeries and and you know to change their names to all these things they're adults They get to choose all that we're talking about protections for children And where does Joe Biden stand on this He's saying it's not like they wake up one day and decide I'm just gonna know that's exactly what they do Because the society around them because tiktok because the Democrat party because Hollywood elites because people they look up to Who have neither wisdom normal reality to draw upon tell them this will make you the center of attention This will make you live your truth. This will make your life better. They're being lied to They are being lied to and Joe Biden is the liar in chief That's what you see here. So all this stuff about oh, he's gonna return us to normalcy Oh, it's gonna be funny. You can trust good old Joe Grandpa Joe gets asked about gender mutilation of minors and what does he say come on man? We need to pass a law and he mentions he mentions The gay marriage for which for adults what does that to do with gender mutilation of minors for transgender purposes? What does he even think he's talking doesn't even matter? He's just there to fool enough of the easily fooled so that the great mass of the left Can get their way. That's it And it's it's wrong folks. It's wrong. He's something that That everyone needs to understand is it's all based in all based in lies all based in misrepresentations Sometimes my friends it feels like our world is getting crazier by the day. You don't say There was ever a call to attention on being prepared for anything and everything I think this is as good a time as we've seen in a long time That's why we seriously recommend stocking up on emergency food as one part of that It's not a reality that any of us like to face But it's preparation that we have to embrace and make our own Go to my patriot supplied comm today Stock up on their popular three month emergency food kit when you do you'll also get $200 worth of rugged survival gear as a free bonus See what you get go to my patriot supply comm your $200 bonus gift comes free with each three month emergency food kit You order cleanest family have five of these each for one member of the family Karen I've got to them each year at home. We're prepared. We're ready to go. I have to leave my home for months If I don't want to go to my patriot supplied comm you'll enjoy free shipping as well get prepared today Don't wait because that's not preparation. That's fixing a crisis. Take action now my patriot supply comm Don't miss a day of the clay Travis and bucks accident show Biden's also so Straddling the climate lunatics on the one side and financial Economic reality on the other with fossil fuels Which is why he has signed He has signed now this Approval for the willow oil pipeline project in Alaska the online activists are all freaking out the planet's gonna now We need to save the whales or the or the shed or the Spotted owl or the way. I don't know whatever by those are animal conservationist people but same idea same idea Is it the delta smelt that's what I was trying to think of the delta smelt with a big problem a little bait fish in California that have caused huge problems with because the environmentalist with the water usage there anyway Biden's got this issue, but on the other side He's got people that are telling him or he's also telling his people that if we don't keep the temperature from going 1.5 degrees Celsius up a generation is damned play 16 What happened was mother nature let her wrath be seen over the last two years For example, I have traveled on helicopter over more forest area burned to the ground than the entire state of Maryland that's how much is burned to the ground floods Droughts all the thing and so people can't deny it anymore if we don't keep at temperature from going above 1.5 degrees Celsius Now we're in real trouble that whole generation is damned. I mean, that's not that purpley really truly trouble It's not it's not hyperbole every time he says it's not hyperbole. It is hyperbole. I think this is such a fascinating Tick that he has or else I know I'm not a joke not hyperbole and one that actually is hyperbole generation is not damned This is something this is the president of the United States is the most powerful man in the world What he's saying is objectively crazy If we don't stop the global temperature from going up 1.5 degrees the next generation is damned We aren't gonna stop anything from going up 1.5 degrees, okay the meaning America and The human race also not gonna be able to stop it. So I guess we're all damned No, this is just playing on the fear centers of the brain and Catastrophism and he's such a fraud everybody honestly. He is just you know I'd rather have somebody who just admitted they were a you know a commie instead of Biden pretending He's like a friend to normal people if you own a small business, you know the value of time get refunds.com does as well That's why they've been it easy no matter how busy you are to apply for the employee retention credit or ERC This is a little known tax refund program from the IRS to benefit small business owners Go to get refunds comm to get started in less than 10 minutes See if your business qualifies for ERC assistance Your business may be eligible for a payroll tax refund of up to $26,000 per employee kept on payroll during COVID-19 Get refunds comm has already helped clients claim over three billion dollars in payroll tax refund through the ERC There's no upfront charge either. They don't get paid unless your business gets its refund Don't let this opportunity pass you by this payroll tax refunds only available for a limited time go to get refunds comm Who is gonna pay that bill won't it be the American taxpayer? Well, I think you can make a case ultimately Yes, the banks pay for this through fees to the FDIC He's saying that the American taxpayer won't pay a penny and I think that's a lie well I think ultimately they will pay. I mean after all that's my point Banks are paying more fees I want to be as explicit as I can because this stuff is very tricky and it's very important Banks that pay more fees will probably charge their own customers more fees So in that sense, I would agree with you that it will be a taxpayer funded rescue mission It will be it's definitely a bailout and The costs will be borne by people who had nothing to do with the failure that was obviously Hannity and Cudlow there talking on Sean show and Here we are now looking looking out into some very uncharted territory for the economy going forward What happens now? You know we had last hour? David McCormick on who was the CEO of Bridgewater Associates Truly one of the largest by assets hedge funds in the world Okay, and you heard what is this a guy who you want to talk about having Knowledge of how this system works and and having to be right, you know the thing about being a hedge fund guy is You got to be right or else you lose money and your hedge fund shuts down, right? And you heard what he had to say about this, but he even was I asked him straight up. I said do you think it's possible that the Fed is going to be able to to you got a combat inflation Ever degrees you got a combat inflation. Can you do that without sending the economy spiraling down into a recession? Probably not and this starts to feel a little more like cause and effect. We had super low interest rates held low as a function of policy not as a function of the market for a decade and The bill is due and we're 31 trillion dollars in debt And we're gonna have to start paying a whole lot more to service that debt I mean these are this is just cause and effect at some level and nobody wants to be as I always say the advantage the Democrats have Is that they always pretend to be Santa Claus and you're never happy about the person who tells you there is no Santa Claus Which by the way for any kids listening of course there is a Santa but anyone who says there is no Santa Claus Immediately the response of the public in general is oh why are you you know, why are you being a Grinch? Why are you such a bad person? Well, I want to be the Grinch, but it's gonna get ugly There's no way through this that doesn't and it's not just ugly for SVB Bank and and some of these other Figures and names that we've already seen dragged into all of this it affects all of us These are systemic issues. These are things that affect your bank account the cost of your groceries The rent or mortgage that you are paying every month your ability to buy a house if you've been saving up all the stuff that really Affects your day-to-day is affected by this stuff that we are talking about And that brings me to the SVB board right SVB board board of directors and They're supposed to be there to be the guiding hand, you know, you have a board of directors so you have a storehouse of wisdom to draw upon and That's supposed to prevent things like, you know a massive bank failure from happening seemingly overnight Because you have all these really really smart people who know this stuff backwards and forwards and They'll guide you, you know, they'll guide the CEO. They'll even replace fire and replace the CEO if they have to But that's why you in the world of corporate governance you have You have a board in the first place Who was on the Silicon Valley bank board? Let's have a fun little fun little thought experiment for everybody out there was it people that are just Finance nerds who get excited about words like EBITDA and compound interest who hear about Breaking down the the latest earnings statement and they salivate they get excited They don't want to watch the game over the weekend. They want to look at some earning statements They want to get down into the into the depths of the company and really un no no no of course not Silicon Valley bank the Silicon Valley experience though the whole world of Silicon Valley is the explosion of the internet Unbelievable. I mean wealth on a scale that has really never been known before in human history in some way is in terms of the The wealth that has been generated Mostly through intellectual property by the way, that's that's a funny thing to think about it It's mostly ones and zeros that has done all of this right? so there's a level of digital alchemy that has been involved in this as well and What you see is that the Silicon Valley bank was sure enough as as every institution of wealth and influence is it was a target for the ideological left to infiltrate with the most woke people possible and they did and they did this from the Daily Mail did a little Reporting into this only one person of the failed Silicon Valley banks board had a career in investment banking Everybody else were a collection of Obama and Clinton mega donors including a woman who publicly grieved by praying at a Shinto shrine when Trump won in 2016 The other people involved in all this were an assortment of high dollar democrat donors all ideologically aligned with the left There's the right aid ceo who credit success with her success with being in an improv troupe about a very diverse board of course of course venture capitalist Kate Mitchell who cried at a Shinto shrine a winemaker who's really tight with nancy Pelosi and a prolific democrat donor Okay a former Obama administration official who got caught up in a race scandal as she ran for the Baltimore mayor's role So there you go Obama administration official I mean you look at some of these individuals you're saying this is this is who was in charge This is on the board of the bank really Did any of these people even know what the bank was doing? Understand this is not the credit default swap situation in 2008 as messed up as that was Um, and there's a whole there's a very long tail or very long connection That story goes all the back to community reinvestment act and the federal government deciding that Lending was actually a social justice issue and not a financial issue or pushing in that direction So that they started making it less credit scores less and less a factor Open up the the backstopping of the of the federal government for fannie may and freddie mac So that people who have no business getting loans because they're never going to be able to pay them back can pay them back because social justice So that's the long long lead up to the and then once that happens once the standards have eroded so much that you can just lend to anybody Basically, but you can commoditize or or um products I'm trying to think what the word would be here productify productize create products out of those those bad loans and then Have insurance to back up the bad loans and sell the insurance as a contract. You can see that was Financial alchemy atop financial alchemy. That was the the riddle wrapped in an enigma surrounded by a mystery I mean that was complicated and almost melted down the entire financial system What we have here is Um, we can't make any good safe money because rates are so low So we're just gonna pile all this money into treasuries 10 year treasuries is what svb did And whatever the rate was they were getting. I don't know, you know 2% 3% now that doesn't sound like that's not very exciting Well, if you have 200 billion dollars And you're getting one or two percent and it's guaranteed that you're gonna have that money and it's safe It's actually a lot of money, right? But what they didn't think was hold on rates are gonna shift Why didn't they think that everybody knew that was gonna happen? The fed was basically saying every six months stretching back now to the end of the end of the pandemic Gonna have to raise rates gonna have to raise rates. It's gonna happen So this was a slow move. This was they got yes, they got hit by a train And crushed svb bank But the train was making the little you know the the toot toot noise And you know hitting the horn or whatever Uh and going about five miles an hour They should have known Do you know why they didn't know you know why they didn't get off the tracks because they were greedy and they didn't care And they thought that worse comes to worse Will be where we are which is the whole thing gets bailed out It's gross. Isn't it it is it is upsetting. It's wrong. There's there's something wrong about this. We all feel it. We all know it But the more important part of it is not that the it's not the recognition that this is wrong. It's What do we do about it? What do we do now And uh the fed does not there there are no pretty there are no elegant options right now. That's for sure All right switching gears here for a second One of the saddest statistics to read is the fact that the number one killer among infants is so abortion Abortion continues to take the lives of nearly one million babies a year just in this country alone But there's an organization that has a practical proven approach to keeping that number from getting bigger and Hopefully making it smaller as the years go by Preborn network of clinics welcomes pregnant moms considering abortion and provides them with an ultrasound In addition to all kinds of love and support for the baby's first two years of life Because through an ultrasound when a mother hears that heartbeat her maternal instinct kicks in And the majority of the time she will choose life 17 years into existence preborn has saved already over 200,000 babies lives For just 140 dollars You can introduce a mom to her baby on ultrasound and help rescue five babies lives And when you do you'll receive five stories and five ultrasound pictures of babies saved Make a tax deductible gift to preborn join me just dial pound two five zero and say the key word baby That's pound 250 say baby or visit preborn dot com slash buck That's preborn dot com slash b uck sponsored by preborn You don't know what you don't know, right?

Let's get uh, linda in sacrum. Ah Sunny sacramental, sacramental, California. What's going on linda? Hi there. I just wanted to tell you why I support trump and I am suspicious of ronda santis. I feel that president trump truly truly loves the people In the constitution. I can't say that about anybody else. I really I feel personally that he loves me. He loves you He loves this country with ronda santis I've never heard him say a positive thing about president trump ever in spite of the fact that he owes his first race as governor to president trump And I just hoping that he is an annever trumper in disguise or a trump hater I've never heard him say anything good And I would like to know what his record in congress was when he was in congress And i'd like to know how close he was to paul ryan who we know is an open trump hater I need to know a little bit more about him. I mean president trump could have declared himself of You know a king at the time of the covet and it said he gave power back to the States he gave ronda santis a chance to shine and every other governor So he's going to have to earn my trust right now i'm suspicious of him He went to yale and he went through there quite successfully, which is a hotbed of lube rules And so, you know, I mean did he say what they needed him to say him? Well, the real ronda santis, please stand up. I don't know the real ronda santis So linda can I just ask you by the way? I think I think that's valid for you to want answers to all of those questions Um, are you open to if desantis runs and he answers those questions to your satisfaction Are you open to oh? Of course, I would never I would not vote for a demo if he ran I would definitely vote for him I would not there's no chance that I would vote for a democrat or not vote I can't but i mean in the primary could he could he theoretically win over your vote or do you think it's just got to be trump For you He's he's gonna have to convince him. Well, no right now. It's trump Right now. I love trump and I have many reasons for loving trump and we have no time to go into them I love trump because I feel he loves us And he's looking a lot of linda can I just say and i'm sorry as you know you can hear the music We're running out of time, but I just want to say there are a lot of people listening who agree with you So don't think that this is everything that you've said here. I think you said it concisely and eloquently and thank you for calling in from sacrameno Um, you're expressing the feelings of of a lot of this audience and I know that so This is why we're going to just keep on looking at what's going on every day What's being said in this primary how the country is going and what the trump proposals are what ron desantis is Next moves will be and we're just going to be honest about what's happening and what we think is is best for america But yeah, look trump is a i'll tell you this on a personal level a super charismatic guy And I like trump on a personal level. I think balance jump is great. We'll talk more about this tomorrow"
