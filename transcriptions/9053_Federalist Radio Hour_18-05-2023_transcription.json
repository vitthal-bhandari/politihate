    "text": " We're back with another edition of the Federalist Radio Hour. I'm Emily Jaczenski, Culture Editor here at The Federalist. As always, you can email the show at radio at thefederalist.com. Follow us on Twitter at FDRLST. Make sure to subscribe wherever you download your podcasts, and of course, to the premium version of our website as well. We're joined today by Senator Josh Hawley, who is the author of the new book, Manhood, the masculine virtues America needs. Senator Hawley, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. It's such an interesting book, and obviously an important topic. One place I thought might be a good jumping off point is actually, when you write about your nine-year-old son's love of cars, you write, quote, he is a temple builder. All men are meant to be. I think it's a good place to start, because you do write a lot about the purpose of man as temple building in the book. It's a central theme. I wanted to see if you could tell us a little bit more about what you mean, especially for folks who haven't read the book. When you say, all men are meant to be temple builders. It's a man's job to make the world better, to make it more beautiful, to make it more productive, to make it into something that is beautiful. Here's where that comes from. It goes back to the Bible. What I do in the book is, I try to make the argument that we need stronger men in America. We need good models, role models, for what men should be and what a good man is. The ultimate foundation for that, the ultimate role models to be are found in the Bible in the biblical tradition. I tell a lot of stories from the Bible. We say, well, let's look at a place where we can find good role models for men. If you look at the Bible, you'll see a very coherent narrative and picture of what it means to be a man and what it means to be a good man. What the Bible says over and over through many different stories across its pages is that men are supposed to work with God to help make the world what he meant it to be. That is an incredible purpose. It's an incredibly high calling, and it's something that every man can aspire to. I'm sure you're going to get questions about this as you're launching the book because you have a really interesting section where you write about androthete. Before I had read the book, I was actually going to ask about androthete because it's such a relevant side show in the media cycle right now. You write about the unhealthy masculinity that androthete demonstrates and you compare it to the materialism of the Epicureans, which is really interesting. It converted to Islam, and that suggests maybe that even though he has this materialist ideology, ultimately he's still looking for something transcendent, looking for something divine, do you see that as perhaps a contradiction in what you describe as modern liberalism, that even as they are clinging to something that is almost hedonistic in its materialism, still so often you see people looking for something transcendent? I think that people today are desperate for something transcendent in our lives. That's the human condition, and that's true not just today, but across time. It's certainly true for men. I think what the modern left has done is they've tried to drain away all of the transcendent and anything that speaks of eternity in our lives. That's one of the reasons why they have launched these attacks on masculinity, so that they don't want anything that connects to what is permanent, what is true, what is beautiful. They reject all of that. Modern liberalism is basically atheistic. That's why I think when you talk about what does it mean to be a man, to that matter what does it mean to be a woman? You've got to look at what are the sources of truth where we can get good role models, and that's why in the book I turn back to the biblical tradition, which has been so meaningful in my life, but also so significant in our country's history, in our culture's history, and look at those stories of, okay, what does it need to be a man who protects? What does it need to be a man who provides? What does it need to be a man who builds? And a man of courage. And so I try to tell those stories and tease that out. Now you asked about entertainment in the book. What I say about that is there's this critique from the left that all of manhood is inherently toxic. You know, if you're a man, you by definition are contributing to the systemic injustice of America and on and on climate change, that the other. I think there are some elements within, or some folks I guess I should say, who would want to react against that by adopting some of the premises who would say, okay, yeah, manhood is toxic and I'm proud of it. And I think a lot of what Andrew Tade has said isn't that thing? Sort of like, yeah, absolutely manhood is violent, inherently, and it is inherently a domineering and proudly so. And I just want to reject the whole premise. Say no, no, no. Male strength is good. We need strong men. We need men, though, to step up and be responsible, be protectors, be defenders, be courageous, and that's really what the book's about. You know, and that's an interesting point because it's this idea that, you know, as you write to leftists, manhood is fake to quote from the book. And then at the same time, they're constantly trying to demonize this thing that they also say is fake, something they believe is not biological reality, something they believe is entirely socially constructed. They say is inherently toxic when they talk about masculinity. And it reminds me when you write about Rousseau, they're kind of idealizing this state of nature, but without also recognizing it, recognizing it. How did they get to that disconnect? I mean, it obviously makes no sense. Well, I think for the modern left, and the modern left are really sort of Marxist at heart. I mean, they're cultural Marxists and they believe at the end of the day that they're really no male or female. They're making that really clear. There's just like this thing that is like the self that you just have your desires, right? You're what you want in life, what makes you satisfy you and makes you happy. And they believe that we're basically androgyn the cells who just have a whole bunch of desires and the universe is meaningless, right? I mean, that's the left view. There's no meaning out there. There's no God, certainly, no eternity, no heaven or hell. And so the only way you can find any meaning in your life is do stuff that makes you happy, pursue pleasure, make pleasure of your God, make yourself your God. I think the real message of the modern left when you drill down into it. And so they dislike any tradition or institution or set of practices or teachings that cut against that. And that's why they are so hostile to the Bible. It's why they're hostile to traditional masculinity and traditional woman that as well. And you see them insisting that both of those things are oppressive and they need to be eliminated and people should choose or many genders. And I think all of that comes down to their hedoneness. They think the universe is meaningless and they just want people to go out and choose what makes them happy. Although, although we have to add to that that the modern left has this authoritarian element they add in on top of it, where they say, yeah, choose what makes you happy. But actually, why don't you let us tell you what will make you happy? And why don't you let us control that for you? And so it's this hedonism combined with authoritarianism that I think is really characteristic of today's left. No, it strikes me that must present a very strange challenge for lawmakers, at least who are sort of tapped into how dramatically the world is changing or the way that we see ourselves as changing. And all of this, when you kind of wake up every day and you have to legislate and govern a country where some of the stuff a world is happening so very quickly. Do you think folks in Congress, maybe even just in the upper chamber, have started to grasp how dramatic a lot of the stuff is as you write in the book. I mean, this is a book on massive changes to the way that we kind of think about biological reality, the way that we think about men that have we've undergone them in the course of some people's lifetimes. Is there awareness of that at this point in the upper chamber or is it still, people are still behind? Well, I think that the left, and that includes those who are of the left in the Senate, I mean, I think the left continues to drive forward this narrative that masculinity of toxic. And I think you see that reflected all the time. I mean, there's a real assault on the idea of gender on male and female, and there's certainly a real assault on traditional manhood. And the book is really a defense of the need for strong, responsible men. And we have a need for policy that will help encourage strong, responsible men. And I talk about this some in the book, but we need to have good paying jobs in this country for men who want to work with their hands for what we traditionally call blue collar workers. There was a time in this country where you could support a family on a blue collar wage. I mean, now so many of those jobs have gone overseas. That was a policy choice. That wasn't like the inactive nature. That wasn't inevitable. That was a policy choice. And it was a bad one. So my message is, strong men are good. We need strong, responsible men. And we need policy that will help us encourage that, whether we're talking about jobs, whether we're talking about encouraging young men to get married and to start family. We should be promoting all of those things and not being apologetic about it. And this raises a very important question. And you write about Marx and you write about Makusa looking at America and looking about, why does America not sort of go on the path that Marx predicts that it will, which broaches the basic chicken or egg question. Is it culture? Is it economy? Marx is writing in a time of basically technological, economic, industrialization, and upheaval. Is there a way to reframe the question? Maybe as masculinity is something that's declining, maybe not just because of the economy, but more because of this combination of shifts in technology and shifts in culture? Or is the economy, is there a primacy to any of those if we're trying to get down to this chicken or egg question? Well, I think culture is king. And this is why the new Marxists, today's Marxists who have now taken over control of much of the Democrat Party, they really, what they don't like about American culture is they do not like its grounding in faith and the tradition of the Bible. They don't like the elements of Christianity and Judaism that are so pronounced in our culture and have given us so many of our foundational ideals. I mean, let's just admit that that is the truth and that's why today's liberalism is really atheistic. And I just say in the book, I make the argument, this is a disaster. I mean, it really cuts us off from our heritage. It cuts us off from a sense of eternity and permanence and transcendence meaning. And it also opens up all of these crazy ideas that, okay, well, maybe there's no such thing as manhood or womanhood at all. We could just do away with these things. So I think what we need to do is reconnect with the foundations of our culture, of our history and our heritage and the Bible is really central to that. And I think the modern leftist attack on our history, the modern leftist attack on manhood and womanhood is ultimately going to fail because it's just out of touch with reality. I mean, manhood is a reality, a biological reality, yeah, but more even more fundamentally, and it's written as a fabric of nature, of who men are. And the same with women, you know, womanhood is a biological reality written in the fabric of the universe. And I think that's why the leftists have become totally out of touch with the world as it is. And their program consequently has become increasingly radical when they were talking about men and women's sports or we're talking about pretending there is no such thing as gender or re-educating kids in schools to believe that gender's fake. I mean, they increasingly are just way, way out there because I think they've lost touch with what's real. Yeah. And I was reminded of the viral video of Jordan Nealy's tragic deaths in the New York subway in the section of your book where you write modernity has perhaps learned too much from lock. And it just is like, can men even act locally on these masculine virtues in a world where they're essentially in a social media panopticon and a culture is going to pick apart? And this isn't even to comment on, you know, the virtues of what happened in that particular situation, but we all know that, you know, this is what happens constantly. Men go viral and people pick apart, you know, Monday morning quarterback, every different decision. Is that possible now? Is it, is that part of what disincentivizes men to act masculine in public? Well, I think that there is a message that's sent to them in from the time that they first start going to school. And from the time they start attending kindergarten for heaven's sake, that is a steady drumbeat of masculinity is inherently toxic, that to be a boy, for instance, in school is inherently disruptive. I mean, you can look at, there's data on this. Nobody should take my word for it. If you look at the data, you know, how often do teachers interrupt boys play at school in their young ages versus girls? And he enters the boy's much, much more. How often do they corral the boys and try to do the boys much, much, much more? So there's a strong preference now over the last 20, 30 years, even in our educational system to try and get the boyishness out of boys. And if it doesn't work by interrupting them, disciplining them, curtailing them, then we medicate them. And that just continues as men get older, you know, to get the constant message that there's something wrong with you as a man. If you want to be a masculine, there's something wrong with you. And not only that, you're making the world worse, just by being you, you're making the world worse. And I want to send just the opposite message. And I think men are hungry to hear the opposite message because it's the truth, which is that by being a man, you can make the world better. The world needs you. It needs you to be a man. It needs you to be strong. It needs you to be courageous. It needs you to be self-sacrificial. It needs you to be willing, American needs you, and your family needs you to go out and be willing to give your life away for other people. These are things that traditionally we celebrated in men. We told stories that valorize those things. Our culture's not doing that anymore. And I think we need to. And that's why the Bible is full of a lot of stories, stories from the Bible, stories about them. And then I know who are significant in my life and made a difference, stories from history. I think we need to hold up those role models again for all men and young men in particular to say, yeah, that's what a good man looks like. I want to be like that.

You know, it's funny as a woman to think about all of this because I have to imagine for men, women get this too in a different way, but the messages are so mixed. Be strong, but not strong like that. The book is full of stories and examples. Part of the problem in our culture is that we don't point to enough healthy examples. What is your... How can young men navigate the difference? Walk that line between what's healthy masculinity and what's unhealthy masculinity, between what's and what's... And what's maybe Jordan Peterson. Well, what I do in the book is I talk about different roles that I think men are called into, ways that they're called to serve and contribute. So I talk about being a husband and being a father, being a builder, and being a warrior, being a priest and being a king. And these roles are drawn out of, again, the biblical tradition and looking at what is the Bible show us about what it looks like to be a good man. And so we look at each of those and to my messages and brief, those are the kind of roles that men are called to. You want to be a good man? Do those things. Acquire the virtues. Acquire the virtues of husband. Even if you're not one right now, acquire the virtues of a father, acquire the virtues of a warrior. Discipline yourself, discipline your passions, discipline your desires, train yourself to be something better. I think men want that. Men want to be called as something higher. They want to be called to a purpose. And I just to say again, I think telling stories about men who've done this, telling stories that give us an example, something to aim at, I think can be powerful and giving men that role model. I mean, yeah, every man is called, in some sense, to be a husband, father, builder, warrior, priest and king. And that's really what the book's about. You know, I can imagine somebody on the last reading this book and seeing it as entirely foreign. It's a different language. It is so rightfully, biblically rooted. And I can just imagine the head kind of spinning there. And someone saying, well, if we understand things, for instance, like birth control pills, divorce law, pornography, which you read about in the book, as these clear material catalysts for declining masculinity, does that mean that policy solutions will necessarily involve rolling back access to some of that stuff? How would you respond to that question? Well, you mentioned pornography. I mean, one of the things that I talk about in the book is, regardless of what the law is, I think what we should say to men, listen, I mean, there's the siren song that the left wants you to believe, which is that why do you spend your time looking at porn on screens and entertaining yourself in various other ways? Don't spend your time making yourself stronger, providing for your family, or otherwise being involved in a community. Why is that? Because men who are strong in that way, men who discipline their passions, men who learn to master themselves, and then go out and become providers and defenders of their families, those men are actually pretty strong men. They're a threat to the status quo, right? They're a threat to the liberal ruling class that wants to run the country on its own. Those men are like, hold on. No, wait, actually, I want to have a say. I'm going to be involved in my community. I'm going to be involved in my church. I'm going to be involved in my government. I think there's this constant steady drumbeat again to men, which is that, just go entertain yourself, just go do here. Watch some of this and let us run the country. My message to men is, the most powerful and profound change that we can make in this country is to change our own character. It's to say, no, I'm going to be a man of integrity, a man of courage, a man of fidelity. I'm going to learn to discipline myself. By doing that, I'll be able to help change my family, my neighborhood, and ultimately my country. It's the other policy, the changes we should talk about. Yeah, and I talk about some of those in the book, particularly on the economic front. We can talk about cultural changes as well. But I think my message to men would be, really, the most profound, fundamental, and important change in America begins with you. It begins in your character. Again, and maybe if we talk about those economic things just for a second, especially as generative AI is sweeping the country, chat GPT, sweeping the country right now. People are wondering what the future workforce looks like. But you write about building things, you write about the decline of blue collar work in the country. And even with things like chips factories, there's a lack of Americans were told who are able to staff high levels of those positions. So in a world that's getting even more high tech every single day, realistically, what does it look like to make things in America again? And how can we do it? Well, listen, we're not going to cross-verse the country unless we actually build things in America. And my view is that we shouldn't be shy about adopting economic policies that try to build up our industry, that try to provide good paying jobs to men who have a skill, who want to learn a skill, who work with their hands. 70% of men in this country don't have a four-year college degree, and they shouldn't have to get one in order to get a good paying job and provide for a family. So this is one of the reasons why I'm in favor of policies like tariffs on China, for example, that will bring back good paying jobs to this country that will help encourage industry here in the United States. And I just reject the premise that I think has been adopted, frankly, by both political parties, that, well, manufacturing and blue collar work is the way it has passed. That's all gone now. We're just going to subsist on white collar service jobs in America. And if you can't do those, I guess you'll just have to take a government check. No way. No way. The future of our country, if we're going to have one, is where men can get good paying jobs and provide for their families, where men and women together can raise their families in the communities they grew up in and can provide and can find good work for themselves there and support a family according to their values. And we've got to make some economic changes to get there. I thought this section of your book, actually, on dependency was really good and raises some interesting questions for pro-natalist policies, conservatives who have been working on that, Senator Romney, Senator Rubio, other offices that have been working on, especially after jobs, what a conservative family policy looks like. Could you talk a little bit about, especially those cash payment bills, where parents would, I think this is just my argument, that Foster's a sense of dependency, where parents are getting a check every single month in their bank account per child until the child is 18. Great intentions, but I think you're getting into dependency questions there. So could you talk about masculinity and its intersection with that concept of dependency and how conservatives should be thinking about that when they're looking at how to create fathers and create husbands in the first place? Absolutely. I think we have got to be doing everything we can to move men who are currently not working or able-bodied, but they're not working to move them into work. And again, we need to send an unequivocal message that America needs your work, your family needs your work. We are all less than what we could be if we've got guys out there who aren't working because we need their contributions. They can make contributions that are unique and we need them to do that. Their families need them to do that. I'm really alarmed by the 40, 50-year trend now and more and more men who are able-bodied, who are choosing not even to look for work. They're dropping out of the labor force. And I think a lot of this is the economic policies we've adopted were simultaneously, we have paid men not to work on the one hand and we sent good paying jobs away overseas. You put those two together and you have our current crisis. So the answer to that I think is we've got to push men out of dependency, which means those who can work should work. We need to look at the welfare programs for men that are allowing able-bodied men to avoid work, where it's actually they can make more by not working than they can in a labor force. We've got to reform that and say, no, men, we need you in the labor force. We're not going to pay you to not have a job when you're able to have one. And then the flip of it is, the flip side of that is the complementary side. We've got to work to bring back good paying jobs, blue collar jobs to this country where a guy can go out and get a job as an electrician, as a plumber, in a factory building thing to say, hey, this is a good way. I can make a good way to here. I can get married on this way. I can have some kids on this way. My wife and I, we can raise our family together and deter a course for our family together with these jobs. That's the kind of policy I think we need. It is a pro-work, pro-independence policy, and it's one that has healthy manhood that wants to be a contributor, wants to provide, wants to protect. It has that at its core. I remember covering your campaign back in 2018 when you talked about three things over and over again, Hollywood, Washington, and Wall Street. You said that in so many different speeches, and I thought it was really, really important coming from a Republican candidate, I want to ask, now that you have been in the United States Senate for a while and presumably have come into contact with folks from Hollywood Washington and Wall Street in your capacity as a senator, often what we see in elite circles is that they live lives that they aren't prescribing for others. Tim Carney has called this the Lena Dunham fallacy. I think is what he says in alienated America, where you have higher levels of marriage and less divorce and higher religiosity, et cetera, et cetera, of people in the upper class who are telling people in the rest of America that it's okay to sort of break these chains of tradition, et cetera, et cetera. How do you rate the state of masculinity in these sort of elite circles? Is the problem as pointed as it is in the rest of the country? Is it just as bad or is it in some ways perhaps even worse in these corridors in Hollywood, Washington, and Wall Street? Well, I think on the one hand, rich people can insulate themselves from a lot of the trouble they cause for others by just spending their money. You think about the crime issue, you think about the drug issue. I mean, what do the wealthy do? And they go out and hire their own police forces effectively. They go out and get private security. They send their kids to elite private schools with rigorous screening processes for this side and the other side. So they exempt themselves. You think about the chaos that their policies are causing in our culture. The chaos that comes with the rampant drug abuse, that comes with open borders, that comes with jobs, the lost communities broken. Now, rich people just sort of spend their way out of that, which is nice for them. But for everybody else is a disaster. In terms of the message though that these people are sending to the rest of the country, especially when it comes to manhood, I think it's bad. And frankly, it makes me think of my boyhood hero, Theodore Roosevelt, who came from that class. He came from a very wealthy family, but he was extremely critical in his day of the upper class and of the elite because he thought that the example they were studying for the country and the message they were sending to the country was terrible. And he was right then and he'd be right now to make that same critique. I think that the Hollywood, Washington, Wall Street class that constantly denigrates traditional manhood, that constantly says stuff like manhood is inherently toxic. That constantly says we don't need more blue collar work in this country and that if you want to be a father and a husband, that there's something wrong with you and that that's, you know, traditionalist and high bound and patriarchal, right? I think that's terrible message. I think that is much the problem of the message they are sending to the rest of the country, even as they spend their way out of the consequences of that message. And so we need to reverse that. And again, I think the way we do that is we tell better stories. We hold up the truth. We provide good role models and we say to men, we need you. We need you to be strong. It's good to be a man, be a man who is strong, who's a contributor, who's a provider. In the sort of online right circles where people are chatting about these things, the first things story went really viral a couple months ago by Lomas and he was describing what's called the longhouse phenomenon. And he wrote, quote, more than anything, the longhouse refers to the remarkable overcorrection of the last two generations towards social norms, centering feminine needs and feminine methods for controlling, directing and modeling behavior. And so, I think the way from the left, right and center have made note of this shift. What I've been interesting about that is one of my college jobs was helping Christina Hoff Summers on the rerelease of War Against Boys. And so it was like 2014, a really important book that picked up on, yeah, how the, you write about this as well, the way that we treat young boys in elementary school and high school, how that actually also has ripple effects on women. Is there, how do you describe the reverse of it? If you look at not just elite institutions, but maybe society as a whole that have largely been in some very important ways, I guess you could say feminized. Is that really what we're looking at? I mean, are men sort of forced, not just in academia, but also maybe in the workplace to deal with new norms that may push them out of places they would otherwise be interested in or engage in? And if so, what do we do about that? I would think that it's not necessarily even feminized. It's really these days androgynize because you see a corresponding war on femininity. I mean, this is the war on girls' sports, for example, the war on the very concept of what it is to be a woman. I mean, now biological males can be women, the less says, and we must treat them as such and we must honor them as such. And this is bizarre, right? I mean, you talk about an attack on femininity. So I think what you see from the left is an attack on both manhood and womanhood. And you see them pushing this idea that really what we are at base is androgynous consumers. You know, so just make yourself happy. Again, let them tell you how to make yourself happy, but be an androgynous consumer. And is that disorienting to men? Yes, it is. It is. Is it detrimental? Yes, it is profoundly so. It's profoundly detrimental for a young boy to be told in class that he mustn't be energetic, but he has got to sit still or be medicated. You know, I mean, it is profoundly disorienting for a teenage boy to be told, no, you shouldn't aspire to be a vintrissum or strong or a trailblazer. You shouldn't be interested in hunting or fishing or anything quote unquote traditional because that's somehow systemically bigoted racist evil, you know, pick your adjective. So I think that the trend here, the messages that are getting sent to men are very disorienting, very disheartening. And I think one of the reasons you see so many young men struggling with depression and generalize lack of purpose is that they feel like, well, if they pursue the passions and interests that they want to pursue, then they're going to be making the world a worse place. And if they do nothing, then they feel like they have no purpose in life. And I write about some of my students. I was a professor at law school for several years. And I write about some of the students who I interacted with who were suffering from just this kind of maylays, if you like. And I think so much of that is culturally driven. And it is this push towards androgyny, this push toward just becoming a nameless, faceless consumer. Men don't want that. Women don't want that. And we need to provide, I think, a better vision of what a responsible man looks like. It's interesting because Marx actually wrote about that, too. People are just sort of being whittled down to androgynous widgets that could be stuffed into any different place whenever their corporate overlord needs them to be that. Getting all the distinctions of nationality and gender just being erased so that people are able to be plugged into different boxes. And the left, remarkably, is now the side going along with that when it comes to pushing puberty blockers on children and everything else. I mean, it's just remarkable how quickly that happened. Yes. It's absolutely true. And it's a great, great point. And this is, I think, part of the new left, their embrace of Marx, what they have taken from him is the emphasis on a victimhood, the emphasis on the need for the overturning of our social structures. But, of course, what they really want to overturn above all is our culture. So they've come to accept this idea of global markets and global corporations. The modern left loves those things. I mean, that's their base now. They're base. And the modern left are people who fly in private jets and attend conferences in Davos. That is the base of the Democrat Party today. So they love the global market and the free flow of capital. They love that. They love consumerism. They're for it 100%. What are they not for? They're not for our culture that says there is such a thing as a God. There is such a thing as eternity that our rights come from God and that there's such a thing as a man and a woman. And they want to tear that down because they think what we need above all is a new culture, a new way of thinking about reality. That's the new Marxism. And you see that everywhere on the left. You see it in practically every program that they push these days. And I think that's why our fights over culture have become so pointed. Because we're really struggling over some of the basic beliefs about what it is to be human, to be man and woman, and of course, to be an American. You know, and just as we're wrapping up here, the last question I wanted to ask is obviously we talked earlier about Andrew Tate. Is there a risk that as we continue ignoring or downplaying healthy incarnations of masculinity, what we're going to get is really unhealthy representations of masculinity that are maybe hyper masculine or that as men, I mean, we, this is a conversation every time there's another tragic and awful mass shooting, you look at a young, often fatherless male who's just sort of wandering through the cultural wilderness and landing in some really dangerous places. Is that the risk that the left actually is running us into here is that the more that you denigrate healthy versions of masculinity, the more you deny the existence of masculinity in and of itself, the more men are going to be looking in some really bad places to feel fulfillment and purpose and order as you write. Well, I think you see that. I think the research bears that out and the statistics spread that out. I'm thinking of just gang culture, for instance, all across the country, cutting across geography, it's mostly young men, of course, in gang culture, but you know, cutting across geography, cutting across race, cutting across, you know, various other social markers. But what you see consistently is young men who don't have fathers, who don't have positive role models, what do they do? Well, they adopt a violent masculine pose, right? And it really is a pose because nobody's ever helped them find a way to take their energy, their drive, their ambition and to turn that into something that is responsible, that is constructive, that provides for others. So they adopt this sort of violent pose and it has terrible consequences. And that's been true for decades, you know, so we admit people have researched this written on it at length. So yes, I think the answer to your question is yes. In order to steer away from that, the answer is not to say, oh, men are inherently toxic, that's ridiculous. The answer is to say, we need to recover what a good man looks like. And we need to start by saying, good men, strong men are good things. We need those in our country and we need to look back to our best and deepest traditions, like the tradition of the Bible, the traditions of our culture and to pull out these stories are like, yeah, that's what a good man looks like. We need those kind of men again in our families, in our neighborhoods and in our nation. The book is called Manhood, the masculine virtues, America needs Senator Josh Hawley.
