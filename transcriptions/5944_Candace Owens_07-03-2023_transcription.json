    "text": " All right, guys, question of the day. If you were offered, and I want you to be honest with yourself, you were offered $1 million to say just one thing that you didn't believe. Would you take it? Would you take the million dollars and say that one thing that you didn't believe? Or would you walk away from the million dollars? Do you think it's easy to walk away from $1 million so that your morals stay intact? Plus later on, Tucker Carlson has released never before seen footage from the January 6th quote unquote riots at Capitol Hill that appeared to dispel several narratives that were pushed by the Democrat-controlled House Select Committee and the legacy media. Color me, not shocked at all. All that and more today coming up on Candace Owens. So one of the many aims of this show and at least things that I try to be successful at is giving you guys a glimpse of what happens behind the scenes in conservative worlds. I know that's a lot of the questions that I have when I was following politics and I wasn't really a part of it is one of these people really like behind the scenes, what actually goes on behind the scenes. And today I want to share with you a story about something that took place regarding me and my personal life in January of 2021. The things, the events that took place behind the scenes after January 6th. Now why am I talking about this finally? Why am I talking about this years later? It's because obviously Tucker Carlson has released a lot of footage of what took place in the Capitol building which has to spell a lot of the left leaning narratives. A lot of those narratives which turned out to be lies impacted people on a personal level. People had nothing to do with anything on January 6th. People like me. So I'm taking a little time capsule back to what was going on in my life in January of 2021. First and foremost it's important for you guys to note that I was pregnant with my first kid. Not just a little bit pregnant, very pregnant with my first kid. My first son was born on January 13th, just seven days after the event on January 6th which is why I was not present. Even though I lived just a few blocks away in Washington DC to the Trump rally that took place and from the Capitol building. I obviously didn't go anywhere because I was sitting on my couch to be completely honest ordering McDonald's because that's what I was craving. I had just purchased my first home. It was very exciting. I had never owned anything in my life and I was very excited that my husband and I had just we had just gotten married and we purchased our first home in Washington DC. So I felt settled in one way but also I was taking big risks in my life because despite having just been married I was not living in a two income home because my husband is an immigrant. Wasn't immigrant didn't have a work visa. There's a long process before you are allowed to legally work in the United States and we were following the laws. Shame on us for following the actual laws. I had just announced a few weeks prior that I was going to join the daily wire that I was going to get a deal done with the daily wire but that deal had not yet been formally inked. So there were just a lot of changes in our life. We didn't really know what our financial circumstances were going to include but one thing that we had banked on was a $1 million offer that I had received from Hashet, one of the big book publishing houses because my book Blackout was a huge success. I think people didn't think it was going to be but it sold more than half a million copies and so a lot of the publishing houses came to us looking to secure my second book and I had told them what the book was going to be about. It was going to be about feminism. Nothing to do with Trump, nothing really to do with politics but more to do about women in this day and age and I was very excited that I had received the first time in my life a $1 million offer. Exciting times. But then January 6th took place. Again, I wasn't present for January 6th but I remember sitting on my couch waiting for McDonald's to arrive and receiving all of these text messages from my family members saying are you okay? Are you okay? Is everything okay? We're so worried about you guys. Now the members that were in Connecticut and Arizona are worried about us in Washington, D.C. Why were they worried? There were no noises outside. I mean, I had expected these text messages during the George Floyd riots that had taken place all summer when we were actually terrified because every day we were waking up and there were cars being set on fire. Cars that are being broken into small businesses that were waking up and having their windows smashed. Private homes as windows were smashed all the name of George Floyd but this we didn't hear a single peep. And of course we realized the news was selling to all of America that there was an insurrection taking place, that people were dying. Officers were dying. People were charging the Capitol building. They were going to kill Nancy Pelosi. They were going to kill Mike Pence and people ate it up from where I was sitting. The city had never been more quiet. Not that entire summer. It was very weird but whatever. Nothing to do with us. We weren't there. When there was this bizarre peer pressure campaign on Twitter for people to magically distance themselves from Trump. So if you were like me and you were quote unquote influencer, you're supposed to say, I can't believe these horrific images that I'm seeing on CNN that has never once told me the truth about anything but I believe them now. I believe CNN now. I believe MSNBC now and I hate Donald Trump and of course I wasn't going to do that. I didn't feel like we were being told the truth because again, I was sitting in the city. A few days after January 6, I received a phone call from my book agent. He was my book agent for Blackout and I was still contracted to use him as a book agent for my second book option. And he essentially said, Hashette would like to discuss with you the events surrounding January 6. They are thinking they don't know yet for sure. It's going to pen a conversation with you, depending on conversation with you about whether or not they're going to go through but they're not feeling confident about doing this book anymore. It was very surprising to me. Why would they not feel confident about doing this book with me anymore? It wasn't there. I'm about to give birth. What did I do? And he said, you know, they're pulling a bunch of publishers are pulling books with people that have supported Trump, most notably, Kelly and Conway. She had signed a book deal and they had revoked the book deal because of her association with Trump even though she hadn't done anything wrong. But I wasn't like Kelly and Conway. I wasn't in the Trump administration. I'm an influencer on social media, sure. So it makes sense of why I had to have a conversation. He said, you know, just remain level headed, have discussion with them. I think everyone's just really nervous but in a few weeks people will calm down and you just really to keep this offer you need to be level headed when you talk with them. I said, okay. I'm so confused about why we're having this conversation. So I had a conversation with one of the executives at Hashette on the phone and I was of course level headed. I asked questions before questions were even asked of me. I asked them, what did I do? What why are we? Why is suddenly a million dollars being put on ice pending this discussion? And that executive answered me. She told me it was because of a tweet that I had authored following January 6th. And this was the tweet that had them very concerned. This was the million dollar tweet, which is why they were considering revoking the deal. Here it is. I wrote this. On January 7th, 2021 at 3.53 p.m. I wrote just a quick tweet to remind all of you leftists that I have zero shame about having supported Donald Trump for the last four years. And I stand unapologetically with every patriot in this country. Your smears have and will continue to inspire me. I will never be silenced. Wow. I thought what is wrong with that tweet? What did I do here? Am I not allowed to support the Patriots in this country? Am I supposed to be silenced following January 6th? Did she explain that they were just looking for some sort of condemnation of Donald Trump and Donald Trump's supporters of Storm the Capitol. And this tweet wasn't that. I didn't say the right things. And I explained to her quite calmly that I wasn't planning on revoking my support of Donald Trump. Why would I? You hadn't done anything that I had seen. And I didn't see anything problematic about the tweet. There was nothing violent in the tweet that I was suddenly supposed to say Patriots have gotten it wrong. We've taken it too far. We spoke for an hour. And at the end of the conversation, I felt that I had dug my heels in far enough for her to understand that I am who I am, respectfully. I was very respectful. And I remember as soon as I got the phone, I turned to my husband and I said, I think that we probably just lost a million dollars. And I remember crying because I was just so confused about what was happening. I was also super pregnant. Okay. And I was losing a million dollars for literally something that I didn't do. Okay. And my book publisher said calm down. Let's give it a few days. Let's see what happens. Well, I gave birth a couple of days after that. And then in the fog of postpartum, a few days beyond that, my book publisher called me and he had great news. A shet was going to keep the deal. I had survived the test and they were going to keep the deal. You know, it was now a couple of weeks later, a week later. And it was okay. They were going to be a million dollars. But I didn't feel good about that. I felt that it was weird that it was ever even a question because I hadn't done anything wrong. I had not actually said anything badly in that tweet. And I said this in my book publisher, I said, look, I don't feel good about this still. I don't know if I want to take their money. It feels icky now. This feels polluted. It feels like there is some implicit understanding between the two parties that I won't go too far in my Trumpism now, you know? And my book publisher said, don't be an idiot. This is a million dollars. You've never seen an offer like this on paper. He was right. And this is not something that people get. And you should just sign this and let's move on. And I pushed back. I said, no, no. I really think that I believe in myself and that we could self publish. He spoke to my husband about it. He said, look, it will be very hard. But this is where your heart is. We could self publish. So I'm going to read for you parts of the email that I received from my book agent, essentially telling me that if I self publish, I'd be making a huge mistake. And I'm going to skim it because it's quite long, but these were the big points. He wrote Candice, I'm not sure where you're at with Hashette, but we've just received contracts. We discussed some of this on the phone, but I want to more formally make a case for moving forward with Hashette. I know Don Jr. had a positive experience of publishing, but that is a far outlier from most, even with someone of your stature. Stephen King, Dean Coon, Sprad Thore, all the major name brand authors work with big publishers for a reason. There are concrete benefits to publishing with a major publisher. Here are his points. Number one, perception. You are a vitally important conservative voice. I would argue, along with Ben Shapiro, the most important new voice. It is critical as you move forward to align yourself with a major mainstream publisher. That's why Ben publishes with Harper. You want to be viewed as a mainstream voice, not marginalized, not marginalized as a discordant voice out of the mainstream. You want your book to be considered as the product of a major mainstream house that people who disagree can disagree on the merits, but not peg you as someone who doesn't have access. I'm not sure if you want to be a mainstream publisher. I'm going to skim next part, distribution. Hashette is one of the biggest publishers in the world. No distribution channels are stellar. You posted a lot of Instagram stories of fans finding your book in the bookstores. If you self publish, your book will be in fewer stores. Stores that do buy it will buy less copies. Blah, blah, blah. His next point was editorial. I know you are unhappy with the editorial process at Simon & Schuster. They published my first book. But so and so was invaluable in getting your book completed and in top shape. Hashette's editors are the best in the business. They are a bigger publisher than Simon & Schuster and have greater resources. Keep in mind, Don Drenner got a lot of flack when his self published book came out because there was a typo on the cover. With Hashette, you can be assured you are incapable of hands. The next topic was time commitment. Self publishing is extremely time consuming, even if you have someone walking through the process. And in his final note, he said that there was a steep learning curve in publishing your first book. And the second book will run a lot smoother. However, if you self publish, you are setting up a whole other curve to overcome. I am available to go over this on the phone if you would like all my best. So it is not really wrong if the email is fair. He is thinking as a businessman, he is thinking we have a million dollars on the table and you are about to go through this bizarre self publishing route to prove a point. Don't prove a point, can I? That is stupid. You can live to fight another day. I'm the contract that is in front of you. And I was upset by the email. I just thought to myself, basically what you're saying is it's going to be a lot of hard work and you want to remain in the mainstream, even if it comes at a little cost, just a little cost of your soul. I remember my husband and I prayed on this and we knew that this was going to be a very big decision that had very big financial implications. And I just said, in summation to him, I can't go through. We need to walk away from Hashette now. They thought about walking away from us. But now we need to go back to them and say, sorry, we're no longer available. We are walking away from you and your million dollar offer. Nobody's ever done that. My book agent said, well, I'm about to be the first. And so I authored this email back to my book agent. I said, after much consideration and weighing both the pros and cons with my husband, I decided to formally walk away from the Hashette offer. All the offer is incredible and would certainly work towards further substantiating myself as a mainstream author. I cannot in good conscience accept its unwritten terms, namely, that I submit myself to the routine inspection for wrong think. I find the treatment of conservative authors to be appalling, the idea that we must continue to tone imaginary line, which cycles our freedom to think and rightfully challenge dogmatic practices or else risk being shunned from mainstream publication is not only unjust but fully un-American. Beyond this predicament, I know that I am where I am today because my fans and followers view me as a fighter. I give voice to the voiceless. Millions of Americans put faith in me to stay true to our shared value, sheep among them being freedom. To sign the still of Hashette would be for me to place profit and celebrity above ethics. I didn't get into politics because I love politics rather because I hate them. I hate watching people betray the very people who sent them to Washington when money perverts their interests. Ultimately, I am declining to become what I hate. I both understand, appreciate the risk as you have laid out that I am taking in my career by turning away from a major publishing house. I have never shied away from risk, especially when the risk I am taking is rude to morality. Sometimes there is a bigger picture. What is happening in this country in terms of censoring, canceling and silencing half of Americans because they dared to challenge cultural orthodoxy is for me the bigger picture. I believe in myself, my message and most importantly, my followers enough that I know this book will be a great commercial success no matter which novel direction I decided to take with it. Thank you for your understanding. I should note that following this, I said to my husband, I no longer want this person to be my agent and we looked into our contract. If you're wondering why I haven't published another book, it's because I basically had to allow the clock to wind down basically for another year before I could walk away from him formally and I've allowed that to take place. I am now free from this agent. I am now free from Hashette. And my $1 million short, sure, sure. You know what, I'd rather sign pictures of myself for a dollar and wait to get to a million people believing in me to buy it than to publish a book knowing that there were unwritten terms. And so for me, a million dollars was not worth my soul. And I think it is something that I'm so proud of and that's why I'm sharing it today because as more and more truth is being unveiled, truth that I always knew that we weren't allowed to say, that I took a risk in saying following January 6. It proves that being on the side of truth, no matter how difficult it is, right, having the willingness and the courage to save the truth and to say it often, no matter how many times they tell the lie, it's what we all should do. It's what we're all called upon to do. And that's all I'm going to say about that. Given the dreary economic forecast that lie ahead, you might be looking for ways to cut back on spending.

Okay, now it's time for some topics, digital. January 6th, man-oh-man. I just never understood. It just defied common sense how a single person could have bought that narrative. That somebody in Washington, D.C., the most surveilled capital in the entire world, was able to drop off pipe bombs outside of the DNC and the RNC headquarters, and they just couldn't figure out who it was. And we all know what happened. We're not allowed to say it. I guess, I should say, allegedly, I believe I think maybe the FBI had something to do with it. It probably is a better way to state it so I don't get into trouble. There are cameras everywhere. Okay? You cannot drop off pipe bombs a few blocks away from the White House and get away with it unless they want you to get away with it because what would that signal to the world? I can hear Russia or China. Wow. A pair of kids can just drop off pipe bombs a couple of blocks away from the White House. Maybe they don't have such a tough security in place. Obviously, they knew who did it. Obviously, they orchestrated it and we're never, ever, ever going to get a name. I think it might have been Ray Epps. Ray Epps, remember him, the guy? Let's charge the capital. Oh, no, they're not interested. They are definitely not interested in talking to him. For some reason, he never got any jail time. And yet the shamans rotting away in prison. Well, Tucker Carlson, Kevin McCarthy, handed over 40,000 hours of security footage from the Capitol building to Tucker Carlson. And he's been going through it. And thankfully, it is Tucker Carlson that's going through it because I trust him implicitly. I know that he is a real journalist that is actually fighting for this country. And what he has discovered is what we already knew that the media lied to us repeatedly. There are still people in America that believe that Brian Sicknick, the officer that died a few days following the Capitol riots, right, was bludgeoned to death by a fire hydrant outside. They believe this because the media got out the lie really quickly, faster than the truth could catch up with it. What's up, Carlson did a brilliant job debunking that first lie. Take a listen. Here is surveillance footage of Sicknick walking in the Capitol after he was supposedly murdered by the mob outside. By all appearances, Sicknick is healthy and vigorous. He's wearing a helmet, so it's hard to imagine he was killed by a head injury. Whatever happened to Brian Sicknick was very obviously not the result of violence he suffered at the entrance to the Capitol. This tape overturns the single most powerful and politically useful lie the Democrats have told us about January 6th. There you have it. Brian Sicknick apparently came back from the dead after being bludgeoned with a fire extinguisher only to reappear and direct people through the Capitol building. Of course, that makes entirely no sense because I think we were told many sense. It was all about harnessing a motion for people to believe that the nation was burning down because of angry Trump supporters. But and how could we forget, by the way, the biggest piece of it, which was the shot of the comment. Remember the guy dressed up, he kind of dressed like a native American. It was wearing a headdress and he, by the way, is facing some real time in prison because how dangerous you. The images of him yelling, holding what appeared to be a weapon. Could you imagine how scared police officers were for their life as the shaman stormed through the Capitol building? They were so scared they escorted him through the building. Take a listen. You have the internal surveillance video. It is very clear what happened once he got inside. Virtually every moment of his time inside the Capitol was caught on tape. The tapes show that Capitol police never stopped Jacob Chansley. They helped him. They acted as his tour guides. Here's video of Chansley in the Senate chamber. Capitol police officers take him to multiple entrances and even try to open locked doors for him. He counted at least nine officers who were within touching distance of unarmed Jacob Chansley. Not one of them even tried to slow him down. Chansley understood that Capitol police were his allies. Video shows him giving thanks for them in a prayer on the floor of the Senate. Watch. Thank you. I'm going to follow the word. Paying the inspiration needed to these police officers to allow us to go. There you have it guys. Nine police officers surrounding one shaman that was holding an American flag, testing the doors, trying to escort him into the chambers. When he gets there, he offers a prayer to his heavenly father and to the police officers. Probably legitimately the police officers were willing to help Trump supporters because they never dreamed that Democrats were going to pretend that this was a dangerous insurrection. And police officers aren't stupid in DC. They know that it is the Republicans that support police officers. So why would they be fearful of a man holding an American flag? And almost signals to them that this is a person that believes in policing. They helped him get to the chamber floor. So that doesn't matter because the Democrats put him in prison anyway, not Ray Epps who said, we got a storm in this building, but the shaman who offered a prayer to his heavenly father while in the chamber. We were told that he was a dangerous man. So obviously the leftist media is in a panic because they've been, I don't know, they've been telling us this narrative. And they have been weaving this web for years since 2021. And you needed to believe that there was so much violence that took place in this Capitol building that it became necessary for them to seize power, to seize power. This should remind you of the Nazi party, the Reichstag fire, something that was orchestrated only to assume more power for the government. The Department of Justice was in on this. You should be scared. You shouldn't feel relieved by this footage. You should be scared. But they got away with this for years. They lied to the public for years. They locked people away in federal prison, okay, for even being there. They punished people for their views. They should terrify you. You should be angry and you should want real justice in the form of the politicians that promoted this dangerous lie and narrative, spending more time in federal prison than all of the individuals who were wrongly assumed to be violent. That's what you should want. That's what should happen in a just society. But we don't live in a just society. We don't. We do not live in a just society. Moving on, you guys, and talking about the lies that we have been spun, obviously, since January 1st, we then went into COVID and we've learned about big pharma and the collusion of the government with the FDA along with the CDC to sell you lies. And they don't care, right? They will tell you as many lies as they need to to push a drug. And then the idea is after everybody takes the drug that they've all agreed, they know it's bad. Of course, they know it's bad. They know what's happening in the clinical trials. They hide all of that data just until enough people have taken the drug until they have earned enough billions. And then they come out and say, oh, actually, that drug might kill you. Backseat maybe does have some side effects. They tell the truth after they've already earned billions. That's how it works. You should be awake to that now. This is how it works even for pills. This is how it works, by the way. You want to talk about a trend? Will go V. Miracle weight loss. Everyone now you're seeing on social media looks so skinny. I lost 15 pounds up on myself for the Met Gala. Yeah. Okay. Sure. Okay. Overnight where everyone's just so skinny. Well, how's this happening? Obviously, we know that they are taking semaglutide has many different forms. But Gobi is one of them. And people have taken this. I would say over the last year, I know tons of people that are taking the shot to get skinny. Obviously, there's no such thing as a miracle weight loss drug. You are trading something. In this case, it's beauty because it ages you. Secondly, by the way, it can kill you. We're now admitting that it can kill you. Whoops. We didn't realize we've already earned our billions. But now we're realizing that the clinical trials just weren't long enough. Our clinical trials is what they're saying. Only went for 16 months. But we realize that at 20 months, I could kill you. Yeah. That is what they are saying. The researchers, and by the way, it was Chinese researchers that came out with this, sounding the alarm, believe that the drugs may cause a person's small intestine to become enlarged, which puts them at a high risk of a potentially deadly obstruction in their digestive system. That makes sense if you're injecting yourself with something and it makes you just not want to eat it all for days on end. It's probably causing some sort of an obstruction in your digestive system. But I'm not a doctor. So I don't know how I can help with that all by myself sitting here. I don't know why that makes common sense. It's not normal for people who just not want to eat for days on end. Don't listen to me. The doctor said it was perfectly safe. And now they're saying it's not. And it was by accident. I want to be very clear. The trials just didn't go on long enough. If they had let the trials go on for her, they would have been very honest in telling you and they would have said, oh, we don't want to make those. We want to make you look your best. Of course, it is obnoxious. It is a nonsense that people keep believing this narrative, that people don't understand the evil, a big pharma. They do not care. They will kill you for profit. They have been killing you for profit. They will put it in your food. They will inject it into your children. They will put it into your vaccine. They do not care if you die. Okay? Who cares? As long as they make their billions. If you are not awake to that, then I don't even know if I have been effective communicating over the last two years. If you are not awake to the fact that big pharma just wants profit. Living a healthy lifestyle isn't always easy, especially when you're on the go as much as I am.

All right guys, since we are talking about lies and the repeated lies that we are being told, the nonsense that science has become, we should talk about the LGBTQ movement and we should talk specifically about Heather Dubrow. Now, who is Heather Dubrow and why she relevant? Well, she is one of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. She was a breakout star. Certainly, her husband is a plastic surgeon and there are an enjoyable couple to watch. I'm not going to lie. I've watched a few episodes of it and they seem to really have their family together. Unbelievably wealthy, of course. You can imagine how much a plastic surgeon makes in Beverly Hills. Well, Heather Dubrow is speaking out because one of her children, oh no, I'm sorry, two of her children, I'm sorry, three of her children have now come out as members of the LGBTQ community. Yes, her daughter Max came out as by. Her second daughter, Kat, came out as a lesbian and now her third daughter who we watched grew up on the show named Coco and who is now 12, wants to change her name to Ace because she is transgendered. Okay, if you're stupid and you believe that they are just defying statistical odds and that everyone in the house is just gay or lesbian or trans and that what's maybe potentially happening is a social contagion. Remember that debate? It all started, right? Long before we were here, the debate about gay people was, was this nurture or was this nature, right? People believe, no, you could actually be born gay. It is natural to be gay. That was the argument. Now today, the society has become increasingly gay. It's never been more gay. Okay. And it's proving the point that is a social contagion because it's just not possible. You know who said it better than I ever could? Bill Mar did. Take a listen. According to a recent Gallup poll, less than 1% of Americans born before 1946, that's Joe Biden's generation, identified that way. 2.6% of boomers do, 4.2% of Gen X, 10.5% of millennials, and 20.8% of Gen Z, which means if we follow this trajectory, we will all be gay in 2053. There you have it. In 2060, we were all going to be gay. So it's pretty obvious now that this is a social contagion. By the way, that clip goes on and he describes how why is it in California? There's so many gay people, but in these states, there's not that many gay people. It tells you because the environment is nurturing gay people in one such environment is that a bro household. I used to like Heather. I no longer do because she is not paying attention to her children. That's abundantly clear for Heather, what this represents. And by the way, I don't care that her daughters buy, or that her daughter is a lesbian. I really, that bothers me so much less than the transgender daughter or younger daughter, because the implications of this are severe. Okay. That is a lie. Okay. Yes. Your lesbian daughter, if she wants to, can date a girl, bring home a girl, and marry a girl in this society. Yes. Your by daughter can, if she wants to, engage in relationships with both men and women, but your trans daughter, your trans daughter cannot transition to becoming a little boy. That can never happen. You are engaging her in this law. You are engaging her in this fantasy. And this can only end up as something that harms her in the end, because what this begins with. And by the way, isn't your husband's doctor, Terry's a doctor? Okay. How to begin this is by giving her pills, filling her body to stop her from going through puberty. This is what happens when you further this line, when you further this delusion, rather than stopping in his tracks and looking at her and saying, I love you very much, but you are a little girl. Okay. But you're not going to do that because you're in Beverly Hills. You're Beverly Hills. Everybody lives, right? You, everybody lives for living. And you especially lie for attention, which is exactly what you are doing. Right. This is what happened when you started getting a little attention from the real house was Beverly Hills and you get more attention because your husband's got his own show botched. You can't stop getting attention. You're addicted to attention. And so it feels good for you, Heather, when you post something on Instagram saying, this is my daughter. Actually, now it's my son, my youngest son. And you get a bunch of likes for being an accepting parent. That's what you did, right? You posted it. And people told you were wonderful for engaging your daughter in this delusion. Well, let me set you straight. This is not wonderful. This is in fact, an delusion. And this is in fact, child abuse. Change this correct course to not allow your youngest daughter to end up like I am jazz. The person that we all watched on prime time and TLC be abused by his parents believing that he could become a little girl. Encouraging him, he made me relate his body. Eventually he didn't relate his body. And do you want to know what happened to I am jazz? Well, today I am jazz. He's now depressed. He's over 100 pounds overweight. He doesn't know what happened. We all do. We all do. He was abused by his parents and nobody said anything. So I'm going to say something to you, Heather and Terry. In my opinion, and then the opinion of every sane adult, what is happening here is you are abusing your children. And that's all I have to say about that. All right, guys. The next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on Daily Wire Plus. I'm going to be reading your comments plus answering your questions.
