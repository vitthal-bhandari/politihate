    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you. No matter how dark things have gotten, if you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on the screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at BlazeTV.com slash The Blind. Today the Democrats fuzzy math. Joe Biden's $3.5 trillion spending bill actually costs $0 and many people will believe that since they had that common core math. At least 12,000 Haitian illegals released into the United States. Did I mention at least that many? And Joe Biden gets his booster shot and answers the question, when can we finally get back to normal? If you're going to warn you, you're not going to like the answer. And neither are the gentlemen at this table. We have got a lot of headlines coming up and it all starts right now. Hey, welcome to the news and why it matters. Happy Monday or is it? I don't know, I'll let you decide after the show. I am. Sarah Gonzalez today joined by two of your favorites. We've got BlazeTV contributors, both Yaku Buyan's host of the Yaku Buyan's show and Eric July, host of Four Cannon's sake, also known as Young Ripper 5'9\". No, that's not me trying to like cater to the Blackbird. That's just his name. I guess I'll see if I can say that. They're like, oh, she's trying to sound urban. Does your mom call you Young Ripper? No, I think she's in for car. She's not here. No, mom, I was going to keep it real. She's going to keep it real. She gave him the damn name. She's going to call him Eric. That's what I would do. I don't care what they call you on the internet. I gave you your name. This is what it is. All right, so it should be a fun one today. Let's get into this spending bill first. This is incredible. The math that the Democrats have learned how to do from going to all of these public schools and getting common core math taught to them. We've talked about it on the show last week. It is a $3.5 trillion spending package. It includes tons of social justice warrior ideals. The Democrats, despite this, like I said, $3.5 trillion price tag, they are here to tell you it actually costs $0. It's just magic. It's magic like that. Joe Biden tweeted out, my Build Back Better agenda costs $0. Instead of wasting money on tax breaks, loopholes, and tax evasion for big corporations and the wealthy, we can make a once in a generation investment in working America and it adds $0 to the national debt it will be paid for, they say, by ending failed special tax giveaways for the richest taxpayers and big corporations adding nothing to the debt, which is incredible because that seems to be how they pay for literally everything is what they say. Well the rich just needs to pay their fair share. If the rich only pays their fair share, then this will all be paid for and I just still have a little bit of a problem with how this math doesn't add up. Look, this is literally how Satan works. Okay? Yes, I just did equate the person who's imposing as the president of the United States to the work of Satan has a lot of truth with a lot of spin. You know, it costs $0 because it's going to be just paid for, yes, by the tax payer. You want to go to 60% tax? You want to go with Canada? Go look at Canada for a minute. And nothing is free. Show me one thing that's free, a single thing, just a sandwich. Somebody is paying, but Joe thinks it's free because it's paper, it's just paper and that's how they're treating our economy. Cut a tree, make paper, print money, it's free. It's easy. This is easy. I can do this all day long. He's like, dang, I can be president. This is fun. Let's go buy an island. We'll just print some money, right? Come on. Tax payer, watch out. 60%. Canada, hello. Yeah. And let me just, let me just add to this conversation, Eric, before I get your thoughts. The proposed tax increase that they are putting into this, none of this, none of these figures include the full context of the bill, which is, you know, there are entitlement phase outs and phase ins. So there are some third party unbiased agencies that are estimating it to be at like 5 trillion or even more than that, not the 3.5 trillion. And the Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation says the bill raises 2.1 trillion over $2.1 trillion over 10 years. And among the tax hikes are a 5.5 percentage point increase in corporate income tax rate that will be paid, of course, by workers in lower wages, consumers in higher prices and investors in lower returns. Because as it turns out, people who own companies aren't just going to eat that cost themselves. That's right. It's so much economically a literate bull crap that happens around like that people don't seem to understand like where the money's coming from and how this government spends suddenly its money. Now, I think it's insane. I mean, this is what happens when you have a bunch of Keynesians working for you is that you get a bunch of weirdos who say, okay, here's the arbitrary number of how much we're going to spend over the course of the next year. Now I want everybody to just take a step back and think about how I almost used the word that I don't think I can use on this show, but how silly that actually is. You can't predict when you're going to use the damn restroom, let alone how much money you're going to spend in the next year. It is literally impossible. The government does it every single year. And of course they're going to deficit spend. That's what's going to happen when they're just going to say, oh, well, we didn't get enough tax money. Therefore, we're probably going to be $2 trillion under or over, depending on how you look at it in terms of their budgeting. So they can't predict it in the first place. Because that's impossible, they're going to inevitably miss and it's not like they're going to under spend. When this government ever, ever do that. So the fact that they sell this is a lot of the American people and I'm willing to bet there are going to be some silly, maybe college days, people that are going to repeat that rhetoric and say it costs nothing, we're just going to tax the rich, rich people which already pay the majority of the income taxation in this country right now. It'll take my word for it, actually go look it up. Instead of just hearing the bus terms that the buyouts of the world use. Bernie Sanders, fresh air, fair share, fair share. They're all this nonsense when they already pay the vast majority of it. Do they also dodge it? When they can, of course they do. You also do it too. Ain't no man coming down throughout April. It's like, yeah, I'm going to give the government more money than what they think that I owe them. So they sell this line to the American public. A lot of people buy it, then your money gets devalued as they allude it too. That's what's going to end up happening. Even if they do end up successfully raising taxes somewhere, rich folks aren't going to eat the cost. They're going to go back on you. You're going to pay for it by way of goods or something else. But more importantly what we're talking about with this reckless spending is what's going on in the future and really in the current and near future to be really honest. Because your money is currently being devalued because they're printing it and because they're spending in the way that they are and monetizing their debt. And then folks wonder why the ex-good cost so much right now is going to go down. It's only temporary they say. Right. You're going to see how it's perfect. Well, you did save the 16 cents on your property. That's right. It's amazing. If we get that grace again, thanksgiving this year. You know, save another 16 cents. I can't wait to hear this. Hyperinflation has to happen. Because it's going to be passed down to the customer. So now your $8 burger is a $15 burger. Your $8 an hour job is now someone who wants $25 an hour. You're pushing the country towards social. And by the way is replaced by automation and stuff. A hundred percent automation or China. Let's just go to China. It's more China. And it's not sustainable. There's not enough wealth in our country with individuals to pay this down. May we be reminded this is not monopoly. You don't close the box. In the next game you start at zero. Okay. We know we have had a deficit forever. We haven't balanced the US budget in forever. They blame Trump for being a spender. You better not blink twice. Okay. Now we're starting to talk five trillion. Keep on doing each other. And President Trump spending was a problem. It was a problem. But that's what it is. We have no party that's going to protect. We're talking about it's not going to cost us anything. Joe, we're so far behind. You can't see the finish line. Okay. $30 trillion worth of debt. So it's cost zero. It's been costing. Our great great great grandchildren. You've now spent their lunch money. I mean what are we talking about it costs now? This is literally the definition of insanity. Yeah. It'll be interesting to see how this plays out. I know, you know, there look, I don't want to get this video kicked off of YouTube. So I'll just say this. We all know that Joe Biden is obviously the most popular president of all time. 81 million votes. All right. Fortifying the election, which you tend to do when you have a very popular person that you're trying to elect. So there are already people who I think are already like, how do we, how do we win again? Right. So add on to that compound that with the fact that if you get enough of these people on these entitlements, which I know is all part of the plan, the master plan here, if you get enough of these people on these entitlements, they will never vote for the party who is trying to get rid of them. So how close are we to the point of no return here? I'll tell you why we're there. It's because the Republican party is chicken crap for lack of better terms because like you just saw with the NDAA, they have no problem spending recklessly money's going elsewhere. It's like, all right, passing right now will figure out what else is in it. The gas lights you when they act as if you're an evil person, if you say you're against it because, well, this, and bear it in the bill is this million dollar that we're spending on this, you must not want them to get money. And I would argue, no, I don't want them to get done. You get the money as far as I'm concerned. But on a serious note, because you got chicken crap Republicans who do nothing but conserve whatever the Democrats recently passed anyway, that's why this can gets perpetually kicked down a road because they don't got enough gold in the ass to say, you know what, this has to stop. We're spending recklessly money that is not ours by way of stealing from the current generation. But more importantly, you're stealing from future generations by monetizing all of this debt. If the Republican Party decided tomorrow, and that's a lot of them that come on the channel and talk big, big, big game, right? They'll come here and talk to Blaise TV, talk a great game. And then you go look at their voting record and they doing the same crap. There's one guy with a, with an eye patch that does that crap that gets on my last freaking nerve. Who voted in favor of red black, black law. I was standing with the Indian. And I was, I was, I was on a stage with that individual recently. And so let me tell you this. If we look at this last, this last, yeah, no, this last bill that was passed, it's the GOP that yes, a bill without reading the bill. We're passing a bill of trillions of dollars without reading the bill. And in the excuses, well, it's a thousand page document. Look, if butrel can read a thousand page document for Glenn back to do a show, then sure as heck, we should be able to have our servants, the government, our servants. I would argue that that even speaks to a larger issue. Why? Okay. If you don't have time to read it, what the hell you passing it for? Why would you even pass something that you have? I know the great wrong Paul had been making that point for I don't know how long, like y'all don't even have time to read it. You pass it anyway. And then we're supposed to look at that 30, well, 30, it's funny. You say 20, 20 dollars. And that wasn't that long ago. And that went 30, 30 dollars. We just added 10. Yes, we just added 10. Wait, wait, wait, wait, we adding another five years. Yeah, it's going to be probably 30, 35 very soon. But we look at that number and then everybody is like, well, how could it have got this way? And you get all these weird old Republicans who campaign like libertarians and then they govern like Democrats, they need to be addressed. They need to have like an owner serious note. I know we've been like, well, we got to support them because if we don't, the Democrats win it. We're going to let the Democrats win either way. Look at them's how they're spending a Democrats win either way. At some point in time, you guys have to address that problem. It is coming from the GOP. We're talking about the reason bill. My concern is right. And again, if you took the vaccine, amazing, more power to you, but you can't make me take it, but how easily we line up for the slaughter in this country, not just the vaccine, but the trillion dollars of spending or the person you voted into office that now just goes rogue that lied to you in the campaign and there's no accountability. The American people don't hold anybody accountable for anything. Heck, we just gave the Taliban half up. And was they really a big pushback kind of sort of, but not that it should have been? You thought January 6 was bad. What should have happened? We should have removed people from office for allowing that to happen. But you missed one of the accolades of the imposter. Right? So let's give him all his accolades. He was also more popular than Barack Obama under the black community. He is so popular. He got more black votes than Barack Obama. It's incredible. It's impressive. Don't forget that. I mean, every time you hear the man speak, don't you just go, gosh, now I remember why he was so popular. He's just so good at this. Speaking of President Pudding Brain and Chief, we do have him coming up later on in the program. You can hear from him on how we need what we need to do to return to normalcy. Eric's laughing because he already knows his. Did your head explode when you heard it? Yeah, it absolutely exploded. It's a comic book. Eric writes a comic book. You got a lot of content. Oh man. You got some very effluent. One of your characters better be the Joe character. There's got to be one. He'll be a villain. That's for them. I'm kidding. Alright, we've got more to come. First one I think our sponsor Omega XL. So if you are an American who just lives in pain, maybe you've reached the age where things just hurt all the time. Maybe you've had a car accident, something like that where you just got some neck pain, back pain, knee pain, whatever it is. What you don't realize is the underlying cause is probably inflammation. That is what is at the root cause of your pain. Now Omega XL is backed by 35 years of clinical research and it actually attacks the inflammation that is causing your pain. So if you are grabbing a topical rub and you are rubbing it on, you know, like, oh my gosh, my shoulder hurts. I'm going to rub this topical cream on it. Wow. That's so great for 10 minutes and then you're back in pain again. Don't do that. Use Omega XL. It will neutralize that inflammation and get rid of your pain for good. Now it is made from the, is it an essential fatty acid combination made from the waters of New Zealand. It is the real deal. There have been so many people out there who have been helped by it. If you're in pain, let me just tell you, Omega XL can change your life. I truly mean that. In order, Omega XL now get a second bottle for free over at omega XL dot com slash news. That is omega XL dot com slash news. All right. We were going to get into something else, but I think we should just let's just talk about this Biden booster shot now. No better time than now. So Joe Biden received his booster shot of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine today at the White House. This is of course right after the FDA approved the third dose only for Americans over 65 and those with underlying health conditions, frontline workers at higher risk of exposure to Corona virus. And he, you know, it's interesting. He takes the shot, which I find fascinating that we've now made it breaking news. We're going to interrupt your programming to watch someone get a needle injected into their arm. It is so sweet. Crazy. The bizarre things to happen of this whole whole deal. I'm not in your market. The piece is out. It is. It is. It's almost like it's a cold. Almost like it is a cold. Hold on. So you mean to tell me you think that getting not one, not two, but three shots while continuing to wear a mask and tell us that the shot works. If your dumbass would just get it, but it really does work. It really works so much because the vaccine is as intelligent as the virus. Yes. It really works so much that you have to keep wearing your mask while getting your third dose. You mean to tell me you think that that's called like behavior? Yeah, I do. I mean, it's almost like symbolism, isn't it? Like, it's like, I don't know. It's almost like, I don't know if it's a placebo or whatever it is that he's taken. I have no idea, but it's bizarre that we have come to a point where that's normal. You see people taking vaccine selfies. Look, man, that's weird, dude. That's weird. Yeah. It's like, could you imagine that? We got your virtue signal. Not even two years ago. Could you imagine two years ago before this where people would just lie up and start taking pictures of themselves getting japped? You're like, yeah, I don't need to know you like your medical information like that. That's not required. But you're right. And you spoke to this point. I saw definitely your post on it like imagine the mixed signals that you send to people. They wonder why people are hesitant as they say. When you don't return to any sort of normalcy, despite getting it. You know what I mean? But you're the dumb one. You don't think it works. Because we don't think it works. It's like you're telling me that it doesn't work like you at least have said that it worked. Because you're continuing to do the same bullcrap that you said would stop if you got it. None of this makes sense. Like, by the way, I know we're expressing this and we're giggling here. But you want to talk about insanity. What is this? None of this makes sense. Legitimately is illogical. Dr. Wiesell, Lasky said in April, they can't pass it. If you get the jab, whoops, wait. Yeah, you can. You can't. So when they're still running with this. It passes, you can get it. You can still end up in the hospital. The vaccination, oh no, it's the pandemic of the unvaccinated. Yes. That's what he said a couple weeks ago. And he promised that he was going to get the booster. And he'll probably get boosters for the rest of his life, right? Well, I mean, if the CDC says you need to get your 65th booster. Yeah, he's going to get it. Go get your 65th booster, you big dummy. Because you're always the best. What are you doing? What do you do? Right. It needs all its cousins, you know, to function. Of course. Of course. So let me, so let me, as we're speaking of people that it, as we're speaking of things that don't make sense. Let's listen to Joe Biden himself because he is asked, he gets his little fauci ouchie. And then he is asked what we need to do to return to normal. And he gives a percentage that we need to be vaccinated. He claims. And I'm just going to let you guys just please be sitting and please don't throw anything at your computer or your TV because we want you to catch this program every single day. All right, watch. We have plenty, plenty of opportunity to make sure we get everyone in the world to play our part. The largest part of the world is going to be vaccinated. What is the percentage that needs to be vaccinated? Well, I think, look, I think we get the vast majority, like, is going on with some of the industries in school, 97, 98%. I think we're going to walk with folks. But I'm not the scientist. I think, but one thing for sure, the corner of the country is going to be vaccinated. So if you didn't catch that, if you hold on, hold on, if you didn't catch that because he had a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, he said, a, a, we need the vast majority to be vaccinated. Like in certain industries. I think 97 or 98%, certainly, a quarter we cannot have a quarter of people go unvaccinated. Really? What are you going to do? Yeah. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come, what are you going to do? Come make me. Please come make me. Please. Go. Call 911 before you come. Call your own ambulance. a quarter interesting number right if you look at how many vote in a presidential election and yet he come down to The quarter that's saying Holding the fort at least and saying hey, I mean kind of right rough. It's close. It's close You know so there's some sanity left in this country and it's never been you know It's never been the majority that stands up for a revolution But I'm just gonna tell you I'm gonna throw that word out here It is time to start talking about take back whatever that looks like it's time and and either We're gonna be like the politicians with no spine all talk no action And by the way for the people who watch this show some of you trolls down on the bottom that says oh you guys just talk You have no idea what we do away from this table. Okay. No idea. All right. You have no idea I challenge you to do the same. Okay, I would be so happy if you would do something those trolls, right? Maybe you need to be Moved over to CNN go to communist news network, but no, but no it is it is going Sarah we said it a thousand times with broken records until the people say enough it will not be enough. Yeah, not this is a freight train Going downhill with no conductor. Okay full steam ahead and they're gonna run this country into socialism In front of our very eyes not even behind us anymore. It's not even hoodwinking anymore It's like I'm gonna show you what I'm gonna do to you. I'm gonna steal and rob you blind Okay, and I'm gonna tell you it's for your benefit It's it's just so interesting to me you have to wonder though if maybe there are a certain amount of Biden voters Who I mean I know you know with Afghanistan and all of the oil and gas workers that had to be laid off because of his policies and and all of these things that have Happened in the last you know nine or so months since he has been president You have to wonder if even the people who were still with him Okay, we know that a large that there was a good chunk of Americans who have had this virus who have natural immunity and still he is not willing to talk about it He is not willing to bring it up natural immunity all he wants to talk about is vaccinated You have to wonder there have to be a few Biden voters who go well hold on a second I mean I'll get the vaccine if I feel like I need it But I just had the virus I shouldn't be forced to be vaccinated There's a lot of people that have virus remorse you've seen the numbers especially coming from like you know black folk And they're having among the lowest vaccination rates. I think a lot of people well He would think you know he would say that the black and brown people that can't get the IDs of course They don't know where to get these vaccinations and that's why When of course that is not the case is it something that they have made it abundantly clear that they are not for But they keep pressing the issue and of course this is starting to obviously impact people's jobs and and their livelihoods and the people See that people are very aware of that situation So, you know that number that he throws out there is just him telling you that as long as they can get away with it They will because that number is Impossible right this is not gonna happen 97 98 percent of people are not going to be vaccinated And you consider other factors like natural immunity are you kidding me? I mean my antibodies are off the chart Yeah, but but it's indicative though in order to truly move a country into radical socialism where they want it You need 90 plus percent to comply. You can't if there is a Reasonably strong resistance, right? It's just too risky. Yeah, it's just too risky And so therefore the way you hold the Forteness country is you say no because they look they can get us to the club But let's save it from falling off because there is a tipping point There is a place where they have you know mind manipulated and contorted enough where they now can go okay Just drop the hammer. Yeah, let's just go grow government insane. It's just go right and so yeah Alright, well, hopefully you're still with us your head didn't explode We've got more to come after the break first who want to think our sponsor prayer bowls So these you have got to go let me I want to tell you about prayer bowls But I want to tell you as I'm talking about them You've got to go to the website and check these out and really look at them because they are the most beautiful Bowls and they are so great because you know for those of us who pray we hear prayer requests all the time you're at church on social media through email and You know oftentimes you stop and you pray for the person at that time But then you forget you go back on with your daily routine and you don't remember Who gosh who was it that I said that I was going to pray for I want to do it again?

They've got all different kinds and designs. They've got one for you You got to go to prayer bowls calm if you order today with the offer code news You will get a set of scripture cards for free over at prayer bowls calm Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas admitted yesterday that as many as well He says as many as 12,000 Haitian migrants who recently entered the United States illegally have been released into the United States not repatriated into their home country But look I said 12,000 it actually could be more than that according to him watch of the 17,400 that weren't deported back or didn't return on their own to Mexico How many of them either? Well first how many have been released into the US? They're released on conditions and approximately I think it's about 10,000 or so 12,000 have been released yes and of the 5,000 that are still in process We will make determinations whether they will be returned to Haiti based on our public health and public interest authorities So what we talked about a total of 12,000 or could it be even higher? It could it could be even higher, you know how you knew that because he said 10,000 12,000 14 that six The two words you need to add is so far Yeah, so far and we'll be at the border here in a couple days and look what I want Mr Mayorkas to tell the American public is how many of his agents are quitting how many while you're importing illegals How many of your DHS people are quitting their jobs because you're forcing them to get what they call a vaccine right? Which is which is an experimental which by the way the patent was out in 2003 2005 2007 they just kept the clinical trial and the animals and said this is go straight to people and see how many people will die Right, but mayorkas is not talking about that or the fact that today I spoke to very high-level Official at the HAs that they can only retain the services of one out of a hundred people that are being offered jobs I mean that's not a border right who would want who would want to go work in a thankless shop where the president's gonna throw The borders closed Sarah. There's no one protecting it But the the lone Ranger on the horse who who up nobody right we better pay him 5x and ask him to stay on the horse You know because nobody is going to the border. This is a catastrophe and we see what's happening Whoa rape? Yeah crime Rampant right well you also brought up the fact that they're forcing you know border patrol all of these federal agencies to get the vaccine and I mean I hate to go back to the vaccine, but I will just to give some perspective here important these migrants He also mayorkas also admitted they are not testing them. They are not forcing the vaccines on them They are releasing them into the United States population without verification that they do not have COVID-19 So while you as an American citizen are subjected to all of these rules and regulations and you better get vaccinated by God Or we will make you The illegal immigrants are they I mean shoot leave your home walk across the border come in that way And maybe they'll finally leave you the hell alone about getting a damn vaccine Yeah, that's that was the angle that I'm gonna take I mean look I don't care where you're at on the subject of immigration You know your money is being subsidized what he's talking about or rather it's being spent when he talks about these conditions Know what the conditions are man. There's a resettlement program that exists for a reason You're you're paying for it one way or another more ways than we are. Yeah, exactly So you look at that and then Sarah brings up a great point Specifically the federal government who is of course in charge of this entire operation Elector of whatever you want to call it They have all of these rules that they are not only setting for themselves But you have now Biden trying to of course enforce this on private businesses really in the entire country And they're playing by a different set of rules So your money is being used to then pay for subsidized basically the relocation of these of these migrants And they play by a completely different set of rules That would make anybody feel like crap or rather it should Mm-hmm as I hate to you know be a downer here the reality here is that looking at it now well They're gonna get away with it. So you know it's just jacked up You know this is a screwed-up situation you can we get point out the hypocrisy all day And I'm not saying that as like a black pill moment I'm just saying this so you can acknowledge the reality so you can do some about it They're gonna get away with it. They're absolutely going to get get away with it much like they've gotten away with the whole COVID Experiement I guess which they've been largely successful and being able to Doop the populace to do whatever the hell it is they want and they can just yell squirrel while they're doing something that is blatantly Hypocritical we can point it out all day long and there's a stupid person unfortunately that gets to vote that says well I want more of that give me some more of that exactly that's a well transfer program Is what COVID is it's a well-in-a-power transfer program is what it is. It's all about the money Go look at the gains go look at the gains at the the big tech in and that the pharmaceutical company go look at the gains Brilliant right yeah, I do also want to bring up one other aspect of this which was brought to social media's attention anyway by Laura Logan which is that the drug cartels are Profiting off of all of this border patrol nonsense that the White House is coming out with so she tweeted out according to law enforcement In Rio Grande Valley Texas Border Patrol agents advised the latest intel from cartels after Biden's response to the horse patrol cartels ordered their smugglers to force border patrol to react and appear to use excessive force and record Cartels will push to media to force more agents off of the line So that when they are not there they can then do what they do which is nothing good Yeah, this is literally sending a telegraph saying hey, we're gonna attack you Monday at 2 p.m This is the weapons we use and this is our tactic So why don't you come play us and we're being played by the cartel. I'm gonna tell you today hear me today I don't have proof, but we're gonna get it the Mexican president Sit somewhere at the top of that money tree because you can't you can't as a neighbor of the US Let this happen on your side of the board left 50 miles is controlled by the cartel Okay, and it's just saying it's encouraged almost There's there's so many pipers being paid at this moment and it runs all the way up our tree and all the way up that tree Because these guys are all connected just look at the new companies that's being formed between gates and sorrows for the vaccine for the booster shot in for the For the testing companies that they now own for testing in the future You know why saw us and engaged teaming up on owning you know the new PCR testing in your facilities Come on. This is a money program Right and so shame on every American not who took the jab that buy into this rhetoric and prolong it like all The few Californians and I won't get us kicked off YouTube But the few Californians that voted for Newsome again because I don't think many did but okay The few that voted for him again shame on them to say no I want some more of that poison, please But you know what you mentioned Newsome let's let's get into To the latest one of the latest laws that he signed after the break first I want to thank our sponsor built bar which I still have so anytime you get a chance to try a built puff You must do so if you have ordered from built bar before you're lucky because you are on their email list Which means you are going to get updates whenever they bring out a new flavor So they have the puffs and then they sell out because people buy them like crazy because they're amazing And then they'll restock them and they'll send out an email and say hey you got to get these built puffs Trust me when I tell you you have to get the built puffs. They're so delicious, but the regular bars are awesome too They've got cookie dough. They've got coconut mint brownie Double chocolate salted caramel and if you're having trouble picking you can get a mixbox You can get two of each of their regular flavors Decide which one you like the best and then load up your pantry with them. All right, built bar is it's a it's a protein bar So it's healthy. It's gonna have high protein, but it's going to be low calorie 180 calories or less low sugar Low carb and you're gonna feel like you're cheating on your diet, but you're not all right You got to go to built calm use promo code news 15 to save 15% off of your order over at BUILT built calm So Gavin Newsom yaku brought up Gavin Newsom and the state of California Well, maybe you are thinking eat look Gavin Newsom got reelected, but or didn't get recalled, but Maybe this whole process has made the Democrats rethink their crazy positions Not so apparently Newsom just signed a bill it is AB 1184 which will keep patient information confidential for patients who are not the primary policy holder for their health insurance Which means that this includes reproductive reproductive health care so abortion care baby killing care So this includes baby killing care and gender affirming care which means that children who want to get sex changes who want to get abortions and Use their parents health insurance for whatever they can actually use their health insurance for Maybe able to do it without you knowing about it because you know what? What say should you have in your own children being raised the government knows better? The government is gonna do what the government does, but looking at California It's almost like where the country is heading but accelerated it's like it gets tests everything That's the test up. Yeah, it's like all those guys over there are the little little subjects here And then we see it kind of or attempting to be applied at a more national scale But every day we seem to get a story and it seems like they want their help in on running get into the ground And I say unfortunately let them I mean we have a lot of people that are behind enemy lies that have attempted to Do everything they can to liberate that damn country or state? Excuse me Which should be a But they have been rather unsuccessful because I think the loony people just it's just too many of them They're just some really out number which is why I said I never Say someone must run But if you want to relocate to live a fight another day if you live in in California I can't say I blame you there are a lot of alternatives certainly To that but this is insane You know what I mean in the in the way that we're kind of moving the conversation with Like they lack thereof They don't even like the term parental rights or anything like that because damn be if you want to make a decision That's your job as a parent Certainly you can't do that or if you're I don't know Five-year-old thinks they are this a boy But they think they're a girl that you're a bigot or or being some hopeful fault But something because you say no, you know, you're not and we're not gonna I don't know cut stuff off in order to try to affirm if that be the case It's crazy and it keeps continuing to get crazier. So I say let them do it now They're way they're able to get away with a lot of this because unfortunately a lot of people that are still there that Value-liberty are subsidizing those bad ideas But I think that's one of the states that of all maybe top dog on the list of states That's just it's a fail state and I think we have to let it get ran into the ground I think that's the only way these people let me they won't even learn by then But at some point why would you subsidize your own suffering? But I also can say that about states not California's will to be fair. Yeah, look now. I agree with you in that sense the only problem is We're a country of precedent now. We've lost law and order, right? So we know even the Supreme Court They're not upholding the law. They're not defending the Constitution They pick and choose winners or losers what cases all precedent and the problem with Newsom and Newsom's ties And I'm gonna jump on a Soros wagon again He's ties with all these guys is all things evil to children all things evil to life in the womb outside the womb children Right and true women's rights. This guy is the guinea pig for he's the guy who raises his hand He's the guy who signed State Bill 145 that changed what's called sexual agency with the parent loses Agency and that's the term today. They want parents to lose agency Over the child now. He's writing a law here or passing a bill that says look if the child gets medical care the primary You know policy older shouldn't even know and it's in line. He's done this before Three-year-old can get puberty blockers and the parent can't do anything because plan parent Who it will step in and do this or or la children's hospital? So you're gonna see more of this in this guy. I told you a couple weeks ago is now gonna be so bold Because he thinks he's king of the castle. He must be loved. He must be like the narcissist side of him is coming out going I can't do anything wrong I can just drop the hammer and I agree with you let him burn into the ground the problem is you got all these other minion governors some in The red states, okay, who's sitting going? He's new some gonna get it through Man, that's a way to get some willing people and then they suck it into the red states And we're seeing this kind of crap when he passed 145 it was two weeks and it was in Austin It was two weeks and it was in Austin, Texas Right? So from that perspective, it's really bad for the country because the other politicians based on precedent on Standing for the people they just go. Oh, okay. He got away with it. So yeah, we're not gonna fight hard It'll buy me some will for my office for my job You know for my future as a politician and that's where I have a problem with otherwise I say throw some fins there It's built another wall feel a different wall But that's between California and Arizona that speaks to the point of why the importance of like these decentralization efforts You know what I mean because yes of exactly that like even so the fact that there are institutions or individuals or even groups of individuals to be fair that can Pass such a thing is insane in the first place like I said Yeah, look I know there's a lot of people watch this show they scraped 1776 and all of this sort of stuff and I Sounds really good, but your founders went to war for a lot less than whatever the hell is going on Right now. I mean that we long crossed that bridge man. We're in another another stratosphere Right now. They went to war for a lot less, but they do a lot of crazy stuff And you're right we know that you know because it's a testing ground people adopted they see it get passed somewhere else They're like okay. Well, we can we can make sure certainly that it happens I think New York City is kind of like that as well where it's in boldens a lot of these areas But that's the point you know when I scream about decentralization I'm looking at instances exactly like this as to why these institutions or organizations or Whether it be the alphabet federal government agencies that are that powerful Congress folk in Washington DC completely out of the loop why they can rule over us Fundamental problem.
