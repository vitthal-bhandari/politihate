    "text": " Everything is expensive these days. You know that. The government is printing trillions of dollars in consumer prices higher than ever. If the government continues its printing and spending, the dollar could continue its free fall and lose its coveted role as the world reserve currency. Let's hope that doesn't happen. But there are a few things you can do right now. American Hartford Gold can show you how to protect your money, your retirement, your hard-earned savings against inflation by helping you diversify a portion of your portfolio into physical gold and silver. Start with a short phone call and they can have physical gold and silver delivered right to your door or put inside your 401k or IRA. So please call or text them right now. Tell them below Riley sent you. Call 877-444-GOLD. 877-444-GOLD or text gold to 65532. Again, that's 877-444-GOLD or text gold to 65532. Hello Riley here. You are listening to the O'Reilly update coming up next the news with Mike Slater. Thank you, Bill. March 16, 2023, you're listening to the O'Reilly update. Here's what's happening today in America. Team Trump files an ethics complaint against Ron DeSantis. Students, at an all-girls college vote to admit transgender men will talk about this more at the end of the O'Reilly update, garbage piles up on the streets of Petty and economists rank the highest taxed cities in America. Also coming up, the message of the day about gravitas. But first, a pro-Trump super PAC called Make America Great Again Inc. filed an ethics complaint against Ron DeSantis. The group claims the governor is conducting a so-called shadow presidential campaign. The super PAC says, quote, the Make America Great Again movement was birthed to stop career politicians who use public service to amass personal wealth and power. An investigation by the Florida Ethics Commission must occur as soon as possible to Santas' toying around on a book tour. Students at Wellesley College in Massachusetts have voted to admit applications from non-binary and transgender students. Men, men, they're now the women's college is now admitting men. But you have the potential woman, your man who was pretending to be one. The school was founded back in 1870 when few women were able to apply to any university. Famous alumni include Madeleine Albright, Diane Sawyer, and Hillary Clinton. Again, we'll talk more about that coming up in just a minute. Giant mounds of garbage littering the streets of Paris as sanitation workers continue their strike. France has been crippled for weeks now by union protests all over the country. The government there is facing a huge national uproar after politicians voted to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Most of Europe is higher than that. England is 66. While it's officially tax season Forbes magazine ranking the highest tax towns in the country. Number one in 2023 was a tie between Los Angeles and San Francisco, California. Each city spends $1.5 billion on payroll alone. Folks there making $100,000 give half their salary to the government. The lowest taxed city in America is Anchorage, Alaska. People up north take home 80% of their income. I'm Mike Sider for the podcast of politics by faith coming up next. The O'Reilly update message of the day. What will it take for us to once again become a serious people? I'll explain next. Hey Mike Sider, Phil and Prabillo Riley. It's time for the O'Reilly update message of the day. When a people are going through a difficult time, it requires the best within each of us to rise to the top. And it requires the best of all of us to rise into leadership roles. That's when times are tough. But when times are prosperous, especially for a long period of time, silly people rise to the top. On the morning update, this morning we talked about men who lack gravitas. It's just silly season, silly time. Men who tour train wreckage sites in loafers, for instance. But this is where you end up when things are too good for too long. You get transportation secretaries who are in charge because their husbands propose to them at the airport and bank executives starring in comedy sketch musical parody videos right before they collapse. And you have Netflix shows for preschoolers with transgender cows, lecturing kids about pronouns and Drew Barrymore on her knees in front of a 26 year old man who's pretending to be a 12 year old girl praising him for his courage. We live in a silly time. Have you noticed? And this is what prosperity brings. When times are prosperous, a lot of unqualified people end up running things. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. Think about it. You know, your climbing and nothing, don't be adds to it anymore. Let's finding it. First place, we live through heaven. The right place. has a great quote that a man should be judged by the degree that those under his purview are thriving. The king inspires creativity in others. You know someone is a good confident man when he promotes other men into prominent places just to see them thrive. He gets delight in seeing other people succeed. We need more men like this, but so many men like this have been either sidelined or neutered. This is why there's so much chaos on college campuses. There's no real men running the show. Like a university needs a real leader to say, Hey, knock it off. Let the man speak. And if you keep disrupting, we're kicking you out of school. You're not following the rules. Knock it off. When you don't have that, it just leads to more chaos because the opposite of the king is the tyrant or the weakling. And we see a lot of those. This is an old idea. This is not an original thought. Machiavelli said this in the year 1500. He said, because excellent men in corrupt republics, especially in tranquil times are considered enemies, whether out of envy or ambition. The people follow either a man who's judged to be good by common self deception or someone who's put forward by men who are more likely to desire special favors than the common good. So you end up lifting up arrogant, corrupt and ambitious men instead of the good men. But Machiavelli says in adverse times in tough times, this deception is revealed. And out of necessity, the people turned to those who in tranquil times were almost forgot. So don't get discouraged. The bad times will come. And to that, I say good. It's about time we separate the wheat from the chaff. Most people won't be ready for the truly tough times, but we will. An excellent men will be valued once again. More coming up. For something you might not know, Wellesley College, a private woman's college outside of Boston is now accepting men. Well, not not all men, just men who think they're women. Man, what a brilliant move by the patriarchy, just a work of art. You know, the patriarchy first convinced the women's rights movement to support abortion. I mean, that that feat alone is remarkable. The perverted men of the patriarchy wanted to have sex without consequence in the sixties, but there was this pesky thing called pregnancy that happened from time to time. So the men got together and said, Hey, let's convince women to support abortion. And then we can have sex with them whenever we want without any consequence. And the other men said, no, they'll never go for that. What are you crazy? Women would never support such a thing. And other men said, no, no, there's a tell them it's their right. And it worked. It's amazing. But the patriarchy didn't stop there. The patriarchy has always been against women's sports. Why do women need to be playing sports? They need to be in the kitchen where they belong. But that didn't stop them. They had the wrong strategy took a while for the patriarchy to figure out that the way to destroy women's sports was to have men playing them. And dressed up as girls and women, sure. But I mean, what's a little makeup to advance the cause of the patriarchy? You got to take one for the team and enough men have. And still, it's never enough for the patriarchy. Men looked at women only colleges. Said women only colleges. We can't let this stand. So they took a university that was founded in 1870 solely for the purpose of, as the founder said, to prepare women for great conflicts and for vast reforms in social life. They took that college and said, we must force them to accept men. And the women of Wellesley said, no, but the patriarchy said yes. And the patriarchy got them to do it. It's unbelievable. Just see Drew Barrymore. The other day, she invited a 26 year old man who's pretending to be a 12 year old girl onto a show. And Drew Barrymore fell to her knees, praising him for his courage. Unbelievable. Well done. Member of the patriarchy. All it took was wearing a skirt, but that's okay. Because the men won in the end. But an honor it is to be part of the patriarchy. Women had a nice run there for a while, you know, thinking they could do things on their own and have their own bathrooms. Ha, get back to where you belong. It's a man's world after all.
