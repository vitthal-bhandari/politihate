    "text": " Good morning and welcome to rising. We're so glad to have you here with us this morning once again. And we have a really interesting show. Why don't you tell him about it Brianna? Well we've got some new developments and changes to Twitter's content moderation policy. The Twitter account at Elon Jet was suspended yesterday. College student Jack Sweeney founded the account in 2020 and kept tabs on Elon Musk's private jet. Sweeney shared the public air travel data on Twitter for years. Twitter reinstated the account Wednesday night but it restricted Sweeney from posting the locations of Musk and other public figures planes in real time. As for Sweeney's personal account that was perma banned after Musk threatened legal action. This despite the fact that earlier last month's self-dubbed chief, Twitter and defender of free speech, Elon Musk took to Twitter writing quote, my commitment to free speech extends to even the account following my plane even though that is direct personal safety risk. Musk justified his change of heart by claiming a car carrying their child was followed last night. That was an interesting tweet that involved Little Nausex. Yeah there was a tweet about a car. You know I just call it Little X. Maybe that's one of his own kids names. That is actually possible. The difficult to say he was even asked in an interview once to pronounce it and he seemed to not be entirely all there. I think that's what he meant by the lyrics. So his kids were in a car that were being followed which is a genuinely scary circumstance to be in and that I have a lot of empathy for. However from my perspective it seems to have little to nothing to do with flight records. So one funny quirk of this is that when Musk tweeted out that real-time posting of someone else's location violates doxing policy it was kind of fact-checked by the kind of Twitter notes function and it pointed out that publishing flight records is protected under the first amendment. This is long-standing. You know this person posts a lot of people's flight records. He's a fan of Elon Musk. Elon Musk once tried to get him to pull down the account by offering $500 and the guy was like well I really just want to meet you and like write on your plane. I think he like said you can live around on your plane or give me $50,000 and this could all be over and Musk chose not to do it so here we are. So then he ended up buying all of Twitter in order to deal with it. Yeah so so a couple things. One community notes is great. This is the program that was formerly Birdwatch. I've talked about it a lot. It's fantastic. People get fact-checked all the time. It's all over the place because it allows users do it. So it doesn't reflect the bias of content moderators because anyone can do it. It's more like it's community-derived fact-checking like Wikipedia. So that is great and Elon has been all for it. He's been totally supportive of it. It's so much better than what Facebook does with fact-checking. The other thing is like okay I don't think an account that gives like a rough approximation of where your plane is is really threatening your physical safety and then even so even if you're giving more specific information like Elon is standing at the corner of 17th and K. I'm just docked where her location is and her location is propped into my head. I don't know that this is threatening. I might say that right. I might be walking through square in DC and say oh I just saw Senator whoever. I just I like I've seen Senator Amy Klobuchar on the street. There was a city by Sweetie. I've seen Matt Gates. There was a city viral tweet yesterday where someone saw a picture of Rudy Giuliani and in a fit in an outfit that didn't love and posted it on Twitter. Everyone could see in that moment that Rudy Giuliani was standing on this corner in Midtown and what constitutes docked saying has been of some dispute. A lot of folks that are kind of in the Elon Musk's camp have said that the claims that folks are being docked so plans that a lot of regret left left leading folks are being docked are exaggerated. That there's too much ratcheting up of language around violence and threat when it comes to trans activists or some of these drag shows and things like that where there have been a lot of protests recently but on the Phillips side it seems that there's a lot of concern about threat when it comes to Elon Musk. So I saw somebody tweeting something along the lines of we care about docked saying and protecting people from physical violence when you're a billionaire owner of Twitter but not when you're an average citizen. I mean I do think sharing your address or your private phone number or those I think those things are certainly docked saying if there was an account that was like tweeting out like what his address is or something I would probably think that would be disabled. I think that that probably is true too. Now we should also point out that Twitter is also blocking links to the Elon Musk jet Instagram account so he has the same setup on I think Instagram and Facebook other social media platforms so if you try if you're if you're not this guy but you try to post links to it and other services that's also being blocked because it is quote potentially harmful under the policy. Do you see this as inconsistent with some of the remarks that Elon Musk has made before including that he quite explicitly would not block this account? Well this also shows that as a reminder you know social media companies don't have to operate under the exact same free speech norms as the First Amendment prescribes for the public square and that that is occasionally beneficial because in the public square if you were just on public property or something and you share and you you know wrote down on sidewalk shock or something what Elon Musk's address is I don't think you can be arrested for that. So it's better that Twitter can it's it's not necessarily wrong that Twitter can make as a private entity can make speech related decisions not. The question though Robbie is whether or not Elon Musk is being inconsistent with both his own stated goals for Twitter about being a free speech spaces is much more closely aligned with what the offline free speech standards are as set by the courts. Yes I think he like all of the people that preceded him and probably all the people that will will follow him in terms of content moderation are certainly being inconsistent. But that's I don't think that's necessarily fair because Elon Musk made claims about why he was buying Twitter and what Twitter would become that are not the claims that everybody else has made. Twitter he bought Twitter precisely because he had criticisms of how it was run under previous ownership. So other people weren't sitting around saying if Twitter is going to be a free speech zone we're bringing comedy back to Twitter I'm not going to block people even if they harass me I'm going to open it up that was Elon Musk's claim and it does seem to be really interesting a lot of people are skeptical about the rationale that's being brought up here to say my kids were threatened so in a car by the way which I think is legitimate but because of that I'm going to check down this account that has nothing to do with- I don't agree with that I think the previous owners did of these other prior to Musk I remember Dorsey saying the Twitter was should be viewed as the free speech wing of the free speech party Zuckerberg has said Facebook is a free speech site. How can you how can you say that there isn't a market difference a market turn in trajectory for Elon Musk when that is a stated his whole stated purpose of buying Twitter is to do something differently than the people had done before right he obviously has a category of his own Jack didn't say I'm never going to he didn't make a whole personality out of I'm never going to ban the guy that's tracking my plane Elon Musk has explicitly said I'm never going to ban the guy who's tracking my plane and within a month of owning the site has banned the guy that's tracking his plane and again using this excuse of his children I think a lot of people are seeing this as another instance of him doing what he did with the Alex Jones banning which also seemed to be inconsistent were you saying because I have experienced something personally which legitimately is a tragedy and hard and the loss of his own his own child it's it's horrible but I I'm able to put have empathy for myself and make policy based on what makes me comfortable but when it comes to the same things other people are experiencing other folks whether they be trans or or you know black or whatever it is on the site who have experienced different kind of targeted harassment it's it's a completely different policy and people are objecting to the idea that it's again elite power concentrated to benefit an elite person the murder you know what used to be the richest person in the world instead of trying to promulgate policies that actually expand free speech and protect people who are genuinely vulnerable yeah I think it is inconsistent but it's a taste of their own medicine for people who had so it's a revenge politics now that's basically what it is okay so I I think that the people a lot of people who are watching are sincerely invested in the kind of free speech principles that Elon Musk articulated when he bought this app and I am one of those people I really hope for the best I think that a lot of these disclosures that we've got in the Twitter files are meaningful and I hope something comes out of them I'm really interested to hear more about who specifically was shadow banned I'm interested to hear more about how these decisions got made I think some of the disclosures about how the decision around banning Trump what were made that where there was an admission that he didn't actually violate company policy that's huge that's big news I think that's a good thing for him to be doing but when he does stuff like this where he's clearly just putting himself before the principles that got him so much so many fans and so much support in the first place I think that he's really hurting his own personal brand but if the previous regimes had lived up to their own promises and commitments on this exact same thing on free speech he never would have had the interest to buy it in the first place he'd never seen something to correct but they didn't they didn't they didn't have those same values you know I disagree with them I have I've been criticizing Twitter law before Elon Musk was a thought of my brain but the fact is that we're talking about Elon Musk here and they can't deflect everybody else's responsibility those other people are not Twitter anymore so what is Elon Musk gonna do is Elon Musk going to have to live down the fact that he flagrantly over and over again now is undermining his own commitments to the people who love him and we're looking forward to making some positive changes on the app so we'll see how the public continues to respond to this I think a lot of folks are seeing this as a hypocritical move and we'll see if it gets reversed there's a lot of holding him accountable being done in the mainstream media for the inconsistencies in the policies he outlines I agree with that we were missing some of that previously I think sure sure all right I'm looking forward to your radar coming up next Brianna what's on your radar Brianna well Sam Bankman freed the infamous three named fiend who was recently indicted by the DOJ SEC and CFTC on eight counts including wire fraud charges was arrested on Tuesday a day before he was scheduled to testify before Congress about the eight billion dollar collapse of his crypto exchange FTX now we've talked a great deal about the cause of the collapse and the bizarness of SBS behavior both before and after the FTX collapse the sleeping in a bean bag in the office dressing like a college freshman on laundry day and doing innumerable ill-advised media appearances apparently with the blessing if there's two Stanford law professor parents maybe this is why they advise doctors not to operate on family members it seems that good judgment might not be able to overcome a parent's rose colored glasses but beyond the wire fraud charges that take up most of the indictment SBS has also been charged with violating campaign finance laws a charge that recalls the reporting we've done about SBS prolific donations to the democratic and republican parties here's to such attorney Damien Williams explaining the campaign finance charge at a press conference earlier this week we charge that bankman freed violated federal campaign finance laws by causing tens of millions of dollars in illegal campaign contributions to be made to candidates and committees associated with both democrats and republicans these contributions were disguised to look like they were coming from wealthy co-conspirators when in fact the contributions were funded by alameda research with stolen customer money in all of this dirty money was used in service of bankman freed's desire to buy bipartisan influence and impact the direction of public policy in washington now given how many people are touched by SBS donations from maxine waters to mitch mcconnell everyone wants to know did SBS fraud philanthropic endeavors and if so which elected officials are going to have some split into do once they've been identified as a beneficiary of SBS fraud congress' youngest member jinzir maxwell frost has already gotten ahead of the story tweeting i never solicited a donation from SBS but he did donate to my campaign we are an operation that rejects corporate pack money we also reject stolen money going on to tweet that he will be donating SBS contribution to an lgbt charity but what about the other recipients of the 40 million dollars SBS donated to this political cycle alone shantell brown centrist antagonist who needed turners to congressional runs and ohio's uh 11th district received one million dollars from SBS uh mitch mcconnell super pack also received one million dollars just weeks before ftx declared bankruptcy president biden received five million dollars from the dethron crypto king while two packs that fund house republicans received nearly a million dollars combined according to fbc filings what are the implications for recipients of these funds theater schleifer over at puk recently interviewed sbf shortly before his arrest in fact and published me been reporting digging into what the s d and y prosecutors might specifically allege beyond the relatively vague charges in the complaint one theory involves something known as straw donations which are donations made in the name of someone else in order to avoid contribution limits established by campaign finance laws or to hide the identity of the donor remember although there's been a heavy emphasis on SBS prolific donations to the democratic party sbf has been clear that he gave to republicans an equal measure via dark money donations listen to this interview with tiffany fong they donated about the thing about post-party security that was not generally known because this way citizens united being literally the highest profile supreme court case of the decade and the thing everyone talked about when they talked about campaign finance for some reason e-practice no one can possibly fathom the idea that someone e-practice dar so i don't all my republican donations were dark superlumpian um and the reason was not for a regulatory reason these kids reported to freak out if you donate to a republican chiral people liberal and didn't want to have that fight so i made all the republican want dark um but but that's the nearest or biggest republican donors here as well well to all for the primary thank you anything dar watch he's done give us a general option so it's all that is like it's a primary for the where you can't be inside can we so sbf hid his republican donations for optics reasons knowing that the goodwill he was buying from the liberal media with his effective altruism shtick would be lost if he was exposed as donating to republicans but of course he was donating to republicans because in his own words and this is what big many dentures do give to both sides to ensure their agenda gets passed no matter who wins their agenda always wins not yours of course thanks to citizens united sbf's uh companies could give unlimited amounts to disclosed super PACs and undisclosed dark many groups so according to speculation reported by schleifer the charges are more likely to be related to donations to campaigns and party committees meaning principles not just super PACs may be implicated another theory reported in puck is that sbf affiliates like executive ryan slamae who donated twenty four million dollars to gop candidates the cycle we're basically giving away alameda money that alameda was a direct donor hiding behind other names another theory is that ftx donors might have been immediately reimbursed by the business which would violate the straw donor ban as well you you see why this is you're you're not allowed to expense a political donation as an in run around the three thousand dollar federal contribution limits schleifer says this theory might explain why some not that rich individuals cut an unusually large number of political checks in recent years now we should check out schleifers reporting for a full rundown of all the possible insider theories as to who might be implicated in the campaign finance violation charge note that district the district attorney who led the press conference this week denied claims at the timing of the arrest had anything to do with preventing sbf from having to testify at yesterday's hearing in front of donation recipient maxine waters but that doesn't mean that maxine waters doesn't have a dog in this fight she chairs the financial services committee a powerful and much sought after committee position in part because of the enormous sums of fundraising dollars that can be raised by committee members from the financial industry sbf gave over three hundred thousand dollars to nine financial services committee members last year waters gave a statement at a subcommittee on oversight and investigations and when she said the financial services committee had quote begun a thorough examination of the marketplace how much confidence did you have in that given the sbf money flowing through the committees it doesn't exactly inspire a lot of confidence for me and a regulatory regime that would protect consumers nor does it make me optimistic about waters chances of coming out of this unscathed one final important point to mention is that none of this would have happened if we as a public had done more to address the pernicious influence of dark money and american politics i mean remember how glibly sbf talked about his ability to ability to exploit dark money donations and the clip i played of his interview with tiffany fong he said quote despite citizens united being literally the highest profile supreme court case of the decade and the thing everyone talks about with campaign finance for some reason and practice no one can possibly fathom the idea that someone actually gave dark good point sam why is that and why are democrats and republicans doing something about it republicans have spent the last few weeks emphasizing as connection with the democratic party but have they proposed any campaign finance reform laws that would prevent the kind of influence seeking sbf was engaged in and do they have anything to say about the conservative supreme court justices that opened the door to this kind of dark money overage to begin with rodell and democrat sheldon white house repeatedly introduces a campaign finance bill called the disclose act to no avail and most recently failed to pass the senate's 60 vote filibuster a threshold in september ending in a 49-49 vote democrat tami boldwin and republican mike krapper were both absent whatever happened to the bipartisan push for campaign finance reform exemplified by john mccain and rush fine gold's push back on the early aught when back when glint was holding coffee clutches for likely donors and rewarding high rollers with sleepovers in the malincoln bedroom and why in this moment our progressive elected not using the collapse of ftx as an opening to advance this all-important cause one i might add which continues to enjoy bipartisan support lobbying dollars hit record highs this year particularly in the health care sector and yes finance in real estate there's any question why you can't afford to be sick pay your mortgage or own a home in the first place here's your answer now liberals will tell you we can't have nice things because republicans or because we need some mckenzie elite like buddha judge to figure out some technocratic solution to why you don't have enough money and too many conservatives will tell you there's no solution at all just you know pull at your bootstraps harder but what if we know how to fix many of our country's problems and big money interests are simply in the way the biggest story in the country is that some 30 year old nepotism case has stolen billions of dollars and used it to try to buy a favorable regulatory regime so he can keep stealing while the government that's supposed to enforce the law looks the other way in still we see little to no legislative solutions being offered in this moment the lever recently reported on how crypto bros are even trying to get into the 401k game remember what happened when the housing market crashed pensions are we only seeing the tip of where this unholy union between corporations and government can take us i think yes but without pressure from the public for real reform it's unlikely will uh sorry it's likely rather that will feel more acute real pain soon enough when will a bipartisan populist majority finally start complaining about this the important stuff it's easy to get really discouraged when you see how in bed the regulators and the politicians and then the industries they're supposed to be overseeing are financial how financially entangled they are it makes you really what hope could there possibly be it's it's disgusting i mean look it's not as though solutions aren't being offered up but they just somehow aren't able to pass the people who benefit from the system being at the way it is managed somehow not to ever be able to get this legislation through congress and it reminds me of a conversation we're having yesterday about kevin dillon and the lack of accountability in california after that leaked tape and you know a lot of public pressure for him to resign both from other politicians and from the public and how there's really nothing you can do about it when we kind of handed so much power over to these individuals without putting some accountability mechanisms in place and when the democratic process isn't working as opposed to so that people can actually vote these people out no one is gonna vote maxing waters out in her district because of some scandal over this and no one is going to vote out any number of politicians on both sides of the aisle because they had failed to do anything about our corporate money in congress capture problem right yeah it's a it's a big issue and the stakes have become very high for a lot of these industries for you know financial interest so they have a incredible incentive to spend tons and tons and tons of money to rig the system in their favorite individual firms have that incentive to rig it against competitors and it's always it's difficult to you know regulate thoughtfully in a way that doesn't all that doesn't just entrench people already at the top especially with an emerging industry like this but it is it has been very interesting to see how many political people were uh were paid off by i mean not paid all unwittingly in some sense but that makes a difference yes um and it was like he was going to shepherd through sbf was his ideal regulation of this space there's no way that wasn't going to benefit him money talks it's why people give money it's not altruistic there's no such thing and we've learned nothing else from this escapade it's that effective altruism is a roose it's for a line but buying political uh influence and i hope that people see that it's not about being a good person or a bad person this is how our system is designed to operate and if we want what people the the desires of the people to more accurately map on to what congress is actually doing then we're going to have to get to the bottom of this problem all right well we'll have more rising right after this stay with us the official portrait of house speaker nancy polosi was unveiled in statuary hall in the u.s. capital last night it will stand next to the collection of portraits in the speaker's lobby former republican speaker john vayner became emotional while speaking at the reveal let's take a listen to that i'm out of speaker i have to say my girls told me tell this speaker how much we admire her so senate majority leader also expressed his thoughts on polosi's career and legacy 20 years she kept saying the same thing our unity is our strength she kept saying it and saying it and saying it and the results speak for themselves we cannot talk about the affordable care act without mentioning nancy polosi we cannot talk about the american rescue plan without mentioning nancy polosi we cannot talk about the infrastructure law the violence against women act the lily led better act repealing don't ask don't tell and so much more without mentioning nancy delisandre polosi she did it all what do you make of uh john bainer getting choked up there would do expect that kind of display of emotion from someone who's kind of cast themselves as a political antagonist i think we do expect that from john bainer specifically because isn't he known for his um emotional his he's a man who's willing to cry right over nancy polosi no just in general it wasn't there isn't john bainer's tears the whole thing oh dear i might have missed that meme uh but look it is a thing yeah yeah he cries he cries all the time all yes here's a roll call article all the times john bainer cried why oh here's a political article from 2013 why does john bainer cry so much okay look i'm not trying to do a toxic masculinity here and yeah how do you shame a man who who is not afraid to be vulnerable in front of you vriana look my issue is not with the fact that crying why is she oftentimes in these situations you know bipartisanship we have the tissues here just in case just in case justified your direction ravi because again this is a safe space for me to cry but look my my concern is always like i'm always uncomfortable with the closeness that people demonstrate in some of these situations because i don't know if this is fair and it's not that i'm against bipartisanship obviously but sometimes the stakes of the things that we're fighting for are extremely high and the camaraderie between people i think is only the kind of camaraderie that could exist if the stakes are not personal for you and i've observed this i spoke to someone who was not a lawyer who was in the middle of a case and they watched how the fair council and opposing council chit chatted and got together and we're talking about how they went to law school together and all the stuff and she was like well we're litigating a very serious issue for me we're litigating some of that's deeply personal and this camaraderie feels like how can you possibly bring the fight that i want you to bring an advocacy for me if there is this chumminess and some people thought that way about um scalia and rbg and it does it gives me kind of there's a big club and you're not in it george carlin vibes yeah i am pulled in multiple directions on this because i like the idea on some level of people being able to get along even if they have political differences and like look at us oh oh we really do we didn't have to put the tinsers no we yeah we headlined an event the other day it was uh it was fun um so i you know when like oh ellen de jennress and george bush like that you know people yelled about that because yeah george bush did a lot of things that are very bad and that's putting mildly but i i am drawn to the idea of people like that getting along and being able to be friends even if they disagree but on the other side of that exactly what you said is true yes then it shows that there aren't actually these vast differences between our powerful elites who run our government and have nominal rd next to their name but and have you know we'll we'll are we'll scream at each other while the cameras are rolling get their little sound bite in and then go have dinner together and go get drinks together and and yeah appear at each other's children's weddings and various things and there's not you know hillerick clinton and darlant rumbadolotron's wedding i mean i think there's a difference between bernie sanders hooking up with josh holly and doing whatever they're going to do together substantively but you don't see bernie sanders and josh holly on the golf course you know eating shrimp cocktails together at some restaurant some steakhouse in dc but that and there's a difference there and i think that sometimes the appearance of conviviality is privileged over people actually coming together over the issues that that should really matter yeah but maybe we should talk about the the portrait itself uh what what do you make of it it seems like a polosi from an earlier era with a shorter haircut at an at an earlier time how does it stack up against some of the other famous looks fine to me i i think portraits though lv the i did not like the obama portrait so the michelle obama one in particular was not great right there's a little stiff i think that at this point we're allowed to say it i did feel like it was a little stiff the grayscale that they put her in i don't think was especially uh flattering no this was this was a good picture i'm just i did pull up the list of other times john bainer has tried this is pretty hilarious bainer has gotten misty-eyed during a tribute to golf legend Arnold Palmer while listening to irish music on st patrick's day the arnold pomer of drink fame of cocktail fame is also a famous uh golf break now i get it golf golf is like the one sport i have any sort of knowledge about i do watch golf and now you know i we haven't been covering the world cup and while singing america the beautiful and then he also cried when he replaced nancy plosie as speaker in 2010 and uh and uh yeah he he said uh he blubbered i think coherently for for a long time justin amash um who uh was a we've talked about on the show is a former libertarian um member of congress was a republican prior to being that left the republican party over frustration with everything um voted against john bainer for speaker because he thought he was a big spending kind of sellout republican or something and said john bainer was by far the best speaker he ever worked with he really liked the guy could not stand said thought paul ryan was insincere in his co wall while sounding committed to amash's principles was totally insincere and uh and double dealing and so there's something to be you can be effective by being affable being affable is not it can be you know of its own thing a good like ted cruz nobody likes right like i think what lindsay gram said he could be murdered on the senate floor and no one would no jury would convict yeah i mean and i will say a criticism of birdie is that you know there's that famous near times interview where he says i'm not gonna call you on your birthday and there's a there's a there's a moment where i think that he might have gotten a little farther not by greasing palms like what everyone else does but just shaking some hands and and birdie always seems i mean i don't know him nearly as well as you do so you can tell me my impression is wrong i he seems very serious he seems very like he doesn't he doesn't take a break from the from the the really against the millionaires and focus on the things that he's focused on not saying that's a bad thing people say that the only difference between offstage bernie and on stage bernie is uh the use of colorful language and that's it the topic so changed just a little the flare change is a little interesting all right well we made it through this segment without any tears on either our part so we should wrap before uh before this gets out of hand indeed more rising right after this former michigan congressman juson emmash and infamously defected from the republican party in 2020 to join the libertarian party becoming the first and only libertarian member of congress on wednesday's episode of new york times journalist jane costen's podcast the argument he talked about how his love of liberty propelled him to make the jump emmash is no longer in congress but he hasn't stopped trying to grow the libertarian party and he further makes the case for why others should follow suit here's a little bit from him on that podcast episode let's listen people in the united states can succeed without all of these connections to government and special handouts and special favors and so for me that was sort of a libertarian ethos and when i joined politics i thought i could move the republican party in a more libertarian direction and i tried so many different ways to do that i tried by working nicely with some of the people in the establishment i started the house freedom caucus but ultimately i failed to change things and that was very difficult for me to just say hey i'm giving up on this and i need to try something different so jane says in this conversation that she identified as a libertarian she now identifies as an independent i think because she has some pretty serious issues with the latest iteration of the libertarian party and emmash has some of his differences as well this is this is robbie insider baseball now help us understand what is the at the heart of the divide within the libertarian party so the libertarian party has gone through a lot of iterations over the years um the candidate in 2016 and 2012 was gary johnson the former republican governor of new mexico um gary was not a great communicator uh he he was famously if you remember the what is a lepo moment yeah which that one honestly with the way that question was asked was pretty unfair it was unprompted unconnected anything yeah someone asked him what should be done about a lepo like it wasn't in context of a larger yeah it was kind of unfair to him but he had plenty of other um just kind of weird communications choices that and then he picked for his lieutenant governor uh bill well the former governor of massachusetts uh kind of never trump republican vibes where it was the ticket's vibes they were not so that was the the vibe it was not a very libertarian vibe it was kind of a republican turning liberal vibe rhino vibes yes and then in the 2016 race when they had this great opportunity because you know they're up against two of the most reviled main major party candidates of all times bill welled really came close to just endorsing hillary over their own ticket which was seen as a stunning betrayal so i agree with it the people who then took over the libertarian party out of anger for what these candidates did i 100% agree i i share their frustration the ticket in the middle was a woman named joe jorgensen and her vice president spicohan i find them great they're not well-known people they don't come from politics so that was a defect they have but i find them to be completely libertarian and i i share their views like almost 100% i don't quite understand but the people were like taking over in the midst of this kind of don't necessarily get along with them and that that's harder to understand exactly why so the new regime is as people who are i think at least perceived to be more friendly not to republicans writ large but to very um to to a kind of uh new right trumpy kind of it's very radical on foreign policy and covid and some other things in ways that i would agree with and actually you would on the foreign policy stuff you would definitely agree with but is pretty um is i think off-putting in some way or in their messaging has been very um kind of podcast energy or very very um very contrary to very provocative sir doesn't everyone love podcast or gee it's i think it's harsh i think it's uh i think it's off-putting to normies it would be my criticism of it it's very online it's very the party is very online now so when jane cozen says you know this the title of this um you know the the article and episode of her podcast the libertarian party became too extreme for me so i changed my political allegiance what is the kind of extremity that you think she's responding to so there was a lot of um there there are debates in libertarian circles about whether the libertarian party needs to be like anti-woke essentially because you can be anti you can think wokeness is bad or you can think some things that are described as wokeness are bad i certainly think that you probably think some of those things every movement has but it doesn't uh it doesn't wokeness often does not compel any sort of policy response so if you're thing and libertarians thing is right wanting the government to be smaller to not do much it like i don't think the government should like legislate non-wokeness obviously some i think in the libertarian movement are trying to find a way in order to pander to like desantis supporting type people and say oh well we're gonna combat wokeness even harder but it can be discordant with a view that says the government should do nothing isn't isn't there kind of a lane a really sweet spot for libertarians to say we can invade against wokeness with the best of them and condemn it mightily but because we're libertarian don't be too afraid because we're not actually gonna do anything about it to like satisfy people who are yeah i mean that would be my exact views uh but i'm not in charge of the libertarian party different people are and i and i think a mosh would on it would say those things as well and it's not you know i'm not making sound like it's this totally acrimonious situation uh mosh is very popular in the libertarian party he might be the libertarian party is candidate next time around um i mean he these are these are healthy arguments being had a lot of the time so it's it's not it's not a dire situation but um but uh yeah that's the this right you know how these things take place it's i know you have you we talk a lot about your uh the the kind of left progressive oh the left will left the left right now is having a debate as to whether or not squab number should be kicked out of dsa over the uh vote to crush the union strike the real union strike or whether the people who are suggesting that like chama so want uh seattle city council woman uh who is in both dsa and a more i'd say argue more radical left organization social alternative whether she should be kicked out for suggesting it as a kind of entryism everyone's calling everybody trot skis it's a lot it's a lot i i i don't envy uh these kind of uh battles because i've experienced them so much myself but it is it's nice to have some insight into other political lanes that are opening up and having a robust discussion that's increasingly public this in the new yern times that breaks people's perception that there are only two lanes in the whole wide world to go down in public hit and different like i said yesterday it's feel especially with covid so i feel like everything's got to be banned or required and that is that that is the most anathema to the libertarian part of this so i really hope voices like amoaches can be raised it says we're not we if we got in charge we're gonna get in charge we're gonna leave you alone make your own choices this is not gonna be we're not gonna force on the entire country one agenda or another that just that leads to everyone fighting with each other all the time thank you thank you for those insights ravi and then we'll have more arising for you right after this yeah texas attorney general ken paxon is facing accusations of creating a registry of transgender people in the lone star state after his office requested the department of public safety to compile a list of individuals who had changed their gender on their texas drivers license and other department records during the past two years according to documents obtained by the washington post the chief of the dps's drivers license division emailed colleagues on june 30th asking for the quote total number of changes from male to female and female to male for the last 24 months the communication was labeled ag request sex change data a representative for texas dps told the post in a statement a verbal request was received ultimately our team advised the ag's office the data requested neither exists nor could be accurately produced thus no data of any kind was provided so i read this story and it's very unclear why for what purpose this was asked i think there was a lot of uh concern which is understandable but it's not i don't know that they were trying to create some sign of registry they were asking for the the raw total not for identifying information of who did it i would still object to them asking for that information just like i i get i started to get weirded out when like the census wants to know your you know everything about your how you everything i don't know it's like okay leave me alone government stop counting people well i mean that's that's the thing historically they're in in europe especially because of the legacy of the holocaust there's a lot of stigma around these kinds of lists a lot of countries in europe don't you know who else kept this i mean that is exactly the point they don't these countries now because of that legacy don't keep the same kind of demographic information that is pretty routine in the united states and which we tend to associate with being able to track disparities and bad things that can potentially be happening in populations so that they can be cured and not invisibilized and a double-edged sword right i think that some people say you know because of the context this is texas there's a negative implication about what that information is going to be used for this had happened in massachusetts probably people would be thinking good they're making sure that all the trans people are okay and they're tracking them for that reason and in europe it's both too what do you think ken pexon would have used it for well we see bills trying to criminalize uh folks you know uh parents for like talking points and say like you know 12 000 people changed their sex identification this year and this is bad i mean yeah i mean there was that viral moment of matt wallch uh kind of embarrassingly i think it was on on maybe joe rogan embarrassingly grossly overestimating how many trans people actually transitioned in a given year by like that was pretty embarrassing orders of magnitude like thousands and thousands of uh uh miss uh yeah michael tracy who is no conservative or progressive interesting and ill and in a little space yeah independent journalist uh yeah i would point it out it does not say something it does not say anything good about you if you like your signature issue you don't you can't even put the statistics within the realm of like a factor of whatever it is yeah i think it's like a few hundred and he estimated it like thousands and thousands so um that's not to say you know in europe oftentimes there there are problems understanding exactly what's going on with minority communities because they don't keep that kind of information and it's not clear to me how you guarantee that information like that is ever used positively equitably as opposed to um keep people down but you know everyone right now is talking about fascism and are they coming for you know that that famous poem first they came from the communist and then they came for and and i didn't care and then eventually they came for me people are asking whether or not some of the focus on trans issues right now which get a lot of traction because i do think it's one of the newer cultural spaces to open up and a lot of people are learning and working through their feelings about changing norms and the way that happens in a changing culture that it's very easy to make them the focal point of a lot of these attacks and they're concerned that this is kind of opening the gate to ratcheting up critiques of various communities that get bigger and bigger and bigger and closer and closer to the average american until we look up one day and discover that there's lists of a lot of us for a lot of different reasons and that that information is then weaponized i mean do you think that that's a kind of a hyperbolic concern as i said i never want to discount anyone for being worried about the government counting or tracking things excessively again i have a kind of garden variety libertarian paranoia about all of these things like you know how i feel about airport security that real id they can delay it till the next century okay but you're very open to jeff bezes putting a chip in your arms so you can check out of the grocery store more quickly let us not forget well let's do it that's different and i'm gonna i'm absolutely gonna put that uh that tracking device in my suitcase yeah that i the apple tracker we did a segment last week about women who have some security concerns are they're here yet oh we have a segment in the future we are going to interview someone about something yes uh you know people are using it to stalk others but it also helps you find your keys and there is an alert function that lets you know if there's a device in your vicinity so you can at least know if someone's trying to track you but yeah look i think that's the problem with this technology a lot of it is very convenient and it's helpful people like having the amazon security cameras they just might not necessarily want to consent to those tapes being used for a funniest home tv show reel if they're not being compensated for or to uh get them in trouble with the law because they're being surveilled in that way yeah you know what no i'm i'm with the irritated uh trans people on this one at the next press conference Ken Paxton does he should be asked why he made this request absolutely no no qualifications yeah this weirds me out bugs me don't like it yeah yeah look i do think there's something to the the idea that like historically what fash just have done is found a group small enough that no one really cares about how they're being attacked and that circle gets widened slowly and it's a little bit of one of those frogs and boiling water situations where nobody notices until it's too late you know if you turn up the you can put a frog what are you doing if you put a frog in water and turn the heat up slowly it won't jump out it'll die if you drop a frog in boiling water it will jump out immediately so the gradualness of it all endures us to new circumstances no matter how harmful it is until it's basically too late so it's something to think about regardless of how you feel about some of the excesses of wokeness whatever you perceive to be in excess that it's rarely the case historically that it's it stops with the group that you're relatively indifferent to all right well we'll have more rising after this please stay with us congressman elect maxwell frost the first gen z member of congress has stated that ft x's sam bankman freed donated to his campaign but that he never solicited solicited a donation from sbf he took to twitter to release a statement saying in part we are an operation that rejects corporate pack dollars which means we also reject stolen money meanwhile us attorney dameen williams has called on people potentially involved in the scandal to come forward to any person entity or political campaign that has received stolen customer money we ask that you work with us to return that money to the innocent victims and to anyone who participated in wrongdoing at ft x or alameda research and who has not yet come forward i would strongly encourage you to come see us before we come see you who come see us before we come see you definitely has a little bit of a threat there like they are going to find i mean the multiple organizations are investigating um and that this is he's out of the uh new york's southern district uh the cftc uh the scc i mean there are a lot of guns pointed on this particular target here that the this is a rumor i mean it's been reported in numerous places the guardian the new york post it's not been confirmed but they allege that sam bakeman freed and some of his top people at ft x had a group chat on signal that was called wire fraud wire fraud i mean this man's parents are lawyers i cannot get over it his dad is a tax lawyer and apparently pretty good one at stanford uh everybody knows don't write anything down i mean we some i saw people joking that regular norney's are all on signal because we're so paranoid about our text messages being disclosed even though most of us are never going to get deposed for anything and people like sam bakeman freed who are overseeing a multi-billion dollar ponzi scheme are flagrantly doing things like this it's like he's begging for it or he thinks he's just going to help smart us all mhm yeah it's interesting how do you feel about this giving back the campaign money etc i don't want to head out like i don't this guy maxwell frost right he didn't know where this money came from it's not something gives you money if in a political context doesn't mean you necessarily cosign everything they that they believe the person who gave you the money i don't know i mean this is the problem some money's fungible also it's like it all goes in the same pile it's all the same it's not like well he's not he i can get back not enough keys except in this case yeah i mean so so during the bernie campaign there was this moment where a billionaire a disney eris who's a progressive wanted to give bernie money and he had to give it back because he had this pledge not to take any donations from billionaires and some people thought well this is getting absurd if someone seems like a really good person they inherited the money they didn't get the money in a dirty you know through their own exploitation then go ahead and take it you know we're fighting a fight here why would you fight with one arm behind your back now from bernie's perspective he already out fun raised everybody in the democratic primary he didn't need that money and part of why he was able to raise so much i would argue is because the people valued the pledge that he made and were willing and able to step up and fill in however this scenario i think really justifies really validates british perspective if you are taking these huge sums of money from people very very rarely if ever are those huge sums of money actually legitimately clean when you're taking it from a billionaire people don't become billionaires because they're a billion times more smart and righteous and just than the average person you know some some things have happened so you know the our Maxwell frost went ahead and gave that money to a lgbt qia charity i talk about this in more depth in my radar but a lot of folks are wondering what heads are going to roll here because of the sheer volume of money what was it 40 million dollars given in this last cycle to democrats alone not to mention all of the dark money and this is what i talked about in my radar dark money specifically that was given to republicans so that sandbakeman freed could keep the veneer of being a progressive left oriented person all of the republican donations went under the radar you know a lot of people were very close to this and that money wasn't coming with no strings attached he was actively lobbying folks for advantageous regulatory terms so that he could continue the scheme yeah yeah we're gonna it's gonna be heads are going to roll i think and and the whole idea that they're gonna go easy on him i i think we're putting that to bed now no they are going to prosecute him and anyone involved with him to the full sixth extent of the law it's going to be an easy win because it's it's so the the evidence is going to be easy to obtain it's i mean he keeps talking about it he keeps talking about it basically admitting to it i mean i will say this they want to win law enforcement loves a win they love look we put this this you know son of a gun behind bars for a thousand years and uh and they're all going to pat themselves on the back so they're they're going to go after him yeah i i will say that having been a corporate lawyer for a time i have also witnessed the slipperiest the slipperiness of legal standards for business judgment in some of these kinds of cases i never saw anything quite like this but i have seen many people and read many documents that all but prove that someone obviously was acting in bad faith they were obviously making the kind of decisions that were highly risky speculative wall street is just gambling but because of the technicality of it all with absent a red flag banks have gotten away with murder proverbial murder probably little murder so a proverbial murder um or kind of sanctions that don't touch it their core wealth in any meaningful way and certainly we saw in the context of the financial crash in 2008 that almost nobody went to jail yeah um so it's it's i don't know yeah i mean it depends exactly what the law says because on on some level you know nobody made these people were i think duped nobody forced them to invest their money on this specific thing it's like no one you know forced you forced you to go to the casino and bet it all on on red like these are choices you made now maybe it was under false pretenses maybe and then maybe the money was actually taken and and it was it was fraudulent what was being done with it that was not part of you know you made this exchange okay here's my money and our understanding our contractual agreement is you're doing x with it and then y was done with it and that does violate the law but that's on some level if you put your you know if you go to the casino sometimes you lose but but robbie here's the thing if if there were a bridge yeah in the middle of a city that said walk over it at your own risk and you walked over it and you fell through and got seriously injured and the bridge builder said hey like there was a sign you should have known better than to walk over the bridge our kind of expectations from living in a society rightly or wrongly don't just you know they set us up for failure sometimes and that's why we have these rules and guardrails around liability the law anticipates that sometimes there's something called an attractive nuisance or basically you have you've made conditions that are both dangerous and attractive then you're responsible for any harm that comes out of them whether it's it's when you should talking about like a as uncovered swimming pool of that some neighborhood kid falls in or something like that but some of those are really abusive losses but we live in a society where there are people have rightly or wrongly expectations about some basic regulatory frameworks that are involved more over stand-backman freedom is being accused of actually actively misleading people about the value of this company we're seeing this now with a lot of this nft ape stuff where these celebrities are now under the microscope uh uh what's his name um Larry David in this context this is celebrity under the microscope i think being charged right now for participating in these advertisements that you know misrepresent the value of the product that is being sold so that is not just passively hey i offered some people a bad deal and they took it it's on them it's i'm lying to you about the quality of the deal that's well that's what i'm saying i agree yeah but there's to go to your bridge example i mean there are some example like the the parking lot i park in to do this show it's like there's a sign on it says that don't leave your valuables in the car if your valuables get stolen we're not responsible for it maybe that wouldn't hold up i don't know maybe you can swim anyway we we have an expectation that sometimes the whole the whole it's like a neighbor like a kid or a someone trespasses and drowns in your pool and you can get sued for that right i've never agreed with that i think i always thought that was bad i think the better example would be if the sign said drive into this parking garage at your own risk and then a hole opens up in the ground when you pull into a space and your car goes plummeting down three floors and the parking garage says hey i never made any representations about whether or not their structural integrity of this garage was up to date or you think the building or the city or whoever would not or in their choosing in their choice of who to do business with they pick the what like at the end of the day you're not we're not going to allow you to put up a sign that says that and if that happens then we're going to recoup our investment i think that's a perfect analogy for what's gone on here all of these trusted folks all of these media legacy media organizations they buoyed uh sandbagment freed they said he was a wonder kid the celebrities had us back you know as an average low relatively low information consumer yeah that is a kind of misrepresentation in and of itself the same way that you know saying hey i have a building here folks parking me it's a similar kind of representation misrepresentation some colorful analogies in this segment we'll be back in just a minute with more rising stay with us it appears elon musk could be in some financial trouble according to reports twitter is auctioning off items from its headquarters and has not paid rent at its san francisco and global office for several weeks the auction will happen online starting january 17th elon musk has also sold about 22 million more shares of tesla stock according to a financial filing last night the transactions took place earlier this week and are worth roughly 3.6 billion dollars so you think he's in some trouble i would not necessarily personally choose to invest in a business uh or see as a hallmark of success if a month after it was purchased by a new ceo they started selling off office chairs uh bird shaped paraphernalia exercise bikes they don't need as many as many chairs he's fired a bunch of people fair enough maybe those chairs were shadow banning people and they should out they go with every with all the rest of the the sensors oh boy look it's it's not it's not a it's not a good look um it the the optics of it are great um and as many people have pointed out most folks can't just decide to not pay rent and to to make themselves um financially viable for the short term and and oftentimes you see that there are these different rules for elites than the rest of us i don't know if you watch the whole we work scandal in all of the videos and movies that have come out of that scam but over and over again you see people entrusted with money and trusted with loans allowed to fall behind on their debts in the way that regular average people don't can't do well i don't know small businesses sometime i think this happened in the d.c area had stopped paying rent but there's no one else who's going to take over this the space so the the landlord let them we just we just came out of a pandemic where the an eviction moratorium kept many people from facing eviction and after the eviction report in maturium left lapsed we saw an incredible rise in homelessness and people having to move out of the the cities or wherever they were living to go live with family and things like that we have an entire generation of millennials who are disproportionately living at home and jin ziers are never even going to leave the nest whatsoever because they came in the floor the room and board costs at the colleges to this and then they go to colleges so we were in a place where obviously the average person understands that they are not subject to the same standards of someone like elan must where he in some spaces is even being congratulated for his business acumen and being able to weather the storm by not paying his bills and selling off furniture so this is with donald trump as well he was notoriously sued for not paying his debts and people considered him to be a business scion who we should be looking up to for his acumen and so often it spoils down to cheating so i mean do you see this differently do you honestly think that this is kind of good news for the job musk is doing right now i mean i don't know it's too early to tell we have to see what twitter looks like a year or two years or three years from now i think it's possible that he wanted to sell off some tesla stock just to kind of hedge against whatever's going to happen in the market and that actually buying twitter was a convenient way to have an excuse to sell some stock to collect that money to cobble together to buy twitter that was one theory for why he was doing this entire thing in the first place which actually made some sense to me and yeah he's down he look he's downsized the company by he's fired tons and tons and tons of people it could be that the company runs just as smoothly without them and uh it runs just as smoothly with a few few fewer chairs maybe people employees need to be sitting less and working well look you're allowed to fire people sometimes you are sometimes you are we'll see if some of those lawsuits come through but you're allowed to fire people generally speaking but if i have a if i'm paying rent and splitting rent with a roommate and i kick them out or i break up with my partner whoever's sharing the rent with me you've got to pay the rent i still got to pay the rent so that doesn't really um you know factor in there in my view although we should talk a little bit more about what you just brought up the selling of stock people i might have pointed out that this is what elan musk was telling stockholders at the same time he was dumping those stocks matt bender compiled these tweets you can see musk says quote i will make sure tesla shareholders benefit from twitter long term and in response to a tesla investor think long term and avoid leverage so is elan musk um kind of saying do what i say and not what i do and inducing people to have uh confidence in the in the stock long term as he's bailing it himself yeah i mean of course he's going to tell the investors to hold firm to that there's nothing there's no reason to panic um that it's what's sbf said as well exactly you know like it seems to me that you're still skeptical that this is going to or that this should affect people's perception of elan musk as a good faith actor or that this was a savvy uh kind of financial play that is going well for him i mean we should always approach these people with a certain amount of of both skepticism that they're acting in a good faith and and whatnot but we should also approach them with a fair amount of reality in that they usually make decisions that are basically competent for their own bottom lines and for these companies it could be that musk has some unique obsession with twitter he seems very obsessed with twitter he spends all his time there and it is causing him to make decisions that are otherwise a little suspect from a financial uh strategic planning kind of position that's possible or it could be he has access to a lot of information we don't have and this will in the long term be just as tesla's been very successful um is he's he built uh he his space x wildly successful under his tutelage he got ahead of everybody else even though he started behind them um look i i don't know and and he'll he'll say things that make you question whether he really knows what's going on with twitter like he said that you know how important it is and how many users it has i'm like wait you're talking about facebook twitter is used by a much smaller number of people but it's very early and it it so many i could so easily imagine a world where everybody has to eat their words for saying oh crazy elan took over and fired everybody and changed all the policies and and then all of you say oh it's falling apart it's collapsing it's not even going to run you know year from now it could be profitable if you do it it could but you pointed out that he seems not even though it's going on his own company he part of the initial twitter disclosure twitter files disclosures was that you know it was like you know red flag this fbi former fbi guy is overseeing the the the data that we're about to drop and people like well do you not know who your own um chief legal officer is i mean that's your that's a senior position do you not and you know maybe it takes a month a few weeks to figure this stuff out but it's a million people but robbie when you but if i'm buying a laptop for the purpose of doing video editing then i'm gonna immediately check if it has video editing software when i buy the laptop if i'm buying twitter for the purpose of writing the ship and throwing all the people who i think i've done all the of the wrong doings and clearing all the people who i think are bad faith then that should be a task that you address before you have the very person you perceived to be a bad faith actor because i just don't i don't necessarily trust all of the mainstream media figures i mean this is this is a disaster this is a sinking ship this is the the the most poorly managed it's all failing it's all collapsing this is the end we're not predicting the end or anything but here's the story the story today is that elan musk is is is selling off furniture not paying his rent in dumping stock and you can frame that and spend that however you want i i think it is a mistake to read into that more than what it is right now a lot of companies go through these ups and downs but you said a second ago that you think that people CEOs generally make decisions that are best for them in their business i agree with half of that then they make decisions that are best for them but with all of the mergers and acquisitions that you've seen over the last 30 years of m&a you know crisis for 40 50 years of m&a scone wild we know that a lot of times these people buy these businesses to get what they can out of it and move on and you even articulated that this could be some kind of play that is involved with tesla and all these other kinds of things so i would not be surprised if all the people who sincerely hope that he's invested in twitter myself included to make twitter better and it's very very disappointed i don't want this to happen but i'm seeing increasing signs of it that this was never about actually making what i think is a very important website better and it was about whatever these kind of financial mechanisms are that are going to make Elon Musk's life better i don't know i think he's already made it sort of better i appreciate these disclosures that i very strongly appreciate knowing more about how everything went off the rails in terms of several important content moderation decisions and knowing why and how people were suppressed without their without their knowledge the the number one thing he could do now that would be beneficial would be to just craft transparent processes yes because there is going to be content moderation and it can't all just be on the fly whatever elan declares that's going to lend itself toward profound inconsistencies right so we should know what actions are being taken and then what actions you need to take to get it back into the good graces of the platform yeah if you're being paused if you're being limited in your reach here is why and here's when it will end if these steps are taken and then everyone will act less crazy because it won't be some conspiratorial paranoid delude am i crazy for thinking i'm being limited just let people know show them the way back and have have transparent somewhat obvious fair unbiased rules is that too much to ask doesn't seem like too much to ask i completely agree we keep i completely agree so if you want to purchase some succulents from the twitter patio where apparently tom hanks once played played uh cornhole you can do that what are succulents is that like a cactus yeah it'll it'll be up it'll be up in january you've been on it about the only plan to come on out about the only plan to doesn't die in my apartment right here but i'm revising for you after those representative nancy mace a republican had an interesting exchange with a social justice activist it's very active on twitter uh particularly speaking up about trans issues here was that exchange is rhetoric on social media a problem and a threat to our democracy mr ward yes absolutely mr segull yes mr caribao yes miss namani yes miss tyler yes um another question i have uh do you believe that rhetoric targeting officials with violence for carrying out their constitutional duties um is a threat to democracy mr ward mr segull yes yes yes yes all right thank you very much only a few weeks after the attempt to attack on a supreme court justice on june 25th one of the witnesses jolly hondrick arabao tweeted out the following in response to a decision on abortion overturning rovey wade and i'll quote directly from the tweet the six justices who overturned ro should never no peace again it is our civic duty to accost them every time they're in public they are pariahs since women don't have their rights these justices should never have a peaceful moment in public again i know so that was a pretty good example of having receipts uh i thought uh this individual uh aldra caribao is very spicy okay she's very vocal the tweets makes for itself and just to really make the context clear mace is describing how caribao's tweets and tweets like that are responsible for harassment harassment that mace herself experienced what i and i think that it is a perfectly valid legitimate calling out of hypocrisy i'm a little bit lost though in the back and force about who's hypocritical and who's not about what people actually want to happen because at the same time you have a moment like this which has gone viral for a lot of people who feel like the left is unfair in how it describes the right as violent and you know especially fascistic and all of these things when they call for similar kinds of violence in this example the right is also saying we shouldn't have these restrictions on speech you should be able say what you want to say so which is it are people allowed to uh obey against supreme court justices and say they should be accosted and say that people like may should be accosted or do we want all of that kind of speech to be considered to be improper at least on social media which would mean a lot of the conservative rhetoric would also come under scrutiny maybe this is a good time to play another clip that people are talking about a lot right now from marjorie taylor green in which she basically argues that if she could do one six again if she were in charge it would have gone a little bit differently can we roll that then gee you were six happens and next thing you know i organized the whole thing along with steve and in here and i want to tell you something if steve and i had organized that we would have won not to mention it would have been armed yeah the the crowd is even seen a little bit unsteady with the the would have been armed comment sounds to me like a very bad uh in bad taste joke she was making there that's what she claims the white house asked her to apologize and with her public kens to disavow this kind of incitement to violence she came back saying that it was a kind of ironic humor and she's allowed to say what she wants to say but obviously we're in a situation where i think a lot of fun in a lot of people's minds either this kind of infective you know can is oh and she's not a politician but she has argued recently on her show that there should be more harassment and more common open condemnation of trans people um saying that they should be discriminated against and people are are seeing results in terms of armed people showing up at these drag shows and the like there are conflicts we just recently had the shooting obviously so which is it do we want everyone to be able to call violence all the time on both sides of the aisle including against mace or do we want nobody to be saying these kinds of things and some of the free speech rhetoric is actually got to go out of the window you're right that there are a lot of hypocritical calls for civility and those call the hypocritical both because you minimize your own size lack of civility what well decrying what the what the fascist right or the crazy left is doing so it's hypocritical on that front and then it does exist in tension with this uh especially on the right this embrace of the most total free speech kind of norms which free speech absolute absolute absolute absolutely absolutely should be embraced in a first amendment context i don't think any of the sentiments expressed by any of the people we've showed videos from are or should be criminalized under the first amendment but the standard for whether whether you should be embraced and given a position in congress or be or be a successful punishment be illegal for you to be any of those things but we might it is proper to denounce and criticize and and call on the voters or the viewers or whoever it is to shun i don't i don't think those things aren't actually in tension they're only in tension because we've started or some people on the right at least have started to embrace this extreme this i don't want to call it extreme because it's good to be extremely pro free speech in a legal context doesn't look like you're not required to like let everyone come into your house and start screaming at you or something it's your doing it doesn't you're not violating the first amendment if you say you know if we don't or if we don't on our show if we didn't if we didn't we're not having Alex Jones on right now we're not violating the first amendment or something it's not because we hate free speech we like free speech it's just that there are some standard practices so it does seem to me that in some of these examples particularly the uh a hundred tweets and in the margaritailer green example these are i think statements that come a lot closer to incitement to violence saying the premium court justices should be accosted saying that you would have preferred an armed attack on congress and your fellow congress members that comes a lot closer to what i would argue is non i don't think either does you do what is incitement beyond go punch that person i think you should go punch that person well if there's time place in manner stuff right it has to be a specific person and a specific time for justices anytime you see them just but you but that's a position not a saying you know what you know what we ought to do at 4 30 tomorrow we ought to all get our guns and go to this mcdonald's where brek have it all is going to be that's incitement so like i said these come a lot closer to incitement than a lot of other things that have happened on the app whether or not they actually meet the legal definition they come a lot closer to incitement and so i think the question is actually out of the realm it's getting increasingly out of the realm of whether this is something that is protected you know whether or not this is something that is like in a free speech plays or whether this is something that is actually not protected speech and how do we feel about that because i think at the end of the day there have obviously been many armed conflicts that has been recorded in history as you just every war is an incitement to violence and obviously a lot of killing death and destruction but depending on who the winners are and who writes history we don't think of as someone just randomly shot someone someday you know christmas attics dies in the revolutionary war we think of that as a heroic kind of a moment in history r.i.p christmas attics but like the the the issue here is is the is the only thing that's really determining whether people feel one way or another about one of these moments just what side you're on and who you think is righteous in their condemnation plenty of people genuinely believe that because of the real threat to people women's well-being ability to survive dangerous pregnancies having been victims of rape and being forced to carry to term all of these things that are all malign in the row or dobs context justifies you know putting that same amount of violence threatening that same amount of violence the people who made that kind of decision people believe that i think what's difficult about this clip is that i think on cell level a hundred does believe it but when pressed on it isn't willing to kind of own that i mean there are a lot of people i mean yes but there are a lot of people who think that abortion is itself an act of yes murder against a living human being and they killed abortion providers because of that belief you know so i i think that the issue here is i mean okay but there are a lot of people who hold that belief but are not acting on it in any kind of violence except for except for voting for policies that the other side thinks is going to result in people's deaths and this is the problem when the rhetoric is your belief in this leads to death then people do sincerely believe that violence is justified and there have been times historically where poll nations have bought into that premise depending on what the cause is and i think i don't know like i don't think this is something that is going to be rationalized out because at the end of the day the only just honest thing here i think is Alejandro not saying yes i actually believe the supreme courtist is deserved what they get i think margarine taylor green in some ways is like more honest here i think she well i think she does what her audience i think she thought what her audience wanted to hear there i don't know what she actually believes i don't know what she actually believes either but i do think that this isn't actually about some consistent principle here it's about who 10 50 100 years from now is going to be perceived as having the more righteous cause and that's a kind of a scary place to be i don't want to come off like the civility police because it's lame but we would it would benefit our society if our elected representatives and our commentator class was a little less incity in their rhetoric if we were in the fall will shorten my view of in the years or days before the Haitian revolution and Haitians are calling for the murder of the plantation owners the people who are enslaving them the people who are occupying their country are we gonna say oh that was incitement to violence and that was inappropriate and they shouldn't have done that so united white people on the island didn't they they killed all the people who are enslaving them yes should we not have killed nazis because they're nazis are we gonna fight this war are we not going to do we think that their just causes are there they're not kill the women and the children i mean how many women just throw on the Haitian how many slave women and children were not only killed but raped brutalized and enslaved for hundreds of years didn't they like i don't really litigate this kind didn't they go like door to door determining what like what your skin color was and then shooting you that's not true in fact Polish immigrants were specifically protected because they did not participate in the slave trade and they were seen as allies in hate hate so it wasn't about color it was about behavior i mean if you're if you're holding the relieving people revolutions and civil wars are very bloody horrible the blood is that history decides which victims were justified and which were not and i think that a lot of this mudsling included by mace i think that she makes a solid point about hypocrisy but it doesn't actually mean anything because nobody actually cares when the conservatives are in a different position where they think that something is right and justified an abortion is murder so only the tables flip that's that's all i'm saying and i think unfortunately this is one of those things that's going to have to be decided by historical perspective and we're not going to get very far in this moment well we'll have more rising right after this stay with us arkansas senator tom cotten has blocked the press freedom act as democrats try to push the bill which has already been approved by the house over the finish line according to media i the bill protects from disclosure any information identifying a source as well as any records contents of a communication documents or information obtained or created by journalists in the course of their work the bill also protects select third parties from being required to provide testimony or any document consisting of a record or information that relates to a business transaction transaction and a journalist according to the republican senator the bill would insulate reporters from scrutiny and consequences and open a floodgate of leaks damaging law enforcement and our nation's security i think we have a statement from him a video that we wanted to play for you all let's run that the press act would immunize journalist and leakers alike from scrutiny and consequences for their actions this bill would prohibit the government from compelling any individual who calls himself a journalist from disclosing the source or substance of such damaging leaks this effectively would grant journalists special legal privileges to disclose sensitive information that no other citizen enjoys it would treat the press as a special cast of crusaders for truth who are somehow set apart from their fellow citizens so the first part of that he's he's talking like in outrage terms about things that are like good right that would shield people from that would immunize people telling you things about the government the government doesn't want you to hear like yeah that's why the tell is that yeah i will say however i do take his point a little bit about and i don't fully understand how does this bill define journalist because it is true that journalists is and should not be a protected class uh the the first amendments free speech rights free assembly rights petition rights do not only apply to journalists they apply to everyone there's no constitutional there's no category for journalists as separate from the rest of of citizens and there shouldn't be because you you can engage in jere like you don't need a you don't need a credential to be a journalist you don't need a a a degree or a certificate or a training period you're just if you're doing the work of journalists journalism you can call yourself a journalist just like we don't want to you know get really cute about whether wiki leaks is journalism or you know whether whether that the julina saan just well he's because that's what some people say well he's not really a journalist so what he did was not okay it should not matter he was engaged in the work of journalism because he was holding powerful government people to account by revealing information about them that they didn't want you to hear right but there are whistleblower protections there are protections for journalistic against having to reveal reveal their sources whistleblowers is a is a defined category right so the point here is that he's acting as though it's insane to create these protected classes for people when our society has obviously decided in the interest of having accurate reporting on people like him congress members who use the power at their disposal often to cloak themselves and their own special privileges we have congress unwilling to prohibit themselves from playing by special rules where they're allowed to insider trade and the rest of us aren't and on and on and on you're right he is he is describing things that are very good as very bad and apparently rather speciously pretending as though the bill doesn't contemplate some of the concerns that he's articulating and create exceptions so senator ron wyden of or again responded to tom cotton um saying that the exceptions to make sure that we could protect our country we're strong enough to get the support of 435 members of the house and that's a very good point this is a very bad part of bill and it almost passed the senate but for tom cottons objection it seems and it's a really odd posture it seems to me to take for a party that has gotten so much traction and when so many hearts and minds over being the party that has painted itself as more proactive about protecting speech rights this is a bipartisan pro-free speech bill that he's sticking his neck out over saying hey i'm the lone i'm the lone person is going to be against this so i'm looking at the bill now and i'm looking at how it defines journalist this term means a person who regularly gathers prepares collects photographs records rights edits reports investigates or publishes news or information that concerns local national or international events or other matters of public interest for dissemination to the public so it means a person who regularly gathers so that so what's the what exactly is to the start out so any whistleblower let's let's pretend that someone is marginally a journalist what is the concern because i what this with this protects is the journalism not whatever they also might have been doing or conspiring to do with some bad actors so the concerns that were articulated about terrorism violence imminent threats um i think this is also this is from uh uh uh i think we leave as uh congressman or durbin um you know the press act like he says the press act like recent justice department regulations issued by attorney general merit garland accounts for these scenarios it makes exceptions for information necessary to prevent or identify the perpetrator in an act of terrorism or to prevent a threat of imminent violence significant bodily harm or death and it doesn't apply to foreign agents terrorists or journalists suspected of committing crimes so part of what was going on in the julian asan scenario is that people won as you pointed out diminish the idea that he's actually a journalist and then also accuse him of kind of conspiring in the illegal you know taking of the documents in the first instance but absent evidence that a journalist has actually induced the initial illegal act they are protected that's not the objection i'm raising okay the objection i'm raising is so under this it would be say a whistleblower someone who has information in the defense department goes to the new york times and tells the new york times reporter gives them this information this this law this bill would stop the government from forcing it from arresting the the reporter for uh for writing a story about it or if they're not saying where who the source is but it would because the new york times reporter regularly gathers prepares etc if the whistleblower just tells this to some random person who then publishes a blog post about it or something i think my reading of this is the government could still come down on that person because that person is not a journalist they're not someone who regularly engages in active journalism so i would be able to qualify as being a judge right now so that's what i'm saying i would i would change this to make it more to make it more to protect it to not specifically cover a protected group of people to find his journals yeah well look we've been i'm not sure that's what i think tom cotton was raising that point to malign the bill without actually wanting to do that but i would change it that way to just well he wants he doesn't seem to have a lot of respect for journalists needing this protection in the first instance and it's worth pointing out that i don't think journalists should have protections that other people don't want the freedom of press foundation um director of advocacy explained that quote conservative journalists are often targets of government surveillance 100 and that uh most harassment of journalists isn't necessarily political uh and that this strong anti-surveillance bill recognizes national securities concerns and should be something that is appealing to people across the political spectrum it clearly is it passed the house with four hundred thirty right here comes tom cotton so what do you make of this as a political i mean tom cotton is a different kind of republican um he's uh he is a national security republican um he's definitely not he's interesting he's not he doesn't fit neatly into some of the boxes available because he's definitely not a never trump republican he's not but he's not part of the new right he's not exactly a neo-con i don't think but he's more uh i i would say he's more pro the national security state um he's uh he's a big uh he's a big the government needs all the power it needs to engage in to fight violence and terrorism and crime and etc remember he was the send in the troops yeah fed author um send it the send in the federal national troops yeah he's uh he's not a he's not a limited government guy not uh so so that i think this very much fits with his ideology well as trump once very famously said sunlight is the best disinfectant he might have been talking about it in the context of covid but it stands to reason that's very you're making a bleep drinking joke here it's a little bit we have always having a little bit of fact oh it is true like in people who are overly trying to protect the deep state when it has every resource at its disposal to keep its secret secret i mean there was a story just this past week about how the pentagon has failed the last five audit and it can only account for something like one third of the money that it's getting at the same time that it's about to get approved for this unprecedentedly large teamly the pentagon has no idea what money spent in afghanistan and on places like that was actually spent on we need more eyes on this stuff and we need journal less to be more protected to report on these kinds of things and the kind of closures that julie and asage made public and for which he's currently being prosecuted i would say people engaging in journalism rather than journalists well look it's worth no day because everyone can engage in journalism it's it's worth noting also that we've been talking a lot about the kevin dillon story in california and those tapes were leased by an unknown source to someone who published them on a blog i had um the guy with that initial blog story on my podcast about a month ago when this all first broke and i i don't i think he's right he's a he's a journalist and i don't think that i think that it it did people are vulnerable when they're outside of these legacy magazines you know we're talking so much about why it is that matt avian glen greenwald and these people who are breaking important news tend to be independent david serota tend to have their own independent enterprises and i would hate a world where someone decides that they aren't real journalists because they're not working for exactly and there's a disdain for them from the legacy media there was a disdain for uh for julina sange right from people there was a uh a reticence to speak up on his behalf right because there's like a well was what he's doing it's not really including from parts we didn't get it and we're not yeah so that's what i seek to avoid in mind i get it of this bill all right that does it for us for today we didn't even comment on our matching matching all right look good with blue day well we hope you have a great weekend we'll be back here next week for more festive coverage uh the most festive coverage you've seen from us yet be sure like share and subscribe do
