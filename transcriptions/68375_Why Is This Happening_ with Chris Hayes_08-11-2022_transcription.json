    "text": " The initial protests were around women's issues and to ask for justice for women and this centrality of women in these protests is carried through is also a very different and very unique characteristic of this protest because we've never had a situation like this where the entire country rises up in support of a woman. Hello, welcome to Wise Is Happening with me, your host Chris Hayes. So you may have seen in the news over the last six to eight weeks these remarkable images coming out of Iran, protests, street protests, violent crackdowns of those street protests, protests that have been happening all over the country actually not localized in any one place particularly. They've been happening through marches, they've been happening on campuses, remarkable images of women particularly very sort of like flagrantly taking off their hijab or cutting their hair in public and you know this has gotten a fair amount of play in American news but not a ton and I actually had a friend of mine who is Iranian American whose family fled Iran, you know ask me, you know why isn't this a bigger deal in the American media? And I sort of thought about it and I think there's sort of a few things. One is it's a pretty hairy situation for American Western journalists to be in Iran right now and I think particularly after what happened in Russia where things got very very very scary for American journalists there's a real trepidation worry about having your reporters in places that might sort of suddenly violently crack down on them. So there's that that means if you don't have people in the ground then it's harder to do reporting it's also harder to verify a lot of the incredible user-generated video that's coming out of Iran which I think has also been like a little bit of an obstacle. I know we've tried to do it on the show, you want to kind of show the most remarkable dramatic stuff but that could be very hard to run down and verify, you don't want to be putting unverified stuff on air. The other part of this though I think is a little bit of sort of cynicism, resignation that's I think embedded itself among reporters I think and among observers about the power of protest. I think particularly people who cover the Green Revolution which was a massive non-violent peaceful uprising protest in Iran in the early years of the Obama administration subsequent to that there was of course Terir Square in the Arab Spring, amazing street protests but in the end the Green Revolution did not shake the foundations of the Iranian regime. Terir Square managed to dislodge Mubarak but now there's another general who essentially rules indistinguishable from Mubarak. Syria had an uprising that turned into a civil war and ended up with Bashar al-Assad in power and so I think there's a little bit of this like yeah they're protesting but really what can come of it. I don't know if that's warranted or not I think it might not be but I also think that it ends up cutting off inquiry and I have felt a little guilty that we haven't done more of this topic on the news partly that's also because it's the lead up to the midterms in American politics are particularly insane so it's a really wonderful to have an opportunity to have a sort of sustained discussion of what is happening in Iran which really does seem remarkable and I think from what I've gleaned from the people I've talked to actually a kind of difference in kind in terms of civil society and protest and our guest for that is Suzanne Tamasebi she's the director of Fomena which is an organization promotes gender equality supports women and human rights defenders their organizations and feminist movements in the Middle East North Africa and Asia regions from Iran she has over 20 years experience in promoting specifically women's rights peace and security at the national regional and international levels and Suzanne it's great to have you on. Thank you for having me. First will you just tell me your background you're Iranian you were born in Iran right? I was born in Iran I'm Iranian and American by birth so my father was Iranian and my mother was American I was born in Iran and I lived there until the time of the revolution our family left Iran I was young and I went back I mean I had gone back before but I went back in 1999 and I ended up staying in Iran for almost 11 years and was part of the women's movement and part of the civil society movement while I was there during those 11 years. Tell me a little bit about that it was something that really jumped out to me about your bio because I know a fair number of Iranian Americans and particularly first generation Americans whose parents fled Iran around the time of the revolution or shortly thereafter and you know have grown up as Americans and have this sort of exile diasporic existence right like there's a lot of other folks who left Iran who would like to return but won't return as long as this government is in power maybe go and visit aunties or grandmothers or things like that might go back for weddings even though that's you know it's only fraught but very few who end up going back moving back to Iran as you did tell me about how that came about. Well I had been back to Iran in the early 90s after almost 14 years of living in the US and nobody none of us going back my father would go back he went back after the end of the Iran Iraq war and had been and was going back but I went back in the early 90s and I had such a interesting experience there I mean things were much more closed in the early 90s and compared to the time when I went back and stayed I went back again in 1999 and I was between jobs I was working here in the US and the women's rights field women's reproductive health and maternal and child health field and I went back I'd only plan to stay for three months but it was the time of the reform movement Iranian society was opening up and I was surprised and amazed to see that there were a lot of organizations inside the country at that point most of them were charity organizations there weren't so many more progressive independent modern organizations but they were just starting to be established and it was a huge surprise to me because I had no idea that this existed inside the country and I was amazed to see so many Iranians getting involved in civil society because they wanted to create positive change so it was very exciting and that's why I kept extending my stay three months at a time and then eventually it ended up being over 10 years you know there's a obviously a big difference between totalitarian regimes and authoritarian ones and even amongst authoritarian regimes there's a huge spectrum of what civil society could look like the amount of opposition and opposition parties that are tolerated the level of free speech and dissent how would you characterize that in the 10 years you were there and maybe the trajectory of it over the first decade of the century well when I went back and I should say that the reform movement really came about because an enlarged part because of the student movement in Iran that the students were demanding change and freedom and openness and the reformists kind of grabbed onto this and came to power as a result the students supported reformists and especially Khatami who was elected as president the reformist president but when I went there I mean I was amazed at how quickly things were opening up so when I first went there I went there a few years after Khatami was elected two years after he was elected and we would go to events in conference halls etc and a government official would come and he would criticize the system and people would be amazed and say oh he's going to get arrested he's going to get arrested look at what he said and literally I think probably in a matter of two years that discourse had changed too he can't be saying that he needs to be responsive he needs to be accountable so the rate of progress and in terms of people's expectations of their government and their understanding of what civil society was and what democracy was was changing so fast and so rapidly that it was fascinating and interesting to see it there was a lot of opening up of civil society meaning when I say civil society I mean the press and or organizations people setting up organizations in the form of environmental organizations or women's organizations or children's rights organizations this was pretty rapid but unfortunately no real laws were established to guarantee that civil society so as soon as Ahmadinejad came to power and actually in the last year of Khatami's presidency there was a backlash against a lot of these organizations and against the press they started attacking the press shutting down the press arresting a lot of journalists and then shutting down a lot of organizations but that was the freest time that we experienced certainly as part of the women's movement and part of other social movements and non-governmental organizations that was the freest time that we had inside the country where we were able to sit together strategize together talk about change and also connect with our counterparts in the region and internationally after that again we saw a period of serious repression that emerged during this period obviously you were involved in the women's movement and I'm curious just to give us again this is now central to the protest now which have been largely led by women not exclusively you know what does Iranian feminism look like in that period of time you know this is again this is about 10 or 11 years ago by the time you left but what does Iranian feminism look like what are the issues that women are organizing around well I should say that women you know from the start of the revolution when the revolution in the revolution was much more than the Islamic State that came to power it was a lot of different groups that participated in the revolution the leftist but what emerged was an Islamic power and pretty quickly thereafter they instituted hijab laws but also they adopted a very conservative interpretation of Sharia law which pushed back the women's rights the few rights that women had gained during the pahlevi regime which maybe now don't seem significant but for the time they were significant they were custody rights rights to divorce even rights to abortion everything but the right to vote they kept the right to vote because they wanted women to participate in the in the elections that brought the homani to power and the first eight years after the revolution was very difficult for Iranians not just for women but for Iranians to talk about change and to really push back against this very draconian regressive system social system that had been brought on because we were involved in a war and speaking up was very dangerous had many costs but after that really women started to organize again and to demand change initially they did it through progressive interpretation of sharia law to say that you know these laws are from 1400 years ago they need to meet the times but they started challenging the rights the pushing back of women's rights and legal you know legal position but slowly thereafter they began to organize in you know within organizations initially women's groups organized in children's groups they participated in children's non-governmental organizations and then in environmental organizations during the reform period there were no independent women's organizations there were a few women's organizations that were set up by people associated with the state or the ruling elite like fah as a hoshemi who's the daughter of hoshemi rafsangyan who was also herself was an MP she had an organization her sister had an organization a charitable organizations but women like me who came from a middle class secular background none of them had organizations but during the reform period they started to establish organizations and advocate for equal rights from a secular gender equality perspective and the first few years of the reform period focused on these groups strengthening themselves they met with each other they started figuring out what they needed to strengthen themselves help trainings for themselves but also for women this was essential it was really important because by the time the reform period ended is when you see the emergence of a really strong women's movement so while the reform period was going on these women's NGOs very strong but once it ended the very last year of hoshemi's presidency women organized a protest in front of Tehran university asking for equality for the dismantling of all the laws that discriminated against women and this was through that whole process of when they were working on themselves and they were meeting and trying to figure out what their priorities were and their major priority at that point was changing laws that discriminated against women and the year after when Ahmadinejad came to power another protest was held and following that the one million signatures campaign was established which is something that I was involved in it was the national campaign where women came together and a broad national network to demand equality and changes in their legal status and we were met with repression and suppression and arrest almost immediately but we we stood that for over two years and I think the reason why we managed to do that is that we had those few years where space was open and we got to work on our own capacities and our own strengths. Let's talk a little bit about the structures of gender discrimination and patriarchy embedded in the Islamic Republic's laws I mean I think to Americans obviously this is always I think the first thing that Americans think about you know the Ayatollah right is the mandatory dress codes and those being enforced by these kind of virtue police which you know is I think to most Americans certainly myself speaking for myself like dystopian and awful and this round of protests you know starts with an incident involving precisely that but before we get to the death of a young woman in custody of these police maybe just if you could just describe you know how gender gender discrimination pervades just you know life and the structures of the law in these republic. Okay so anybody looking at Iran should be quite aware that there are possibly two realities and this was also something that was so fascinating for me especially when I started working in this you know the civil society sector because I think if I just stayed with my family I would have gotten a very bleak image of the reality of Iran's because you know middle class secular family had suffered greatly greatly under the Islamic Republic but when you go out and you see younger people especially some of these people who come from religious backgrounds or who'd grown up in the revolution and they had a lot of criticism and they wanted to change things and they were much more forceful in their criticism of the state so I think it's important to take note of the fact that Iranian women are extremely strong I think as people are now seeing and this was surprising and super interesting to me I wouldn't say surprising because a lot of the women in my family were also very strong but I was surprised to see it in the context of the Islamic Republic because I had also grown up with a lot of those stereotypes and stereotypical beliefs about what Iran was like after the revolution but to see these strong women despite the fact that their legal situation and the laws that govern their lives were so regressive so let me give you some examples of those laws so and I should say that you know it's important for people to keep in mind that you know the Sharia's interpreted differently in different contexts and really they have to look at religion as a political tool it's not religion in and of itself so I don't want to perpetuate that notion that religion is bad because we know even in the US religion is used to suppress women or other groups and it's bad when it becomes a political tool so there are different interpretation countries for example Tunisia is very progressive but they're also their constitution also talks about how it's based on Islam but women have all their rights so I want to make that clear because I don't want to give the wrong impression here but anyway in Iran it was a very very conservative interpretation of Sharia law so initially the age of marriage which was 18 was turned back to nine for girls and 15 for boys that has changed since so it's 13 for girls 15 for boys men have guardianship of the family so basically men get to make all the decisions about family where they get to live if their wife gets to work if the wife wants to travel if she wants to pursue her education and the man is in charge of the child so women don't have guardianship over their child even if they're given custody of their child they still don't have guardianship over their child so if the father is absent and it's the father's father or the court that has guardianship so they can't set up bank accounts they can't make decisions about their children's health yes it's very problematic in that sense polygamy is allowed even though Iranians its polygamy is really looked down upon by Iranians but by legally it's allowed men are allowed to divorce their wives without any reason but women it's very difficult for women to get divorced there are certain conditions that allows them to get divorced but it's very difficult so these are some of the major challenges that people deal with in Iran their inheritance is unequal men get twice as much as women your testimony in court counts for half that of a man there's criminal age of responsibility for girls it's nine for boys it's 15 so when we set up our campaign we were looking to change all of these laws all of the laws that discriminate against women i think the american i wouldn't say obsession but i mean i think that the you know again the sort of focus of u.s perception of Iran on the morality police and and you know hijab and dress codes and whether hair can show and obviously i think everyone who knows a little bit understands it like there's a lot of you know there's a lot of dancing around the edges of that and people go to parties and they take it off and it becomes a sort of like pro forma thing what is the difference between how that you even perceive that or americans perceive the centrality and oppressiveness of that and how it is understood and lived by iranian women okay so the hijab was initially almost immediately after the revolution there was this rumors about the hijab and so the first protests that women organized were on march 8th international women's day in 1979 to object to these this notion of hijab and also to talk about other things but hijab was very central and the rulers the rulers rulers backed off a little bit they said no no we're not going to do this and it's not going to be obligatory but a few years later in 1983 april of 1983 it becomes mandatory it becomes enshrined in law and so women according to laws women have to cover their hair and their bodies they have to fit wear loose fitting clothes but from the very start women have rejected this and they've pushed back on this as i said the first few years of you know after the revolution were much bloodier and much more difficult times so you know but even then women pushed back their head scarves but every time they've gotten a chance to push back their head scarf wear tighter fitting clothing or wear colorful clothing they've done that but it's also women's bodies have also been monitored you know through morality police initially it was through the comite and then the basi which were these militant groups so it was people who had guns in volunteer people young people who had guns you know so it's it's pretty scary but nevertheless women were pushing back and then they instituted the morality police or the guidance police which you know has had also very serious violent approach towards controlling women's bodies but nevertheless i think you know as you said i think there are different dimensions to people's lives and especially women's lives and perhaps they're freer within their homes within other places and even when i was in iran we were taking off our head scarves in the car in cafes so we were doing this but it's it's humiliating to be told what to wear and it's humiliating to be controlled in that way and to always be afraid that somebody's going to stop you in the street or somebody somebody some random person could just tell you you know you need to cover your hair better or your clothes are too short or you know or your pants are too tight or whenever it's humiliating and it's angering to have to deal with that even if you push the boundaries and you get away with it a lot so in september of this year september 13th a young woman 22 year old irani woman named masa amini she's actually from the Kurdistan region but was in taran i think visiting family she was arrested by the morality police she's with her brother she was in front of a metro station they said that she had i think improper her job she was taken into custody and then ended up at a hospital and died in custody this death had this kind of seismic effect in iranian society it is the precipitating incident for the protests which are now entering their six or seventh week and i wonder if you could just speak about what it was about this death the particulars of it that triggered the initial anguish and street protest reaction i think people you know really empathize with the situation of masa or jina which is her Kurdish name she was this stranger this young beautiful girl a stranger in the big city and she told the morality police according to her brother and other people who were present she pleaded with them don't arrest me i'm a stranger in this city and i think that really echoed and resonated with people that you know the level of innocence and this incredible loss of life as i said you know it's a humiliating experience i think women live with this con either they've experienced being harassed by the morality police or they live with this constant fear and i i think men that care about women also live with this constant fear that this could happen to people that they care about and love i think so a lot of people identify some people identified with her brother i know one person said what would happen if this happen i keep thinking of my sister and i keep thinking of this brother he's never going to be able to live with himself again that this happened to his sister while he on his watch while he was with her so i think people really it resonated with people and the family did a great job the family was under pressure from the start the authority said oh you know they they give multiple reasons for her death they said she had epilepsy that she had a stroke that she had a heart attack and the family consistently instead fastly refused this story this account and they kept saying no she was a healthy young woman and she died in your custody they were also under pressure not to hold a funeral for her but they would stood that pressure and took her body back to sapphiz and held a funeral and there were protests with respect to you know the funeral ceremonies so that was important because she was Kurdish the Kurdish political parties in courtistan the Iranian Kurdish political parties called for a general strike and people you know they striked people gathered in sapphiz and in other cities in courtistan and there were protests and during these protests a couple of significant things happened first of all women took off their head scarves and they chanted in Kurdish and i'm doing a rough translation from Kurdish to farce to english but basically a death for a headscarf how much more of this humiliation will do we have to endure so it really was a sense of humiliation and another thing on her brave stone it was written that you know jina which is again her Kurdish name you have not died but your name will turn into a code word for resistance and it really has i think it has these are two significant things that emerged from this initial protest and then in later protests the slogan that zan zan de gi oza di or jen jian oza di which is a Kurdish slogan that Kurdish women who are working you know towards emancipation and freedom and self-determination had used in the past but it was picked up almost immediately and it became national and now it's global so these are some of the issues that spark the protests and have kept them alive since you know it's just hearing you tell the story and i had sort of tracked some of this but just the details of the family's agency in this and their incredible courage and defiance you know that in the american context of the story of emmett Till of course the young black boy who goes down to visit relatives in the south he's actually from chicago so he's a stranger there right and he is lynched he is murdered and his body is sent back to chicago where his mother is and she you know opts to have the open casket and to show the world what happened to her boy and that is of course one of the the major kind of precipitating incidents that kicks off the modern civil rights movement just thinking about those parallels of this family you know that they send their daughter to tahran and she dies in the hands of the morality police and they they require her body to come back and then they have a funeral there and that that is this kind of galvanizing defiant action on their part of resistance it's very inspiring you know to think of the courage that they showed in deciding to do this exactly because they were under so much pressure and you know even for her 40th ceremony because iranians mourn on the 40th day after burial they were under a lot of pressure not to hold that ceremony and they refused they were even threatened according to accounts that their son would be arrested but they refused and they said you know even if we issue a statement because they were under pressure to issue a statement to cancel the ceremonies people will still come and people came they came in droves they shut down the roads to the gravesite people abandoned their cars and they walked we saw video footage of people crossing rivers and mountains and i think because people were sick and tired they're sick and tired and another really important issue with mass's death is that people were also sick and tired of the killing of citizens with impunity that this has happened before it's happened in protest it happens to people who are in prison then the fact that the government felt like it had to do tell so many lies to cover this death and didn't take responsibility wouldn't it just been so much easier for them to say yes one of the guards or one of the police man did something wrong and we're going to hold him accountable they refused to do that i mean this has created protest across the country they have killed so many people there's actually a slow in it says that you're killing us so that you can prove that you didn't kill massa which is true they're killing so many people just to prove that this didn't happen and now there's some sort of rumor that he run is trying to go to war i don't know how true that is but just imagine just because they're not willing to hold one person accountable within the system which goes to show how broken the system is how dysfunctional the governance structure is we should also highlight i think and i know that in the early coverage of this it was quite central to the protest there was this we talked about the Kurdish parties calling for general strike there was a an obvious kind of regional and ethnic access to this of course the Kurds are spread through various countries throughout the middle east turkey iraq northern iraq particularly in kernistan and in iran and have sort of struggled for various forms of self-determination have often been persecuted and marginalized in societies in which they're ethnic minorities they speak a different language they have a distinct language Kurdish which is different than farce or arabic how much was that how central was that or how important was that in the early parts of this protest because i think my understanding of the coverage at least initially was that this was as this was sort of a bunch of kind of issues stacked atop each other but one of the prime ones being you know sort of Kurdish pride self-determination etc i think the response from the Kurdish community was critical in the initial protests and the way that they turned out to protest and the role that women played in these protests taking off their headscarves saying we're not going to take this humiliation anymore this has not been a sectarian issue and that i think that's the beauty of it and the government of iran tried to make it a sectarian issue they you know if you listen to their you know arabic language broadcasts across the region you know they're talking about how masa was a terrorist she was associated with terrorist groups outside the country that this is about wow you know breaking up iran it's a kurdit you know this is what they're saying and this is they try to do it they attack you know the iranian Kurdish political parties that are based in kurdistan they started bombing them they also did the same thing in zahidon which is sistam baruchistan they killed a hundred people there they tried to make it a sectarian issue but they haven't been able to do that it's i mean and this is the beauty of this movement this protest movement or revolution or whatever you want to call it because in many ways it resembles very much the way the women's movement has been organized all these years it's national it's in big cities it's in small cities it's in villages it's intersectional so you have people from different ethnic groups different religions groups that are part of it it's different age groups you know so you have a lot of young people this a different movement supporting it the student movement is supporting it the workers movement is supporting it and you also have middle class people from different social economic backgrounds poor communities supporting it so it's a very varied and the most important thing that many people even myself at the beginning i thought this was a weakness but i think ultimately this has turned out to be a strength is that it's not there's no one charismatic leader and it's locally organized it's diverse and it's you know if there's no one particular leader that's doing it more of our conversation after this quick break so so it clearly you know the flame kind of jumped right and kept spreading so you've now these protests are entering their six or seventh week and and they show no signs of stopping and they seem like they're happening all around the country there's particularly moving images coming out of both not just college campuses but like high schools and i've seen you know repudiations and taking off the job and and even obscene gestures directed towards like Iranian government officials showing up at high schools i mean there's been some you talk a little bit about like the different ways that this protest has manifested itself in terms of the iconography of it the method of protest what people are calling for and how they're registering their discontent so initially this protest was about justice for masa and the elimination of the morality police and the hijab laws this was the initial cause so immediately after the protests in court is done you know at the burial ceremony of masa the women's groups and also student groups issued calls for protests and these were their demands but very quickly these demands have expanded and they're about fundamental freedoms and serious political change and you hear you know besides the slogan of the protest being echoed and a lot of these you know the in a lot of the protest that women life freedom you also hear in many of the video footage that we can especially with younger people that people are saying freedom freedom freedom free azadiy azadiy azadiy this is the main one of the main chants that keeps coming out of these protests and i think that you know in that sense it that says a lot that is a lot of younger people are involved in these protests and what they want is freedom they want to be able to choose not only how they dress but how they live their lives what they have envisioned for their own lives is very very different than what the Islamic Republic of iran has envisioned for them or is able to give them or wants to give them i think the Islamic Republic kind of wants to make it much more conservative and much more difficult and these especially the young people you know they're the generations the high schoolers and the college students they're very connected on the internet to their peers across the world so their culture and their aspirations are very similar to people their own age groups and you know their aspirations are different and what they are being offered is very different than what they're willing to settle for so they're willing to die for it it seems they're willing to die for it i don't but i think you know it's important to say that you know the initially the protests were in universities a lot of women are participating in these protests and still a lot of women are participating in these protests the fact that the initial protests were around women's issues and to ask for justice for women and this centrality of women in these protests is carried through is also a very different and very unique characteristic of this protest because we've never had a situation like this where the entire country rises up in support of a woman and it's also very creative protest when sharif university you know they were having a sit-in demanding that their fellow students would be released because so many students were arrested the guards attacked them there was tear gas bullets etc the next day high schoolers began protesting and then you saw some of those images that you talked about so every time something has been shut down or there's been an impediment people have come up with other alternative very creative ways of continuing their protests but it's also creative in the sense that i'm sure that you've seen the images that have come out the videos that have come out with women sort of creating bonfires with their head scarves dancing in the streets because dancing is also not allowed in iran dancing in the streets not allowed in iran so it's really a very i think in that sense it's a very it's civil disobedience in its most beautiful form but you've also seen a lot of pictures images that have come out and a lot of music i think the music by the one the anthem of this these protests everybody has kind of heard it but there's so many more anthems that have emerged there's so much creativity that's associated with these protests what's what is the anthem of the protest so what we have is an anthem that was written by sharvin hajipur a young man who took tweets that people had tweeted had written about why they want to see change what kind of change they want to see and it's called barreya or for because of and he talks about in this song he recounts these tweets and it's you know it starts out with so that you know for dancing in the streets for not being afraid while kissing someone you love in the streets for the afghan children for women for freedom and the end it ends with freedom so it's a lot of you know it talks about people's aspirations yeah like for the for like the reason i'm doing this the reason i'm there i want to actually play a little bit of this because it has been so prominent in the protest take a listen that's the sort of protest anthem in iran you mentioned before you know police repression and i think you know basically in any context in any society when there's uprising the police put it down i mean even you know open liberal societies that tends to be what happens but it does seem like there have been and i'm sure the Iranian government disputes this so and i obviously can't independently verify nor can i be seen use but do we have a sense of the scale of the number of people that have been arrested and or lost their lives in the in the context of these protests we do i don't know how accurate they are i think i personally think the numbers are much higher because it's very hard to verify and i said you know these protests are very decentralized they're all over the country but the latest figures that i saw are 245 people killed 41 of them have been children under the age of 18 as young as seven years old a lot of people are being killed are in their 20s and in their teens so this is significant about 10 or 15 percent are women mostly men are being killed even though it's a supposedly a women's revolution but it's more men that are being killed and 14 000 people arrested that's the figure that we have i think it's more than 14 000 you know but that's the figure that we have and people are being released with great delay before in previous protests they would be arrested and they would be released almost you know within a few days they would face court cases but they're taking longer to release them and prison conditions are awful what from what we're hearing they're overcrowded a lot of the prisons are makeshift there's not enough facilities for the numbers of people in the prisons and also a lot of people are being transferred to prison violently beaten they have injuries many of them have gunshot wounds pellet wounds with no willingness or ability on the part of prison officials to care for these wounds so it's significant in that sense i think it's really important again i should i'll just reiterate the fact that i we know we have i think some staff on the ground there but we don't have the ability or to sort of definitively establish as an independent news organization you know their numbers are arrested numbers of deaths or deaths in custody it's clear that the protests are happening across the country and i guess the next question to me is you know i referring back to that that opening monologue about you know this sense i think you know at one level i think there's a sort of like well we've seen this before and it just sort of eventually it'll you know burn itself out and then you know when i think about the summer 2020 here and i can imagine you know if you were in another country being like oh i wonder if the you know will the regime fall in the u.s. will the american governor top law you know at some level because of the mechanisms of what is still a functioning democratic system of competitive elections you know some of that was chattelled into the ballot box in 2020 and and all trump has voted out i guess the question in iran is like what comes of this and you can't predict the future but what are the possibilities what's the table of options as you see them for the results of these protests i don't know i keep initially when they happen i did a couple of interviews and i was criticized for it but really i was going based on past behavior and i said that you know the regime is so brutal that it's going to crack down on these protests and it has been brutal but they've continued nevertheless so it's hard for me to speculate i can tell that you know i think the islamic republic is going to be more brutal they announced last week that they're not going to take it anymore and ever since they announced that they've started targeting universities especially they had targeted universities before but they're targeting them they're targeting dormitories and so when you go into dormitories i think people have to understand that people living in dormitories usually are from different cities they have nowhere to go they have nowhere to hide they don't have family members in those dormitories it's not like dorms in the u.s that are so nice they're not so nice if they had family members they'd be living with their family members so these kids are like sitting ducks so they're going they're arresting them they're beating them up we've seen awful footage you know so they're going into these places where the target audience or a target group is very it's easy prey and using a lot of violence to suppress them but nevertheless the protests are still continuing they're still continuing so i have no doubt that they're going to continue to be violent and more violent as we move along i don't know what the iranya how the iranya people are going to respond it seems that they're so sick and tired of the status quo that they're continuing with their protests we'll have to see so there's either the protest will continue there'll be a lot of violence that will be suppressed or they'll just continue in this way that it's that is happening now until people maybe are tired or they retreat or maybe we'll have a revolution we'll have a change in power i don't know i think those are the three three scenarios we'll be right back after we take this quick break let's talk about the most extreme revolution i mean i think there's something to the effect that you know you see this in the french revolution you certainly see it in stalin's consolidation in the soviet union after lennon's death and even during lennon a special kind of paranoia right about about revolutionary uprising among governments that have been installed through revolutionary uprisings yes and so of course that's the case in 79 and i don't know how much how familiar our americans are with this i think everyone sort of knows that the ayatollah you know it was an exile and then came back and you know the islamic republic was founded but it was a revolutionary moment and to your point earlier there was a coalition of different groups of trade unionists leftist communists you know islamists together that proton the government through you know street protest uprising all of that so you know one imagines there's a special paranoia you see this with poutin with street protest right i mean he's you know color revolutions are sort of point of obsession for him because they have been effective in some of the neighboring countries in eastern europe and i got to imagine that there's something similar animating the powers epine in iran yes of course the iranians have been paranoid about revolutions for many years color revolutions and this is you know unfortunately this is it's clouded their judgment in terms of you know totally yeah to the demands of the people so even with this they're saying oh you know these are fabricated demands imported you know exported by the west to iran imported by the west to iran their western demands the women's demands are fabricated demands albeit it's you know the women's demands go back to the beginning of the actually before that a hundred years we or women's movement is a hundred years old so they're but they're saying it's a western demand that it's you know westerners and you know iranian expats that are trying to foment revolution inside the country and they're dismissing many of these very justified and indigenous demands and they've been doing that for years and that's why they're afraid of civil society that's why civil there was such a massive civil society crackdown for all these years and especially in the last year or so and really before ryce came to power in the last year of rohani there was a major crackdown on civil society and in particular the women's groups everybody who was working with either interrogated or arrested somehow rendered inactive and even groups that were doing very sort of though key work in the last few months before this were arrested and so the authorities have said oh we expected a protest like this by women's groups but just they used masa's death as an opportunity to do their protests and wreak their havoc earlier than had planned so they're acting as if they knew this was going to happen and they were prepared for it and it's all because of westerners that this is happening the reality is that actually part of this concern and i think part of this crackdown also comes from the issue a crisis in who's going to be the next leader of iran that the supreme leader is old there's many for many years there's been a rumor that you know he's ill and there's also been a rumor since 2009 actually before that that he wants to institute his son in his place he wants his son to take over and you know we think a lot of people think that the reason why there was such a crackdown on civil society before these protests was because they wanted to clear the way for such a decision so that there would be nobody to disagree or nobody to rise up but so this rising up has happened to their surprise and it's happened earlier i don't know what this does in terms of you know the secession issue but yes all those same paranoia that you talked about with Putin exists in iran and it has existed for 43 years can you imagine we still have revolutionary courts 43 years into this revolution and we still have revolutionary courts so that should give you a set of how what does that mean it's a revolutionary court it was set up to try people around the revolution the former i see you know people that were part of the former power structure but it still exists it's still operational how how can you have a revolutionary court 40 years after the revolution so that same paranoia is alive and well inside of iran and it's contributing greatly to this crisis of governance well and there's always i think this is true of any government even you know even democratic liberal societies but i think it's particularly true of of kind of mixed authoritarian governments along the spectrum you know china being an interesting example there's actually a lot of fair amount of protests in china and there's an interesting kind of bend but don't break often in the face of them you know there'll be protests over pollution from a plant or a corrupt local leader and sometimes there's crackdowns and sometimes there's responsiveness and sort of figuring that out has been in some ways part of the genius of the chinese state and continuing its its authority and i got to imagine that you know there's a similar choice facing you know any regime that one option is some form of reform i mean that there was or the sort of kind of glass nose period in katame and in the first decade of the 21st century that that window's been shut but it sounds like the possibility of the supreme leader how many you know succeeding you know passing away and maybe giving power to his son that it's not from their perspective a perfect moment for any kind of opening yeah well you know we iran has struggled and tried reform for over 20 years i told you about what i went to iran was the beginning of the reform period and and i'll be honest you know i think iranian people iranian women have greeted that reform largely with open arms they have used because reform is less bloody it has less costs associated with it than a revolution and people have tried to reform for over two decades now with no real results with no tangible and sustained results so i think you know that's probably why i didn't even mention it when you when you talk about the scenarios yes reform is definitely one of those scenarios i don't i can't imagine that would happen because these hardliners who are in power now have tried really really hard to consolidate their power and to gain control of every sector of government and partly i think part that's the secession issue that's forced them to do this they want to be the ones who make the decision who decide who comes to power next this has been the reason and they don't you know unfortunately they don't consider the iranian public as players except for their immediate circle of supporters and the reformists also have a similar unfortunately a similar approach that they think that they're going to play this political game and then whenever they get the upper hand they can call people in to come and support them so i think you know the idea of reform has become a less desirable option for iranians just because they've had such a bad experience with it yeah i mean i'm by no means an expert in the constitutional structure of the islamic state but it is a pretty interesting one kind of unlike anything else actually so if you could just like describe because they're sort of a you know there's essentially ostensibly a sort of multi-party democracy sitting you know underneath this sort of supreme council of clergy and a supreme leader that have a sort of interesting interaction with each other if you could just describe kind of how that works and who really controls you know who ultimately controls the state well ultimately it's the supreme leader that controls the state so you have the supreme leader who decides who can be in the assembly the guardian council who can run for the guardian council council of guardians but they get to you know provide oversight to him the assembly of experts provides oversight to the work of the supreme leader but he's the one that gets to appoint them he's the one that allows them to run to be elected so it's an indirect election process so it really is the supreme leader who has all the power i don't want to say i don't want to dismiss the president because the president also can have some say and we've seen that like the difference between the presidency of katami versus the presidency of ahamadid al-jal it's very different they have control over the executive board so they can ease certain things they can make you know create openness or allow for some limited reform but ultimately they can't change very much and because pretty much all the power lies with the supreme leader and they're you know certainly i think people have talked about having constitutional reform changing the constitution so that they take away some of the power of the supreme leader so that you know he doesn't have such ultimate power that he has to be more responsive that the oversight bodies actually conduct oversight over his responsibility or that there's a council instead of one supreme leader so there's a council but this has never happened even in you know small changes like having to do even with women's rights so we're talking about women's rights partly any change has been made throughout all of these years so yes there are political parties but there are political parties that are you know have to be approved through that same system where with the supreme leader is still the head of that system and one of the reformist political parties at the beginning criticized what happened to Massa I saw a note somebody had written on an instagram page that they had criticized and they asked for a permit to be able to hold protests but that political party has now been suspended for a number of months as a result because they asked for a permit to hold a protest which is actually allowed by the concentration people can hold protests without permits as long as they're not carrying guns but now they you have to ask for permits and nobody's giving permits and even if you ask for a permit then you're suspended so it's not a it's not an open system at all and there have been times when it's been a little bit more open but really it is you know and then I have to say that besides the supreme leader we also have the revolutionary guards who have a lot of power inside the country now so I think it's you know it's not as much a clerical regime as it is the clerics and the revolutionary guards together yeah and the revolutionary guard which is the sort of kind of a special cadre within the armed forces more broadly also have you know tremendous amounts of sort of political and monetary power or huge budgets they run sort of off-book businesses right there's sort of kind of classic oligarchs in many respects at least my understanding in many respects yes of course and you know the revolutionary guards were initially set up to protect the security of the Islamic revolution so it's not of Iran but it's the Islamic revolution but that security was external now it's internal so they have a lot of power internally and they even compete for many years they competed with the Ministry of Intelligence in terms of you know security issues so around these protests for the first time we see the Ministry of Intelligence and the revolutionary guards who came together who issued together a joint statement to say that you know this is being fomented from abroad so actually they competed for many years but around these protests they've come together so they have a meeting of the mines I guess the question is how long do you think this can go I don't know it's already gone a lot this is the longest continuous national protest I think that we've seen ever so we had the protests after the 2009 elections and they were pretty broad and especially broad in the big cities but they weren't continuous so people would you know the because there were the candidates for the presidency Musavi and Khadrubi they would you know initial days yes there were consecutive days where people protested but then they would say okay let's go we'll come back in a week right so it wasn't continuous in the sense that this is continuous so this has been the longest continuous national protest with over 130 cities involved 120 universities I don't know I don't know because I'm surprised at how long this has lasted given the incredible violence that the Iranian authorities have used so I don't want to speculate I really don't know I hope it goes until at least people get some concession whether either they get what they're what they want which is freedom to be able to decide how they want to live their lives how they want to be governed their relationship with people who govern over them what that is or if not then at least they get some serious concessions and they have some say in how they want their country and their lives to be lived.
