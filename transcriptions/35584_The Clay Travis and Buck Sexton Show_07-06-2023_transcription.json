Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Wednesday everybody welcome to the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show. I'm back from sunny St. Louis. Great to see a lot of you out there. Thank you for coming out to the event last night. I'm in solo today. Play on a much deserved vacation with the Mrs. I told them that Clay needs to experience his first professional massage of his life as he is going to a place where there is a spa. We will see if that happens. Play the people have made their wishes known. We have to see if you are in fact a massage guy. Massage aficionado. I will say I actually didn't know that spa like going to the spa was named for the city in Belgium, which is a place where there are hot springs and people used to go to convalesce. I didn't know that until I don't know last year or so. So it's crazy how we don't learn things. But there's a lot to learn today. From the news cycle. First off, we have a we didn't get into this earlier in the week. And I wanted to a federal judge has had blocked the Florida law that ends child sex transition surgery and hormones. I want to discuss that with you. New York City still going with its plan to house migrants from in private homes, according to Eric Adams. But this is also interesting to me. New York has joined a number of other cities that have decided to sue the car makers, Hyundai and Kia out of South Korea, because they've made cars too easy to steal. This is what the Democrat metropolis is have been relegated to. Now they have to actually sue the car company. It's too easy to steal your car. It's your fault. I don't know. Maybe they should sue the companies back and or sue the cities back and say, how about you enforce the law. And there'll be fewer criminals running around doing all of this. Speaking of criminals, also the Lulu lemon CEO has doubled down on the firing of two employees who tried to intervene during a mass shoplifting event. Not this isn't someone with pulling one shirt off the rack and trying to stuff it somewhere where no one will see this is just walking into a store, filling bags with expensive merchandise and walking out because nothing will happen. And the CEO of this athleisure company, Lulu lemon has said, yeah, that's right. You're not not allowed to do anything about it, which is now increasingly. This is the demand the Democrats have of you. This is the demand that they make. But we'll get into some of that. Also want to take a lot of your calls today 800 282 282 got some Chris Christie throwing punches in the presidential race. You can hear what Chris Christie says, decide for yourself whether you find any of it worthwhile or not. We have reached out to, I have to assume there's a campaign we've reached out to his people. We're waiting to hear back. We've reached out to Nikki Haley's people. I believe she will be joining us at some point. We've had Vivek on. If there's anyone that you think we need to have on, please let us know from the presidential primary side of things because I think it's important for all of you to hear. I had some people last night telling me in person that they want, they want us to have a RFK junior back on for a more, a more extensive Oh, Nikki is joining us on Tuesday. That's great. We'll have RFK junior join us. I had an appointment. So Clay had to handle that interview solo. But this time I promise you we have RFK on RFK junior on. I would be there to ask them because I have a lot of questions. People keep asking me, what do you think? What do you think about an RFK unity ticket with Trump? Or what do you think about a third way? Or is he going to shake things up? And I say, all I really know right now is he's right on COVID issues, pretty much top to bottom. And he's been more honest and forthright and law and right longer on that than almost anybody else in the political game I can think of. I mean, there are a few others who are close, but he's been very good on that. Beyond that, I'd have to look and see and ask. But see, that's the great thing. We can do that. We all get to learn here together. These people who want tremendous power, who want to lead the country or even just lead the conversation in the country. This show gives them an opportunity to tell all of you millions of American voters what it is that they really stand for. And you get to make your own decision as to whether or not you think they're being honest with you, or they straight up, will they get the job done? And how are they doing? Something else is top of mind for me right now, which this isn't something I thought I would come in today talking about. But you may have seen Elliot Page. Elliot Page is a is an actor who was an act is an actress who now is a transgender male, a female who has had top surgery, cut her cut her hair very short. You probably know her best from the movie Juno. In fact, the only thing I've ever seen her in was movie Juno, where she plays a pregnant woman. And it's worth noting that she played a pregnant woman who ended up having the baby and that alone, because there was some consternation in the in the film about whether she should actually have the child. That alone got a lot of criticism from the left. What do you mean she had a baby that wasn't planned? So, you know, demonic and monstrous, but that's a different conversation. She is out there as as the I think right now, the most famous Hollywood female to male transition individual, I think the most famous female to male trans Hollywood person. And she's given this interview, where she says that someone attacked her outside a Los Angeles hotel, it was a while ago to this is not not recent, and said, I'm going to bleeping gay bash you. That's the quote. Now, this is just I think everyone realizes a step away in terms of the plausibility when you hear this of the individuals who we found out later were two aspiring Nigerian actors, but just as small that told us that they that these two men in I think they were supposed to wearing MAGA hats at the time, but they yelled, this is a MAGA country on the streets of Chicago at two o'clock in the morning. Now, you could argue that there are a lot of parts of the country that maybe do feel quite MAGA. But I don't think that something that anybody would be shouting on the streets of Chicago in particular. You know, I don't think anyone's running around yelling in Brooklyn. This is MAGA country. The whole thing it was so absurd from the start, which is why I didn't go back and check this when I was doing a radio six to nine for premier networks. I had a podcast, but the title of the show, which is the title of the podcast, Josie Smollett is lying to you. It's like the first week that thing came out. But I bring up the Elliot, which we all know now is true. It's true to the point of it's shocking that anybody went along with it. But there were a lot of people who did, including Kamala Harris. Remember that? Oh, Josie Smollett, the greatest guy horrible. This thing happened to him, you know, the the attack on the street. Anyway, so Elliot Page says this, no one brought it up at the time. But why do I care enough to talk to you about this? Why do I care enough to bring this up with you? Because usually celebrities saying things that are untrue or dumb or a combination of the two is not really news. Well, because you'll notice there is a wave of hysteria now, because for the first time the trans agenda of the Democrat party, I don't even think it should really just be referred to as the agenda of the left. Because it's the Democrat party. The trans agenda of the Democrat party has come up against legal resistance in some states. It has come up against some states that have passed laws saying when it comes to children, we are not going to allow under the guise of medicine. Where do this medical procedure that they're doing on children? How many years of study have they done? What are the long term implications? And what's really going on here? No, no, no, suddenly it is the standard of care for some young person who is having a psychological and identity crisis. And there's pushback. There's finally meaningful pushback, which is why you now have the hysteria coming out now is a moment and some of you are going to tell me also Ellen Page has a book that has just launched. What a great way to get publicity. You claim that there is a somebody yelling, yelling, yelling hateful things at you. And the human rights campaign yesterday declared for the first time in over in its over 40 years of operation, the human rights campaign has said that there is a state of emergency right now for LGBTQ plus Americans. It has issued a guidebook alongside this warning because they want people to be safe when traveling to places in the country that don't Florida is one of them. Let's just be that they've attacked Florida. We've seen what was it? Uh, senior member of the ND NAACP attacked Florida. Neither human rights campaign saying for LGBTQ plus people, there are places you can't go and can't be safe. Notice the extent they're willing to go to the hysteria around stopping minors from making life altering body mutilation surgery and also the hormones, you know, the hormones that people are taking can they'll say, Oh, some of it is reversible. They don't, they don't know really what it does is someone over the long time, over the long term. But because that is not just treated as though it is the next great civil rights struggle of our era by everybody in the country, because there are parents out there in particular to say, my 13 year old is being told to do this by school. Basically, that's the most common place that it happens. And I don't want the state to weigh in and say that this is now gender affirming care. I'd also have a question for all the people who push this stuff. If it's gender affirming care for the transition, what is it when there's the D transition? Is that gender D affirming? How does that work? Gender negating? Have they figured that one out? Anyone who says that's not a problem or an issue doesn't know what they're talking about or is lying to you. There's a Navy seal. Kristen Beck. Now Chris Beck was always Chris Beck became Kristen Beck. I believe now Chris Beck. I saw him recently on a podcast D transition. This is the biggest mistake of his life. His life. Yeah. How much you heard about that in the mainstream media? And that was an adult. That was an elite warrior. That was somebody who was having a psychological crisis. Do you hear anything about it? If it's gender affirming care, I need some of the talking heads who are so depraved and just remorseless about this. Think about some of the people who are pushing this. Do any of you really think that Joe Scarborough and Mika really believe that 14 year old should be trying to mess with their genders? Nobody really thinks they believe that. But will they say that on MSNBC because the latte drinking audience of Libs wants to hear it? Yes. Does it matter that this affects the perception nationally when CNN and the New York Times and MSNBC will talk more about CNN later. That places in total free fall. Yay. But does it matter when all of this is going on to them? No, they don't care. Just about the paycheck. Just about the ratings. Really more just about the paycheck because these are all corporate media institutions that they can decide even if you have bad ratings, if you're singing the right tune, they can keep you around. But there's so much dishonesty. There's so so much obvious propaganda around this issue. And I've never heard anyone explain that. What do they say about the D transition? How can you be affirming a gender that was yours since birth? You just didn't know it until you're a teenager or adulthood and then have the reality that a pretty good percentage actually realize that was a mistake. So what was the affirmation if the affirmation was wrong? Why is this important? Well, when you're 15 and you don't know anything about anything, really, you shouldn't be making decisions that you have to look back on the rest of your life with tremendous regret because medical professionals were too cowardly to do anything for you. Your own parents either pushed it, which does happen sometimes. It just saw. She's an actress from Transformers as a photo going around everywhere. She's got three young boys. I'd guess their ages. I don't know. Look like they're eight, 10 and 12. I'm not sure what three jobs, something like that. All dress and present as girls. Megan Fox is that Megan Fox? Megan Fox. Yeah. Photos. Three boys all think they're girls. Does anyone think that that's because maybe that particular parent is a lib who has adopted this and pushed us on our own children as a lifestyle, as a fashion that makes her feel good about herself. Okay. Well, if you don't believe that, what are the statistics? What are the chances? Three for three, all three boys. It's pretty low. People say, well, but it happens to parents that have that are that are conservative happens. Yeah, because then as the kids get older, they go to these institutions. They go to, they go to grammar schools and high schools and colleges and corporate America and the media, they're all telling them, oh, your gender is this fluid thing and it changes and you'll be celebrated for it. And a lot of parents feel powerless about it. A lot of parents feel like, well, what I was talking to some of them last night. I was talking to a social worker last night and saying, lose about this. I told him he should call in some time. He was saying what they're doing to kids, what they're doing to children right now, these institutions is monstrous. But they're the ones telling you that, oh my gosh, there's a threat now. The community is under threat. If you won't go along with gender transition surgeries for 15 year olds or 12 year olds, monstrous. That's what they want to tell you. We have to hold the line for sanity somewhere. And I think that this isn't even something we could view as a victory. This is just more question of, are we refusing to concede utter defeat on this issue? Let me know what you think about all this 800-282-2882. You know, inflation and prices are rising. And what the current stock market volatility retirement accounts are not in great shape.

And we're about to talk about the allegations against Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, the Biden family, an FBI source, an FBI whistleblower and more representative Anna Paulina Luna of Florida is with us. Congresswoman, appreciate your being here. And thanks for making the time. Tell us what are we? We haven't talked about this yet on the show. So I need you to set this up for everybody a little bit. What is going on with the house looking into bribery allegations, the whistleblower and Biden? Oh my gosh. It's, um, I don't know if we have enough time, but to kind of chalk it up in a nutshell, long story short, um, the House Oversight Committee has been working to collect evidence to prove that this administration, this family and Joe Biden specifically has indeed unbing guilty of public corruption. And we found that we had recently, just a couple weeks ago, the peanut bank records from four different banks of about 20 that we suspect where we found that the Biden family was receiving money from foreign nationals, basically using and selling the Biden name in order to personally enrich themselves. And they moved these funds between 20 companies. So that comes a couple weeks ago. And then this week, representative Comer had requested a document from the FBI that basically outlined and proved that Biden as vice president in the Obama administration had received a $5 million transfer from a foreign national in an effort to sway American policy. And ultimately what ended up happening is the FBI not only refused to hand over this document, it's not a classified document. But then they also too said that their own source who has been a human source with the FBI for over 10 years, very credible. They've even paid this source over six figures for the information that they have that they were and they had credible fears that if this individual was a mask to representative Comer and oversight that they had credible fears that this person would be killed. So the the allegation, I mean, do we know any of the specifics, Congresswoman, about what was there, what the quid pro quo was? I mean, you know, what level of detail have we been able to get about what this FBI source was alleging? What we do know is that this individual has proof that there's a $5 million bank transaction that at the time, vice president Biden received for his word to influence American foreign policy. And what I can tell you is that we've been trying very hard to get this document and that the FBI has done well to us. That's actually part of the reason why we are now tomorrow meeting to work on the markup for the bill to actually hold the director of the FBI in contempt of Congress. Now holding the FBI director in contempt wouldn't result in any actual legal action against him because the DOJ is Biden, right? So that's not really going to change anything. Why isn't the FBI sharing information with Congress on an oversight committee? I mean, I remember from back in the CIA days, what the oversight committee wants, the oversight committee is supposed to get. That's that's a question that we're all asking. And in my opinion, Buck, just based on what I have witnessed, what I've heard and what I've personally seen over the last, you know, couple of months of being in office, the FBI has some serious issues. I mean, they have a role right now that's currently leaking information to 100 Biden about his own case that the FBI is investigating. So I think that we're at the point now where, you know, the Republican party, although we don't control Senate or the White House, we do control the House and, you know, there has to be some peace behind a lot of what's happening because exactly like you had mentioned, you know, these three letter agencies seem to think that they're not held accountable to anyone. And really the last line of defense for the American people is Congress. And so they need to be held accountable. We need to be subpoenaing all this information. And so Representative Comer has been doing a good job with them to help us, Representative Jim Jordan, who's ahead of House Judiciary. But right now, I mean, the more information that we put out, Buck, even just on those bank transactions that I had outlined earlier, I mean, MSNBC, CNN, and ABC refused to even cover it. It was only Fox News that was covering it. So they're really trying to suppress this information. In my opinion, the corporate establishment media is working with the DNC and some of these three letter agencies to run cover for Biden. Speaking to Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, and Congresswoman Hunter Biden, Clay and I talk about this a lot. He still thinks that they may drop real charges, not some deferred prosecution pays a fine, make the whole thing go away, but that there'll be a real charge against Hunter Biden. Based on what you're seeing, the information that you've seen already, do you think that's possible? And also, how could there not be unless the system is corrupt? I think that's the question a lot of people are asking me. If you get paid millions of dollars, you don't declare you don't pay taxes on it. I thought that was kind of a big problem. It is a big problem. And I don't think that we will have any charges brought until, you know, we have a new Republican president. And unfortunately, that's what it's coming down to, because many of these people that are appointed are indeed appointed because of their political leanings and support of that administration. And right now, exactly like you had stated, I mean, there's so much information on Hunter Biden. And yet they're refusing to act just like the FBI had this information about Joe Biden. And they've had it since 2016 previously, and they chose to sat on it. They had it in 2020. They chose to sat on it and they're not doing anything with it. So they have the evidence. They have the testimony of people that are bringing it forward of the, of not just the human source, but there's multiple whistleblowers that have come forward about the Biden family and about Joe Biden specifically. And it's really interesting because one of our, our best whistleblowers that actually had proof that Joe Biden and his family was receiving illegal, basically pay for play schemes. The DOJ is now trying to charge as an illegal arms trafficker, even though he's never sold or tried to broker any deals with any four organizations for arms. So they are, in my opinion, using their position to not just intimidate, but to prevent people from coming forward with the threat of ruining their lives. How do we get any accountability in the FBI? People ask me this question, Congresswoman, and they'll ask usually in the context of the intel community CIA. And I said, look, you'd have to have leadership that would understand the institution well enough that they would know how to change the culture. But you'd also have to get rid of a lot of people, a lot of programs and cut a lot of funding. Do you think there's stomach for that in the next, in a next Republican administration, you think that, from what you're hearing from some of your fellow members of Congress on the Republican side, at least, there would be a willingness to do something about that. I mean, I remember when Eric Holder was held in contempt, when he was attorney general, right? I mean, you know, we do what we can, but that's not going to change that much. Correct. I think that it really depends on who the president is. You know, in my opinion, we need a fire breathing dragon who is really aggressive on foreign policy and wants to actually, you know, do the right thing and help end some of the corruption. Exactly like you stated, you know, I think people in general, I'm frustrated. I know people are as well because it's like, well, we know this is happening, but like what's going to change? And it's kind of, you know, it feels like sometimes a defeatist perspective because it's just egregious what they're doing. But, you know, I think it's going to really depends on what happens next administration. I'm sure you saw what happened with the debt negotiations. And I think and I voted no against raising the debt feeling for trillion because again, like you stated, cutting funding is a huge deal. And yet it didn't seem like there was as aggressive action towards some of these three letter agencies that could have been there. And so I think that it is people one holding your representatives accountable because it does matter you do have a voice and your representatives will respond, especially if people are calling in, you know, but also too, it does depend on leadership. And that's why I think 2024 is going to be some foreign. What do you think is the most important issue or to that the Republican Congress, under Speaker McCarthy's leadership, can realistically achieve between now and election day? Well, I thought the first one was everything with the debt ceiling and that's kind of gone to pass. But I think it's really going to be using these hearings to hold people accountable. I would love to see an impeachment of my orchas and some of these bureaucrats have their positions completely defunded, which is something that we can do under the holding rule. So I think that that's really going to be something that, you know, we're a very slim majority and it's projected, I think, just kind of with everything happening with members stepping down and whatnot. So we'll probably have like a three person majority by September. And so every single Republican in this conference is really going to have to work together and have their voices be heard. Otherwise, we won't get anything done. But it is going to be interesting to kind of see, you know, we are. I've never been so happy to have the founding fathers engineer our country, the way that they did with the checks and balances. But I am so happy that we're at least in the majority right now, because we can stop a lot of the bad legislation that this administration is trying to push through. Florida representative Anna Paulina Luna, Congresswoman. Thanks for being with us. Appreciate it. Thanks, Buck. I always want to call our Anna, but you know, Congresswoman, thank you. Thank you very much. So here we go. We have more information about the Biden crime family. But we keep running into this roadblock. I feel the frustration that a lot of you have. And as I said, when I was seeing some of our listeners out in St. Louis last night, and they're asking me questions on stage. And then, you know, after after we did our our live event, and I look at them and they ask these questions and I say, I, I hope we can change it. I don't know, because I'm not going to say, Oh, yeah, everything's going to be fine. You know, the three letter agencies there, they've learned their lesson. They haven't learned their lesson. They haven't changed. All they thought they had to do was wait it out under Trump. It's one of the most true things that I ever heard about the State Department specifically. It's a, it's a joke, but I think it's really more a mission statement than a joke, which is that presidents come and go, but the State Department is forever. It's what the bureaucrats there say. I don't know what jokes they make about the CIA. They're probably very funny too. But point here is, nothing changed. Nothing changed in those institutions, not really not at all. And these are areas of our of our civic life where there has to be some degree of good faith in operation. This is why prosecutors and the Soros back prosecutors and the concerted effort by Democrats to undo the rule of law in these cities is so destructive because there's not a lot you can do when a prosecutor decides that he's not going to or she's not going to enforce the law. You can vote them out. And this is really what we're talking about here. Well, okay, you can achieve political power to try some reforms. But in the case of a three letter agency, it's more than one individual. That's the problem. It's not just one Soros prosecutor. It's an army of them, so to speak, that are embedded in these places. And not just, not just the, you know, the famous or the most famous of these three letter agencies, CIA FBI. They're in the EPA. They're in DHS. They're all over the place. They're in a whole range of these institutions. And how do we clean things up? How do we make things better in them? And I get asked this question, I say you would have to have a Congress and an executive that was willing to do things that would be unpopular with some folks in the moment. Oh my gosh, look what you're doing. There's a there's a old, again, another old joke, but the fireman first strategy might have heard of this before. It's whether you're going to cut municipal funding. You see variations of this all over the country. The second you say, hey, can we, can we cut this program or that program? So those, oh, no, you're, you're, that's going to result. You're going to, you're cutting the fire department. You're cutting the police department, right? Oh, no, you can't do that. None of us are going to be safe. You see this with the budget negotiations to every dollar of additional spending beyond the preset spending is sacred. That's the approach the Democrats take. It's, it's maniacal, but it's effective. So you would have to come in and say, we are going to, we're going to cut FBI funding, cut IRS funding. Democrats, as you've noticed, they want to massively increase IRS funding. That is not an accident. That's not incidental. Because the funding of the IRS to make it the tax stazzy serves multiple purposes for them. They use it as a weapon against their enemies. All of a sudden, you know, people are going to get audited who are, I don't know, talk radio hosts, stuff like that. And also pushing for even more revenue for an overtax population and pushing even more revenue out of the 50% of the population that pays all of the taxes. That's the plan. That's what they're doing right now. 800-282-2882. I do want to talk to you about the CNN collapse because here is my thesis for you all in that. Trump broke CNN twice, twice, not once, but twice, which is amazing. And I will explain, I'll explain that in just a second. On 9.11, 2,977 people lost their lives. And today, 9.11 related illnesses continue to take lives. Yet a whole generation knows little to nothing about our nation's darkest day. The Tunnel of the Towers 9.11 Institute is writing this wrong by educating kids in kindergarten through 12th grade about 9.11. Their nonfiction, first person accounts are told through videos and the Discovering Heroes book series. These accounts are moving and unparalleled. Kids won't forget these true stories. The Institute offers full curriculum units with scripted social studies lessons, activities, and background for teachers. There's a speaker's bureau for classrooms with access to 9.11 first responders, survivors, and loved ones. To never forget, we must educate future generations. Let's help our nation honor its vow. Last weekend, my wife, Carrie, participated in Tunnel of the Towers Foundation climb, going up 104 floors of one world power with the support of so many of you. She broke through her goal and all that money goes right to Tunnel of the Towers and its incredible mission. Last night in St. Louis, we raised over $1,000 just because of the attendees who came in and we asked them to donate. So this is a mission we're on all the time because we want to help Tunnel of the Towers. Join us, please donate $11 a month. I donate $11 every month, $11 a month, t2t.org. That's t the number two t dot org. The voices of sanity in an insane world play Travis and bucks, sexton. All right, welcome back. We're going to talk about the continued collapse, the ongoing free fall. Because it's free fall. And CNN having a rough time as it deserves to. It really disgraced itself during the Trump administration. The egos over there starting with Zucker, the ousted head of CNN who was conducting a longtime affair with his number two at CNN. Sure, she got the job. There was no favoritism there at all. But you will recall they never could get over being called fake news. They never could get past the ego blow of Trump saying what was just true. I always also like to remind everybody that the usage of fake news as a term by Trump was response a response to what the Democrats were doing. Democrats were to undermine the MAGA voters of 2016, saying they believe fake news online as in, you know, stories about, you know, Hillary's actually a lizard person from outer space. Oh, also, do we want to talk UFOs today or later this week? I'm just putting that out. I'm sitting here and I'm open to anything. I'm open to anything that has evidence and some people I really like and trust and think are very smart are big UFO believers. And I need so we need to get somebody on here. We could just play be so where are we with this exactly the UFO thing? Anyway, we'll talk more about that. But back to I just put that out there. I'm with you solo for the next couple of days. Clay's on a couple's retreat is with the misses and some friends. And he's taking some days off to rest recoup and we'll be back in action with us on Monday. So I'm going to be with you a few days. I think we should talk about UFOs a little bit getting all this attention. I sit here as a hey team was it Mulder or Scully who was the skeptic. I never watched enough of the X files. I should probably go back. Scully. So I'm is that the lady? I'm about to I'm apparently you know, breaking news on the lady here. Yeah, I'm Scully. I'm Scully in this one. I don't see the UFO thing. I don't know. I will tell you this. I don't know if my family's listening this at all. My family is split on this one. My immediate family were split on this one. There are a couple of skeptics and there are some there are some Mulders. There are some true believers about the UFO thing. I sit here and I go, what am I missing? You know, if it's make the little flying saucer appear somewhere and and I don't even care if little green men get out or if it's even just like amoeba's under a microscope, but just show me the show me the UFO. And I saw me you were probably thinking I'm crazy because there's all the dots on the screens and stuff and others you think yeah, of course, Buck, it's amazing. Isn't this debate that we're having over UFOs because right? There's a guy who came forward. Oh, yeah, producer Ali telling me in New York City, the sky because of the fires in forest fires in Canada, the air quality in New York City is the worst in the whole country right now. I'll tell you when I was in China back in 2019, so right before the I was in I was in China right before the pandemic. And I was there for a week, we can change. And and you'd see the the the pollution I was in Shanghai and the whole sky and everything from just the pollution gathered, it was really dystopian, unsettling. And I thought a lot about China was very dystopian. I'll just add that I thought this is not gonna this is not heading to a happy place everybody. But that's not a surprise. But New York City's what's up? Oh, oh, Pence. So we want to Brisha Mike is saying all hell's breaking loose because Pence, Pence is announced. So now, you know, the skies, it is a little bit like in Ghostbusters, right, when the skies turned like was a purple or something. And because the keymaster and gozer and all that. So Pence is a Pence has announced we played some of that announcement for you. See it. Oh, we do if you're a Pence, we have some Pence people who have called in please stay with me. I will get you. I just want to talk about the CNN thing for a second. Because I know there have to be some Pence people out there. I also note that there are a fair amount of there are a fair amount of people that seem really, really anti-Pence. I would like to hear from them too. I'm Republicans. So I know I know there are people that think Mike Pence is great. And he's their candidate. And some of them have already called in. So we've got we've got proof of life on that one, right? We know they exist. And I also am curious to hear for anyone who feels very strongly against Mike Pence. Because I would guess that for a lot of the GOP base right now, and for a lot of you, this is my guess I could I could be off. Pence is just not the guy for the moment. And so him running, you know, you think it's going to be a little bit like Nikki Haley running or you're not deeply anti and you're not pro, you're just kind of meh, whatever about it. That's my guess. I could be wrong. So that's why I put it out to you and I want to know. But back to CNN, the fake news controversy from the very beginning. So they were saying fake news, Trump turned it around on them. And he really forced a journalistic self-immolation over at CNN. I mean, they just they they lit their own building on fire. They destroyed it as a as a a temple as a monolith of supposed journalism. CNN was gone. It turned into ever Jim Acosta. And and although he wasn't he lost his White House hard pass. Oh, the first amendment is dead. Jim Acosta has to show an ID and check in before he gets access to the West Wing, which a lot of people don't have access to. But you know, the whole thing, right? And and you saw all these different hosts who were supposedly giving you the news who were really just boring opinion hosts reading off a prompter who don't have much to say other than Trump is Hitler. Well, that in the post Trump era, predictably resulted in the professional defenestration of a number of senior CNN figures, no, most notably Jeff Zucker. And and then Chris Cuomo, bro Cuomo, was like, Hey, like, what do you mean? I can't advise my brother? No, not when you're going to be reporting on your brother and doing interviews with him at night. That's not telling the audience about it. That that could be kind of an issue. Thank you. Defenestration want to go with that as word of the day. Crazy historical fact, defenestration of Prague, you know, those guys lived. I'm pretty sure it was because there was a manure cart under the window, something like that. Someone could fact check me on that one, but the the guys who were defenestrated, which then led to massive warfare throughout Europe, but they lived that even though they're thrown out the window. So CNN had this whole problem, and it was because Trump broke them. I mean, he just spiritually, emotionally defeated CNN as an entity. That that is, I think, beyond dispute at this point, because to to go against him, they decided that there were no rules and they exposed to ever they exposed themselves for everyone to see as abject partisan hacks. Okay, that is CNN destruction number one. CNN then tried to limp along and do a redo with this guy Chris licked the big piece in the the Atlantic, which if you want to know what B minus students from Northeastern lib schools and coastal coastal universities, this the if you want to know what they read or pretend to read, it's the Atlantic, they read one article from it once a month, maybe they can say I read the Atlantic, but I did read the Atlantic. So I'm admitting that to all of you. So I could read this article, and it was a big profile with a lot of access to the head of CNN. And what was interesting was that first off, it makes clear CNN destruction 2.0 was, you guessed it, Trump's town hall, the Trump town hall, they just lost their minds over there. All the different anchors, they're all crying about it. And how could we have platformed them? And the fact that you had all these pro Trump people in the audience and Caitlyn Collins gets steamrolled the whole thing. And so much so that he Chris licked this guy who came over from he was at morning Joe and then he was at the cold, no, not the cold bear. What's the the late show with cold bear, whatever that is, right? Stephen Colbert show. And then he moved over to take over CNN, it didn't last much more than a year. This is why he didn't last though. This I don't know. I don't know this guy. Never I never talked to him. I talked to Jeff Zucker a bunch of times when I was over as a contributor at CNN before I realized they had all completely lost their minds and hated Republicans and any Republican in the Trump era who still was going on CNN, I was like, you're just get you're just getting punched in the face. There's no point. The audience hates you. They're not listening. The anchors hate you. They all despise you. So that's I turned down a job at CNN without a job in TV because Trump had just won the election. They wanted me to stay around. I said, no, I'd rather just do my own thing. Thank you. Because I was pro Trump. I voted for him. I was so psyched that he had won. And I was like, I don't I don't want to go on CNN. So they can be like, so like, explain to us like why you think that like voting for Hitler is not voting for Hitler. And I just didn't really need that in my day to day. But Chris licked this guy ended up sounding not that crazy. Here's from the article. I think he's a live, but he's not totally insane. He said apparently to CNN staff, do not virtue signal. Tell the truth. Ask questions getting at the truth, not collecting facts for one side or collecting facts for another side. Ask the tough questions. It's an incredibly sensitive divisive issue of when there's a Venn diagram the country can agree on if we get there with the facts. Yeah, this guy is gone because he showed up at CNN and he was like, everybody knows that this place turned into a laughing stock and a partisan, you know, clown show. Can we at least get back to some basic reality and CNN with its collective Biden voting, Hillary and Obama loving voice, shouted out, no, we shall not return to the fact, sir, you shall be fired. So that's what CNN did. And it's because the Trump town hall two times, two times CNN has fallen victim to the Trumpster. So that is what happened. You know, when you're younger, you're invincible, whatever life serves you, you take it on. But as you get older, you start feeling the creaks and cracks in your body, especially after exercise.

Play on vacation for a few days. We'll be back with us on Monday. Send you all his best regards. This is buck. I'm rocking at solo today and holy smokes. I am getting inundated with photos from the big apple New York City in Gulf in a orange haze because of these Canadian thanks Canada. These Canadian wildfires and the photos are really stark stuff. It looks a little bit like what you would think the atmosphere on Mars might be or something if you were to be walking around. Kind of reminds me of the great smog of London of 19.2. I'm sure if you're a watcher of the crown and somebody who watches that series you would know about the great smog of London in 1952. But it's a bit like that in terms of what it looks like outside of New York City. So I hope it just passes quickly. I'm friends and family are telling me they're kind of avoiding going outside. One of our producers Greg in New York City says that he even makes your eyes water a little bit when you're outside. It's not not good. So I hope that all of a cleanup. I can assure you that printing presses so to speak are getting fired up with articles about how this is climate change. Climate change. So how is it clients a fire with wind that has blown the smoke from the fire south because of very big fire or series of fires. Well, they'll say that you know why the fire happened because they're the grass or you know the not fauna the flora you know the plants and things were dry because oh everything's more dry because of climate change. Usually the most I think the most common cause of forest fires is human meaning people light the fire either on purpose or by accident but they'll be articles about the climate change situation and how that that ties into this. In fact, one of my constant frustrations I do like to watch the occasional nature program. You know I've always since I was a little kid my mom could even attest to this. I think I wrote in the first grade that I want to be an animal conservationist when I grew up. I didn't even know how to spell conservationist but I learned the term from watching so many national geographic specials. I had all of them on VHS. I had the National Geographic on Jim Panzis, the National Geographic on sharks, the National Geographic. Some of you know what I'm talking about. They actually had a pretty great series back in the day and this is before you could use drones and automatic cameras for everything so the photographers had to get up close and it was you know the footage was a little bit more exciting because now I mean you know they they basically attach a GoPro to a great white shark's head and you know you see everything that's going on but back in the day the photographers had to do a little more. Why am I telling you about animals? I actually just ran myself so far off the tracks that I can't even remember animal conservationist. Oh that I can't win. I did this to myself last night at St. Louis too. I went off a tangent of a tangent and I had to ask somebody in the front row what was my main thesis here and they reminded me and I stayed on track. I was fine but you can't watch any any programming National Geographic style you know earth and these things on Netflix without getting a lecture on climate change. At some point the voice over will be like but what is really causing the destruction of the you know double-quested cormorant climate change. You said that you're like really? Really? Yeah sure that's what's causing it. It's always climate change. Yeah so they'll be writing about that I am sure in the next 24 hours but how this somehow tied to it. But yeah it's worse today than it is yesterday. Evernthalmi New York City is in rough shape. St. Louis speaking of cities. I was there last night and it was great to go check in hang out with our affiliate there in St. Louis. Appreciate everybody listening and I did a live event and it was interesting to me because my it was my first time in city limits. The only time I had been in the St. Louis area before was actually to interview Mike Pence as part of the hill tv project at the hill.com that I launched a few years ago. I was a host there but I went to interview Mike Pence and I went right from the airport to some venue outside the city and so I never really experienced St. Louis at all. So it was my first time being in that city and as you know I had the experience. I'm hitting the Midwest tour a little bit more these days. I've realized as a New Yorker I've spent obviously a ton of time in the Northeast in New York and DC. Now I live in Florida. I've spent a lot of time in the the South for one family I family in the South in Virginia but also some of the government work that I did took me to Virginia and other places military facilities where I would spend weeks on end and then the West Coast I spent a lot of time in California. I haven't spent as much time in the midwest as I would like to so I'm going to be spending a little more time and I went to Chicago last year for the first time and I had that experience where I turned to Kerry at the silver bean in Millennium Park and I said is it really what if the crime here is really as bad as everyone says and then in about an hour and a half later there was a fatal shooting broad daylight right next to where we were right there at the bean. 16 year old shot and killed another 16 year old and and I said okay oh yeah I know this the violence here is is bad really bad not even limited to certain areas of the city that need additional attention so I was in St. Louis and I'm excited to I see the arch I'm excited to check out the greatest barbecue and and all the different things that St. Louis has to offer and I get into the the I'm going to this station radio station I get into the uber and I say to the gentleman who's driving me we're chatting up I'm chatting up a little bit we're talking because I always like to get a little bit of a sense of you know what's going on the city so he said oh we've got great baseball here and everything else and I said so well what should I know where should I go and he says well first of all don't go out walking by yourself at night downtown I look at him I'm like wait a second we're in we're in downtown like right now you're telling me that you don't think if you're you're a lifetime St. Louis and you're telling me you don't think it's safe for me to walk around in the downtown of the city at night he's like I wouldn't do it I said okay that's not and then I went I saw more I saw a whole bunch of folks last night you know hundreds of people came out and we we got to chat and they all told me one after another when I shared this experience with them I said yeah yeah that's unfortunate the reality of of that city now it has become and it has been for years it is very dangerous now they mostly pretty much all of them I think I met in person live in the suburbs and it's nice and quiet it's pretty and they have land and you know they're there so so for them this city isn't a day-to-day problem for them but they're very aware of the fact that St. Louis has a very high homicide rate depending on the year and and the numbers you use it's usually in the top three four shootings in the country I think it might have even been number one in the last couple of uh sometime in the last couple of years it's usually St. Louis um I think the Orleans is usually on that list as well uh Baltimore is always pretty high on that list there are a number of these cities and I just remember thinking to myself here I'm a I'm a visitor to this place I'm all excited to be here I'm excited to spend some time with with uh Missourians and talk to them about what they think's going on the country and just have that experience and to hear that the the the largest city in the state has this problem to me it's just a shouldn't this be in all hands-on deck situation right shouldn't this be the primary focus of the uh city let you know city legislature the mayor's office that everybody because it's a great city it's right on Mississippi River it's got great food it's got great sports I'm like you know you fix they've got all these big employers I learned a lot I I always find it whenever I go somewhere the first time I I approach it like a CIA officer you know area familiarization right I approach it well I just want to know as much as I can about the place in a short time so I have some sense of what's going on and there's so much cool stuff happening there and this is the same thing when I was in Chicago I had the same now I've spent time in other cities that have high levels of of uh violence and you know that's unfortunate there's a lot of similarities that you experience here but I'm in Chicago I think this is Chicago is beautiful it is a beautiful city is a historic city it has amazing food it has really cool culture I'm like this places I was also there in a 75 degree day which everyone tells me is you know if you're gonna see Chicago go in at 75 degrees but it was amazing but it has too high of a crime rate and it is the single biggest anxiety that I think the residents there deal with day in and day out and certainly same thing in in St. Louis and I see I just say what is it going to take what threshold has to be crossed you know they had uh Kim Gardner was a Soros back prosecutor there she's out they said the new prosecutor I think is a little bit better the new sort of main city prosecutor but what does it take for some of these democrat enclaves entirely controlled by democrats you notice this is it's a recurring theme it's a recurring story you have a major city you have a crime rate that is far too high you have far too many people and disproportionately young black men losing their lives to violence on the streets and the democrat party does what what is the answer to this they talk about racism in the police department and the need for more community investment this isn't fixing anything neither of those things are fixing anything and really and the first one about racism in the police department is just a distraction it's meant to avoid dealing with the real issue which is how are laws being enforced you know they told me that some of the some of the residents again told me that there are a lot of low level traffic infractions that in downtown St. Louis aren't observed at all meaning if you if someone just flies through a red light they won't pull them over they don't care now I don't know if this is just their perception or if this is almost administrative reality now with law enforcement there I do know that in Chicago you're not allowed to put chase somebody on foot really for a whole range of reasons so if a felon decides to run the cops aren't supposed to give chase well that makes the in a whole range of circumstances not all circumstances but that makes it a lot easier to be a criminal doesn't it oh wait they're the cops well i'm gonna run and they're not going to be able to drive after me and they're probably not even going to be able to chase after me on foot because that's not a department policy it sounds like that can't be true but these are the laws that have been and these are the policies that have been implemented in these places and and I just I put this out there because to me this should be one of the biggest issues this should be one of the biggest drivers for independent votes to go to republicans the the only answer is republicans who are going to actually enforce the law yeah everything else is noise and so I don't know what that means for st. Louis and for Baltimore and for New Orleans and for these these democrat single party enclaves but for the rest of the country and in states where there's still some sanity at the state legislative level you have to just you have to enforce the law and that means all the laws you have to I see this trend this troubling trend of people who when the police pull them over you've probably seen this on instagram and it's on tick tock all the time now and they view it as a game to just be as antagonistic to the police as possible and refuse to obey any commands and dare them to do something about it this is a widespread attitude i'm telling you you see it's all over the internet now you know that the officer will say you know you were speeding and you're like you know and your registrations expired and i need you to provide idea to say no not going to do it the officer says come on you know i'll pull you out of the car no and maybe they start you know cursing at the officer or whatever that mentality that stuff at the lower level is the foundation of the degradation of the rest of the society around it through higher crime the little stuff turns into the big stuff when everyone thinks that they can just well whenever thinks that the laws aren't going to be enforced the criminals take advantage of it and there's no answer from democrats on this at all ending mass incarceration was not an answer it actually made things worse ending mass incarceration which didn't even really happen but when i when i go to these great american cities whether it's san francisco or new york or or chicago or st louis or wherever and i see this playing out it is just so frustrating and i i almost wish that we could say can we put aside all the rest of politics for a second here libs democrats can we sit down and get serious you have to enforce the law and you have to punish criminals who refuse to obey laws or else this never gets better or else people are going to be telling visitors to otherwise great cities you can't walk around downtown at night by yourself it's not safe that's just wrong that's not where we should be in 2023 as a country anywhere in this country and it really it is a question of political ideology and i'm just going to say it is the fault of democrats that this is where we are now straight up we all know it so let's call it out uh 800-282-2882 if you have any thoughts on the conversation we're having here on crime in cities by all means give us a ring you have team at my pillow is on a mission to outfit your home with one comfortable item after another the pillows you sleep on the slippers you wear around the house the geese a dream sheets that you sleep on and now guess what the towels that you use daily their latest offers on a six-piece towel set set is made with usa cotton making it extremely absorbent yet still providing that soft feel you look for in a towel the set comes with two bath two hand towels and two washcloths typically retailing for $99.98 for a short time you can get this set on clearance for $25 with promo code and buck that's over 70% in savings define this offer just go to my pillow dot com click on the radio listener special square to get this clearance price of $25 on the towel set enter promo code clay and buck or call 800-792-3269 that's 800-792-3269 for this special and many more from the front lines of freedom and truth play Travis and bucks sexton type one diabetes can happen at any age are you at risk screen it like you mean it because if just one person in your family has type one you're up to 15 times more likely to get it too so screen it like you mean it one blood test could help you spot it early and the more you know the more you can do so don't wait talk to a doctor about screening tap now or visit screen for type one dot com to get more info and screen it like you mean it pure talk america's wireless companies on a mission to alleviate 10 million dollars in military debt by veterans day but they need your help pure talk will donate a percentage of every new order to this great cause when you switch to their super fast super dependable 5g network talk text plenty of data starts at just 20 bucks a month so do this right now go to pure talk comm slash clay and when you switch to pure talk you'll be helping military members in need that's pure talk comm slash clay we all look forward to the freedom of retirement but who wants to wait till then to kick back and chill out this summer get into a retirement state of mind with core's light the beer that's made to chill it's crisp refreshing and pairs perfectly with all your summer plans or lack thereof hey this is retirement after all this summer chill like you're retired with core's light get core's light delivered straight to your door with drizzly or insta cart by going to core's light dot com slash refreshing celebrate responsibly course brewing company golden colorado"
