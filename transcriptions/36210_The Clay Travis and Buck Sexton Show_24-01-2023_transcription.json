    "text": " Hi, it's Carol Markowitz. I'm so excited to launch my very own podcast. We'll talk to the biggest names and politics, news, entertainment, and get to the truth of the issues that affect your family and have some fun along the way. It's the Carol Markowitz Show, part of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Podcast Network. New episodes drop every Monday and Thursday on the iHeart Radio app, Apple Podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts. Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show Podcast. Fascinating to see what stories the media focuses on day and day out because it tells you so much about their worldview or their politics in a whole range of ways. And certainly in the aftermath of a horrific mass shooting, whether they decide that this story deserves wall to wall coverage is a political call to action and is something that should be used to shame their political opponents irrespective of really what the facts are of the situation. That is something that we see happening time and time again. I bring it up because right now, Clay and I talked to you yesterday about the shooting that occurred over the weekend at a dance hall, where you had 10 people who were murdered by this guy who was just a disgruntled, a disgruntled, deeply unhappy person who just turned to the worst kind of evil killed 10 people and was going to kill more. He moved to a second location. I actually shared this clip on Twitter. It's it's remarkable. Brandon Sy was on scene there and he was the individual, the hero, who this guy is reloading. Now, I know a lot of people think, Oh, I would have done this too. A lot of people would freeze. You've got somebody who has, I think it's been repeatedly described as a pistol, but it's rather as as an assault rifle in the media. But it's really a pistol with a folding stock, I think. But either way, it's it's illegal under technically a pistol with a folding stock illegal under California law. This guy Brandon Sy essentially rushed the shooter, who you can, I think safely assume otherwise would have been able to kill another 10, 15, 20 people who were helpless, defenseless at this. So this guy saved a lot of lives. But that shooting occurred over the weekend. And as we know, the Democrats immediately jumped into the, Oh, this is a hate crime. And I don't just mean in general Democrats, top legislators, senators, Democrats associated closely with the Biden administration, the White House. There was another shooting over the last few days, seven people, seven people were killed in this shooting. And this shooting also involved a an Asian American or a person, a person. Yeah, a person of Asian descent, a Chinese agricultural laborer, 67 years old. So he's almost a senior citizen who was in the San Francisco area, Half Moon Bay, went into his work facility and just started murdering people, shot seven people in in cold blood. Now that came 72 hours after the other individual who actually killed 11 people, excuse me, one of them additionally succumbed to injuries, I'll kill the 11 people at a lunar New Year celebration in Monterey Park, which is near Los Angeles, two major mass shootings by two Asian assailants, one of whom already I believe committed suicide in the car, right during the standoff. So he won't face any trial. But two two shootings, mass shootings, Asian assailants, and the media interest on this is minimal. Yeah, because it's not an opportunity to try to find some tie into Trump and MAGA and white supremacy and all this other stuff. And one of the one of the big lies, Clay, the media pushes about shooting mass shootings in particular, mass shootings of three or more people is that this is the disgruntled white males who do this. This is what you'll always hear. It's actually not true. It's not true, because if you look at the data, what you see is that when it comes to mass shootings, the ethnicity of the shooter is essentially totally in line with their percentage of the population. So mass shooters are spread evenly among all they're all male, but among all demographics, white, Hispanic, black, Asian, but yet the media likes to push this this storyline of it's, you know, angry white males or, you know, white supremacists who are the ones who are doing all of this, which I think is why they're not really talking about once again, they two mass shooting 17 or 18 people killed. You would think like this would be wall to wall coverage. No, it vanishes if it's not a white guy. And this is the this is the truth. I mean, all of you out there listening know that if there isn't a opportunity to tie this into white supremacy or, or to far right, extremist culture, then the story just automatically vanishes. And the one that is maybe the most emblematic of this to me buck is the shooting that happened in Colorado at at Boulder. Remember, they thought that that was a white guy just based on pictures that came out of a guy who looked like he was white in terms of you could see his skin. And then it ended up being that he was middle Eastern and the story almost immediately vanished. So they initially said, Oh, look, another crazy white guy goes in and kills a bunch of people in Boulder, Colorado. And you could actually track the story and how much attention it was getting. And then as soon as it came out that he was of middle Eastern descent, the story vanished. And a lot of you probably haven't heard anything about that shooting in Colorado since. Yeah, there is something deeply disturbing when you look at when you really dive into it, when you pay attention to it, the the Democrat liberal mind has an obsession with the denigration of of whiteness all the time, and particularly from white liberals, they they they liberal do it. This is this is a a false virtue signaling fixation that they have with how the evils of whiteness and you see this as it is evidenced by media coverage of these these mass shootings we're talking about. We all know if the if the if the mash instead of saying there are evil people and deeply violently mentally ill people who are spread through all populations, which is true, and understanding that they're going to be people that from from all different ethnic groups that are mass shooters, that's going to happen, which is what the data all shows. Instead of looking honestly at that issue, because there's no political advantage in it, they try to skew the issue toward all mass shooter. You see this, by the way, I mean, they'll even be blue check commentators. There's a mass shooter and the guys white they say, Oh, it's always a white mass shoot. It's just not true. Yeah, but this is this is one of the lies that they believe and one of the lies that they repeat. And unfortunately, a lot of people you and I make a living knowing what actually happens and what the data actually is. A lot of people see, Oh, okay, we'll see an end says, you know, another, another white, you know, male shooter, and this is all the mass shooters are white males. It's not it's not reality. And that's why I think, you know, you have to remember the mindset during the war on terror era, we used to call it the GWAT global war on terror. And then they try to get rid of that term, the Obama administration came in and they wanted to call this was the fight against al Qaeda and later ISIS and all this stuff. They wanted to call it something like overseas contingency operations against violent radical extremism. I'm not kidding. It was actually something that was so long. I remember sitting in Langley when when the Obama administration came in and we're all laughing our asses off because it was we're like, that's this is ridiculous. This is an encyclopedia. This isn't a, you know, an operation discussion. But I remember there was there was a belief that to service the narrative of, oh, we're so scared about Islamophobia, they would always downplay when there was a terrorist incident. You know, oh, we don't know, we don't know if this person is a Muslim, we don't know what their belief system is. And they would do this. And we all kind of knew like usually the guy's screaming a lot of walk bar and on video and he's shooting something up. You kind of know right away. I think there's a similar mentality among a lot of the democrat aligned media now, which is let's not focus too much on the mass on any mass shooting that doesn't involve a white perpetrator because we have to tackle the problem of white male mass shooters because they're the ones that do it all the time. It's incongruent. It's what's the phrase under a cognitive dissonance. Yeah, they can't handle it and just pay attention to this. I mean, we had the Walmart shooter was a black guy, right? In Virginia, went in, shot up the place. We had also in Virginia in the same way that we have the double Asian shooter. We had the former football player at the University of Virginia who went and shot several of his teammates. Two black mass shootings in Virginia in like short concert. Now you got two Asian mass shooting in short concert. The stories will vanish, but you still hear a lot of talk about the Buffalo shooting, right? racist white guy goes into a black supermarket kills people there and they choose which stories to emphasize to your point. First of all, mass shootings. If we eliminated every mass shooting and I think this is important, 98% of murders would still be happening. So we have this idea out there that mass shooting is a huge part of the national murder rate. It's actually the case that if we eliminated them, 49 out of 50 murders would still be happening in this country. You know, that's also true about part of an issue. It's also true about modern sporting rifles, AKA assault rifles, you ban assault rifles, 98% of shooting still happen. Yeah, but they're, you know, they're obsessed with you know why? Because they view gun control. Yes, ultimately they want to stop. They want to eliminate the final stop gap against tyranny to the founding fathers and shrine to the constitution. But every call by a Democrat for gun control in some way is meant to be a thumb in the eye of a white male Republican AR 15 owner. And that's why lives in Brooklyn and Santa Monica and Chicago and where in DC, they get so excited about it because it's meant to be see somehow you a law abiding gun owner who lives in Texas and has, you know, seven AR 15s and loves to go to the range. You're the problem. It's a neurosis that they have to do this. They want to poke those people in the chest and blame them for mass shootings by lunatics that have nothing to do with those individuals. But that's, it's just meant to be a political cudgel. The exception to this rule book that I would point to is the shooting in Texas and the school shooting is such a unique circumstance. The Hispanic shooter there, they covered obviously you've filed a got a massive amount of attention because of who the victims were and where that shooting occurred. But otherwise, the focal point is always on white guys. That was also on the list of the biggest police failures of all time. You know, up there with the FBI response to Waco up there, you know, people talk about Ruby Ridge and Waco and you've all day is a place of abj, abj, abj, law enforcement failure. And I'm, you know, you would hope that there'd be important lessons learned from it if that's possible for, you know, for future law enforcement generations. All right. So my friend switching gears here, think of time and money that was invested years ago by somebody in your family to videotape all those joyful things in life vacations, football games, birthdays, so many things. Somebody who was on hand with that video cam working away. I remember my dad used to love to bust out the old video cam with a little, you put your hand in the velcro and we were there for Christmas and for birthdays, you had all those videotapes, right? And they're stored away. My family has them. We've got them in storage. Those memories are precious. You don't want to throw them out, but they're just collecting dust and eventually you're going to have no way to share them or play them and they're going to degrade because the actual media they're on degrade.

Welcome back in clay Travis Buck Sexton show. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us. Two data into the program final hour of the show. We bring it now our buddy Andy McCarthy who is doing an incredible job breaking down so much of the legal related issues all around the absurdity of classified documents and beyond Fox News contributor former federal prosecutor at the Southern District of New York. He spent over 20 years there wrote a book ball of collusion. The plots are rigging election and destroy a presidency and like me he also had sorry Buffalo fans and also fans of the Dallas Cowboys. You had a Bill's Cowboys Super Bowl that went up in smoke on Sunday as well. I did clay and you know I feel terrible about this because I hate both teams. I just you know but I thought they were I thought they were getting hot at the right time. So who knows do you think before we get into serious stuff do you think Tom Brady's gonna retire or do you think he'll come back? No I think he's gonna play another year. I think he could still he'd have to be like in the right offense right because he could still really throw the ball. He's not you know he's not what he used to be but it's like that's like saying like each hero is only hitting 305 you know I mean he's he's still really pretty good I think. I think he's going to end up down in Miami where Buck's been in part of the year now. I think he's going to be another Miami and more Miami people. I think he's going to play for the dolphins. That's my prediction. A lot of reports about that today that he's like looking at checking out schools and stuff like that. So we'll see. Yeah we'll see. All right so let's dive into Mike Pence today comes out and says he's got classified documents. The continued fallout five different times Joe Biden has been caught with classified documents. What's your take on the big picture question here of whether anybody's going to get charged with anything related to these classified documents? I don't think anybody's going to get charged but like I think we discussed before if you would ask me that question like two and a half weeks ago I would say you know Trump was a hundred percent going to be charged. Yeah I was with you. I think anyone will be. But my other I mean my other big picture impression I couldn't help this but I'm reminded I guess this is because I'm getting too old but I'm reminded of the the Clinton Winski stuff with the Democrats refrain throughout those years was everybody does it and I'm like well no everybody doesn't have sex with interns in the White House but maybe everybody does do this. I don't start to look at why isn't it? Andy you know you may have seen yesterday there was an arrest of a former top FBI official who oversaw counterintelligence in New York City. I don't know if you guys ever crossed paths in your day but Charles McGonagall is facing charges of money laundering I think among others that he took money from a former Albanian intelligence employee and a representative of the Russian olig oligarch Oleg Derapaska. A lot of people see this and they say so one of the guys who if you were involved at that level and counterintelligence in New York City the FBI office in New York City you certainly were aware of the Trump-Russia collusion investigations and things going on there so somebody who would have been overseeing the fake Russia collusion investigation of Trump has now been charged with colluding with Russians to evade US money laundering laws. Yeah that's exactly right and Buck I was reminded you guys were kind enough to mention my book in the intro. I wrote a lot in the book about Derapaska including the fact that you know number one the FBI tried to flip him in with it 2016 before the Trump stuff ever got rolling and that was the reason they were dealing with steel at the time because steel was working for Derapaska while the FBI was taking information from him that ended up in the steel dossier which I thought in and of itself was remarkable and you know the funny thing with Derapaska was apparently the bureau one of the reasons the bureau soured on the whole idea of turning him is when he sat down with them they pitched him on this on the Trump-Putin conspiracy and he was like what are you talking about this no Trump conspiracy which was apparently that was not what the party line was at the time but I'm just I can't help I mean it's terrible for the FBI but I can't help but be amused by you know the way these guys you know seem to change on a dime so like you know first they're trying to flip Derapaska then they're prosecuting Derapaska then the head of the foreign counterintelligence in New York is working for Derapaska it makes you dizzy doesn't it? is the FBI something that we could dramatically reform in a meaningful way Andy I mean a lot of people ask me this all the time and I know some people on the right will say well we got to tear it down to the studs and start anew well if you're going to have federal laws you got to you're going to have a federal law enforcement agency so you know remolding the you know people think oh we have a DNI and we had NCTC and all these things yeah we didn't need all that right you're just creating more bureaucracy to paper over the failures of the bureaucracy you had before could we do something within the FBI I mean can there be a house cleaning that that would be meaningful I think there could book if they were serious about it like if they really went about it in a church committee type style I'm not I'm not a big fan of the outcomes of the church committee but like the the driving force behind it those spying scandals and the you know the 60s into the 80s those were good reasons to have that committee and if they you know I think you know if you throw out the extremes of both sides like there's one side on the left that wants to defund all police and really doesn't believe in in prosecution at all and then there's people on the right who I think unreal unrealistically think that we could get on without a federal police force I just think the way society is and the way the law is now you have to have a federal police force it doesn't have to be the FBI but we have to have one so if you toss those people aside I think there's enough people in the in the broad middle on both sides who have gripes about the current FBI and maybe that's the making that people could if we still have a capability in Washington of people like like being grown-ups with respect to a problem that everybody understands as a problem and in my own view of it you and I I think I've talked about this before I think the Bureau after 9-11 became too much of an intelligence agency and it started to be an intelligence agency with a police sideline and they're very you know I think intelligence work is very important police work is very important but they're very different and if you become an intelligence agency it really damages your dedication to civil rights which police have to keep like in the front of their minds and I think that's what's really hurt the FBI I would take their counterintelligence mission away from them. Andy I want you to take me into what a search of Joe Biden's home would have required at least in your mind from a sort of procedural mechanics perspective. It's one thing when you know Mar-a-Lago they show up at former president Trump's home and they raid that but for a sitting president to be essentially searched by his own Department of Justice's FBI is truly unprecedented. Is that something that Merrick Garland signs off on? Is that something that is threatened if the Biden regime does not comply? Like who I just don't even understand how that ends up happening. What do you think the mechanics and the procedures behind the scenes were like for this? Well I think that the big thing was Biden signing off on it because you're quite right you know this is president Trump had a very exalted status because he's a former president which is a big deal but it doesn't have any political power right whereas the incumbent president is the only guy I mean you know Justice Scalia taught us all this like 30 years ago right or 40 years ago the the only person with power in the executive branch is the president. Everybody else including the attorney general in the executive branch is a delegate who exercises the president's power at the president's pleasure and that includes the special counsel like they try to tell you they're getting an independent prosecutor and there's no independent prosecutor in the United States prosecutions and executive function everybody answers to the president so they couldn't have done this without Biden's final that would have been in subordinate and I think that's probably a big part of the reason why they didn't get a search warrant which they certainly had legal grounds for and why they cut a deal with Biden's lawyers that they were able to accompany the FBI as they did the search which of course didn't happen in Trump's case so I think the mechanics of this is Biden has to sign off on it and then there's probably some limits that are negotiated about what they're allowed to look at or where they're allowed to look and then the lawyers went along with them as they you know went from play from room to room in the house. Andy so this basically goes where in your mind I mean how does all this end up I mean you saw Mike Pence has classified documents at home too this has crossed over into crazy town. Yeah so I think that's a big part of why nothing's going to happen with this because you know people are starting to think that you know if we now started to look at like listen to what Biden's excuses here right he he wants you to believe that it was sloppy aids who packed up his stuff and sent it to you know and it turned out that classified information ended up in there as if the aides had security clearances right as if the aides when he was a senator went into the skip with them and are the ones who stole the document you know I mean it's it's ridiculous but I think there's such a a culture of carelessness that if we started to search a lot of these guys who knows what we would find and everybody kind of realizes that so I think the Democrats badly want to prosecute Trump right so if it was just Trump who had this problem there'd be a very high chance that he'd be indicted but now that it looks like Biden has it and Pence has it and who knows what well you know who's the next person we'll hear about. I don't think they're gonna I don't think they're going to get indicted and I wonder if Pence having these documents is going to lessen the enthusiasm of the of the new Republican majority in the House to start asking a lot of aggressive questions because I really think that's the only way we're going to find out anything here that the special councils are there to just say you know we're doing our investigation we can't comment so this whole thing is supposed to go into a black hole either the Republicans in the House use their subpoena power and conduct hearings that's the only way we're going to find out anything and I just wonder if they'll do that at this point. Andy you mentioned earlier and Buck and I both have this opinion now my opinion's changed I thought they would charge Trump over the classified documents I now think I agree with you that they will not I wonder if this classified document scandal is becoming so all encompassing that it actually is going to make it harder for the Department of Justice to charge Trump for anything January 6th related now I presume you would think those were harder charges to bring in the first place but do you think this overall mushroom cloud of incompetence that sort of is surrounding everything now is actually making it far less likely that anything January 6th related will also be brought against President Trump. That's a really interesting question I hadn't thought about that my my I thought up until now that they look at January 6th and the class the Mar-a-Lago documents as like two separate boxes that don't really have much to do with each other although I do think that if they had found at Mar-a-Lago any documents that were incriminating with respect to the Capitol riot they would certainly have used them but I thought they were looking at that as like two separate trends. I agree with you by the way on that but I thought the charges would actually be easier on the classified docs to prove. Totally. And so but it's such a mushroom cloud now that I almost feel like it implicates January 6th then I was just wondering if you thought so too because in the mind of the public charging anybody now when it looks like there could be you know potentially felonious behavior everywhere feels kind of like a arbitrary and capricious application of the law. Yeah I think there could be something to be said to that but I still think that their big problem with January 6th is because Trump is not implicated in the violence the only way that you make a federal case out of that is to criminalize John Eastman's legal theory right and I just think that this whole idea of going down the avenue of making a felony into frivolous legal theories is nuts. I mean I don't think we want to live in that kind of a system. I know they're so rabid to get Trump that they'll probably overlook all that but I've had hope that because they haven't done it up until now that maybe Garland realizes this is like a really bad idea. And in McCarthy everybody look for his latest on National Review and also on Fox News. Andy we always appreciate it. Look forward to talking to you again. Thanks guys. Have a good one.

I'm flying tomorrow. You just jinx me. Oh man I forgot about that one sorry you could blame me when your flight delayed four hours because you know not enough diversity and inclusion seminars have been completed by you know the FAA or something but Pete Buttigieg is out there telling everybody remember his transportation second I think it's fair to say the most consequential think about that term though the most consequential transportation secretary in recent memory I'll say it is good but he certainly had consequences yeah we haven't talked very much about transportation secretaries in the past because everything just kind of worked and so it didn't matter it's an interesting argument you have to go back quite a ways to be able to or you have to ask a lot of people for them to even be able to rattle off a transportation secretary I think by the way Langley the George H. W. Bush Intelligence Center is also right next to the federal highway administration so there's that for those of you who've ever had a tour of CIA headquarters I don't even I don't know federal highway administration I used to joke around you know that's that's where the real secret stuffs actually happening Langley was all just a front you know it's like many black even tour you can take a tour the CIA they used to do them they don't really do them I don't know they kind of go back and forth on it it's obviously super limited you basically can like press sometimes will go into the lobby yeah they have portraits of the former directors the stars on the wall for fallen officers but like that's it you know you're not you're not like hanging out with everybody in the you could even walk around Langley like I wouldn't think I know you can tour the FBI I've done the FBI tour before but that's not really on its own can't or it's right downtown they do have its own campus they have a couple of internal spy museums at this EIA where they have things you know World War II era OSS stuff and things like that so I think you know they're very limited tours you can do but it's not no they don't they don't bust it's not like the Bronx Zoo they're not sending busloads of kids out there to you know to go check out what's going on did you get adrenaline rushes working at the CIA like where you were like oh like this is because people tend to have it and I'll say this people think when you practice law that it's all like a time to kill you know and when they think of lawyers and most of the time you're just like sitting in front of a computer pushing a button you know like over and over again to scroll through emails so I'm very serious very similar yeah very similar reality I used to say to people that being a CIA analyst which is what I was doing and there's other jobs case officers a very prominent role that people often will think of it's written about a lot of books and talked about but to be a CIA analyst which is what Jack Ryan was very handsome played by Harrison Ford and now by John Krasinski just putting that out there in Affleck I think also played him right been Affleck so you know handsome CIA analysts with great hair who live in Georgetown that's like a thing that's a thing that happens but you know it's it's I used to tell people it's a 80% mundane 10% particularly crappy and 10% legitimately cool and badass yeah so 80% of your hours are doing things that you're like well you know I could be like I could be working in mutual of Omaha you know it's yeah paperwork it's meeting that's whatever some of the training stuff you get to do and then obviously going overseas you it's a whole lot more interesting and you see us out of the world I love reading you love reading so the information that you get to learn and have access to is itself interesting but the job of a CIA analyst is like the job of an analyst in a world's massive amounts of information absorption and then synthesis into small usable bites in this case for the policy community but it is it's a reading and writing job like yeah I did get weapons training and stuff but it's really a reading and writing job which is really very similar to being a lawyer right like you're basically just synthesize arguments and try to and a little bit of what we do here right there's a voluminous amount of data that comes in every single day and we try to make sense of it for the larger community yeah being an intelligence officer I was joke around people's actually very good training for being a doing media being a writer journalism it's all it's all very very similar back to Pete Buttigieg for a second here though because the most now increasingly I think you could say in competent secretary of transportation that anybody can remember is out there reminding everyone that every decision about transportation is a climate change decision play 24 we're looking at investments that that are fair that contribute to equitable economic growth we're looking at climate impacts because every transportation decision in the 21st century is a climate decision whether we recognize it or not and thankfully because we have such a big investment you don't have to look at which states got funds from this infrastructure law and which ones didn't every single state I believe we're already over 3000 bridges so we're making sure whether talking about big projects like this or smaller communities that every part of America sees the benefit of because frankly every part of America has a need just notice that whenever someone starts using the term equity and climate and climate equity and these things all together this is the language of the modern day American commissar sort of like in the Soviet Union when there was always talk of the revolution and the need for the workers and all that stuff equity climate this is the secular religion of America today and Pete Buttigieg is one of its priests I'm I think that's well said I'm also genuinely curious about what his future is so he's not a very good transportation secretary he's relocated to Michigan there's obviously a Senate seat that is opening in Michigan but if you ran for the Senate and lost it would certainly dent his ambitions going forward he probably in the back of his mind thinks okay I'm gonna run against Kamala and beat her in 28 because we think Biden's gonna run in 24 but is he gonna be transportation secretary for eight years I gotta say I think I think in a head-to-head match up I think Kamala Harris for it for the Democrat nomination beats Pete Buttigieg I think Pete Buttigieg has a zero percent chance of being nominated because he's gay and I don't mean that because I think there's some massive anti-gay sentiment in the country that would prevent him from being elected I mean him getting the Democrat nomination because there's lots of black guys that aren't gonna vote for a gay white guy to be the nominee for the Democrat party and it's like they won't talk about it but you look at the data he didn't get any support from minority voters that Pete may or Pete is the woke white liberal selection right a lot of woke white people like him but it doesn't actually connect with the huge percentage of the overall electorate I think he'd probably have to be VP and then maybe he's Kamala's VP and we have the diversity and inclusion ticket officially out there for 2028 the conversation continues on the Clay and Buck podcast feed go subscribe today we'll talk to

new episodes dropping every monday and thursday on the iHeart radio app apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts welcome back in clay Travis Buck's excellent show appreciate all of you hanging out with us we are joined now by mike pumpayo 70th secretary of state former cia director under donald trump his new book never give an inch fighting for the america i love and secretary pumpayo you probably didn't expect this would be the lead question but given that mike pence has classified documents and given that donald trump has classified documents and joe biden has classified documents do you have classified documents have have you gone back through papers in the way all this what do you make of everybody seeming to have classified documents oh my goodness what what a mess no i don't believe anything that's classified anybody who has it they should turn it back in what what a mess class by documents should stay in the places they're supposed to be and and just as importantly if it turns out that somehow they got where they weren't supposed to be you should give them back and then you should be as transparent as you can about how the heck by the way you shouldn't say you don't have regrets if someone shown up in that had classified information in by home or near my corvette then i have a corvette um i promise you i wouldn't say i didn't have any regrets i would regret it deeply that i it screwed up in that way uh secretary pumpayo it's buck um wanted to ask you about the reports on abram's tanks possibly being provided to ukraine by the u.s a lot of the people you're you're speaking now we're listening all across the country served in iraq in afghanistan with a lot of veterans in this audience a lot of active duty military and i hear from them all all that uh frequently about their concerns that we're getting deeper and deeper into the ukraine fight uh where one do you think the abram's tank should be provided and uh then where would you draw the line on u.s support for the fight against russia well two things um i do think that that equipment should be provided if the cleanness can make use of it and it can help them push back against uh invasion by vladimir poutin um it's in america's best interest to do so they have an ask for to your point i'm a veteran too i served as a young soldier on the vennese German communist border um i worry about american getting too deeply involved but the best way to keep american soldiers from having to fight europe or to fight against russia or china anyplace just to make sure that when there's an authoritarian faith a place like ukraine and they haven't asked for the 82nd airborne they haven't asked for a motorized raffle division all they said is can you send us stuff we ought to provide them with the stuff that we can that they can use that they can be trained on that are actually going to deliver against the mission set uh it's the only way to end poutin's invasion of europe secretary pumpayo a lot of talk lately about twenty four who's running what the time frame is to run if you are going to run for president when would you announce and are you exploring running for president now so my wife and i are praying about trying to figure out if this is the next place for us to go serve as for timeline we kind of think late spring early summer is probably when she and i will have to uh turn from prayer to action and we decided to get in head to i will enter to make our case to the american people and if not uh find where it is will next birth if not in elected office so we're so good about it yeah so so far donald trump is in does that impact your thinking in any way given that you were a secretary of state and served at the cia under him or is it not even about who else is running from your determination no it has nothing to do with wealth runs when president biden ron's reform and president frank or remember in the end you you must come to believe that this is a time and you have something that you can not only offer the american people in terms of a policy agenda that delivers good outcomes for them but that you have the tenacity to wear with the capability to actually deliver on those promises if you believe those two things and it all works as a personal matter uh you have an obligation to go and make the things and then like the american people sort it all out speaking of mike pompea former ci director former secretary of state under trump and his book is out today so our timing here on clan buck is always is excellent never given inch is the book and uh secretary pompea i i kind of ask you because it's always fun whenever i see a book come out from from somebody on our side of things to see what the media focus is on right away and they are drilling down into it's all over twitter oh my gosh have you seen mike pompea's book which i guess in a sense this is kind of an unintentional advertisement they're doing have you seen his book never give an inch because of what he says about the murder journalist jamaal kashogi well mr secretary what what did you say and why are they all so upset about it oh goodness um i don't know uh i don't know what they're so upset about the washing that that person's life wasn't more important than the lives of american's life american soldiers who are protecting us and we weren't about to give up the partnership with the kingdom of saudi ravy that was helping us keep the american economy going keeping american security going you could see what happens when you flip the script president biden said oh this is a prime issue he immediately had to go on bended me to the kingdom at austin to produce just a little more crude oil um we from we did not for a moment mistake the fact that this was a bad act but we did not for a moment forget the putting america first was what really mattered most and keeping america's secure meant keeping a relationship like security relationship any diplomatic relationship with the kingdom of saudi ravy and the united states secretary pompeo there's a big debate now still ongoing about where covid came from uh you have worked in the cia you certainly served as secretary of state do you think it's a settled question what's your own opinion about where covid came from was it a lab leak or was this a natural animal evolution of a virus it's largely a settled question this virus came from a laboratory where they were working on this virus and others like it in wuhan china and it leaked accidentally from that lab and then the chinese communist party knowingly sent that virus across the world uh when it was inside of human beings on the airplane and they killed millions of people as a result of that decision so what consequences should there be on china and what do you think about people like dr fauci who are still saying oh i don't believe the lab leak theory happened if you're correct and i agree with you that this was a lab leak and that china tried to cover it up and also then basically spread this virus all over the world it seems like there should be really severe consequences for them uh and it also seems like it's kind of an important uh discussion to be having in the united states and not have somebody like dr fauci wagging his finger and saying the evidence doesn't support this and how dare you even raise it as an issue well the second one's easy and dr fauci got this wrong from the beginning uh seen his debates on again a function research is is angles on the head of a panic the truth is he knew that america was finding gain a function research uh in the laboratories in china uh i can't explain why he's chosen here perhaps it's money i i don't truly know but i know this i know he's wrong i know that with near certainty that it came from that lab you should know that lab is still up and operating and conducting the same kind of research it did before this thing leaked who knows when we will see that again which really gets you second question is what should the penalty be how should we respond to that there are lots of pieces to this the challenge of the chinese communist party far extends beyond since far beyond the challenge of the wuhan virus uh and we have for 40 years allowed the chinese communist party to be at war with us at least economic war and we've turned the other cheek uh one of the things i'm most proud of and i did a second or second as we confronted the chinese communist party in a serious way we understood its ideology we understood its economic motive and we began to put real restrictions on their capacity to do harm to the american people secretary of state pompeo uh appreciate you joining us to talk to us about all this and uh people should go check out the book
