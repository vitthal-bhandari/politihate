    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Welcome in to the Tuesday edition Clay Travis Buck Sexton Show. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us as we get set to bring sanity to an insane world. We got a lot of different topics to run through throughout the course of the day. Giving you a little bit of a road map of where we are headed. In the third hour, we're going to dive into the Elon Musk interview with Tucker Carlson. What have we learned? What is the impact of the decisions that that Elon has made so far as it pertains to the future of free speech in particular in big tech companies and in social media? And I think you guys are really going to enjoy that discussion. Buck is going to get us rolling in the second hour as we talk about two different recent shooting cases than the way that they are being covered and how the media continues to try to divide us by arbitrarily focusing on outlier incidents to essentially drum up racial antagonism in this country. But I wanted to start with what I think is a simmering and potentially soon to boil over issue for the Biden White House. And that is the focus on transgender athletes and this idea that Joe Biden continues to push. And I say Joe Biden, but I continue to refuse to believe he actually believes it. And if he ever has a press conference, I would love to have him directly asked why he believes biological men should be able to compete against women. But Rhonda Santas's team came out with a spoof as the Bud Light attack continues. They did a spoof. If you remember the real men of genius ads that Bud Light used to run, they would make fun of a guy who was doing something not that genius, but they would kind of mockumentary style in a humorous fashion praise, whatever that was. And I bet a ton of you remember the real men of genius ads because back in the day, and I know this is stunning, beer companies used to try to make you laugh because they associated beer with having fun as opposed to beer that wanted to celebrate the fact that men who have penises decide that they are women, which is where we are today. But this ad I want you to listen to, it's only 30 seconds, very funny, well done parody of the original real men of genius Bud Light ads. Listen, team DeSantis presents real men of women sports. Today, we recognize the men who've hacked the system, hacked the system. Once mediocre in the men's division, now cream of the crop in the women's for mediocre to champion. You couldn't cut it with the boys. So you pushed women off the podium real man. Still first place because without you sports would be fair without you. Women sports would be for well, women. Buck, this is I think you win a lot of times with humor with satire with ridicule. Unlike the absurd, maybe we need to contrast the Saturday Night Live, ridiculous commentary over the weekend with that ad that we just played, which is obviously parody. It's designed to make people laugh. It is ricocheting around social media because I think many of you out there are sitting around thinking to yourself, how in the world did we end up in a place where men are becoming women's champions? And if you even dare to mention it, it's considered transphobic by the left. This is something that is I think Buck and it's in my new book, which is going to be out of August 8th. I think this is an 80 20 issue. If it is hammered home, the idea that a man can identify it as a woman and become a champion is so patently absurd to virtually everyone out there, white, black, Asian, Hispanic, gay, straight, you name it. This is a 80 20 issue. We have the SNL clip that you mentioned actually, which I but I mean, I also feel like we could have Dr. galley, we kids play in on exactly what's going on in America today. Dr. gala, we kids, for those of you who remember your Bud Light ads from 20 years ago would certainly know what's happening today. You mean Dr. Galakowitz? Yes. Here is Saturday Night Live trying to push the propaganda line play. Now over 14 states that have passed bills restricting healthcare for trans kids. Listen to that, Michael. Yeah. Restricting healthcare for kids. For some reason, there's something about the word trans that makes people forget the word kids. If you don't care about trans kids lives, it means you don't care about fricking kids lives. I mean, this is I just wanted this is honestly Soviet level propaganda. Yes. It really is important. Never understands this is coming from Saturday Night Live NBC, you know, the peacock network, you know, the whole corporate umbrella that it's under. This is coming from people who are actively misleading with the words that they use the way that they frame this issue. We're not just talking about healthcare. Okay. I could make the same case for, hey, maybe we shouldn't be telling people who have body integrity disorder, a body identity integrity disorder, which is when you think you shouldn't have a limb, you could make the case that surgically removing a healthy limb because somebody has a mental health issue. This is a real thing, by the way, you can Google it to real psychological disorder. I'm sure if you asked any psychologist about it today, they'd say, Oh, it's not real. Oh, they're to hem and ha because unfortunately, there are more commies in the medical profession who are psychiatrists and psychologists than anything else than any other place in the medical profession. But if you said you're denying someone healthcare clay, you won't let them, you won't let them have a surgically, why? It would be so much safer if you let the surgeons remove their healthy leg or their healthy arm because they don't want it. You could play the exact same word game with this. And then you say they don't care about trans kids lives. Why is it they can't even speak about what we're talking about here? They want to give puberty blockers to 12 year olds. They want your 14 year old daughter to lap off her breasts before she even knows who she is or what's going on before her brain is fully formed because they are psychos. There's something wrong with these people. Yeah. And I mean, people who are pushing the stuff by the people who are using this propaganda. That SNL clip that we played, it isn't humor. It isn't remotely designed to persuade in an humorous fashion. It is, as you said, straight propaganda. And I always say, I think about these things a lot because I've got a 15 year old. I've got a 12 year old. I've got an eight year old. So far, they have been knock on wood very healthy. We haven't had any major issues with them. But the idea that you would equate child health care with body mutilation. And if the trans idea is just too complex or too freighted with, with, you know, basically antagonism right now, I think this is an easy question to ask for every parent out there listening. Do you believe that your 14 year old should get a tattoo? Would you be okay with your 14 year old going into a tattoo parlor and getting a tattoo that covered their entire chest or their entire back? So, so I think everyone clay would say, no, obviously, but remember the argument the left is making is, is at its core, a different argument, which is they would agree, I think that that's a choice, right? That the tattoo is a choice. And so we can wait until you're 18 for that choice. Their argument about transgenderism is this is why they say, Oh, doctors get it wrong when it's babies, is that the individual is trans from birth. This is who they are. This is their core identity, right? So, so they're not, I mean, it's a different, they're trying to suggest. I just see them actually is pretty similar because in both cases, you're making what is essentially a lifetime decision before you are of age to be able to do it. And in fact, maybe you're right. Maybe some trans people would say, no, the tattoo shouldn't be allowed, which would actually be really funny. I think they would, by the way, I think you think that's what I'm saying. I think the average trans person would say, no, you can't get a tattoo to your 18, but you should be able to chop your boobs off at 14. Yes, the argument of the left play is that this when a 12 year old says, I'm not a boy, I'm a girl, that is the recognition of their core, most basic, most fundamental identity. And for that to be suppressed, even for a matter of years, would be the negation of that of their personhood. And I, whereas a tattoo is like, we could all agree is an artistic choice that you, you know, I'm just saying, this is how crazy they are. Well, I think if you could get a trans activist in a real debate to say, no, no, no, you shouldn't be able to get a tattoo to your 18, but you should be able to chop your boobs off at 14. I think on its face, that clip would go so viral that parents everywhere their jaws would drop. Because I'm telling you most parents, I went to see a great movie last night, Buck, and I'll encourage everybody out there. This is not woke. You can take your whole family. I went to go see air, which is the story of how Nike ended up signing Michael Jordan, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon. It's a fabulously entertaining movie. Again, said in 1980s, zero woke associated with it. And the Michael Jordan's mom is in that movie, Buck. And afterwards, I took all three of my boys and were driving home. And she said, I'm concerned about Jordan making a lifetime decision in terms of what sneaker company is going to sign with. All he wants right now is a red Mercedes convertible. And he won't care about that in a year. And it was such a, and I'm paraphrasing, her commentary. But so much of being a parent, Buck is about making your kids understand the permanence of some choices. Like I had a discussion with my 15 year old today. He wouldn't listen to me very well. But about he uses discord. And I said, you know, that knucklehead 21 year old who posted all those documents out there, he thought he was just hanging out on discord with his buddies. And that was never going to go anywhere else. This idea that you allow someone under the age of 18 to make a permanent life altering decision that potentially, in many cases, could end your ability to ever have your own child is to me the essence. I don't remember very many times when there has been a good or evil decision that has to be made in the United States, people who are making these choices on behalf of kids under 18, in my opinion, are evil. I agree 100%. I think it's monstrous. But I just, I want everyone to understand the full scope of the argument. I've gotten more and more people to believe, for example, or to understand that the argument to the left is not a transgender woman is a transgender woman. And you should just try to make some basic accommodations. It is, this is a woman. And if you make any distinction in the use of pronouns, access to bathroom, sports teams, you're a bigot. That is the actual argument. And the reason that is the argument is the same reason why they're now pushing for this. Why is it's, you know, it's one of these things, Clay, where they always say to us, why are you so focused on this? Right? This is what the left says when they get caught doing something crazy. Well, I actually look at this and say, why are they so focused on this? Why is Disney so focused on this? Why are these massive companies? Why is there this effort from the entirety of the Democrat apparatus to continue with this? I know this book. I'll tell you the answer in my they can't end. Progressiveism has to find something new to fight about. Well, that's that's like the macro that 30,000 for which is true. And they want this basically everything else. But but ultimately the problem of the trans agenda is that the moment that it is something that a person can just decide psychologically, the moment it's separated from innate immutable characteristics and identity, it's going to lose so many of these protections and changes and title nine now and all these things, which is why they are immediately now and in every way that they can turning and saying, this is that there are trans babies. I mean, you've actually heard this phrase there. You've never heard of a trans baby 10 years. Babies is what they're calling them. What are they called? Babies. Oh, thank you. I didn't even know that. Yes. Yes. That's a they've legitimately created a new phrase that babies don't know their gender. And so you should call them babies. So they meet babies. So what's fascinating here is that the argument now, the real argument that mentality, the psychology of the left, the reason they want to pretend this is or they really believe this is the new civil rights struggle is that you are trans from birth. You just don't know it. Right. This is the this is the argument that is being made. Doctor's face. The baby's wrong. Is there argument? Yes. Doctors get the sex of babies wrong. We've this is something. And what's fascinating is as it plays out, what we've seen is there are actually people who are trans and then later on, realize that they were having a mental health crisis and that they're not actually a woman or they're not actually a man and they go back. So what do they call that? What is you know, this is something that is completely left out of the argument. What do they call a D transitioner? They just shout them down. They say you don't exist. They say, because ultimately this has become the cause of the left because it's the most. It's the way that they can not only destroy the family, which is always the purpose of the Marxist and the leftist, but it's also a way that the state can separate children from their parents. I think that's if you don't see that on the horizon, everybody, they're already getting clay. Look at the look at the shield law. They just passed in Washington state that we talked about. Don't have to tell someone runs away to a shelter. I'm trans. The state doesn't have to inform. The police don't have to inform the parents. It's crazy. You see what's happening, folks? It's why it's a fight. It's a fight we have to have. It's for honestly, I was going to say it's for the country. It is also for all the kids out there. It's to at least protect them until they're adults want to have a different conversation about what happens when people are adults. Sure. Fine. We're talking about kids here.

I'm a columnist at the New York Post and Fox News and author of the best-selling books, Dolan Youth, and now host of the brand new Carol Markowitz show. Yes, I'm taking a new journey and launching a podcast part of the Clay and Buck podcast network. I would like to invite you to join me for the ride. We'll talk to the biggest names in public life and get real answers to the deep questions. I've spent years writing a culture column about the things that really matter and then a book on how to protect your children from the bad forces around them. Now we're bringing that fight along with some fun to this brand new podcast. We'll also feature an advice segment. So send in your questions to Carol Markowitz show at gmail.com. Join me for the Carol Markowitz show new episodes dropping every Monday and Thursday on the iHeart Radio app, Apple podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts. I anticipate the board is also going to look at some of the infrastructure here like the utilities and then ask the question, it would be better to sell that utility from the district to maybe a private a private entity who can operate it more efficiently. Maybe the district would save some money on this and could put that towards paying down the bonds and the debts. So that's the Santa's talking about the utility pro utilities provision to the Reedy Creek province or whatever it's called in Florida where Disneyland is. Have you been to Disney World Disney World? Sorry Disney World. I think I went once when I was five. I have no recollection whatsoever and haven't been back since. I'm not I'm not up on the Disney stuff in terms of what's actually going on there. I am up on the and we are up on the Ron DeSantis Disney throw down. And I think that this is showing for first of all, they're they're pushing more agenda stuff from Disney that people are saying they're not backing off entirely. They're trying to find ways to have their way and and and be leftist in their inclinations. And Ron DeSantis Clay has decided that he's not gonna back down from this fight. Ron DeSantis, we'll talk about this when we come back. And I would consider myself to be something of a Disney World expert. And I really want to have some fun buck Keith Oberman, who may be the craziest left winger in on the planet right now formerly of MSNBC. He says that it's time for Disney CEO Bob Iger to stand up to Ron DeSantis and move Disney World to Puerto Rico. So when we come back for anybody who has ever been to Disney World, and I bet it's a huge percentage of our audience of all the crazy things that Keith Oberman has said, just move Disney World to Puerto Rico. Maybe they're craziest, but we'll have some fun with that and the ongoing Disney DeSantis battle and what it means when we come back. Today is tax day.

All right, Trump clearly Buck has a skill in that whatever he says, he's managed to get people to say insanely dumber things in response to whatever he says. They'll follow him down the rabbit hole of absurdity and somehow make themselves look worse. And I see this right now on social media because we're talking about DeSantis versus Disney. And Stewart Elliot and Keith Oberman are two men of the left. Stewart Elliot works at the New York Times. Keith Oberman, I don't know that Keith Oberman has a job now. I mean, he's bonkers. But both of them are arguing, and I'm not making this up, that Disney World should just move from Florida and just move to a new place. Keith Oberman says Disney World should move to Puerto Rico, which is funny primarily in the context of Walt Disney specifically picked the Orlando area because he wanted as many people as possible to be able to drive to Disney World. It's hard to get to Puerto Rico. So the idea that like people are going to be able to hop into their car, they're going to hit South Florida and then realize, Oh, we're a long way to Puerto Rico. You can't drive to it. Stewart Elliot at the New York Times writes, who else thinks Disney should call DeSantis's bluff and announce its closing Disney World and recreating it in another more welcoming state whose residence will get first crack at all the jobs. So, but you said you went to Disney World when you were five Disney World for anybody who has ever been there. I bet it would cost $20 billion to try and move Disney World to another location. And many of the things at Disney World, it would be impossible to move, right? So if you've ever been there, they have massive physical hotels because the lesson that Walt Disney learned from Disney Land that he built out in Anaheim was, I need to own all the land because otherwise all these other hotels get built right by the park and they make all the money and salary off of my park. So he bought, I don't know, 225,000. I don't know how many acres, totally Disney World is now miles and miles of square miles that now is in Disney World. And so this idea that I don't think you can underrate how dumb many people are who work in journalism. And some of you might be saying, well, I listen to your show every day. You guys are super, super dumb and you can make that argument. But trust me, whether you like Buckeye, we are by far in the 1% for people who work in our field, right? There are a lot of really dumb people. I'm not going to argue with it. I'm not going to argue with it. I would just, I would put Buck and myself in a test up against any duo that is on the air daily, anywhere in media. Like I will throw down, I think that we on anybody who speaks daily on media, I think that we would win like whatever academic competition there was. We got to do like media jeopardy. We do like a tag team, you know, media jeopardy. If there were a quiz bowl, spelling bee, I think we would win all of them. All right, so maybe not for me pronunciations because I'm not very good at those, but so fanatics, but otherwise we're really good. So Buck, these people are crazy and I want to play and DeSantis has managed to win this battle with Disney, I believe. And he's not just winning it. He's making his critics truly sound insane. And they've obviously been in this battle. I want to play a couple of cuts with you. Let me play cut four here. And then we'll also play cut five because Disney has tried to outsmart DeSantis and the DeSantis legal team really pretty sharp. And they are failing. Here's cut four. I've worked with both leaders of the House and Senate. There is a bill that will be put out in the Florida legislature that will make sure that the agreements purported to be entered into by Disney are revoked and the people's will is established and is upheld. And that is something that's very important. And at the end of the day, we made the decision as a state, as a people through the medium of our elections, that we would not have one corporation serving as its own government. That's not good government. It's not something that we want to entertain in Florida any longer and whatever rationale there was 60 years ago to do that. Clearly now we're in a much different era as a state. I think that's really well said. And then Buck here is cut five. And then we can react. He says, Hey, maybe we should build a prison next door to Disney World. Listen, come to think of enough people like, what should we do with this land? And so, you know, it's like, okay, kids, I mean, people have said, you know, maybe, maybe have another, maybe create a state park, maybe try to do more amusement parks. Someone even said like, maybe you need another state present. Who knows? I mean, I just think that the possibilities are endless. Buck, I mean, this is, this is a guy who is not going to allow for one company. Doesn't matter how powerful, how rich, all that stuff, because Disney's been getting away with that for a long time. Disney decided to act as a political entity in the state of Florida. And so, remember, all the complaining they have, but really Creek improvement district. I have to always remember this is what it's called the really Creek improvement district. All the complaining you're hearing is that Disney has enjoyed special perks. And given to it by the legislature in Florida, special perks can be taken away. You know, I think the argument that I've seen some conservators make. Oh, how dare he, it's so anti business to penalize a business like this. And it's, well, hold on a second, giving somebody, you know, if the, if you're giving a tax credit for film for the film industry, which a lot of different states have done, right? You're basically giving them money to come film in your state. Well, if that, you know, the production company and of paramount or whatever goes off and says, well, your state is bigoted because of some legislation or something else. And you pull that special incentive that your state had given them. That doesn't strike me as anything other than a totally reasonable response that Democrats not only would do have done clay everywhere all over the country, like they'll take action right away against a state if they can. So, or sorry, against a corporation within their state, if they can, they'll penalize companies. They'll run you out of business if they don't like your politics. Yeah. And you know what's really, I think particularly galling about Disney's stupidity here is there was a great test. What have we said on the show for some time? Really, there should be a battle between Gavin Newsom and Ron DeSantis because they had such a diametrically opposed perspectives on COVID. 700,000 people have left California. 800,000 people have moved to Florida. But, but a really great example of this was Disneyland was shut down. Disneyland and Anaheim was shut down for a, I believe it was a full year longer because of COVID than Disney World. So, if you're running Disney, Ron DeSantis was one of the best allies of Disney that has ever existed. He fought as hard as he could to open up Disney World and allow people to be able to go into that theme park. Meanwhile, Gavin Newsom kept Disneyland closed for an additional year. It's a fascinating story to manage and compare Disneyland versus Disney World to different sides of the country. And yet, Ron DeSantis, who was the best friend of Disney. Remember, he also got the MBA there. He, I'm not sure that Disney has ever had a better corporate ally in the 21st century than Ron DeSantis during COVID. And yet they have managed to spite him by continuing to embrace what politics and try to defy his ability as the governor of Florida to run his state as he sees fit. And the gut, remember, Bob Chapick got fired, the CEO who went toe to toe with DeSantis and Bob Iger, who has come in, is supposedly only going to be there for another 18 months. So DeSantis may well outlast two different Disney CEOs and have the ultimate final victory here. You know, there's also the great stuff that Disney has done. A lot of it is, is in the past, like Disney's been resting on its laurels for a long time. I know they do. There's the Mandalorian and they make a lot of other things now too. But the brand of Disney was built over many decades. Now Disney, we saw has people running content who say things like I have a pansexual child and a transgender child too separately, which the chances of that are truly by the numbers like one in 10 million just so happens ahead of content to Disney happen. So this has changed where it's a different Disney now at the top and the fact that they can still make a lot of money by having, you know, Mickey and Minnie, by the way, my parents told me they did take me. I they I was so young, I vaguely remember Space Mountain. Isn't that a thing? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Space Mountain was the old, the biggest roller coaster there for a long time. This is what we did on Travis Family Vacations. We would stay at Fort Wilderness Campground in a pop up tent trailer combo. My parents loved Disney World. That was the Travis Family Vacation. We would go to Disney World. So I've been, you know, probably I've been in Disney World on the property a hundred days or more certainly in my life. So I know that place pretty well. And you know, the people that are pushing back, obviously, the left is in freak out mode because this is just about power for them. Disney's a very powerful corporation that has a a least nominally an all Americana kind of brand, kind of like Bud Light, by the way, and you know, even more so than Bud Light because it goes right to children and families and everything else. And the for the people that are saying to Santa shouldn't be doing this, I always look at them and say, okay, so so what is the answer? Massive corporations get to just decide, you know, do we want Disney to operate like the teachers unions do in cities where it just is just the machinery of the most left wing lunacy and undermines all good policy in the state undermines what the people actually want? No, I don't think that's a good idea. I think sometimes you fight the bullies. Yeah, that's a great point. And I also think and this is me speaking out as a parent who watches a lot of these movies. We talked about this Super Mario Brothers just set the second greatest all time comedy opening for a cartoon, right? There was another Super Mario Brothers movie with Bob Hoskins someone sent us an email one of our VIPs that movie stunk. Yeah, that one bombed. I think that was a live action Super Mario Brothers. This is just a cartoon. But what I have heard from parents about Super Mario Brothers is what Disney is failing at now. You want to go to a movie and have there be no politics in it at all. And when I go to Disney movies now, they drop in like, hey, you're the lesbian daughter of a trans like that. They just throw random weird, not connected to the storyline at all backgrounds of characters. And I mentioned the movie air Super Mario Brothers. I think there is a maverick and top gun. The biggest movie last year. I think there's a desperate desire on the part of families to just go watch a movie that is nothing other than purely entertaining. And that is what Disney used to deliver. And now I think they've lost their way. The diversity and inclusion lunatics. What did you say? That company off the road was your favorite Disney cartoon? We got this on the air. Well, you went way off the reservation with Lady of the Tramp a classic for the canine lovers out there. Excuse me. Late. This is maybe your most ridiculous take ever. That Lady in the Tramp is the best Disney movie that I've ever had. I might even say Beauty and the Beast is the best Disney movie of all time. I'm just gonna throw that out. I think more people might appreciate that. When I was a kid, I was Peter Pan got boy who never grew up fabulous. Respectable. I respect way more respectable than Lady in the Tramp. That's frankly, there might be like three girls listening right now that agree with you. Everybody else is like totally in disagreement. Just saying. If bucket had more testosterone as a kid, Lady in the Tramp would not have been his favorite Disney movie just tossing it out there. And maybe maybe Joe Biden's favorite Disney movie of all time, Lady in the Tramp. We all know we need more testosterone in the Biden White House and my friends at Shaw can hook them up. Did you know that the average man today has 50% as much testosterone as they had back in the past and they don't all work now at ESPN and Disney. So I'm working the Biden White House too. How much different would Disney be if we sent a big supply of testosterone right to Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney's office. We said, Hey bud, take this and also give it to the other men that work in your company because we're convinced they have zero testosterone. No backbone. They won't stand up to anybody.

Welcome back to Clay and Buck. Just let you know come up in a few minutes we'll talk about Prime in New York and also a couple of incidents of well one case lethal force or attempted lethal force in our case somebody was killed. Two incidents getting a lot of attention from the national news media. Meanwhile the mayor of New York City weighing in on how everybody should be vegetarian or vegan instead of focusing in on the only reason anybody really seemed to hire him initially which was to clean up the the city of New York when it comes to crime. So we're going to get into some serious news and everything here in just a minute. We've only got a couple minutes here and I just I just want to go right now. What do you call the tell the tape Mr. Clay is that I like to go to the data. I'm a data guy. So I went to Rotten Tomatoes database on all Disney movies all time. Mr. Fancy Man over here with his his telling me that no one like Lady the Tramp. I will say there was a there was a sleeper here that got it that I didn't think of that probably I should have known would be the most. Now this is based on all Rotten Tomatoes rankings all time online. Is this critics or is this like average viewers viewers? Okay viewers ratings all time. The most popular do you want to guess what the most popular is all time according to Cinderella? A good guess Pinocchio. Pinocchio number one all time. I will say that 101 Dalmatians comes in at number three also very strong. What's number two Cinderella? No, Zootopia. I don't even know what that is. See I okay. All right. No excuse me. The people of Spades not the second greatest Disney animated movie of all time. I don't even know what Zootopia is. This is by the people. So let's not let's not undermine the list until I get out what I want to get out here. You've got a few other ones that you all know like Fantasia's number eight but coming in at number 13 on the list all time. Lady on the Tramp. This is out of about 60 some odd movies. Now Mr. Clay Peter Pan made in 1953 number 43 on the list. I'm just saying I'm just you know you know I know that there is there is no what 43. I mean it's it is a it is a guy flying around and types. They're upset because there's like mermaids and it's the boys who never grow up and it's like sexist. I think they're remaking Peter Pan and they're and they're Indians in it and it's unacceptable to have the Indians or what you know like playing on the on the drums. This is you've allowed the woke universe to inform. Wow we're going to that one. Peter from the war flag on this Travis. I'm throwing the woke flag. There's no way that this is crazy. Lady in the Tramp is better than Peter Pan according to the the real people. You know Clay and I can put up our top fruit for your kids out there. You know he's got kids. I don't but I've seen a lot of Disney movies growing up so we can give you our top ones. Maybe we'll put them up on the clay and buck.com about you know I mean Peter Pan maybe makes it into my top 10 maybe. Just say it. I can't believe they're 60. The fact that Zootopia is number two all time. I don't know what that is. I don't know what it is. I don't think anybody's ever watched it."
