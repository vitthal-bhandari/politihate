    "text": " Black Friday weeks by Madea Marked. Let's go! Clear your leviem at spatter on the tech for Black Friday Verizon. So as an Apple Watch S.A.M. at Staircase features, former Tveil dei Le t'Vintr\u00fch. Talk to you here at the Cashco. New by Madea Marked. Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Ooh, welcome back in, Clay Travis, Buck Sexton Show. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us as we roll through. The Thursday edition of the program, we're gonna be joined. This is gonna be a really interesting conversation, I think. David Zweid, who has been covering so much of the COVID controversies in an honest way at I believe New York Magazine, correct me if I'm wrong on that, Ali. He has got a great piece out, pointing out a connection that I hadn't really thought about. The universities that are most restrictive of free speech are most demanding of COVID shot. And it's such an interesting combo to think about. Again, the universities that are the most restrictive of what can be said on their campus in classrooms are the most militant about insisting that you get the COVID shot and boosters in order to be able to attend their university. Such an interesting window because the left in many ways has become so overarching and controlling that they are attacking freedom in all directions. They want to control what jokes you can make. They want to control what opinions you can have. And they want to demand simultaneously that they be able to control you when it comes to the COVID shot, a completely unnecessary shot for most people who are healthy and young, for instance, in this country. That conversation, trust me, is gonna be really interesting. Top of the third hour, Senator Josh Hawley from Missouri will join us. But I wanted to hit this because I told you South Park, which is one of the last fearless bastions of humor in this country. They will ridicule and lampoon anyone in a position of power, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, many of their ridiculous commentary, much of it, has actually been proven true. Remember, they were one of the first places to start mocking the idea that a trans woman that is a man could become a female champion in athletics. They were years ahead of this becoming a reality. And I need to tee off for a moment when I mention that. Did you see what US women's national team member Alex Morgan said in the last day or so? I like Alex Morgan. She's a talented women soccer player. She's a mom now, I think. Back in the day, she did the SI swimsuit issue. Really pretty, good looking, makes a lot of money as an athlete because she's talented as an athlete and also has that wholesome appeal. She came out the other day and said that the US women's soccer team should consider not playing in Florida and Texas because those states require people to compete against the gender at their birth. And it was such a ludicrously dumb statement. It almost made my brain explode. Because the US women's soccer team is the best women's soccer team in the world. We win the World Cup all the time. A large degree, the reason why we do that is because women here have freedoms and most of the countries we play against women don't have freedoms. When the women's World Cup bracket comes out, you can almost pick every winner just based on the freedom that women have in those countries. It shouldn't be a big surprise that the US women are better than the Afghan women. Yeah, they can go to school and they can wear shorts. They should be better at soccer than people who can't go to school and can't wear shorts. Which is why it's so frustrating to me that the US women don't come out and say, hey, let's support women's human rights around the world. Instead, they've allied themselves with the woke imbeciles in America. And so Alex Morgan said, well, maybe we shouldn't even play in Texas and Florida because they're not letting trans people compete against women. And I'm like, are you really this dumb? Because there would be no US women's soccer team if they let dudes who want to identify as women be on the US women's soccer team instead. The US women's soccer team lost to a group of boys 15 and under in Dallas, Texas in a tune up match for the women's World Cup. Five to two, I believe. Think about that for a minute. 15 year old boys in one major metropolitan city, a travel team of 15 year old and under boys absolutely dominated the grown women on the US women's soccer team. If the US women played the US men in soccer, the US men would win 100 to nothing and the US women would have no goal scoring opportunities. That's not hyperbole. That's not exaggeration. If the US men went 100% full bore, they would win like a hundred to nothing in a soccer match against the US women. There is no comparison between the skill level of US men's soccer players and US women's soccer players. The women win because they play against women. That's not denigrating them. But they're arguing against Texas and Florida laws that just require that kids in high school compete against the gender on their birth certificate. That's 100% normal. If we didn't require that, then some 15 year old boy who decides to identify as a girl would be the best soccer player in the state of Texas or the state of Florida. And they would dominate women's sports, which is what we're seeing happen like the Leitama situation, where this dude who decides to become a woman becomes the greatest women swimmer in college. So in all seriousness, how in the world has it become so commonplace for women's athletes to be so dumb? They're basically rooting for the erasure of women's athletics. Because these trans dudes, these dudes who decide to become women are going to, if enough of them do it, totally eliminate all women's athletes because the men are bigger, stronger, and faster than the women and suddenly deciding to identify as a woman doesn't change the biological advantages that you have. So South Park was actually ahead of the curve in pointing out the logical extension of this absurdity. And I gotta be honest with you. I loved this clip that I saw this morning. I haven't watched the whole show, but they're one of the few media outlets. I wish Buck were here to hear this, to completely go after the hypocrisy of Harry and Meghan complaining about getting too much media attention by doing more and more interviews, more and more reality specials, and certainly by Harry releasing his latest new best-selling book. Here is a clip from South Park, absolutely eviscerating Harry and Meghan. Enjoy. You've lived a life with the royal family. You've had everything handed to you, but you're saying your life has been hard, and now you've written all about it in your new book, wait, yes, that's right, friends. You say my wife and I have totally like, you should write a book because your family like stupid and then start like journalists. So you hate journalists. That's right. And now you wrote a book that reports on the lives of the royal family. Right, so you're a journalist. We just wanna be normal people. All this attention is so hard. Isn't it true, sir, that your questionable wife has her own TV show and hangs out with celebrities and does fashion magazines? What are you suggesting? Well, I just think some people might say that your Instagram loving bitch wife actually doesn't want her privacy. How dare you, sir? My Instagram loving bitch wife has always wanted her privacy. And you know what else? To hell with Canada, we are leaving. Oh my God, my Instagram loving bitch wife. I just, let me just point this out. Republicans have a massive opportunity that I would have never believed it was possible. I'm writing this in my book, which is gonna be out in September. Would you have ever believed that Republicans could be the party that says, we like jokes and we like comedians and we think comedians should be able to make jokes because we like to laugh? Democrats have so lost their mind. Can we just clip by the way, that little part about the Instagram loving bitch wife that last little bit because I, if you didn't, I tweeted out the clip and you might not be able to tell greatly the audio because there's a character who's speaking as if she's Meghan, there's a character who's speaking as if he's Harry. And then there is the interviewer of what is described as a Canadian broadcast show. So you might need to see the clip 100% to enjoy it. But how crazy is it that Democrats have so embraced cancel culture that if a joke makes somebody uncomfortable, they don't believe it should be said. Even beyond that, they think that the joke is violence and that people need to be protected from jokes that make them uncomfortable. What in the, if you were trying to craft a platform to win the majority of America, I've made this analogy before it's in my book. If you go to a comedy club and you pulled up at that comedy club and somebody was standing outside the comedy club with a poster protesting the jokes that were going to be made by the comedian inside. What would you do? Almost every single one of you would roll your eyes and be like, what a freaking loser. Who protests jokes outside of a comedy club? You would dismiss that person as a loser and you would be like, this person doesn't deserve an ounce of my respect or attention. If that same person, and that's despite the fact that whoever that person was would have gotten a poster board, they would have made a sign, they would have gone and gotten transportation to go to the comedy club and they would be standing outside of the comedy club and the heat, the sun, the rain, the, whatever it might be to let their opinion be heard about the dangers of the jokes that were being told inside of that comedy club. Same person gets on social media and tweets old jokes from comedians that they're offended by and the media covers it like it's news and treats those people complaining online as if they are heroes. Why have we gotten to a world where we treat people who are anonymous online with more respect than we would people who are actually physically present in our lives? I would argue we've got this 100% backwards. We should give more respect to the people who are at least willing to publicly put their face and their time out behind their opinions, i.e. the people who show up outside of a comedy club, then we do the people who are complaining on social media, often from anonymous accounts. Yet we're backwards there. I'm not saying we should give credence to any of them. I think they're all losers. It's a sign of how amazing America is that we have so much freedom and so much free time that people can complain about the jokes comedians make because remember they're jokes, they're not real. They're designed to make people laugh. Think about how much different America would look like today if we simply treated everyone complaining online like we do everyone complaining in person, in particular as it pertains to jokes. Just think about it. Your mind's probably blown a little bit, but it is crazy to what extent we've allowed losers on social media to dictate the entire direction this country goes. We'll take some of your calls, then we're going to talk with David Zweig. He is going to be fantastic. I think it's going to be a really interesting discussion about where freedom has gone. I think it ties in with what I just discussed. And if you want to see that clip from South Park, it's up on my Twitter account. You can find it at Clay Travis there. But I want to tell you, as we roll into our number two, preserving your family's legacy in history is a big deal. How many of you out there right now had a dad, mom, grandma, grandpa walked around with one of those kids walked around with one of those camcorders back in the day, recording everything that happened at your family's Thanksgiving or Christmas? How many of you have seen old videos of you opening up Christmas presents from back in the 80s, back in the 90s? You know that VHS tape is designed to disintegrate. It will not last forever. How many of you even still have a VCR in your house to even be able to watch those clips? You need to protect your family's memories and their history while you can. And our friends at Legacy Box can do it. They're based in Chattanooga, Tennessee. My mom's hometown, U.S.-based company. They have more VCRs, probably, than anybody in the entire world because they are trying to preserve so many memories out there every single day. They've got a huge staff. They'll treat your family's history with love, respect, and they'll put it on a digital file so you have it forever. Become your family's hero and save all of these great memories before it's too late. Here's how you do it. Go to LegacyBox.com slash Clay to get a great discount LegacyBox.com slash Clay. Welcome back in, Clay Travis, Buck Sexton Show. A lot of great emails rolling in. I want to hit a couple of them here. Alex Morgan should be asked if the U.S. women's team should play in the 2023 FIFA World Cup. If Visit Saudi is a sponsor. Visit Saudi the Gulf Nations tourist board is set to be unveiled as a sponsor of the Summer's FIFA Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Yeah, look, my position in general on this is I don't have any issue with athletes deciding that they want to speak out aggressively on social issues. But you have to be consistent. This is why, for instance, I've gone after the NBA in a big way over China. If you're going to rip American institutions and say that police hate black people in America, I think at a minimum, you should say, Hey, maybe there shouldn't be Uighurs in concentration camps in Jingjiang, China. You shouldn't take billions of dollars from China for actual slave labor that is taking place while you're ripping the United States and its institutions. Now, if you're just going to say, Hey, we're going to just our goal is to have our business everywhere. Then I get that. But don't rip America for its perceived transgressions as part of what capitalism here and then go overseas and don't say a word about what's going on there. Don't be LeBron James who's making excuses for China while ripping the United States into shreds. Margo writes, poor, under educated Don Lemon again, exposing his lack of attendance the day the teacher explained to adjectives. Prime is that physical, intellectual, political, wisdom, parental, beauty, athletic, which prime is it we need an adjective Don prime. That's a good a good email from Margo. You hit your prime at different ages for different aspects. I didn't have a high level of athletic prime, but I probably hit it around 27 or 28. I'd like to think that my radio prime is going to happen sometime in my 50s or 60s. I hope it's not already here because it ain't that good. According to lots of you anyway, look, I got to tell you, as we get ready to go here from, I think you're going to really enjoy this David Swide conversation that we're about to have right now. And in the meantime, I want to tell you all about our friends. Let me scroll through a lot of different advertising hits that we got to hit on a day to day basis.

First guest of the day. And he has got a really interesting piece up right now. David Zweig has been on the show a couple of times before. Journalist with the Atlantic Free Press and also New York magazine. He has a sub stack. David Zweig.substack.com. And I want to start with something that I hadn't really thought about, but then I read your piece and I was like, man, this is so fascinating. You have pointed out that the universities that have the most stringent speech codes also have the most aggressive requirements for the COVID shot. And it is such an interesting combination that I hadn't thought of before. What led you to this idea? What did you uncover? And what do you think it's telling us? Hey, yeah. Thanks for having me. And I had seen this list from this organization called Fire, which is Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, where they had put together a list of, I think, 200 or so colleges and universities. And it was based on questionnaires that were sent out to thousands and thousands of students where they rated colleges basically by their free speech environment, you know, but by, so it wasn't specifically like, I don't think an official code, because I'm sure most universities have. But it was more about what, you know, tens of thousands of students had to say about what's it like to be on this campus. So I'd seen that list and it stuck in the back of my mind for a long time. And as probably a lot of us have observed, there certainly does seem to be a correlation between kind of the more far left and progressive that that universities have become and the limitations on free speech. And I also, from having written about COVID for the last three years and really tracking it closely, we also all sort of observed that the far left has seemed to be the most militant with a lot of its sort of aggressive pandemic policies, which includes vaccines. So on a whim, you know, I thought, you know, I'm going to know look up a bunch of the colleges on this list. I wonder if there's a correlation. And I got to say, I was blown away by how direct and obvious the correlation was. I thought there might be a little bit of a loose connection, but it is one to one. So what I would say looking at this is that there is this idea of kids, and I'm using kids, obviously, in the definition of college kids as being in incredible danger. There's this palpable fear that someone might say something that upsets you, that you might catch COVID. My wife is finishing law school right now. And at the school, these kids in their 20s were terrified of what might happen to them if they caught COVID. And she had a conversation with some of them and she was like, well, what do you think would happen if you caught COVID? They're like, oh, I would get hospitalized and I might die. And I felt so bad for them in that way because I can't imagine what it's like to live in a world where you are so terrified all the time about what people might say, about what someone might breathe on you and you might get a virus. And it seems to me that instead of trying to toughen these kids up and share with them risk analysis and that a big part of adulthood is understanding how to deal with dangers in your life while still being a normal functioning adult, we're actually coddling them more and more, which is making them weaker and weaker. In other words, iron sharpens iron. I really do think that's true, right? The harder you push yourself, the harder you work, the more you end up as a refined version of yourself, the more you coddle these kids, the more coddled they become and the weaker they become. Yeah, you articulated this really well. I think better than I did in my piece, which is like this sort of broader connection between a culture or almost like an ideology of victimhood and of danger, where free speech and hearing ideas is dangerous, hearing things that you don't want to hear can harm you, it makes sense that the people that kind of enforced that type of environment would also then see COVID as this incredibly dangerous thing to healthy young college students. So I think you're right to draw that line from those two things. It's really kind of like an overall overarching way that these people conduct their lives, the people in charge as well as, I guess, a lot of students at these universities. I think there is something else going on as well, which is, which I touched on in my piece on this, which is, I think it's also obviously just part of signaling to the tribe that like, let's set aside the larger thesis that you mentioned, which I agree with. I think it's also, it was seen as quote, bad, and you're on the right with the bad people. If you had questions about some of these COVID restrictions and mitigations or vaccine mandates, therefore, you know, just by like a deductive reasoning. Therefore, if we want to be seen as the good people on the far left side, the best way to signal that is to be as aggressive as we can, that the sort of like more fearful we appear and the more, you know, a militant we become in our efforts to sort of fight the COVID foe, then the more that shows everyone that our university is on the correct side of things. All right, you write at places, and we've talked about this before, which I love and respect that you've had the bravery to do this. New York magazine, the Atlantic, I mean, these are not places where I would imagine a lot of the things that you have said. The audience has been particularly receptive to it. You know, the idea that masks don't make sense. The idea that schools should open up. Are you starting to hear from people who may have been foes of your early reporting? Yeah, you ended up being right on all this because it's interesting. It seems like there hasn't really been a reckoning. It's just like there's a lot of people who want to pretend, oh, we couldn't have known any better. It was super complicated in the early days, and they want to write off the fact that people like you and frankly me and buck who's on his honeymoon right now, we're actually out there saying no, no, in real time. This isn't making sense. I'm curious what you're seeing in your social networks and hearing from people about this. Yeah, I think you're exactly right. I have for a long time and there's a lot of people who are, you know, justifiably angry about this and they want there to be, you know, to use your word of reckoning or, you know, people have to be held accountable and I don't disagree with people in charge being held accountable. But as far as- I mean, that's the entire basis of democracy is holding your leaders accountable for their choices. I mean, that's the point of having elections. Yeah, there should be something that happens to some sort of commission or something to look into this. But kind of pulling the lens back, just sort of regular people, the millions upon millions of citizens who kind of went along with a lot of these things are, as you were saying, perhaps readers of some of my, you know, early work on this. I don't think there is going to be a reckoning. I think you're right. I think the way, and I'm not an astute enough, you know, observer of history. But I think some things people are- they're never going to acknowledge we were wrong. I think there's sort of like a, you know, there's a cognitive dissonance to that, to the moral injury, you know, that someone would suffer from acknowledging the harm that they caused from things that they had advocated for. I think a lot of it's, you know, optics that people wouldn't want to admit it, you know, out loud to other people. But quite honestly, I think most of it's probably unconscious. So I think we all have our own rationalizations and motivated reasoning. So they made a major publication to say, open the schools. This was in the first week of May of 2020. And I think those people now may recognize that was the right thing, but they'll just simply rationalize it away and say, we didn't know. So, you know, and it's very hard to argue with that without getting into a whole long thing with someone. So I'm not sure of the solution to this, though. Yeah. Well, so, and here's the question last for you. Talking to David Zweig. I was talking about this yesterday on the show. I may build on it here in a little bit. I know that heart, you know, issues are up 30%. Heart deaths, heart attack deaths in people aged 25 to 44. Are you concerned you were right on kids being back in school? You were right on masks. You were right on many of the draconian policies out there. Are you as concerned as I am about whether the long range impact of these COVID shots may also be another thing that is going to linger for a long time? Well, I was one of the first people to write about the link between myocarditis and the COVID vaccines. I interviewed the lead scientist from Israel, and I did this for New York magazine way back when. So I've been very concerned about, you know, these serious adverse events related to the vaccine. With that said, I think the problem is it's going to be very hard to tease out what is causing these things because at this point. Because people are going to argue that it's COVID that caused it, right? That's their that's their that's their linchpin here. It's not the COVID shot. It's the impact of COVID infection. Exactly. And it's basically impossible for anyone to prove one way or the other. Of course, different researchers and different scientists are going to produce different studies on this. But the fact is without like a proper, you know, separated pool of people, everyone has had COVID just about. And, you know, what is it? 80% or something more of the people have been vaccinated. So at that point, it's really hard to tease out. And needless to say, I was talking to a researcher I'm friendly with at one of the top medical schools in the country. The other day, and I said to her, can you please run a study where we look at the geographic distribution of long COVID sufferers and then let's cross reference that with the voting patterns. I'd be curious to see that. That's a great idea. That is to say that like, you know, I know you didn't mention long COVID specifically, but and I'm not minimizing for the people who genuinely are suffering. But I think, again, people are going to see what they want to see, you know, needless to say, you know, Long COVID in your theory, which I think is true, is going to be far more common in the Northeast and in California than it is in Alabama and Mississippi. I think so, you know, someone could argue, well, maybe part of that is, you know, lack of diagnosis and some of the other areas, but nevertheless, I mean, There are actually and I make this claim that this sort of idea for a study only because we've seen from some of the existing studies that have been done that they're the one of the biggest indicators of long COVID is if someone has anxiety about So again, I'm not diminishing. I think there genuinely are people really suffering from this, but we also have to acknowledge, you know, some other factors that may or may not be influencing things. So just getting back to your thing about that, you know, the heart on the issues. We already can predict which person, which people will blame it on COVID and which person and which people will blame it on the vaccine. I think we don't know. I think it's going to be really hard to ever tease it out, but, you know, we're just going to have to see what happened. But, you know, with all that said, I mean, this gets back to the point to point in my article to some extent, which is what we do know, in my view, at least, is that healthy young people, particularly so who have already been infected with COVID. So there is not robust evidence that they have any benefit of getting vaccinated, let alone, you know, triple quadruple dose at this point, and certainly no evidence that this has a real, you know, epidemiological benefit like that. It's going to, you know, stop transmission. So it just seems like an like, it's an extraordinary moment that that these universities, particularly so many of these ideally universities, you know, the most elite institutions in our country. And in my view, have these policies that are just wildly divorced from, you know, a scientific or ethical basis. Fantastic work. You've been doing it for a long time. We'll have you on again. When the new book comes out, I believe David Zweig. Keep it up, my man. Thanks for having me. Take care. If your cell phone service, he's fantastic, by the way, really done fantastic work on COVID.

Close enough hour number two. We're going to be joined by Senator Josh Hawley at Missouri at the top of the next hour. He was just charged on stage by a climate activist. We'll see how Senator Hawley handled that. He also probably glowed about his Kansas City Chiefs winning the Super Bowl. Unfortunately, I think he's going to be able to glowed about that for years and years to come because he's got Patrick Mahomes' quarterback. But we just had a great conversation with David Zweig there. And I just want to encourage all of you to go read his piece combining the fear of words that might hurt you with COVID, a virus that might hurt you for young people who are actually under threat from neither words nor COVID on a statistical basis and how that coddling of the American mind is creating a generation that cannot handle any kind of failure or conflict or frankly risk at all and what that might mean going forward. I also want to point out, I talked about this yesterday, 30% increase in heart attack deaths in people aged 25 to 44 statistically proven. That is a fact. Why? Why is that occurring? What he hit on is now people are acknowledging that far more are dying of heart attacks and they're saying, well, this is the impact of COVID. Why can't we have a study of people like me who I know have had COVID at least twice? I never got the COVID shot. I am 43 years old right now. Am I under a greater risk of heart attack or would I be under a greater risk of heart attack if I had had COVID and also gotten the COVID shots? Because remember, almost everyone has had COVID at some point at this time. We need a study of people like me who never got the COVID shot and we need to compare it with people who got the COVID shot because almost all of us got COVID to see whether the rate of COVID heart attack death is higher for people who just got COVID like me or for people who got COVID and also got the COVID shots. I think you know what my hypothesis would be. I think the COVID shot made people more likely to have heart attacks. I could be wrong. Why can't we get that study and know for sure? Josh Hawley next, Senator, keep hanging with us."
