It's so predictable in fact. I predicted it told you they were gonna try this again and Now what they're saying is just mask up and everybody everybody even those previously infected even the very young even the healthy Must get vaccinated or else. I don't know there could be There could be some lockdowns real Lockdowns in your future. That's what they are out there saying right now here is Joe Biden saying he is considering a Mandate for all federal employees play one That's under consideration right now, but if you're not backstage you're not nearly as smart as I thought you Sorry son of consideration Right now That's the guy who's president United States just remember that all your Smug Democrat friends running around Who have been trying to tell you how awful Trump is for years and years and how he's destroying the country? They replaced him with this guy Yeah, another smart as I thought you were I Cannot believe Joe Biden as president and even more even more so can't believe anybody pretends that it's not a complete and total absurdity But let's look at this for a moment. Let's just let's dive into this together. What has changed Why is it that now things have to be different? Well the answer is if you look at the data There are more cases, but There are not a lot more deaths. There's been an increase in hospitalizations but if the hospitalizations aren't overwhelming the hospitals and if people aren't Dying in large numbers from COVID is it really? The health emergency that they're pretending it is right now that requires a change in The guidance mask many is making a comeback. That's the point here. I write about this on bucksexon.com They go check out my editorial on how the mask reversal is bull crap and everybody knows it But I still remember when we were promised We got a hundred millions 100 million Americans vaccinated so there's a hundred million of us who have natural immunity and do we get our basic freedom back? No, we don't They're trying to roll it back Somehow the science has changed dramatically in the blink of an eye and this is why you got Fauci Walking around saying, you know, you got a mask even if you're vaccinated play too The data are clear the most recent data that when a person gets infected who it has been Vaccinated namely a breakthrough infection and they get infected with the Delta variant that the level of virus in their nasal Farynx is about a thousand times higher than with the alpha variants and it has been well documented that even though it's a rare occurrence those individuals can and have transmitted the virus to uninfected individuals and for that reason The recommendations and the guidelines have been changed to say that if you are vaccinated Even though you are vaccinated when you are in an indoor public setting in an area of the country with a high degree of viral dynamics namely the Red and orange sections on the CDC chart then you need to wear a mask even though you are vaccinated I Need to know why? We don't have Fauci telling us to wear two masks Because of the dynamics of infection to stop the droplets Two masks are better than one mask Remember that double mask. Why not double mask now? I Thought that was about the science. In fact, I thought it was about the science when a couple of months ago the CDC director said Oh, no, if you're vaccinated, you don't have to wear a mask anymore Now they're changing it. Why? The only reason they could possibly want to change it is because the vaccines don't work as well as they said They did at least when it comes to stopping transmission and stopping all infection That's another way of saying that when they were telling us the science was settled a couple of months ago. They were wrong There is now new information But is that even really the case or rather are they making this decision about masks because of this? New information Well, they're telling us it's a surge in the unvaccinated and so we all need to be really frightened really Unguard because of this play three Right now fortunately for us we have enough people vaccinated that you're not going to see a Wave or a surge of infections among the vaccinated it will be a surge Of infections among the unvaccinated it will be an outbreak among the unvaccinated people not getting vaccinated Not only is a bad thing for them It could actually interfere in a negative way With the rest of the country by generating variants that would elude the vaccines. That's the thing we're concerned about Ah, you see get vaccinated or else you're a petri dish for a super covid virus As if we didn't have enough anxiety here as if there wasn't already enough Other rising of those who have not gotten the vaccine. I have not gotten the vaccine folks, but I have had covid therefore I have natural immunity So why should I be told that I'm a risk When the most recent major studies actually show that natural immunity is yes, you guessed it More durable and more effective than the vaccine derived immunity How many people are actually Dying right now from covid in this country Just to give you a sense of it. New York City currently has couple of hundred people in the hospital for covid Los angeles Has nine per one thousand one hundred thousand residents hospitalized with the disease So anybody who thinks those are pandemic numbers that justify mask mandates should wear a helmet every time You get into a car and take baths with a snorkel on just in case, you know, you pass out or you hit your head or something This is stupid beyond words And I also think at some point we have to say as a society the same way we have for the flu vaccine for many years Right a lot of people including at high risk know there's a flu vaccine don't get it They choose not to get it and a lot of people die from the flu We're at a point now where if someone's getting covid and they're getting really sick And they die from covid and they didn't get the vaccine They made a choice to not get the vaccine Now some people would say buck they might have died with the vaccine anyway and sure i'm not i'm not saying anything other than People get to make decisions about their own lives and those decisions have consequences And I don't have to be constantly forced to be worried about their decisions and I certainly will not be coerced into forcing them To make certain decisions about their own health But you see the problem with this all long has been they've tried to make this a collective issue And they're not done You know Biden back in december was saying and now the clip is making a lot of the rounds on the media That he didn't want matt he didn't want vaccine mandates Well now his cdc director is basically saying yeah, well look what they're doing in europe that looks pretty cool Maybe we will do that play five But they're issuing health health passes there right where you know you can go to a disco or a disco tech as they like to call it If you have a health pass is that something that the cdc would ever lead into or Perhaps advise here, you know, I think some communities are doing that and and that may very well be be a path forward I do want to sort of comment that in some fully vaccinated Venues if there are people if they're unmasked and there are a few people who are transmitting there As a fully vaccinated person it is possible to pick up disease in those settings We've seen that in some of our outbreaks investigations this summer, which is why overall It's so very critical to just get the huge amount of disease in some of these areas down Huge amount of disease Why why do we have to worry about the amount of the disease really? Hospitalizations and deaths are all that matter and really deaths are what matter And those are very very low I mean there are places like the north east and the north east of the united states uh, los angeles california where caseload is very very manageable deaths are Practically non-existent right now on a day-to-day basis from from covid. I mean you're talking about maybe uh in the in the dozens Something like that Very very low numbers, but this is the mentality of covid zero that we're fighting against Which also comes from this this belief that the lockdowns the democrats the fauciites have that if only we take more extreme anti-covid measures If only we're willing to go even further in the inconvenience And the absurdity of these measures if we do those things Will be in a much better position Everything will be fine, but that's just not true This is where you get double mask where goggles Socially distance all the time even when you're outside even when you're vaccinated. I mean this is this is a mental illness that they have But the white house suffers from it. I mean you have to remember the white house is very much uh also On board for these extremes of fauciism play for We Will of course be abiding by every aspect of the cdc guidelines on masking that they will provide this afternoon And that does mean as you convey it that we will be looking at The rates in different areas where the president may visit and also the rates As they if they move in washington dc and we will apply guidance accordingly That means we will be prepared to wear masks again if if required if the if the guidance is is leading to that As would the president and that will continue to be the case I mean at what point do we just say enoughs enough Life's not perfect the government can't protect you from everything. It certainly can't protect you from a virus And we just get to live our lives At what point do we say that this is no long that the the collective mass mobilization of everybody has to do all these things To fight against this virus is absurd and counterproductive. No longer necessary We have lived with flu as well as other diseases communicable diseases in our society for as long as we've had a society And we've never assumed that we should just go to constant extreme measures to prevent The spread of those diseases. So why the big change here As you know, this has all been infused with politics at every step of the way the democrats have been shouting the science the science And the rest of us look at them and say, you know your science which you act like I mean democrats act like their science Is sacrosanct never changing and just solid as can be And yet they change their designations they change their regulations frequently Frequently they make these distinctions about oh, we've got to do something else. No. Oh, that's not the way it is And yet The fact that they change what they say is unchangeable and certain you're not supposed to pay any attention to you You're not supposed to spend a moment of your time actually wondering hold on a second if they were wrong the last time Could they be wrong this time? Stop asking questions. That's the most important thing the Fauci had to want from you stop asking questions and obey All right I love my pillow products I just got my dad the my towels from mike lindell's my pillow And I had to get my mom matching sets too because they just absolutely love The towels they love the my pillows they've got on their beds.

Oh, oh, I just did it there. See what I just did microaggression Man-splaining no, but if you were a a person of science in the medical community You would know that you're not allowed these days to make this most basic of biological distinctions Perry wife says the piece here some of the country's top medical students are being taught that humans are not Like other mammals a species compromising two sexes The notion of sex they are learning is a man-made creation This is Astonishing let me just read you from this piece from katie herd zog on berry wisest sub stack During a recent endocrinology course at a top medical school in the university of california system A professor stopped mid-lecture to apologize for something he'd said at the beginning of class I don't want you to think that i'm in any way trying to imply anything And if you can summon some generosity forgive me, I would really appreciate it The physician says in a recording per provided by a student in the class Again, I'm very sorry for that. It was certainly not my intention to offend anyone The worst thing that I can do as a human being is to be offensive his offense using the term pregnant women I said when a woman is pregnant which implies that only women can get pregnant and I most seriously Sincerely apologize to all of you Wasn't the first time that the student had heard instructor apologizing for using language that to most americans Would seem utterly inoffensive words like male and female. Why is it a problem to say male and female? Why is it a problem to say breastfeeding? It's just feeding Or to say pregnant woman You have to say pregnant person now this oh because otherwise you are being trans phobic and trans uh trans agenda the trans agenda is a human rights issue With all the moral certainty and righteousness of the civil rights movement. That's what you are to believe That's what the left in this country even in medical schools believes And that's why As you see this play out you should be deeply concerned about what's happening here We've already lost a lot of faith in the medical community in this country because of the way so many of them have been politicized and either weaponize for purposes of politics or silenced Because they're not allowed to speak out against the craziness but as All of this is happening people are paying attention. They're seeing that Doctors particularly those that have blue checks next to their names on social media Can be every bit as partisan as a journalist a news anchor a university professor you name it And the woke madness has spread into medical schools. This is really concerning when this isn't just in rhetorical terms This actually results in horrible outcomes for patients Go back to this berry white sub stack in 2019 the new england journal of medicine medicine reported the case of a 32 year old Transgender man who went to an er complaining of abdominal pain While the patient disclosed he was transgender his medical records did not he was simply a man The triage nurse determined that the patient who was obese Was in pain because he'd stopped taking a medication to relieve hypertension This was no emergency. She decided she was wrong The patient was in fact pregnant and in labor By the time the hospital staff realized that it was too late The baby was dead and the patient despite his own shock at being pregnant was shattered Are there's a lot in here. All right, that's the end of the quote First off notice how even in this piece by berry wise we refer to a Female as he because it's a transgender man But that's not accurate That's not accurate and that accuracy is a real thing a tangible observable demonstrable thing Male female is a question of truth. It's not a question of belief or feeling And when people deny that truth There can be consequences even life threatening or life ending consequences has happened in this case So I would note that even here where they're pointing out the absurdity in this piece of Not using male and female as terms in a medical school and a professor Graveling before the class so they know the worst thing in the world is to be offensive wrong Sometimes being offensive is brilliant. Sometimes being offensive is necessary. It's courageous It's wonderful Some people deserve to be offended some ideas deserve Complete and utter humiliation and repudiation That's the reality of living in the world Now the left can pretend that something else is going on that we live in some alternate universe, but we don't have to go along with them And that that professors though university are as scared of this as they are at medical school Um tells you a lot. I mean here here are some very basic facts. Only women can get pregnant There is no transgender surgery. There is nothing going on That can change that We do not have the ability to have a man give birth to a baby Doesn't work This is like saying we can create life out of nothing We can't do it You can you can pretend but that's not true And truth has to be the center of what it is to be A conservative if we aren't conserving the truth, what are we conserving? It's necessary to look at An issue like this of the trans agenda and understand what the broader implications of it are. It's absolutely essential um, and Yeah, I'm A pall that we've even we've gotten to this point a pall that it's taken this long For people to finally see oh and then there's of course there's the transgender Children's situation where they're giving kids puberty of puberty blockers sometimes on the first visit These are prepubescent kids are giving puberty blockers too You know what the long-term implications of puberty puberty blockers are? No, you don't because nobody knows because they haven't done studies These are very powerful drugs with enormous physical and psychological implications But the woke left Is desperate to find another gender identity or whatever crusade and so they want eight-year-olds taking puberty blockers That's what's going and if you point out that this is crazy If you point out that this is wrong They come after you they want to destroy you That's that is unfortunately the country that we are living right now. That is what we are seeing um, you also saw the histrionics and hysteria from democrats yesterday including, uh, the two atoms shift and kinsinger Because msnbc watcher see that and they'll they'll love shift and kinsinger forever as a result of that They'll absolutely love them for it, but there are so many lies That uh, let came up yesterday. Well here. I mentioned this guy kinsinger I mean here's here's the kind of stuff that he was saying play 12 and for all the overheated rhetoric surrounding this committee Our mission is very simple Let's define the truth and it's to ensure accountability Like most americans i'm frustrated that six months after a deadly and Surrection breached the united states capital for several hours on live television We still don't know exactly what happened. Why? Because many and my party have treated this as just another partisan fight It's toxic and it's a disservice to the officers and their families To the staff and the employees on the capital complex to the american people who deserve the truth And to those generations before us who went to war to defend self governance Because self governance is at stake All the self governance is that is at stake Oh no I'm so bad Uh, it's unbelievable, isn't it? It's uh, really people that are the betrayers belong in the Ninth circle of hell to borrow from dante people who betray um are really the worst they're the ones who You just you know treachery the deepest circle of hell, right? That's that's where satan resides himself those who betray their own side those who betray their own obviously judas Resides there Traitors are the absolute worst and we have some republican now I don't mean traitors in the legal sense Because they have the free speech rights, but i'm talking about traitors to their ideology into their party And yet they think they're heroes for doing it Here's one of the many many many lies that we're told during the And it's not even like they're told once they're central to what's going on here in all these uh hearings and all this show trial of Trump voters. That's what this is it's a show trial for all Trump voters january the january 6th commission But we've never said this was okay. I was furious and you know this I was furious as soon as this happened As soon as january 6 was occurring this was a disaster And it's awful for the republican party It's bad for the country and it's just it was just wrong I mean people should be punished you cannot Storm a building and attack police because you don't like an election outcome And i've been consistent on that from the very beginning so is every conservative who knows anything And yet they pretend like we're okay with this no democrats are okay With the blm riots all summer democrats are fine with attacks on federal buildings as long as it's in the name of Social justice or whatever. I mean here's jim jorren saying he's he's never downplayed What happened on that day? He's never pretended that it wasn't wrong play 10 No, I think the message is i've never downplayed january 6 What we've done what i've done and what republic has have done is we've been consistent We said what happened last summer in these in so many of our urban areas to police officers to small business owners and to our fellow citizens Was as wrong as wrong could be and we said what happened on january 6 was as wrong as wrong could be We've been consistent the people who haven't are the democrats And that's why they continue to focus on this because they can't talk about the fact that they defund the police and all the things They said when they raise money to bail out rioters and looters from jail They can't talk about those things so they're going to focus on this and attacking the former president That's exactly what this is about. I mean it's really a preemptive impeachment third impeachment of donald trump just in case he decides to run again This is the ongoing Everlasting impeachment process of the of the so-called insurrection So that's what you're seeing play out In real time here this and let's just all be very clear about the fact that they're not even going to look into this as a Security matter any meaningful way Why weren't there more capital police deployed? Why didn't reinforcements come sooner? Why did it seem like at different times? Protesters were let past barricades by a capital police I mean there's a lot of stuff who shot ashley babbitt. What was the justification for it? There's a lot of stuff out there that you'd say huh Are we going to get any of those answers and I can tell you right now unfortunately we're not this is just about putting a bunch of Biden voting Members of the capital hill police on the stand To cry and to convince the american people that anybody who voted for trump was part of this terrorist insurrection And they're awful and therefore we are all Tainted by that sin we're all tainted by it. That's the point And now we want to check in with our friend producer mark producer mark. How you doing? Good. How are you book? I'm all right, man. What's going on? Prusa mark world.
