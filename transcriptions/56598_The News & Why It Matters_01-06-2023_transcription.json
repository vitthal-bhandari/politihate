    "text": " Bad government and bad policy can literally be deadly. Almost 100 people died in Hawaii's Lahaina fires. The most wildfire fatalities the country has seen in the century. But months on from the event, it seems like the media and local and federal governments would rather we all forget what happened. I'm Lauren Chen, and to uncover the truth about that day in the aftermath, including through exclusively obtained 911 calls, the Blaze and I travel to Maui for this first-ever Blaze original documentary. And this is just the start of Blaze Originals. A new docu series featuring your favorite Blaze TV hosts as we investigate the most important regions of our national theater covering groundbreaking issues and standing in the void left by the elimination of investigative journalism. Watch what really happened in Maui, a Blaze original streaming now on BlazeTV.com, and use the code Lauren plus to save $36 off your annual subscription. Today, the debt ceiling bill has passed through the house. Mike Pence throws his hat into the ring for presidency. And the Pentagon has canceled their planned drag show for Pride Month. We've got all of that and we're coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez and last night the house passed their swampy debt limit deal with a vote of 314 to 117. 71 Republicans took a stand and voted against the bill and 41 Democrats opposed it as well, presumably because it didn't allow them to spend enough of other people's money. Now the bill is now expected to be rushed through the Senate to be passed just days before the June 5 deadline given by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill would decrease federal debt by $1.5 trillion over a 10 year period, which I don't know at this rate would kind of just be a drop in the bucket considering the national debt is fast approaching $32 trillion. Despite the fact that Americans voted to give the power back to the Republicans in the House to wield that power in a time such as this, to stand strong against the Biden regime rather than capitulate in the name of compromise, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy took a victory lap last night telling reporters, I think we did a pretty dang good job for the American people. I mentioned there were 71 Republicans who refused to go along with the deal. One of them happens to be joining me now in studio. Congressman Chip Roy, I can't believe you're like, I was just reading your tweet last night when you were on the floor and you wrote a big no and now here you are in Texas. Yeah, that was my voting card. That was my no voting card and took it down and dropped it down with the well and yeah, good to be with you here in person in Texas and the Republic of Texas. I got up and flew from the swamp to here this morning and already feel better. I was going to say does the air just feel different? Yeah, I already feel a lot more positive. I used to make fun of my old boss, Senator Cruz. He'd always say, oh, it's so great to be back in Texas. I thought it was just a line as a can. It's totally true. You get off the plane. You're like, oh my gosh, thank, thank the Lord. So obviously you were vehemently opposed to this bill. Sure. I wanted to see more Republicans stand in opposition to this, especially some of the ones that you would expect to be in solidarity with you most of the time. One of them being Marjorie Taylor Greene who tweeted out this is a big long thread fact check on this debt limit deal. She said it eliminates 2023 funding for the Biden regime to hire new IRS agents to target Americans. That particular one was fact checked by Twitter. They added the little, there it is. Readers added context. They thought people might want to know it actually does most new funding for the IRS does remain. So I think that one may have been a little off, but she went on to say the GOP will target and eliminate the remaining funding for Biden's IRS Thugs and the Appropriations Committee. The debt limit deal gives the GOP ability to punish Comey, Fauci, struck Brennan by defending their retirement, punish everyone involved in the Durham report, cut funding to the job crushing Green New Deal and open up the energy industry in America, Defund Sanctuary Cities. She goes on. What is your take on all of that? Well, she said some sort of tweet earlier about me living in fantasy land and frankly all those tweets with all due respect, she's a friend. That's all fantasy land. It is true that we have the power to do some of the things that she mentions. We can defund a lot of those things in the appropriations process if we choose to do it. That was always true. Whenever we actually go through the process this fall, we can choose to do those things. I'll believe it when I see it because what we saw unfold this last week, all the great work for five months where we were unifying the conference, where we got in behind the speaker, where we then were able to pass the Limit Save Grow Act, which did raise the debt ceiling in a trillion and a half, but we got monster improvements for it. We were able to pass HR2, a true border security bill, the best that we've ever passed. Why? Because we were all sitting around the table. And with all due respect, the speaker broke from that. The speaker cut a deal with Joe Biden and Democrats. And unfortunately, a few of my Republican colleagues who have bought into the swamp deal making rhetoric, they're, oh, it's the best deal we can do. Don't you understand this is the best we could get chip. We have a Democratic Senate and we have a Democrat in the White House. No crap. You know how you actually go win this? You stand strong and you hold the line. You could have said we're only going to pass. You know what, Mr. President? You're going to get the COVID rescissions. You're going to get the IRS money and you're going to tell Janet Yellen, there's your money. You're going to get through June, July and August and we'll keep debating and negotiating. But no, we're not going to raise the debt for trillion dollars. A blank check actually uncapped through January 1st, 2025, which even the leadership team, the speaker's office acknowledges would be about $4 trillion, about 12 and a half percent of our total current debt. Think about that. That's what they're going to do. And for that, what do we get? Effectively, a freeze in spending for two years. They all go, oh, it's the most cuts in the history of mankind. No, it's not. First of all, mandatory spending is still just going off the charts. Social Security, Medicare, et cetera. We're only talking about discretionary. The discretionary spending, it's still going to go up. It's just going to go up at a lower rate. And all we're going to do it is freeze it for two years. All of those other things. What do we do? We leave in place, the president's green new deal. They're bragging about it. We don't actually get rid of all the IRS agents. And that business said, oh, we're getting rid of the 1.4 this year. The truth is they can still continue to expand the IRS. It doesn't actually pump the brakes. I hate that we're in this position. We shouldn't have been. The speaker was wrong to cut the deal. I'll wake up and on Monday, I'll go sit down in his office and say, what are we going to do now? But I can promise you, there's going to still be accountability. And we're going to have to figure out how we're going to come back together as Republicans. Because if he's going to do deals with Democrats, we're going to call it out. Yeah. I mean, you had one of Joe Biden's economic advisors going on television before the vote, going on television saying this preserves all of these key progressive accomplishments that we've done. And it's going to help us do more of them. Maybe that should have been a clue that they this should not be something that conservatives should be voting for. But there was another Democrat, Brad Sherman, said last night after the vote, now we are allowed to say it, we rolled them. That is incredibly embarrassing. It's frustrating. I am proud that I think 18 of the members of the Texas delegation, I believe opposed this in the end. We had a very strong support with 71 no votes. Some of us held the line. Others bought into the normal kind of swamp hype. And this is the actual problem. This is what I think is most important for your listeners to understand. The Uniparty, the cartel in Washington, they have to constantly have their back broken. This is why we're $32 trillion in debt. This is why we're losing our freedoms. At the end of the day, how much complaining have I been getting today? Hardly any. You know who I've been complaining from? A handful of fat cat donor types who are like, oh my god, we might have had to fault ship. Stop being mean. You know who I'm getting praise from? Just scores, hundreds, thousands of Americans who are fed up, who can't actually pay their bills, who are dealing with inflation, who are dealing with a wealth gap, the middle class getting squeezed out. While we have programs giving money to a whole lot of people at the lower end of the spectrum and a whole bunch of deal making for the people at the upper end of the spectrum. People are sick of it. We got to stand up for a simple limited government and actually stand up for capitalism, not the crony capitalism that this whole deal is unfortunately too emblematic of. So do you think because I think if you go back, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, it felt like the Republicans were the party of cutting spending, actually caring about the debt, actually caring about things like the deficit. And now it just feels like Democrat and Democrat light. And I can't for the life of me understand why or how Republicans just decided to abandon that position. It's a mix of things. For a while, there's a lot who are just kind of obfuscating it. They didn't actually fully believe it. And they were just saying they did. Actually, I think we're building a new kind of coalition where there's an increasing number of people who truly believe it. And I'll say this about the speaker. I think the speaker truly wanted to get the best deal he could get to lower spending. I believe that Garrett Gray's Patrick McHenry. But where I think they miss it is they're accepting something that isn't nearly good enough. They took the first off ramp rather than the fifth or sixth. And it's not like you're taking the first off ramp to buckies, you're taking it to that old beat up crappy gas station. That's what they just did. And the problem is we're now the ones left holding the bag. And I say by we, I'm talking about the hard working Americans, my wife who's spent her whole life 20 years now since school paying off loans. And now what are we doing? We're rewarding people by giving them literally half a trillion dollars in student loan bailouts. What's the answer to my wife? What's the answer to the plumber right now who never took out a loan? Republicans just embraced that. Republicans just embraced the subsidies that are going to the massive corporations. 90% of the green subsidies are going to billion dollar corporations. We didn't do a thing about it. We walked away from that fight. Democrats get how to play ball, transform the country. They don't give a crap about these peanuts. Oh, you cutting on defense discretionary? We'll whine about it. That's the bureaucracy. But they know they'll get it back. You know how they'll get it back? And my friend Marjorie and everybody else just swept this aside. $27 billion of COVID recisions, $6 billion more actual recisions. The other money was all swept over to the Department of Commerce to sit there in a little play account where they can dole it out to go buy votes. Finally, yesterday, when we were opposing the rule on the floor. And we said, you know, we're not doing this. There was a promise that we would keep to 2022 levels of spending. It's been broken. So what do we do? We voted against the rule and they didn't have the votes. They were down. They were losing. They hit a gavel, which was the kind of signal. And there was a rush about 40 Democrats at the floor and they switched their votes. And they were all bought off with earmarks. That's the way the swamp works. That's disgusting. God bless you for having to even deal with that. I don't know how you do it. I want to, speaking of the swamp and how the swamp works, I want to ask you while you're here about this ongoing FBI, well, we're trying to investigate. The house is trying to investigate into whether or not the FBI was kind of setting aside evidence regarding Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, the Biden crime scheme, Biden family crime scheme, I guess you would call it. And just recently, I guess it was yesterday, Representative Comer said that the FBI is not going to cooperate with the subpoena. Like they formally told him, we are not cooperating with your subpoena. We are not going to turn over these documents, even though they are unclassified. Are we going to find, are we going to have accountability here? So the simplest way to answer this question is not going to be through hearings. Jamie's a great guy. Love Jamie oversight. They'll do their best. They'll call people in. Jim Jordan, Judiciary, the Weaponization Committee, call them all in. They'll show up. They won't show up. You know what it'll matter? On October 1st, have you written a check to the Federal Bureau of Investigation without holding them accountable? If you have, stop your dang crying. Because we're supposed to use the power of the purse. October 1st, October 2nd, November 1st, have you funded the FBI and given them the money without demanding that they come and answer to the Article 1 representatives in Congress? If you don't force that, then stop complaining. And then if they don't force that, that teaches the FBI immediately. Do whatever you want. Do whatever the hell we want who's going to stop us. Including a basically three and a half billion dollars new headquarters, like shiny new headquarters outside of DC. Why are we funding a new headquarters for the FBI? Oh good. Well, we have to, you know, give them a good pat on the head for all the tremendous work that they've done weaponizing themselves against half of the American population. Correct. Now, if I'm going to be generous in the debt deal, because you know, you should always be fair and honest, there were reductions to non-defense spending that were in this deal. Okay. They negotiated $40 billion of reductions, which will get backfilled. But the problem is you got to actually enforce them in the appropriations process. So this is where it'll matter. Will we enforce the reductions against the things that matter, the weaponized state against the American people, the FBI, the ATF? The FBI is not just doing what they're doing about Biden. They're also saying that Scott Smith, the domestic terrorist for defending his daughter in Loudon County, right? Mark Hout, the father in Philadelphia for daring to defend his son and exercising free speech outside of an abortion clinic. We've got to stop that weaponization. I think there's a lot of Republicans who want to do that. And I will say about the debt ceiling deal, we can use that to leverage to go do those things to Marjorie's point, to be fair. But we have to do it in the appropriations process, which, by the way, was always true. What we did with the debt ceiling deal was give up our maximum leverage against Joe Biden until January 1st, 2025 inexplicably in exchange for two years of freeze caps for $4 trillion. Yeah. Well, we, again, we so appreciate what you do. And I know our viewers are all really big fans of yours. We appreciate you fighting for us because I think they're just, they're so often used to people going to Congress and forgetting that their job is to represent us, not the other way around. So I appreciate it. That's what I do. I got into this business because I got through cancer and I had a then three month old daughter and a two-year-old son. And I said, I want to try to save this country for him. So that's what I'm doing. Well, we appreciate you. Thanks, sir. Come back soon. I will. All right. Good. Okay. We got to take a quick break. But before we do, I want to thank our sponsor, Birch Gold. So look, things are not going well. Congressmen sitting over here laughing because it's like, we just talked about the country is going down and down. And if you have like an IRA or 401k, don't check it right now. It's just you're just going to watch your money. Just continue to dwindle away. Might I suggest that you look into diversifying with gold and silver? You can do that with Birch Gold. They make it very, very easy. You can actually transfer your existing IRA or 401k into an IRA in gold. Historically, that has been a really solid hedge against inflation, which as Congressman Roy just mentioned is a little bad right now. So just going to suggest that you text the word why to 9898. They're going to send you a free information kit on gold. There's no obligation, just information. So just read about it. Okay. Do yourself a favor. Do your due diligence. Read about it. See if it's something that you want to do. You can text the word why to 9898. 9898. We are so close to the hundred thousand subscribers on YouTube. So those of you who are watching, we'd appreciate it if you would just hit that like button. Make sure that you are subscribed to the show and comment. Let us know what you think about the news of the day. I want to welcome to the program. Supergear host of Stu Does America and Pat Gray, host of Pat Gray Unleashed, both of which you can find on Blaze TV or wherever you get your podcasts. Like YouTube, which we are not as close as you are to 100,000, but we'd like to be. We would like to get you there. So make sure that you do all of those things that I just told you to do, do it to his YouTube as well. And Pat Gray, and Pat's. Thank you. It's just a small task that we would ask of you. If you don't do it, please don't ever watch the show again. Okay. So I just had Congressman Chip Royan. He was a little fired up about the debt ceiling bill, which is now I hear as of the time of this taping, it's planning on being rushed through the Senate. Because and it's interesting because I was talking to Congressman Roy Offair. And I said, I mean, this I've heard Mike Lee saying like, hey, there's a way that we could stop this. But they're not going to, right? Because the house just gave them cover. Yeah. I mean, Mike, they can delay it a little bit. But really, I don't think there's much of a chance of him stopping him. We had Mike Lee on radio today and he was fired up. Yeah, Mike Lee, which he said the thing is really fired up was section 261. And how that thing gets basically overturned in section 263. And the passion he told that story was really amazing. But it's such a good point. I mean, like, there's just nothing in this bill. It's you know, Chip is fantastic. And when he's, thank God he's around. And Mike Lee as well. Thank God we have those two. That seems like the only two. A lot of tell a lot of things. Maybe Rand Paul. Yeah, Rand Paul. I mean, there's there is more. It feels like the only two. There's a few though. And it's just a limited number. You know, I mean, if they came to us with this idea that, look, we're going to get nothing out of this and they're going to do it clean, which is what Joe Biden wanted. And then they said, where we were we want of landing is we got to, for example, there's $80 billion they're spending on the IRS. We got $2 billion of it back. Now, that's legitimately what the bill is. If they get us and said, look, we basically were going to get nothing. We got a little tiny bit. And that's all we can get. Maybe like it would be something to swallow. But instead, they said they're going to get all these amazing things. They're going to do all these incredible things and actually adjust our fiscal path to a more sane direction. That didn't happen at all. I mean, there's, I mean, and I think, you know, both Mike and Chip have both argued this is worse. It's actually worse than nothing. Which is incredible. I mean, it feels like anytime politicians touch stuff, that is the answer. It's worse than nothing. I wish they would all go on vacation all the time and just stay there because it seems like every time they touch anything, it does not turn to gold. It turns to something else, which is a brown and soft and smelly. How did Thomas Massey get taken in by this? I want to know too. I know he was on with you guys, right? We talked to him about it at length. You know, and he's super, I mean, he's, you know, Thomas is not a guy who folds to GOP pressure. He's not that guy. You know, he is probably the best person in the entire government on the Second Amendment, for example. I mean, he's a guy. Here's a guy who is after mass shootings, introducing bills saying that we should lower the age of gun buying, right? Like that's the type of guy he is. So I don't know what he thinks. What he just explained to us is he was very excited about this idea that if they didn't pass some appropriations bills or whatever, not to get in all the weeds of it, but there would be an automatic 1% cut in January, which everybody that I've talked to outside of Thomas says they're just going to, they have an easy way around this because of the timing of it and they're going to pass some giant bill that's going to force them to avoid that 1% cut and it's going to go nowhere. Now, look, maybe Thomas will be right. Maybe we'll all be like, wow, Thomas was brilliant in six months and we'll be singing his praises. I'll still like Thomas. I still think he's a really good congressman, but I just don't think he's right on this one. Yeah. No, and that's really what Mike Lee said. He said he loves him, but he's just dead wrong on this, just completely wrong. And that's unusual and it's amazing. What would be amazing for the United States of America is to have an actual budget? Maybe someday. Yeah. Yeah, maybe someday. You know, they'll have the balls to pass a budget and then stick to it. What would that be like? We don't know because it hasn't happened for, I don't know, 14 years or something. It's ludicrous. You mean something that they expect all of us at this table to do in our own personal lives, but they don't want to do it. But they can't or won't for whatever reason. It's ludicrous that the greatest nation in the history of the planet can't even pass a budget and has it for decades, decade and a half almost. It is. And you know, the debt ceiling, they make it seem like this is really difficult thing to deal with. There's a bunch of different kinds of debt ceilings, right? We all live under one at our house, which is our debt ceiling is we spend less than we take in, right? That's what we have to do. That's our own personal debt ceiling. Maybe, you know, sometimes specific times we have a couple credit cards, we put some money on those credit cards, and we have a debt limit that's just set. We can go near it, but we can't go past it because we have credit limits. What they want is just the right to have a new credit card every month sent to them that has a new balance so they can just fill it up until they hit that one, then another one gets sent to them. That's not a debt limit, right? At the very least, we could use this debt limit to come together and say, hey, we set this at $31.4 trillion a while ago. It seemed really far away, and we hit it really quickly. Let's adjust what we're doing here so that we don't hit the next one very quickly. Let's at least take this moment as a moment of reflection to do something different to change our path. That's outrageous for them to be considered. They won't do it. What the difference one is just nothing. I don't think they understand what ceiling means. This is like, yeah, we're going to pile everything in our house, and then when it gets to the ceiling, we'll just raise the roof. Yeah, keep doing that year after year. It's embarrassing. Speaking of embarrassing, I want to get your thoughts on Mike Pence deciding that he is going to throw his hat into the ring. He is set to announce a presidential bid next week. There are some reports that are saying that he's going to have an event in Iowa on June 7th, and that will be the day that he will make the announcement release a video. I want to go through here. Actually, my producer gave me these notes. I didn't know that there were this many people. I didn't realize that Asa Hutchinson had entered the race. It's now Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramashwami, Nikki Haley, Asa Hutchinson, Tim Scott, Larry Elder. I also didn't know about and now Mike Pence. That doesn't even include John Bolton, who said he was going to do it in Britain and then hasn't done anything since. I don't know if he's in or not. The Pence thing is interesting. Look, I don't think Mike Pence is going to win this nomination. Really? It's going to be close though. It's going to be really close. We could all make the case against him. Let me make the case for him a little bit here. Just because I honestly, I'm not anybody's, other than I have two kids, I'm their mom and their dad. You get to vote whoever you want to vote for. I don't care really. You do what you want to do. But the case for Pence, I guess, would be, first of all, he is third in almost every poll. That is something, if your argument here, if you're Mike Pence to get into the race, I guess is what I'm trying to say is why would he do such a thing? We have Chris Christie coming in too. Why did he do such a thing? Pence's argument is stronger than pretty much everybody else in this field. He's third in the polls, which again means seven and eight percent way back behind DeSantis and Trump. But it's something. It's not Chris Christie at zero. I guess there is a contingency out there that says, hey, I really like the Donald Trump policies, but I don't really like Donald Trump. That is certainly a section of the Republican electorate. You'd think, Mike Pence, would have an argument to those voters. He was in the office. He did all the same things. He agreed with Trump on pretty much everything, except he wasn't tweeting all the time and doing all the things that people don't like about Trump. I do think that the overwhelming majority of those people have already settled on Ron DeSantis right now. But we have to also say that Ron DeSantis has never been in this situation before. I think he's performing relatively well so far, but we don't know how he's going to hold up in these debates in this campaign as we go forward. My guess is he's going to do pretty well, but if he were to collapse, if he were to have a terrible moment, Marco Rubio looked good at 1.2 in 2016. If he falls down there, someone's going to take the mantle of the non-Trump candidate. And Pence probably thinks he can be that guy. He certainly has a lot of insight into the presidency. He can make a lot of behind the scenes arguments. None of this is going to win him the nomination to be clear, but I can understand why he might think, hey, why not jump in? Honestly, maybe the best argument for him is what else is he going to do? That's a great point. That's a great point. Pat. I had a listener tell me on my show this morning that he'd rather hit himself in the face with a stick repeatedly than vote for Mike Pence. And I think that's how a lot of us feel right now. Why is that? I don't know. Why? Trump destroyed him. Trump destroyed Christie. And anybody who ran before in 2020 or 2016, whatever they've run against Donald Trump has been destroyed. And even I kind of feel that way about Ted Cruz. And I mean, as far as presidential material, I don't know that he is anymore. Well, I don't think that, I mean, I guess you could say he agreed with Donald Trump's policies, but I think there's a big difference in agreeing and actually being the one with the courage and bravery to like be the guy. I just don't feel like I feel like Pence falls short of that. He's just viewed as like too soft. We'll just bush over. Crazy. I mean, I mean, really, what he did for four years was be submissive, right? Just whatever Trump said. We all know it. Exactly. Yeah. Disagreed with some of the things that Trump did. Exactly. He was almost entirely silent, which is amazing that Trump did destroy him. We should at least point out the craziness of the situation. Mike Pence basically made himself into a submissive child for four years and agreed with literally everything Donald Trump did for four years until January 5th, 2020. Yep. And because he didn't do something on January 20th, 2020, I guess, January 6th, 2020, for January 20th, 2020. Because he didn't go along with this thing, that Trump was not right on. He could not overturn the election. It would make no sense to create a system in which the sitting vice president could overturn the election. That is just not something that would make any sense. That would be fun. That would be awesome. That would be awesome. But like, you know, because of that, they obviously had the falling out. And now all the people who seemingly liked Pence for four years, what hit themselves in the face with a stick instead of four. I mean, I can understand why this would be frustrating to Pence. None of this changes the fact that he's not going to win the nomination. But it is weird. It is weird. I mean, this is not Cruz who got in fights with with Trump. This is not Chris Christie, who was going to be in the administration and endorsed him early and then bailed on him and went on MSNBC and made fun of Trump every day. I mean, this is not even Nikki Haley, who seemed to have, you know, he invited and welcomed in Tim Scott to the race. It's not those people. I mean, Pence was really there the whole time until that one day and that one day was enough, apparently. It's kind of strange. I really liked Mike Pence in 2007. Yeah, it's not 2007 anymore. But I liked him. Yeah, he was really good. Yeah, one time Congressman. Yeah, as a congressman, decent governor. And people talked about him. You know what? Hey, Mike Pence might make a really good president someday. Those days are gone. Yes. There's no appetite for him. And then there's no appetite for Chris Christie. Chris Christie has a big appetite. Yes, there's no appetite for him. So we're going to take a quick break. We will be back with more of one of the sponsor, Jason Medical.

Uncomfortable moment today when Joe Biden fell on stage at the US Air Force Academy graduation ceremony in Colorado Springs. I want to we have the video of that. Let's go ahead and play it. All right, so he's shaking a graduate's hand and down he goes. Wow. That is hard to get enough to. Yeah, they have to help him up. And by the way, I'm not laughing that he fell. I am as Pat pointed out during the break, why are the people cheering? Yeah, they're cheering. Yeah, yeah. Louder when he went down and I'm having a heart and understanding that is a bad fall. Yeah, he went down hard. Especially when you're in your 80s, that's a bad fall. Did he trip over something? It doesn't look like he's told a bad podium. He must have forgotten that there was a step down. Was it because he points back at something like, oh, I didn't see that. Who was on that podium? Oh, right there. Now I'm down here. He didn't. He doesn't back. Which again, I mean, you hate to see someone so frail, just kind of, you know, you see this happening right before your very eyes were watching him just kind of devolve into this. But it's also like, we tried to warn you guys before he was elected that he campaigned from his basement because he was not doing well. And this is the result of that is that you have to watch this uncomfortable transformation of this man who used to be, you know, as much as his doctor wants to call him currently vigorous. There's not a lot of vigor than I'm seeing there. It's really, really bad. You know, it's, it reminds me of another president president Miles, my dog, who was just passed away at 18 years old. But in his last days, he was doing something like that. Like he would try to get up and he would just kind of go back to the ground. And that's the scariest part of that. Anyone can trip, right? It does happen a lot to this guy. And that's weird. It's because he can't lift his feet up off the ground. He's shuffling around everywhere. But you can trip. Anyone can trip. That's that could happen to anyone. But you see him try to get up and his body just gives out. He just goes back to the ground. That is that's scary. That's I mean, look, we all know this guy is not in good shape and in real physical trouble to watch this happen in front of our eyes is scary. And you know, you think of selfishly what it makes us look like when we're in the middle of trying to, to, to do all sorts of things internationally that he is encouraging. I mean, I don't know what, I mean, what does China think when they see that? It's just, it's got to be laughable to them. And think about the way he describes himself and how he talks about himself and how he's not old in his mind. He's fine. He's fine. And his doctor tells us that he's super vigorous and the guy's in incredible shape for 80 years old. No, he's not. No, he's not. And that's proven almost every day. And you know, you think back to the time he fell up the stairs, the multiple times, multiple times, three times he fell up the stairs, fell off his bike, his bike, his bike, he fell off this podium. Every time he's done with a speech or an appearance, he turns around, he doesn't know what to do. And you know, he's been schooled time after time after Mr. President, as soon as you're done with your speech, turn to the left, exit stage left. And he can't do it. No. He just can't do it. And I'm sure they described how to get off that little podium, that little stage, and he couldn't do it. And so he fell. I don't, almost every one of his appearances, he's got a note card in front of him with exactly what he has to do. It says you, you're here. It notes that he is present at his own event, and then tells him what to say, where to go, what question is coming, how to step off the podium. I guess he didn't read that part of it. I mean, it's, it's pathetic, pathetic. Well, and despite all of that, how many Democrats will vote for him in the presidential election? Almost all of them. He's the nominee they'll all vote for. Especially if, I mean, look, especially if they hate Trump as much as they say they do, they don't care. They don't care if Donald Trump would be a better president. They hate him. Right. Right. So that's a real problem. I mean, I honestly, at this point, between him and Federman, and Feinstein and Pelosi, I mean, this is like leadership that, that belongs in some sort of nursing home. Yep. Yep. Yep. And they keep trotting them all out there, even though they, they don't know what's going on. You know, Dianne Feinstein doesn't know who Kamala Harris is anymore. Federman's just blathering through. Wait, she doesn't? We didn't see this. She, she, she, she, well, I should clarify, she came in, she of course cast the determinate vote in the Senate. And this happens all the time. And this happens all the time. Close. And she came in and, and Dianne Feinstein reportedly said, why is she here? Not realizing that the vice president of the United States comes in to do this anymore. I mean, she is gone, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone. It's disgusting what they're doing to this one. Yeah. I mean, legitimately revolting. Yes. And all for Power of Politics. Federman too. Really? Federman too. Yes. And, you know, Biden is just the most public example of it. He's a little bit different in that, like, I don't know that he's, I don't know that he's, I don't know what is going on with him. He doesn't seem to be able physically or mentally with it. And it's, it's a terrible sign. I mean, if you want to paint the narrative of America in decline, it is very easy to paint when you watch the sky on stage. Mm hmm. Yeah. It really is very uncomfortable to watch. All right. Let's go ahead and we're going to take a quick break. And then when we come back, I do have some disappointing news to share with you guys about the planned drag show that was going to be happening at the Pentagon. I'm really, really sorry about that. I know, I know, I know, but we'll get to it. We'll get to it after the break. We'll be right back. All right. Put the Kleenex away, guys. I know you had your nice cry when we were transitioning segments here, but I'm very sorry. The Pentagon has canceled their third annual drag show on Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas. Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. The Pentagon. Yes. I'm sorry. The spokeswoman confirmed that the event was canceled, explaining that, quote, hosting these types of events in federally funded facilities is not a suitable use of DoD resources. You think, really, but it took them, I would like to point out the third annual to be able to understand that that was actually not a suitable use of DoD resources. By the way, there was no minimum age requirement. So that would have been in all ages drag show, as you can see from this particular post from the Nellis AFB Spouses Facebook group. They said, no minimum age requirement, but you must be 21 and up to purchase alcoholic beverages. However, the sexualization of the children is for free on us. Yes. But it really does. I was actually shocked to see that they did cancel it. It makes you wonder if there is something else going on that they just happened to use that as an excuse, because why now at the third annual, you're going to be like, oh, maybe we shouldn't be hosting all ages drag shows with DoD resources. You just now came to this revelation. I just don't buy it. I don't know what it is. You're right. It doesn't make any sense, especially on Friday, it's the first day of the Pride month. Everyone has put up their Christmas tree or the Pride tree and hung the holly all over the house to celebrate. You think the military is getting more and more woke. I don't know. Maybe just the people there are just like, we don't want this. That could be what the answer is. They just decided to take a stand. Look, if you're, what did you say was in near Vegas, right? If you want to go see drag shows, my guess is there's plenty there. You got to see. And you know what? No, it's going to be protesting them. They're going, go, I want to watch it. I don't know why you want to watch it. I don't get it. I don't want, like, I think I like women, but I don't want to see them dressed as men. I don't see any real reason for that. I don't know why. I don't know what the attraction to these things is, but I don't like soccer either. So, you know, who knows? It could be just something I don't understand. I will say that like one thing that I do understand is that military funds should go to building missiles and training troops and sexualizing children and global warming fighting and all the other important things our military does should not go to drag queen story hours or dances. Yeah. Really? And I will say, even if it was for adults, it's completely ridiculous to be doing it. You know, it's just not, there's no reason to do this. They live near Vegas. Let them go, if they want to go watch drag shows and they're off time, they can go do that. There's no reason to bring that into the military. But it's amazing how much people are bending over backwards to do these kinds of events. I mean, you know, you got the Dodgers who are doing that weird thing, the anti-Christian, anti-Catholic drag presentation. I mean, how would you, why would you spit in the face of the vast majority of your fans, many of your players, and you just don't care? You're catering to what a maximum of three or four percent of the population and you're spitting in the face of the other 97 percent. This nation is still what? 75, 80 percent Christian. How many people like to be mocked like that, mocked and ridiculed and belittled and like to see blasphemy and sacrilege? I don't think that many really. But for some reason, they are hell-bent to do these drag shows. That's a good idea of phrasing it. Yeah, that will be it. Yeah. I mean, I feel like even a non-Christian person would find that type of thing uncomfortable. Yeah. Right. Like you, I mean, the video that we showed, it was hard for me to even play on this show, just to show how disgusting those drag nuns were, you know, getting up pole dancing or whatever on the cross while they, there's this guy supposed to be Jesus that's being crucified and the dude is like dancing all over. And I was like, this is disgusting. I can't imagine, even if you're a non-Christian, I can't imagine watching that and being like, I'm cool with this. And it has to, it has to feel gross even if you are not religious. Oh, totally. I mean, you know, there's a lot of stuff about Catholicism. I'm not Catholic. Right. They have different traditions than my churches do. Some of them are specific to Catholicism. And like, they were, you know, doing that to those as well. And like, I don't like that. If it was Jewish or Islam or whatever, like, I think everyone would be, they wouldn't do it to Islam. They wouldn't do it. They wouldn't do it to Islam. I don't think they do it to Judaism either. Honestly, I don't think they do it to, I don't think they do it to Scientology, frankly. I think it's just a Christianity target on this one. And you know, I think what's interesting about this particular, the way this is all broken, is over the, it's been the past like, what, two months to get Bud Light target. All this has really picked up momentum. We're heading into today's the first day of the Pride month. And we all remember what this was like last year, everything. There was rainbows everywhere and all that, but all that was planned months in advance. A lot of these companies haven't had chance, a chance to digest this and change directions. I talked to someone who works for a company who had planned on changing their profile picture, I guess on their social media accounts, to put the rainbow in as they always did. And today they decided instead to tweet a picture of some sort of Pride thing, say, Happy Pride month, and their intent is one time, June 1st, let's all forget about this, this is happening because they've seen the pushback and they've decided like, we've got to check this box, but let's change our approach here. I think that might be part of the result of this. Maybe some companies who are just like, I just want to sell stuff. We don't want to get in the middle of this. Maybe they'll at least minimize it and that'll at least improve it a little bit. But my standards are pretty low at this point. Guys, I saw earlier, well, I'll give credit, Chad Prather texted me a screenshot of an email that he had gotten. Quip toothbrush, they sent out an email that said Happy Pride month with a special rainbow toothbrush that you can buy. Really? A toothbrush? You guys have to have to gay up a toothbrush? Like, you can't just sell tooth brushes and stay out of it. You got to make the toothbrush gay? I don't understand. Like, you have one job, sell a toothbrush that people can use to keep their teeth clean. That's it. That's all. And you have to make it gay. Right. I mean, it just seems like most toothbrushes are straight. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It says sex. This should be straight. Maybe they're asexual. Maybe that's how they fit into the LGBTQIA community. Maybe that's it. Yeah, it would be nice. High gene is important for everyone, of course, sir. I mean, it's not like buy the toothbrush, but don't make the toothbrush gay. Gay people can buy the toothbrush. I just don't need it to be gay. All right, we got to take a break. We'll be back. It's too mention happy Pride Month. Here's a video for you that I'm going to just try to work this one out. Okay. A misconception that lesbian means a woman who loves other women. And actually, the definition is non men who are attracted to and love other non men. Throughout history, there have always been gender non-conforming lesbians. And it's interesting to see nowadays that there are some folks who kind of try to gate keep that identity and only include folks who identify as women. When that's not what being lesbian is all about, there are trans men who identify as a lesbian for many, many years and still feel comfortable with that community and that identity. There are non-binary folks of all kinds of lesbians. No, no, no, no. There's just, there's like a zillion different ways to get lesbian. And if that were not for you, then nobody can keep it from you. I am non-binary trans masculine and I'm a lesbian. Non-binary trans masculine. And lesbian. Words mean nothing. No, they don't. Absolutely nothing. Those are the lesbian. Like only women or non men. I like only non men. Don't let anyone gate keep that word. I won't. I won't let them gate keep it because that's really important to me. What other people think about the gates around words like focus on something important. I'm not thinking about your genitals all the time. I appreciate you coming out of the lesbian on my show. I think it's important to pride month.
