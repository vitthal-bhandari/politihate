    "text": " Welcome to useful idiots. I'm one of your host Katie Helper. And I'm Aramette. How are you Katie? It's hot. It's very hot. It's hot. It's cooking. But not as hot as it is over for our friends in Europe. Over the pond. Yeah. It's tough right now. It's really tough right now. People are just dying. That's the world we live in. And being in a proxy war with one of the world's top energy producers also isn't helping either because now. Right. Cut it in Europe after ration energy and limit cooling and limit gas consumption. So great timing for a proxy war always. It's great. Yeah. I mean, it's always a great time for proxy war, but it's even especially good right now. Yeah. So just wait till winter comes. It's going to be even better. Well, at least people won't die of heat. They'll just maybe die of hypothermia. God, this is such a dark world we're living in. It is. Well, we're here to lighten it up with this week's floor food groups. Yep, for basic food groups. So for this week's for basic food groups, we got I got Democrat suck. So this is this is an interesting curveball because you're going to be like, why is this a Democrat suck? This sounds like Republican sucks. So let me just start reading from democracy now voters went to the polls Tuesday for a primary election in Maryland. The Trump backed far right state legislator Dan Cox, one the Republican gubernatorial primary last year Cox helped organize buses to Washington on January 6 when he called Vice President Mike Pence a traitor for not supporting Trump's efforts to overturn the election. If elected Cox has vowed to conduct a forensic audit of the 2020 election. He also wants to ban abortion in Maryland and end what he describes as sexual indoctrination in schools. Now, why is this a Democrat suck because the Democratic governor's association spent over $1 million helping elevate Cox's message as part of an effort to help the primary campaigns of far right candidates that Democrats hope will be more vulnerable in November general election. This is called the I believe the pie Piper strategy. Because the idea is to get Republican followers to follow the pie Piper, which will then lead them to destruction. Right. Now you may have heard of this before this happened in a minor election, which didn't have that many that much of a, I guess, consequence when you think about it on a global scale if you really zoom up, take a real bird's eye view from another planet, which was of course Donald Trump And the Democrats also encouraged his rise during the primary because they thought he was such a joke and so repulsive and so odious that he would, of course, help the Democrats get into office now news flash that didn't work. It got Donald Trump elected. So, I think it's a great thing to go into it though that Bill Clinton even called Donald Trump reportedly and to encourage him personally to run because they were friends at that point. Right. They got the weddings together. Yeah. Exactly. With Jeffrey Epstein. And all and that whole crew. So yeah, Bill Clinton use his personal connection to encourage Trump to run and that got them Trump humiliating them in 2016. Yeah, great job. Try that again. Yeah. They definitely got the memo on from that experience. They're doing it also in Pennsylvania with my strano who's another right wing lunatic. So maybe he'll get into and we'll have a bunch of them fingers crossed right then. So what do we got for Republican suck. So for Republican suck we have one of Republicans top passions, which is banning abortion and also cutting back on Medicaid. So we're combining two passions of Republicans here. And this is a headline in the San Antonio current. It says Texas officials celebrated end of abortion rights after cutting back post part of Medicaid extension. The article says, while celebrating last month's Supreme Court decision overturning the right to abortion. Governor Greg Abbott pointed to the millions of dollars in spending that state lawmakers approved to help pregnant women and new mothers. He measures he touted was a law that extended Medicaid health care coverage for a pregnant woman until six months after they give birth or miscarry, exceeding the federal government requirement that states provide at least two months of the benefit. Abbott statement neglected to mention that Texas lags behind at least 2033 states, including 11 led by Republicans, all of which have already expanded or are working with the federal government to extend post part of Medicaid benefits. So that's the whole year after giving birth. So basically, Abbott is bragging about how he's going to be there to support pregnant mothers after forcing mothers to carry the fetus to term. All while cutting back the number of the months the benefits that they get to have that pregnancy. So most others are many other states get 12 months. Abbott is saying, let's just give them six months and then they can spend for themselves. And you didn't do justice to this great Republican pastime because you did say that they like blocking access to abortion. So they do like taking away women's right to choose. And then I think you said that they like cutting. What did you say they like cutting benefits in general? Yeah. Well, you know what they really like doing though on top of that is they like cutting benefits to babies as soon as they're born. That's right. It's a little grace period of six months. You know, I guess they want to give them six months but this is this is such a beautiful like you can't make this up. They really care they're very pro life when it's not a viable human being but once it's born. Not so much. Yeah, you're on your own. You got a fan for yourself. Yeah, exactly. And this article also points out that Texas is among a dozen states that have also declined to expand. Brighter Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Traditional people with low incomes, leaving it with some of the strictest eligibility requirements in the country. For example, single parents with one child must earn $196 or less a month to qualify. Yeah, for health care. If you make above that, sorry, you can't. If you make $200 a month, you're rolling and dough. You don't need any help. Yeah. Yeah. No health care for you. These people are such sadists. Yeah. Disgusting. I would love to do a brain scan on them to see what happens in their brain when they're doing this stuff. They probably derive some glee. This is what they live for. Yeah. Wow. Anyway, good candidate though for Republican stuff. Great candidate. I mean, the good news is that we had such a great candidate. So that we can look on the bright side. Thank you Republicans for making our job so easy. Yeah. Millions of listeners and thousands of five star reviews rave about the hit podcast series in the red clay.

Final DIY project, build your own coffin. For people who want to make their own final resting place, merchants offer ready to assemble kits. We just had so much fun. Visitors to Leona Oceana's home near Portland, Maine might notice that pine bookshelves perched in one corner of her living room. Garland did by white lights. The shelves hold neat rows of books by her favorite authors, including Mark Twain and Edward Gory along with knickknacks such as a snow globe with a skull inside. Guest tend to check out says Miss Oceana, 52 years old and administrator at a municipal public works department. Visitors may not immediately grasp the versatility of the bookcase. It might look like it came from Ikea, but it will eventually be a coffin. The shelves are designed to be removed easily. And one day, the two sections of this bookcase are to be joined with hinges to serve as Ms. Oceana's final resting place. To prepare for the inevitable, some people lay out instructions for their funerals or write their own obituaries. Then there are the other souls, including Ms. Oceana, who build their own coffins and use them as part of their household decor until needed. Death has always intrigued me. I don't think in a weird way, she says. Now she's not the only person, Erin, and viewers and listeners to do this. Various merchants offer coffin parts or ready to assemble kits to make the task easier. The first is a cardboard casket company of Beaver Dam, Wisconsin sells a bill-drawn casket kit starting at 699. Pretty affordable, honestly. Jonas A. Zahn, owner of Northwood's Casket says the company sells about five kits in a typical month. The company's website says it's assembly takes one to two hours and it features a blog post. Called. So you want to build a casket? And buyers can add their own flourishes and creative designs. I've seen a lot of camouflage, Mr. Zahn says. Those in the DIY coffin camp give a range of reasons for taking matters into their own hands. Preparing for death may increase the odds of checking out in a pleasant manner. Having a burial box standing by perhaps means less trouble for the surviving family members. And it might be easier on the budget than buying commercially made coffin. You can see these beautiful bookcases, which I guess somehow will turn into a casket. Do you see that little cute skeleton, by the way? Gorgeous. Gorgeous. Yeah. I'll say this. That's the happiest skeleton I've seen in the long time. The skull, not so much. The skull looks a little down. It's tough to be a happy skull. It's tough to be a happy skull. When you're separated from your body, you're not as happy when you're with your body. When the full skull full skeleton is present. It's a lot easier. Then we see someone else lying in a bookshelf, Joan Pillsbury climbed into her coffin to get a better angle for her drill. So what do you think of this, Aaron? It makes sense. If you want to cough him, my only question is though, should you want to cough him? Wouldn't the best thing for everybody, for your friends and family in terms of a hardship on them. And for the planet just to get cremated. I guess so. You could do a green burial. That's the thing, apparently. But cremated. Yeah, that's that's. Yeah, cremated. What is it? Who was I talking about this? What are your thoughts on what should be done with the ashes? I mean, obviously it's up to the person. But are you in favor of scattering them or putting them in some kind of urn? I think that's up to the individual. All right. I think those, you know, I think those those ceremonies where people go and they scatter the ashes, especially in a place that's significant to that person's life. Those are really beautiful things. You're returning them to the earth. I find those moments for touching. That's what I'm going to do. Right. We do. But yeah, you're going to have that done. Yeah, I just don't want to take up space as a cadaver. You know, but that's my own. Hey, everyone's got their own preference. No, we're not coughing. We're not coughing. Yeah, at least not too strongly. Yeah. So that's that. That's the isn't that weird. That's the well, that's a very, very good weird. All right. So for isn't that terrible. We have an incident from the world of fast food, which, you know, how many horror stories has the fast food industry provided us. Well, here's the latest one. Mom claims traumatized daughter found cigarette in Burger King fries. Traumatic. Well, if you think it's traumatic now, Katie, let's watch the video. Oh my gosh. Oh my goodness. As you say, it's from Burger King starts a little grace, but you can see there were chicken fries over. And after eating six. As you see, we found a cigarette, but. Oh my gosh. Right on it. It is a Seneca myth. That my daughter found half smoked in her bag. Wow. That is terrible indeed. I mean, it's understandable because I got to say that cigarette looked a lot like the chicken fry in terms of the color. It did look very similar. It's an easy mistake to make. It's an easy mistake to make. I mean, it's probably happened to the best of us. Yeah. And let's face it, you know, Burger King. They're not known for their fries. Ah, interesting. They're known for the Whoppers. Right. The Whoppers really their signature dish. I think people generally elevate Wendy's and McDonald's fries over Burger King's. And so maybe it's really the fault of the consumer here for ordering the fries and knowing that they're not getting a top product and things like this are going to handle it. And things like this are going to happen. Right. Yeah, it's true. Like, if you're not going to order the best of the best, be prepared to eat a cigarette. Exactly. I thought you were going to say that people who order from Burger King are eating unhealthily. And so what's the cigarette here or there? But you're actually saying it's not a question of the health. You're saying it's a question of the how top notch. The cuisine is. Yeah. I mean, if you're, you know, it's not health shaming. Yeah. Yeah. I just feel like in the, in the hierarchy of fast food fries that Burger King is not up there. Right. I mean, we're, I think we're getting a little bit into victim blaming territory, but, but you know what, you got to check the first step in preventing that is being aware of it. So I think we're also showing people what victim blaming looks like so that they know not to do it. Well, look, no matter how you feel about Burger King fries, let's all agree that a cigarette, but inside the fries is terrible. Hence. Yeah. That was this week's isn't that terrible. So what's, what's new, anything else on your mind, Aaron? Well, let me just shout out the squad for voting for a new measure to expand NATO, adding Sweden and Finland, which is great news for the military industrial complex, which is even given a shout out in this bill. Let me show the text. So this measure, which will expand NATO, open up a new NATO front really on Russia's borders via Finland. Also has this passage where, quote, it urges all members of NATO to meet the 2% defense spending pledge as agreed upon during the 2014 well summit. And what that is is at the summit, all NATO member states agreed pledged to ensure that they spend at least 2% of their GDP on the military industrial complex. And so this is the squad and every other progressive member of Congress. So, I'm just quoting to urge NATO members to meet that pledge, make sure you spend at least 2% of your GDP on the military industrial complex. And I can tell you one person who will be very happy with that pledge. Here he is. We expect a growing number of nations to meet the minimum 2% of GDP requirement to address today's challenges. All members of the Alliance must fulfill their obligations. They have no choice. They must fulfill their obligation. There you go. There is what at least one guy who will be very happy that Democrats are making sure that all NATO member states spend 2% of their GDP on the military. His name is Donald J Trump. That's, it sounds like almost like the way that you're saying it almost sounds like a telethon like we need to raise these funds we can't do without you. We urge you. Yes, we urge you. Yes, it's really important that everyone spends at least 2% of their GDP on the military and the complex. We can't be feeding people, giving them health care, building infrastructure. You've got to make sure at least 2% goes to the defense industry. And what do you get for that you got a beautiful NATO tote bag. Just so people that people understand why is this dangerous. What's happening right now. Well, look, we're more than four months into a war in Ukraine that is wreaking havoc, especially for Ukrainians. And it's also causing a crisis around the world food prices of skyrocketed nuclear tensions are escalating there's no nuclear talks right now between the US and Russia on renewing the treaties that limit the nuclear weapons stockpiles. We have an energy crisis Europe is facing the brunt of that. So is Africa and Asia. And we have domestic problems at home that are very, very dire. And instead, Democrats so far have been 100% behind Biden's policy. And by voting to expand NATO and to encourage spending on NATO aka the arms industry. Democrats are just fueling this fire and trying to speed up the race to extinction. Yeah, well it's going well. That's the good news. Is that's a there right on schedule. Alright, anything else you want to tell us about. about? Well, I do have an update on a story we discussed a few weeks ago where the Guardian newspaper came out with this article calling me the most prolific spreader of disinformation on Syria and failing to provide any examples of this alleged disinformation or evidence. And so since then, I contacted the reporter who wrote the story, his name was Mark Townsend of The Guardian, because I wanted to see if he had any evidence. I also wanted to see why before he printed that, why he didn't contact me first. So I actually reached him on the phone and I had the video, which I published on my podcast, Pushback. We have a clip of it here. So let's take a look. To hear Aaron's call with Mark Townsend, go to useful idiots.subsect.com. All right, well, we have a great interview for you guys today. We are making history. It is our first interview with a Tony award winning Pulitzer Prize winning artist named Michael Jackson. Michael R Jackson. Yes, Michael R Jackson is the Tony and Pulitzer winning playwright, composer, and lyricist of the hit Broadway musical A Strange Loop. And we're very excited to speak to him. Aaron, what are some of your favorite songs from A Strange Loop? As I said, I've been listening to a strange loop on loop. So I have a lot. The opening song, intermission song is amazing. It's like a total classic American Broadway number, but it's also incredibly subversive, the way Michael adds in all these different elements and refrains. The next song is called Today, which I love as well. The next song after that is called We Want to Know, which is Usher's family singing to him about what's going on with his life. And it's beautiful and it's funny too. And then the big hit from the show is In Her White Girl, which is really a great song. And the song I talked about called Periodically, which is Usher's mother confronting him about her bigotry. I mean, she's homophobic and she's telling him how upset she is about his gay lifestyle. But Michael gives her such a beautiful melody. So even as she's saying these hateful, bigoted words, it sounds so beautiful. And it's very emotional because at the end of it, Usher and the mother, they sing together and they sing her bigoted words. But he's doing a duet with her. So it's just really beautiful. And there's also a song called Memory Song. That's one of my favorites. It's so touching. And I mean, it's just, it's a genius show and I hope everyone knows the opportunity and goes see it. Yeah. It's just incredible. Welcome Michael, R. Jackson. So excited to be talking to you. Not talking to you guys. So I know you've been asked this so many times, but tell us about the evolution of a Strange Loop. Why you wrote it in the first place and how it got to be the award-winning musical that it is today? It started off as a monologue that I started writing right after I graduated from undergrad. I was about 23 years old and I was sort of scared about my future. I had just had a BFA in playwriting. I didn't know I was going to do with that. And so I started writing this monologue about a young black gay man sort of walking around New York wondering why life was so terrible. And it was called Why Can't Get Work. It was just like sort of a thinly veiled personal monologue that I just wrote kind of as a way of making sense of things. The world was sort of in a crazy place at that time. Like the US was about to go to war with Iraq. I was living in the middle of nowhere to make a Queen's. I had this BFA degree. It was just, I just needed something to make me feel like I had some control over something. And so I started writing this piece. And then I went to grad school about nine months later and I began writing music while I was there and then the music started to work its way into the monologue. The monologue started to take shape into a one-man show that I performed. Then I decided I didn't want it to be a one-man show that I kept working on. The book of it, the story. And then that is when it turned into what is now known as a strange loop. And then I kept working on that and doing different readings and workshops over the years and concerts of music from the show. And then eventually we got our off-Broadway production in 2019. And then we did really well with that. Then the pandemic came. And we were on pause. But then we won the Pulitzer in the midst of that. And then we did the show out of a pre-Broadway tryout in DC at the William & M. Theater Company. And then we got our Broadway theater in December 2021. And then we opened on Broadway in April 22. So that was about 18 years from start to Broadway. Of just sort of like working on it and working on it and working on it. And during this period, a lot of the cast members that are in the current production, they've been working with you on the show as a part of it throughout this period, right? Yeah. John Andrew Morrison, who was nominated for Tony for Best Detredrator this year, has been singing the song periodically from the show since 2008 when I did my first New York concert at Arz Nova and Jason Dizzy and El Morgan Lee and James Jackson had sort of all been involved for a long, long term, really, and for people who are just hearing about a strange loop for the first time, how would you describe it? The basic premise of the plot is it's about a theater usher named Usher who was writing a musical theater production about an usher named Usher. And he interacts throughout this process with thoughts, the thoughts in his head played by a amazing cast of people. In the process, though, he also interacts with his family or he... Yeah, who are also played by the actors who play the thoughts. So the thoughts sort of transform from character to character to character as he's sort of making his way through the writing of this musical that's about himself. And eventually, he has sort of a self-realization of the end about himself that's sort of profound. So one thing I want to ask you about is you... When he interacts with his family, there's all these different aspects of his interactions with his family. And part of that, I think, is he's also interacting with fictionalized versions of his family as well. Is that pretty? Right. Yeah, so there's like an early scenes where you're seeing his mom played by the whole ensemble. And then you'll see like a later scene where his mom is played by one of them, but in this sort of like sitcom sort of version of what his family would be like. And then later, you see his mom played by a different thought. And then that mom sort of takes us into the final family scene that's like a little bit more serious. Yeah, and in this, you portray the family. The family comes off as both really loving and supportive of ushuries. He's pursuing his theater dreams in New York, but also having very bigoted views of him as a gay man. Right. And what I... Just notice from the way the songs are written, for example, periodically, or Usher's mother sinks to him about her concerns about his gay lifestyle, is you still, even though she's saying all these bigoted things, you still portray her with a lot of compassion, I think, as a writer. Can you talk about that? Yeah, I mean, I think that that's part of the complexity of life that he and I wanted to sort of express, which is that someone can have very bigoted views, but they also can love you, and that those two things are not necessarily in conflict. I mean, what it can be in conflict, but like they're... They can't... They sometimes can't be pulled apart from one another. And so I just wanted to sort of offer the audience a sort of just a complex portrayal of a mother's love for her son. And you do it, I think, via the melody, because there's a part of periodically where she's singing to him about how concerned she is about his gay lifestyle, but yet the melody you've chosen for those words is so beautiful. It's during the very end. Yeah, it's like sort of a repeating melody that is sort of very melodic and very sort of almost like a lullaby. Yeah. And I just thought that that was like an important thing to lead the audience with is that like, I didn't want people to just get caught up on, oh, his like homophobic mother, how horrible she is, because I just think it's more complicated than that. And I wanted the music to sort of want to support the complexity of it. I was there when I saw it, when I went to it Playwrights Horizon, your parents were in the audience. Oh yeah, I forgot you were there that day. That's right. Yeah. What was that like? It was amazing because they had never seen any of my theater writing ever. And I was nervous about them coming because they're not like regular theater goer people at all. Like that's just not part of their life. And I was just worried if they just wouldn't like it or they wouldn't understand it or that it would do I mean that like that just as a piece of art, they would just be like, what is this? But they were like so into it. And they sort of that day that you came was amazing because they kind of like stood in the lobby and like this whole crowd like gathered around while my mom started sort of in my dad's room to start talking about me and like and it was just kind of it was like a really crucial point I think in our relationship because suddenly I like it was like I came out again but this time as an artist to them and it was and they were just they were so proud and they were so impressed. And I think it like really was an important moment for us. Did it lead to any conversations with them about your relationship? Not really because like that's the thing that's that's always like tricky for me to sort of explain to people about the show is that like it's why I don't call it autobiographical because I did draw off in personal experience but I also made a lot of things up. And so there are things that they like recognized about you know our relationship but they also could see that it was something else. And so there was nothing really to talk about other than like they would go oh is that that or is this that or whatever about it but like it they just they didn't they didn't really care about anything else other than like wow our child made this thing and it's like really amazing and they loved looking at everybody being so engaged around them and they were into it and they thought they were funny or whatever you know and so it just was like there wasn't like a there wasn't like a deep family conversation that was needed to that needed to happen between us. It just they just were proud of me and of it. That's funny my mom she's a novelist and one of her I think her first published novel was a fictionalized memoir called The War at Home. And when she wrote it her mom was still alive my grandmother was still alive. And in the novel which is very autobiographical you know it's about her kind of crazy abusive family and her mom did a lot of speed and was charming but also a very bad mom in many ways. And my grandmother was at the book party she was just like please just punch. Like I think partly it was because she could because it was fictionalized memoirs as opposed to you know totally true memoir she had that there was that distance that let her be proud of her daughter but also feel like a star. Yeah I mean and there was and I just again just because I did fictionalize quite a lot and I'm like and everything in the musical is from Usher's point of view who's like a young person who has sort of a distorted sense of self and so like and also just of his family. So like there's a there's also an aspect by which it's not even really about them like that because that all ultimately sort of fades away especially toward the end when sort of the gospel play that he creates sort of disintegrates. And so for me it's not it ultimately does end up just being about him and not about anybody else you know. Were you embarrassed like because there's a lot of sexual stuff in it. I'm not saying you should be embarrassed. I know I would be embarrassed to talk if my parents saw me forget that it was me in the in the thing just me we're having written something like that. Were you at all embarrassed by that or are you a more mature person than I am? I don't know that I was embarrassed but I definitely was just like not sure how they would take any of it to the degree to which they would associate anything that was happening on stage with my own life. They then might like draw certain conclusions which as with everything else in the show it's much more complicated than than what you just see on stage. And so I just was thinking I was just like not sure how they would take it but I wasn't like embarrassed. One of my favorite songs of yours is not in a strange loop it's called Judith. In my mark or jump the shark or this last mark when they doubt me I will follow my Judith like through the darkness. And it's about your struggles to break out in the musical theater industry and really it's a song for anybody who's struggling to express themselves and to be heard at a time when it feels the world doesn't want to hear them and you know and it's just about your your struggles and and the choruses the industry will always be the industry and I've given up given a fuck what they think about me right. So and that was written well before a strange loop blew up into the big into the most successful musical most acclaimed musical on Broadway. So I'm just wondering your reflections now back on that song and the you know the frustrations you were feeling when you wrote it. So the song Judith was one that came about because of the actress Judith Light of whom it's named after. She's if you've ever met her in real life she's just a really incredible person and she gave me like a crucial me and the group of people I was with a really crucial bit of advice. We're on sort of like a session of her she sort of in some ways is like a light coach which is kind of amazing. She has he does this thing where he like talks to artists about like their lives and she came into the room she sat down and she goes I don't want to talk about the industry fuck the industry the industry is the industry she's like tell me you're all gonna make it tell me about your lives and then he like it stares you in the eye and she's like what's going on and he just like looks at you like and she doesn't flinch and she gives you start talking to her about things and and I was really inspired by listening to her talk to everyone and to me about you know people feeling struggles about where they were as writers or as people or whatever as artists and I just started writing the song because I at that time definitely felt this sense of like of not being where I wanted to be as an artist and wanting to do more and so I wrote that song it's just a way it's sort of purging this idea that I had to to fit into some sort of box or category and so when I reflect back on it what I feel is like that an artist another artist inspired me to keep going and that that sort of advice really helped me over like a sort of crucial hurdle that then sort of open things up for the successives to come and what's so cool about your journey to me is you were uncompromising in sticking to your ethics and to your artistic voice and your your musical itself takes digs at the musical theater industry and yet here you are now being totally embraced by it and I imagine that's both a little uncomfortable but also I mean it's got to be exhilarated yeah it's it's also sometimes confusing because the thing that I'd sort of learned is that people who love the show or hate the show or whatever everyone projects onto it whatever they want and I sort of have to like back away from what people's opinions of it are but like but yeah it's it's in a way it's a strange look it's that like the very thing that I was sort of railing against was the thing that helped me sort of rise which just sort of reminds me you know the piece sort of owes a big debt to the artist Liz Fair who has a song off of her first album Exon Guideville that says on asking sweet Mary please temper my hatred with peace weave my disgust into fame and watch how fast they run to the flame and that's has always been like a mantra of mine and I feel like that's sort of what happens in a way with a strange move what does that mean what you just said like what does that Liz what do those Liz Fair lyrics mean to you which I am up listening to her in high school so well what it means is that you sort of you you might start at the bottom of the of the food chain but like the very thing that keeps you that like that keeps you at the bottom is the thing that can propel you to the top and I think that that's a big piece of what happened with a strange loop is that like I was sort of an outsider in many many ways and my outsider status is the thing that I wrote about and from and that ultimately ended up being the thing that people were most drawn to I saw that you and the cast were visited by Michelle Obama what was that like and have you been visited by people who you've been critical of either like locally or on Twitter well the funny thing about is that like I've actually gotten quite quiet over the last year partly because out of not not because of that but because like I feel like the world has become so sort of um tribalistic in its sort of culture more sort of stances and I just have like had become more questioning of that and sort of more non ideological than I've ever been in my life in that regard and so I sort of and also I got into like a sort of back and forth but somebody about a topic where I was like I have two choices here I can incinerate this person which is very in my wheelhouse to like burn I am then actually a flyer breathing dragon or I can just totally shut the fuck up forever and I decided to shut the fuck up forever because I because it's all just trying to drain you with your energy and so what what that meant is that like lots of things would happen in the world that I wanted to comment on but I just decided it's no like I'm not going to do it so there are people who come to the show who like I have been critical of but in those moments what I sort of have to do is just be gracious to them as like as a guest who's in who's come to the house and they they paid their money for a ticket or they got a ticket or whatever in there there and it's not going to go beyond that and so it's been a little strange on one level because I know what what I think of them or or I know what critiques I've made in the past but also like there they are shaking my hand and and they've been moved by the piece that they've seen and I've written them so I have to take that into consideration as well and I just sort of leave it there and it's sort of you know and I feel like there was a time in the world wherein you could have you know political disagreements with people without it turning into World War III whereas now we live in a time where everybody is like wanting to be the World War III they want to see in the world and I'm just like I'm I'm I'm for big peace isn't that what Jimmy Dorol says he's like her big piece all right big piece like grilp even though he's like oh super pugilistic about everything all the time but no but no we love Jimmy that so that's sort of the the the compromise I've taken with that because like Michelle Obama came to the show Pete and Chasten Kane's of the show um a lot of like a lot of folks I mean and not just political people but like you know culture culture figures who like I'm sort of like yeah you know like I mean I don't really I mean prove Paul's like in the fracking or whatever and Paul's one of our co-producers so I it's I don't know like there's what am I gonna say like there's in that moment like they're they're there they're grateful to be there I'm happy they're there right it's not it's not a moment what I would choose to like suddenly like start attacking them for some disagreement I have with them that's what's cool about art and music is it transcends all of that and it speaks to a human experience that is deeper than politics whenever some or sometimes when I'm arguing with someone politically and I'm feeling angry towards them one way I disengaged I imagine well maybe both of us have been moved by the same piece of music before music doesn't have the power to do that to move people who are bitterly opposed and we've maybe even hate each other doesn't have the power to actually move both of us and I think that's just an amazing thing about it yeah and I think another thing that I also have learned is that like sometimes when somebody's right there in front of you you feel differently about that because most of the people who like I've been critical of I've never met them ever and so like when they're in front of you it's like oh there's suddenly another human being standing in front of you and you have to like you don't have any choice other than to like deal with whatever that makes you feel and like maybe you still are like oh you're like you know scum of the earth I mean I'm sure there are people who like if they came to the show there's some people like if they came to the show I would probably be like I probably would like I don't want to meet them because I have I feel so strongly but like I'm the thing I just have been learning because I've met so many people in general who come to the show who like tell me what it means to them that it's forced me to be a lot more empathetic and a lot more just needing at somebody where they are in the moment and not projecting my own whatever on top of them even if like I know we had disagreements and and that's also something that I've tried to do by inviting certain people to the show to like I know I might have disagreements with and you know I know that might sound like oh I'm promoting civility but like and flexibility you know now like but that's sort of what I'm talking about is that like I'm for I want peace you know and like this is a small way to promote it I guess you know who knows that that will work out in the long run but it's I found it to be a profound way of sort of interacting in the world in this moment when everything is so fraught and so you know binary and so like my way and where the highway I mean I didn't expect you to tell Michelle Obama like get out of here you Neil liberal shell whose weaponized identity politics but I was just wondering if there was like oh if it felt weird and the other thing is you didn't you didn't have a huge I don't know if you've ever tweeted something about the Obamas um oh I definitely have that okay yeah but you also didn't have it you didn't and you still don't I mean I just saw you got to 15,000 which is great twitter followers but it's also very possible that they they'd have no idea yeah I'm sure they don't I mean they don't and what do they care like people said like all kinds of things about them for years and years and years and years so what so what is like you know something I say matter to them at all and again in that moment she liked thanks me for the show and I thanks her for coming and that was it I didn't say anything beyond that you know I certainly don't you didn't say yes we can I didn't say yes we can I didn't say like anything beyond thank really thank you for coming I appreciate you for being here because I did appreciate her appreciate her for being there and like so many of the the people in the room really really love her like and I just have to leave it at that because there's just truly no value in in doing and going and taking it any further than that Aaron you should next time you're fighting like with Mark Townsend who you know smeared you for having disinformation you should just say be like Mark what do you think of this song called inner white girl what do you think of the song Judith I don't want to I don't want to do that because I don't want to risk liking people like that and if we if we bond over a strange loop then I'm in trouble because I strange loops I've listened to it on loop I love it so much Michael in your Tony speech you talked about when you wrote a strange loop you wanted to create a life raft for yourself and I'm wondering if now you think and I've seen how you've actually created a life raft for many people who have really felt seen by this musical in ways that they weren't before yeah that's been kind of that's sort of connected to what we were talking about before that like so many people come up to me and said you know I felt seen by the show it like this reflected some aspect of my life or my family or like this one guy came up to me and told me that you know his family had never really accepted him for being gay for many years and then he like brought some of them to the show and that the show sort of helped them start a dialogue in their family and that's like that was like really overwhelming for me to hear because it's not that like I didn't think that something like that could happen but that that's like a real thing that somebody said happened in their life as a result of you know watching this thing that I had spent all these years and years and years and years working on and that I had started from a truly just for myself sort of place so that that means a lot to me and I think that that's significant and it's and it's why like you know if there are people who I think disagree with politically or culturally or whatever if it if the show means something to them I can't dismiss that totally like I just I do think it's just like a human aspect particularly with art that like that can just cut through quite a lot I mean it doesn't mean that like the disagreements are not still there but that it's not nothing and I've had to really sort of internalize that that like those human to human moments are like really really important and I treasure them. Are you able to tell us any stories without giving away any names or identities of your most frustrating interactions with industry types that might represent just how difficult and dysfunctional the musical theater world is or the entertainment world is? I think like the the the the biggest frustrations that I've had are they're not necessarily around like breaking through but they're like what they what big frustration I have is the director of of a strange group is Stephen Bracket and he is white and there's been over the years even to Broadway even with the success of a show there are these people these voices that come in are like why do you have a white director? How dare the white director direct this a white director can't white directors is like what's somebody made you have the white director you thought you needed a white director and I'm and like in the sort of narrowness of that the way that people talk about that completely ignorantly without understanding the history of how he came to be involved with a piece or what his contributions had been or how valuable his contributions had been or what our collaboration is like really I find quite infuriating because the implication in it whether they say it or not is that me a black musical theater writer doesn't is like a baby who doesn't who is incapable of making his own decisions or of having integrity to do whatever it is if he wants in his own work it's that what becomes important is that there's a white person involved and that they're sort of in charge of me or in charge of my musical and that and so that's been a frustration of mine because I always have to be like mother fucker shut the fuck up like I'm nobody tells me what to do ever I'm fully fully capable of like making my own decisions and collaborating with somebody white black brown whatever and I have done it my entire career and so that's a big frustration because because it's it speaks to sort of that the narrowness that so many people have in their minds and the sort of like closet racism that they have even as they might think that them making that sort of judgment is somehow speaking truth to power it's actually a kind of racism in and of itself because it takes me out of the equation so that's like that's been I would say if I had to name any frustration that's been like the biggest one and it and it and it and it also you know disregard Steven's work and Steven has I feel been one of the most respectful one of the most patient and sort of like collaborative people that I've met it doesn't mean that he's like been perfectly entire time but like he's been like the most ideal collaborator that I could have had for this piece um to date so that's that's something that I feel strongly about who are some of the people who you would not be able to talk to if they came to your show and to hear the rest of the interview please go to usefulidiot subsack.com That was great huh?
