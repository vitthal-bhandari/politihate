There's a bubble in my throat. There's a bubble in my throat. And I'm gonna cough it out. And it's gonna sound just like this. Ahem! Cough! Wow! That was gross. That was really gross. I am I'm having trouble breathing out of my nose because of allergies. And I should have brought some sort of inhaler but I didn't. So I'm gonna sound a little more like I have a cold even though I don't even though I don't I always sound like I have a cold but especially today because I can't breathe out of my nose whole... You know I'm friendly with Benfolds. And remember he like when I was doing that video like I was playing video games with Annie and I would improvise songs when I was beating her and stuff and then Ben was in Australia just like I'm gonna put this to music and he put it to music and it was so fun. So I guess when I was in New York I did post a video just where I was just so happy. I mean it was like post-COVID in New York for a short time before Delta started sweeping the nation but it was like over and it was so exciting and I had just posted a thing where I was just like walking and just my heart filled with New Yorkiness and I said something like I was just sitting on the corner and I saw a guy with a long gray beard wearing a tube top and short shorts and smoking a cigar and I just thought New York is back baby and then he just sent me like he just he puts it to music like he just gets bored and he takes stuff and puts it to music. So this is that let's see if it's interesting. So that's funny I love him. God he's got a podcast. On this very same network and it's so good what he makes songs out of. So I got an email from Jimmy Kimmel live. No just Jimmy Kimmel the person and he's been I think he's always been an archivist you know and I think he's been like archiving all his shit and stuff and somehow we found you know we I lived with him for many years and he it's from before we met but he found he had a one of those little answering machine tapes of mine and he digitized it and emailed it to me and I haven't even listened to all of it yet but it's like a bunch of emails a bunch of voicemails from Gary Shambling and a couple from some nieces and nephews when they're little and and then there were three from Paul Rudd from before we ever met. I mean this is 20 years ago we were fixed up on it we went on a date but it was we met for coffee and somehow even though he is a gorgeous awesome wonderful smart funny amazing guy and so am I I think it wasn't a match but then years later we became friends we have mutual friends and we and I love him and his wife but uh I haven't gotten through it if there's anything interesting and it's a terrible quality but it's Gary's are so good because they all start with him saying all of them start with Sarah it's your friend Gary Shambling anyway that was really special especially because of all the Gary messages on it and I'm so bad at keeping stuff and holding on to things that might mean something to me at a later date I'm just terrible at it I don't want I think of myself as that James Spader character from Sex Lies and Video Tape I only want one key you know I don't like stuff I don't like things but boy well how special even though the quality is terrible and it's but it's how neat was that so there's that all right let's take some calls you left me a message now I'm playing it for the world let's hear some voice hi Sarah I am just a check from Philly and I think you're great but I have to say I am totally team Rory on this whole balls as a symbol of courage debate and this is why okay if balls are as fragile as the people who have them would at least have us believe then that means they are source of intense vulnerability and fear for those people right and yet the balls are what produced testosterone which is the juice that gives those same people the energy or whatever it is that they need to go out and you know be energetic be physical or even a rationally aggressive sometimes even in the face of that vulnerability right that's courage being able to do the thing knowing and fearing your own vulnerability if you can do something but aren't vulnerable that's not courage that's just strength so to me the symbolism holds because balls give their people courage but jinies give their people strength right although going through childbirth really does take courage because that shit hurts and everybody knows it anyway love the pod everybody knows it that's this all right well there's one for Rory good for you Rory you've got people on your side you know i was thinking about it balls is i would take on that same argument i say about the neck slash throat area why isn't there bone around it protecting it there's so much shit in here there should be like a a cartilage or a bone protecting it we got ribs with for our hearts and lungs we got our skull to protect our brain we need a little bone around uh our brothers balls our brothers balls and a little bone little like kind of bendy bone around my throat i mean why is this so vulnerable anyway i'm happy for your Rory you got some uh got some fan support and you know what you need it i'm happy for you and i love you whatever what else hi Sarah i am a midwestern trans man in his late 20s and i was just wondering what should somebody do in the situation where the only way to save their relationship they feel is couples counseling but the other person is extremely resistant to any kind of therapy or counseling to help themselves with their own individual needs already um my partner has been effectively manipulating and gaslighting me for the past year i didn't really realize it until they try to drive some very very close members of my inner circle away um and are still kind of continuing to do so i love my partner i don't want to be another person in their life that tells them they love them and still leaves i don't want to go up on them but i also don't want to continue to be emotionally abused every day so thanks why are you with this person i i get it you know you say you uh don't want to be another person in your partner's life who abandons them there may be a reason why people keep abandoning them i'm using them because i you didn't say a sex of who your partner was um the common denominator seems to be them though i mean of course you know that said their or their origin story is surely uh something traumatic from childhood where there was a abandonment you know and and probably i would say driving people away protects their little inner child from experiencing that again but of course it becomes a self-fulfilled prophecy and they are not a child any any longer they're an adult they're your partner in this behavior isn't certainly not serving them anymore it's definitely not serving you and it's all very sad and hopefully someday they'll realize this and get help but in the meantime it is not your job to endure being treated this way you know just because you understand where it comes from and you have empathy does not mean you have to stay in this relationship you can love this person peripherally as a friend with your whole heart um i don't know it just it does not sound like this relationship is serving you at all um i don't think this is a couple's counseling thing it doesn't sound like your partner's looking at change the change has to come from you you know and and that change should be get the fuck out i think you know you you do not deserve to be treated this way and the only person that can take you out of this situation uh is you life's too short to be scared all the time and didn't conclusion um i have nothing Raj in conclusion girlfriend you need to dump this loser there you go that was an original thought by Raj he wrote that he he wrote that thank you I really wish you could see what I see through the booth of Raj um saying girlfriend you need to dump this loser because it's really something here's a Athena club yes yes i got away with not shaving as frequently when I was holed up at

podcast from a few weeks ago when you talked about exchanging female male words with female or any words and it really struck a core for me because i create all these videos all the time for my classes now that i teach mostly online and i start every video with hey guys so i've had to be very conscious about not saying that and but i don't know that i would be so conscious about not saying hey guys if i was talking amongst a group of people just in a normal conversation as opposed to making a video and making a public and i was wondering if you have a different way that you talk amongst your friends and family then you do publicly i know we're all trying to make changes in terms of the way we speak to be more inclusive but um i think there is a little bit of a difference i like the idea of exchanging like hey guys what hey gals and that's something i might try but i'm really apprehensive to do it because you know it's so hard and for men to call other men women even though you're not you know it's so ingrained in our society that's such a putdown which is ridiculous but i know that i started every video with hey gals i would probably get a bunch of feedback which maybe is a good thing but um it's like it's it's really hard for me to do that i guess just because of our society yeah right it's like insulting to you know the when you say hey guys you're like well we mean everybody but if you go like gather around ladies it's because you're putting down the the boys you know soccer team or whatever but it's very interesting very interesting thought to say hey gals with the idea of you know no we it gals means everybody you know means everybody that's interesting i mean the unfortunate thing is gals just sounds corny as fuck maybe we can take back the night with gals you know like just gals hey gals what's up gals oh why is that so corny to the ear why i say guys a lot but for a while now i've changed it i've been i say y'all because that's everybody i like y'all yeah saying gals hey gals just sounds so corny and then guys is like what's up guys like it sounds cool why is that is that we're conditioned to think guys is cool and gals is cheesy are we conditioned to think that i mean it really does sound cheesy to my ear holes and yes i'm sure i use far less pc much more you know antiquated language at home or if i'm just like with rorier close friends but i i think i'm mostly i'm trying to implement new language all the time you know even at home because i like it i like i like the challenge of it and i like incorporating new new language my best friend Heidi visited me with her six-year-old son and she was saying she's the one who also i was to saying is like it drives her crazy shopping for her son because it's like he likes pink and he likes rainbows and they have that in like the girls section and the boy it's just ridiculous how they sexualized colors you know and it's very odd but anyway um she was talking about per as a pronoun meaning person you know we're trying to use it and it just felt really odd but everything feels odd at first but you know so if you're saying like um is he going to the store you'd be like is per going to the store as it sounds really weird but then i go like well a lot of things sound weird when they're new like when people first when when blog was new you'd be like are you ready are you ready to do your blog you know just saying blog was like a punchline because it was so new and we were like blog now no one thinks anything of it you know or when nobody could pronounce Gallifenakis or like that guy needs to change his last name gal something gal now everyone can say Gallifenakis or like how you if you're my age realize like you know every lyric to every Huey Lewis song even though you didn't even realize you know you're not necessarily a Huey Lewis in the news head i mean maybe i am a little bit but i know every word to every song i realize that's how much space is in our brain for stuff so you know all the new words get shined or are you gonna are you gonna put it in the cloud it's like when i say the you know when the friends when the friends pilot script was going around i'd be like are you gonna audition for friends it's about friends i don't know i find it in there you know guys is a rough one because i do find it endearing but i i do like y'all i find it more useful because it's just all encompassing we should just make a word that's like represents everyone you know like that combines gals and guys got gays just say gays we'll call everyone gays

about something because i actually was trying to find a specific video of you because i really liked the way you spoke about anti-Semitic theories surrounding 9-11 and instead what i found somehow was a clip of you from jesus's magic um where in one of your jokes you say the n-word hard are twice as well as the c-slur um and i i cannot tell you the weight in which my heart sank um i just turned 17 and i really enjoyed your podcast because of your political ideologies i thought that we shared a lot of the same ones and it was um i just kind of shattered my heart a little bit just because i really looked up to you anyway i wanted to know your thoughts on that because i just i really hope you grew since then because i just i really want to keep looking up to you well what do you think you think i've grown since then you you got to know who i am now first do you think i've grown since then i think i think yeah i have i i think uh i think a lot of people have grown since then um you know there's some some pretty good stuff in that special but boy oh boy is a comedy not ever green so much of that first special makes me cringe i will say my intention in that special was to blow up race and that whole special was in character i was not saying those words for no reason but those reasons no matter the intention do not stand of course i understand that now i'm very clear about that now and i've been for a long time also shout out to Brody Stevens in that for playing big-nosed Jew not defending it i haven't even watched it i can't i know my heart would sink if i saw that stuff now um like yours did i am i feel very sorry for disappointing you um even retroactively i will only say that um the person you came to like the me i am now um is only who i am now because of who i was and what i was able to learn along the way especially the lesson that i can be wrong and i can change and that's a good thing you know as much as i would like to delete a lot of that stuff out of existence i can't i said a lot of things that i would not stand by today in my comedy career that's how comedy works sometimes it's of a time and it does not always hold up rarely does it hold up so what can i do all i can do is everything i can to make it right for for the rest of my life and be changed by it and hopefully there are people and hopefully you who um who will enable a path to redemption for people who have not been perfect their entire lives and want to change i'm guessing you know um maybe even you have done things that that you regret today even in your your short 17-year life maybe not my favorite people in the world or people who have been changed and continue to change but in order to do that you've got to not be perfect and accept that you aren't so uh i don't know if you're still gonna like me because that's a part of my history and i can't change it and we live in a digital age and i'm an entertainer so you can find a lot of stuff from the past uh with with plenty of disappointing things in it i can only promise that if you look to me for all things correct i will disappoint you but hey if if all you learn from me is not to have strangers be your heroes i have done my job um but to answer your question yeah i have uh i have changed since then yes it's hard yes ugh it's a terrible feeling to disappoint people and i wish it had something funny to add as a button to the end rudge give me a button of some kind for this in conclusion po-bodies nerfic it's got that from garfield is that right that's right yes wow one of the great comic uh minds of our time garfield sure well you know here's a question for you sarah okay if garfield is served lasagna on a monday is his overall mood excited neutral or bummed i mean it would have to be neutral he hates monday's but he loves lasagna that is that's a good answer it's yeah it's just like if he's got to be if he's got to wake up on a monday let him wake up to lasagna that i i agree i will i my take is that garfield is just a generally not to compare into another cartoon but he's an eor so or you know fictional character so he's just always generally a little bummed all of lasagna in the world wouldn't please garfield i wish you could see them going like basically like that was a mic drop for him and there you go all right what else hey sarah my name is devin calling from spoke am washington and you've mentioned before that you want to be able to move in one day with rorrie and i was just wondering like is that the goal where does that value come from for me i feel like i'm best with a partner when i do have my own separate space so i just love to hear your thoughts on this shit don't fuck with my head i feel that way too i you know i usually do feel that way too but i i don't with rorrie i mean listen i i went into this relationship pretty damaged and kind of terrified and very wary but um i've come really far with rorrie i feel like one of those i'm like i don't even know if people watch this like the dodo you know that site the dodo and they always have like a broken malnutrition dog and then at the end of the video he's like happy and loved and has a forever family and is for grew back that's a little bit how i feel with ror rorrie because you know we talk everything out we've both have come from myriad relationships that have chipped away at us in various ways and and we just want to just be honest and take each other at face value no games no like but what do you really mean you know like we're i'm gonna say what i really mean and i've and i'm gonna take you know your word that way too and it's been great and just talking shit out we had a little rough patch over the weekend and like we just fucking it wasn't fun but we talked it out and it always ends up good you know we we really talk shit out and we we talk about moving in together a lot and and both romantically and pragmatically like oh and we live together this but also like when we live together this you know like i i feel like once we do there's gonna be real clear lines and we'll have space you know to have our time outs and be separate because we both thrive on that you know and we've been practicing on weekends we we have like long weekends together big chunks of time and then we we hang out and we're each other's world and we're like canodling all day and then we'll like separate corners it and like do our own thing and like i love it i go you know play a little ps5 i'll go upstairs and take a sweet-ass bath he's like love it i don't know it's so far it's working but we haven't moved in together but i'm really not that worried about it though this call like uh like stirred up old fears a little bit no we like to be together i think it will be good i don't know your call really fucked me up and put me in my old headspace so thanks for that you know i used to think like time was such a twat because like when it came to relationships things would be so good and then like your partner would be like what does all this mean you know what what are we building to what what is this working towards you know and just be like why can't just be more of this but i i don't have that with Rory Rory i think it was my idea that we move in together because it's like he's renting a house and he's not there much you know it doesn't make sense but um i don't know i feel good about it i feel very cornered by this question no i don't what what am i feeling right now i think because i had an experience of cohabitating that left me kind of a shell of a person and i got very scared off and um but now i feel differently and that's that and i really like sleeping next to him i can't believe it with my night guard in and everything sleeping slack jawed and he still like looks at me and loves me what so yeah we're gonna move in together all right all right what can i say the heart wants what it wants said a man who married his daughter at best okay i know i'm late to the game i i just watched uh whatever pharaoh v allen v pharaoh or whatever i know i'm late to the game but um very disturbing though i will say one big takeaway was me a pharaoh's kinetic at home is fire it's so rad it's like the time it's so homey it's so warm the bookshelves the the the countryness the the tire swings the lake but it's also about more than that i'm the worst what else i say this is chilpomer um i'm from boston and years ago i decided to lose my accent because people made fun of it did you i just wondered how and when did you lose your accent from new england thanks take care i you sounded like boston right from the top just because you said sierra sierra sierra um i didn't lose it i didn't unlearn it i really never maybe i had it a little bit but i never really had it because my mother my dad is a very thick boston slash new england accent very thick but my mother uh you know she's she to me like she talks like diane chambers from cheers you know she she says like what said she died she said uh like when and where and you know diction was very important to her and i think that's why i'm i would slur my words but i'm very careful with diction and i think when people imitate me they're imitating me being careful to say things clearly um but uh yeah so i never really had it we we learned very early to uh like translate what my dad said it would like translate in our brains like if he said like uh cult if he said cultcha cultcha we knew it was culture we would just translate it but it would backfire too because then when he would say like parka or sofa we would say parker or sofa we just thought like you sit on a sofa it's so funny when my dad and his mother would talk like they they anything that ends in er like er they changed to ah you know like um whatever i said culture culture i don't know i'm using the word culture um but then anything that naturally ends with like a h they turn into a y like my dad just said like hully for hollywood hollywood hollywood they would say hully did you get the hully did you pick up the hully it's like cinder relly i wonder if those mice were from boston but yeah i didn't have to unlearn it because i was unlearning it through my my mother all right enough of that what else hi sir my name is desray i'm a huge fan of the podcast and everything that you have ever done i wanted to chime in on the idea of nothing matters and the color who said you know what about everything matters and first of all i want to throw in there what about a nice neutral it is what it is you know what's what's not try to to be too optimistic or too pessimistic even though i tend to be a pessimistic person myself you know it is what it is um and i wanted to also share a very brief story about a time that i was making some cupcakes for a baby shower and it wasn't going well they were falling apart the frosting wasn't doing what it was supposed to be doing whatever and i was so upset about these fucking cupcakes and my boyfriend said they're cupcakes it's cupcakes nobody's going to be disappointed with the cupcake they are what they are they are delicious whether it looks good or not and to this day a phrase in our house is when something is kind of not going the way we wanted it to but it's also going to be okay if we lose that control it's still going to work out maybe or maybe we have to compromise but it's still okay we'll say it's cupcakes um anyways love the show thank you for all that you do bye bye i love that this topic has spanned weeks and it's like so little it's it's so little and it's so big you know it's like encompasses it's the micro and the macro but um it's it's just funny i like that it's cupcakes come on it's cupcakes i like that it is what it is yes very good i for some reason i it's like too popular a lot of people are saying it is what it is lately like i feel like it's the new you know hey at the end of the day but similar i i would say that i i say this is what is which is practically the same thing but for me it's like when the shutdown first happened march 2020 i had so many things just suddenly went away of course for everybody and i just i think my survival was i just said to myself this is what is this is what is how you gonna handle it and it really helped me but that's great huh nothing matters everything matters it is what it is this is what is it's cupcakes hey whatever floats your boat all right it's cupcakes baby what else hi sarah my name is Natalie um i wanted to touch on people who are under religious conservative beliefs that are still on the fence as to whether or not they should get vaccinated or not i know my family falls onto this category which is really unfortunate and a lot of people in this country still do and it breaks my heart because i know that there's a true desire on their hearts to know what is true which side is truly the misinformed side and i just want to say that if you fall under that category that uh best case scenario of getting the vaccine is that you save human lives which is what you're called to do as a follower of jesus christ anyways and worst case scenario is that we were all dumb and blind and bill gates kills off the entire population together which technically and biblically you shouldn't be afraid of because according to you you're gonna have everlasting and eternal life in heaven right so stop being afraid of death because that is biblical hypocrisy why not take a risk in what we do know which is that people are dying of covid 19 trust that god has a plan for your life and for this world and get the vaccine save some lives while you're on this planet because you're going to heaven at the end of the day right yay how exciting anyways i love you sarah and i love this podcast thanks well i think your approach is perfect and i agree with every everything you say that the whole bill gates conspiracy is just so crazy he's a fucking nerd genius that like created computers or the internet or i don't i'm sorry i'm an idiot but you know microsoft i made billions of dollars and then invested it in like eradicating malaria and uh and myriad things that are saving people's lives good grief he's not diabolical you know there are a lot of people having a hard time knowing what is true and it's like whoever gets to them first or lights that you know ignites the fires of fear in them first but you know i like your theory your theory seems very win-win i like it and dad with that i am wrapping up winding down winding down wrapping up the show this is the the time in the show where i say subscribe rate and review wherever you listen to podcasts and check us out on youtube if you like watching with your stupid eye holes bye"
