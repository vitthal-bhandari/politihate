    "text": " This is the Ademailant Show. Hi everybody it's Ed Mylet. Welcome back to Max Out. I am so fired up about today's program. I've been chasing this lady to get on the show for... Chasing. Chasing. For many many many new parts to catch. In fact, so hard to catch. I had to drive all the way to your house to do this today. So you know this is a great pad. And getting it's a family home, which is reflective of YouTube. But you know this is important to me today because we didn't shoot it at my house. I came to you. And this lady, most of you recognize her. But if you don't, she's a trailblazer. And she's an incredible mother. She's an author. She's one of the greatest college softball players of all time. She's an Olympic gold medalist. And she is many many other things. But she's also really the first female baseball announcer in the history of ESPN. And she is also the host of Sunday night baseball with my friend Alex Rodriguez. And so we got all kind of stuff to cover today. So thank you for being here. Good to have you here. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks for coming. I'm glad you're in my house. I know. I'm pretty honored. It's cool. And we're sober today guys. No alcohol in today's show. Alfred Scott. She did. She did. I wanted to keep it real. So thank you again for doing this. And I don't know if you realize it, but you're making history. Does it feel like it to you? I mean that you've broken through all of these barriers. I mean you're the first woman ever to do what you do in terms of the broadcasting realm. Do you ever think about that? I don't. I mean I don't think about it like history. I think I guess when you do stuff like that it's for history. It's for when 30, 40 years from now and I got grandkids or sitting around the table and you look back. That's how I think of it. I think what it hits me more is that there's more responsibility. Yeah. So I recognize that this is more than just about me. This isn't just me doing my job, but there are a lot of women. There's men, fathers, daughters that depend on me to not screw up. I recognize that from day one. Yeah. It's true when women knew that I was finally had booked you. I'm going to tell you I was struck by kind of the level of emotion from some of the women about how much they're rooting for you and you're so great at it. So they don't really need to worry about that. But it's interesting to me. I think when you're making history you don't know it. It's not until you're done making it that you go wow that was profound. But in the 50, 80 year history of the sport and then all the television time you're the first woman to do this. So it's pretty significant. I had Christine Simmons on my show who's the president of the LA Sparks and she's an African American woman and she said to me she says I'm conscious of the fact that I'm the first and I want to do a good enough job so that I'm not the last. Yeah. No. I talked to John Skipper who's then president of ESPN and him giving me the opportunity to be on Sunday. I was like look like I just don't want this to be the hey we've put her on for a couple of games. Don't put me on unless it's something that we want to sustain. And not just with me but just as far as opening the door to a lot of women. And that's where the responsibility kicks in. Because I screw up that door closes. Right. I want to knock the damn door down and just like come on everybody. Well you're doing it because just recently you just signed a multi year deal with them so it doesn't seem like it's going to end anytime soon. Right. Yeah. I'm excited. Yeah. I'm going to stay. Congratulations. That's because you've done such an amazing job and Alex is constantly telling me how incredible you are and frankly before you and I had met I was familiar with you but I must tell you he raved about you and our private conversations about you. He thinks the world of you. So but I want to go back because I want people to you know you're not the after. You're in progress but I want people to kind of know a little bit more because I think they know you as the broadcaster. But if you really dig deeper you're an incredible athlete as well. Right. So this one won a gold medal and a silver medal in the Olympics and at Stanford and softball right off camera said you're one of the greatest college softball players of all time. You're like no no I'm not. And I said well at Stanford she says no no I'm not. But the truth is you were a great athlete. Were you always a great athlete growing up? No. Oh my gosh. I wish we had like a real like to show you me you know around the holidays especially my parents will break out like old videos of you know me as a kid me playing softball. I mean I played all sports but I was completely uncoordinated like oh gosh like me and T-ball right the balls on a stick okay it's not moving. I would strike out. But I'm like I mean my personality too like I'm like all into it like taking these huge legs trying to swing out of my shoes and the ball still sitting there on the stick. And you can run it out of the first baseline with like Phoebe from friends. Are you serious? Like when did you get good? I mean my dad was you know he's a legendary in this area football baseball coach and I grew up on the sidelines I grew up in the dugout. Coach's kid you're oh yeah you're only just always practicing. Like my dad didn't see the uncoordination or just the total like you know wow like he saw the athlete always and he saw the potential and so especially my younger sister and I we worked all the time. Before you could eat dinner you had the weight program. Seriously. Just like when your coaches came like I have friends this day that said I hate it coming to dinner at your house because my your dad would make us work out. No way. I was like oh he made you do that too and that was just the norm. I was like is that not what you do at your house guys. Like he had it was called military workouts and he had like a military press bar and then we'd have to do this whole workout before you could eat dinner. Whoa. Yeah. No he was he was intense. It's funny because of a lot of the athletes I have on my show not all of them but usually one of the two parents instilled some sort of kind of crazy work ethic that they think is normal that nobody else in the world does when they were young so it was your dad. And your dad played college football at Fresno State right. Yes. Dang you did do your homework. I did do my homework. I also told through a mutual friend of ours that your dad is a central figure in the sense that he's a huge fan of yours but he'll also let you know what's up both when you played and in broadcasting. Oh yeah. And that your mom is more just a support and a fan. So describe the dynamic. You just people I think people that have children want to know how do you make something like this right. So what was that what was that dynamic like or is the balance is key and I think understanding your kid I mean I got two boys now and my sister and I were super different and so just understanding the personality. Like I mean my dad pushed me but my mom was there to also she was incredibly intelligent so she pushed the school end of it. But then was softer on the athlete she was always just like you're doing a great job no matter what on the sports side when I came to school was like you can do better. Okay. Whereas my dad was like schoolwork like just get after and so they balanced each other you know and we could kind of find that happy medium they both were like hardcore all the time. Would your dad let you know after a game that something wasn't acceptable or you didn't play well. He never let me know the opposite like it was I mean if you okay go I can't remember until I got to college and I remember like the first moment but until I got to college I don't remember him ever saying like good job and I don't mean that in like a bad way. I just the coach and him I could be three for four with three home runs and we talk about the one about it in Gombes. No kidding. And that mentality is still inside of me of you know even in broadcasting it's like okay like you can work and work but there's always something you can get better and it's not looking at it like you're bad or he never was like you're awful or he was never negative. He was just always trying to give that constructive criticism of like okay but what are we trying to do to get better. I think sometimes I'm that way a little bit too and I think sometimes it says something to you that's powerful which is like we know you're better than this. I know you can be better than this. I think if you're willing to break the negative part down even with your kids because we're in this sort of positive PC where like everything has to be everyone gets a trophy. Everyone gets a trophy. But you said you remember the first time he validated something you did. What was that? It's like it's yesterday. It's funny it's like such an emotional moment because it hit me like a lightning rod and I'll never forget we're in my parents van. I was playing in internment so I was at Stanford freshman year preseason tournament we're in San Diego and we just played Cal State Northridge. I was up bat with the bases loaded. I'm batting third as a freshman. I'm feeling pressure and in my mind I'm like this is who you want it to bat. You want the number three batter bases loaded. This is a team that we should beat and I struck out on a changeup. I can remember the pitch and it was pretty fat changeup too and I don't know. Just didn't see it. Whatever. I missed it. Game ends. We had like a break so my parents took me to lunch before we had to be back for the next game and I remember sitting in the back seat behind my dad and my mom's over here and I'm just like I mean as down as they come and I'm ready for it. Tell me what I did wrong. But I'm already like I know I'm awful. He pulled the car over and he turned around and he's like Jesse don't you know that you're the best athlete that our family has ever seen. And I was just like head up. He's like my dad played sports. He's like I played in college. He's like we had athletes and he's like I mean he turned around to look at me and he was so emotional and proud and he had never even come close and all of a sudden it went from like that to like don't you know. You're this down on a strike. Don't you know who you are? You're the best athlete this family has seen. And to come from the coach like my dad and like massive moment. It literally changed me because it helped me see me for like the first time. And like up until that point it was like just what you know he had done just that constant how can I be better I'm not good enough and all of a sudden I was like wait you think I'm like you know it was sounds cheesy but it was. And from that moment on it was like it shifted. He to this day like is my biggest fan with him and my mom but like his ability now to say I'm proud of you and you are accomplishing more than I could have ever imagined. And sometimes it strikes him that it was a female in the family and he said that too. You know he's just like of all the men that we have in our family and the jocks and he's like I never would have thought it would have been a woman. It would be in our family that would do the things and now he's sold like on women's athletics and so amazing. It's cool. I can just see your whole being changes when you talk about it. So that's wonderful. I thank you for sharing that I appreciate that very much. It was definitely one of those you have them that sprinkled throughout your life and that was one that literally was like the heavens opened up and I was just like wait what? Wow. Do you think you still like when you're doing really well or you do something like even this new deal you signed these still kind of think of like your dad is one of the first people when you do something good. I was like Ed it's like I become and I'm daddy's girl and I'm close my mom's my best friend. I feel like she doesn't get enough of it either. She's my best friend but it's an easy relationship. You know I was always daddy's girl just vying for that attention constantly. It was never enough and till this day if he tells me he's proud of me I'm like the ten year old girl. He's like really? Are you proud of me? Wow. And it's funny because of all the you know with social media and likes and all the things that you can get for whatever you might need it comes back to my own father just saying you know four words. Me too by the way. Isn't that amazing? I'm in the exact same way. Millions of people liking your stuff and if my dad's proud of me everything else is amazing. By the way millions of people are nodding their heads right now some of them are crying and they're in total agreeance with you. So let's just finish this piece though because it's pretty incredible. This is such an accomplished woman. I love the title of the show's max out but like you've really maxed out multiple areas. Like when I look at you I'm like I'm in your home. You can feel the spirit in your home and the love and we're talking about your son's off camera and your husband and just I can feel this is such a loving family and you were this you've got this unbelievable pioneering career that we're really going to get into the teeth of in a minute. It's just it's trailblazing. It's changing something forever potentially and it's you. It's probably got to blow your mind that it's you but you were also an amazing athlete. And so don't be humble about this. You were you a four-time All-American? Yeah. Four-time All-American. Then you make the Olympic team and win a gold. What is winning a gold medal like? What's cool is okay. So we hear the national anthem how many times you know in your lifetime is growing up as a kid you know a home room games that you've played I think what hit me with the Olympics and this is a bit of my personality coming in I mean clearly I've loved the game of softball dedicated most of my life to playing it so there's that passion right. Then you go to the Olympics and to me in 2004 we had just we had just gone in Iraq so our political place in our country was very interesting at the time. That's me like I'm someone that's very aware of a lot of that and I remember you know getting into the dining hall the cool thing about the Olympics is the Olympic Village you get 10,000 athletes you have more countries represented in the Olympic Village than you do in the United Nations. So my favorite piece of the Olympics besides the on the field was actually our meals really beyond the fact that I love to eat but the fact that I would actually not sit with our team I would go and I remember clearly I wanted to sit down with the Iraqi soccer team and none of them that I had met in line getting food spoke English I had met this Egyptian high jumper that was able to help me like translate and so I went down and sat with the Iraqi soccer team with this new like friend that I met on the Egyptian track team and literally just sat down and had conversations about what was happening between our two countries. Oh my gosh what a great story. No but it was like what did you get out of that? Just like well honestly how like upset they were and but yet here we are and they were so just like taken aback by the fact that I wanted to talk politics in the middle of this like entire arena and they ended up inviting me back to their side of the village and we just hung out we spent like hours just kind of talking and getting into stuff and you know and it didn't stop there you meet athletes from all over but the point is when you have USA across your chest like I wanted to know what that really meant and when you win a gold medal and now the anthem is playing it brought such a sense of pride for our country that I don't want to say I mean I was always proud to be an American but you know you grow up here you don't really realize and for me talking to not just Iraqi athletes but honestly you know athletes that you know finding out that they don't have any female representatives from their entire country so knowing here that I grew up and I had opportunities galore from the age that I could first walk like throwing a ball and playing with other kids and so to answer your question like you get a gold medal but like honestly like I lost it and I'm not like very emotional like crying very much I lost it when we got up on that podium and our flag was raising and you have USA across your chest and it's like you combine that like of course all the hard work to win that gold your teammates your sisters that love but there was this whole like huge it hit me in Athens how proud I was to be from the country I was from and to understand what that meant to not just but you know warfare and all the different things that make it complicated yeah sometimes you're not proud of but at the end of the day it's USA this is who I am what an amazing story like that is an amazing story I can just picture you sitting there talking to this Iraqi player like what an amazing like and it was funny because my teammates are like what are you doing right right right going on and I wouldn't give up because I was like because they were looking even like when I first started to try I was like trying to converse with them and it wasn't working and they're just looking at me like what what are you trying like yeah you know and so then I finally got a friend of mine that I was able to okay can you help me and so then I went back to their table and they're like she's back and I was like I'm gonna do this and I'm glad I did because my first impression I'm sure they were just been like crazy American right you know but we ended up getting to know each other what a wonderful story you know and and I love that because I can't I couldn't fly over to Iraq and talk to people right and yet we have this huge ability and I know it sounds I guess cheesy but within the Olympic arena to cross any border right and have like real conversations yeah I don't think it's cheesy and I actually also think it's kind of a metaphor for who you are which is that when there's an opportunity presented to you you jump all over it in every aspect and not everybody listening to this has the opportunity to go win a gold medal or be in the Olympics but they do have a chance to get out of their comfort zone and go explore experiences and do something extraordinary and this is no knock on the rest of your teammates because they obviously won a gold medal so there's something you share with them forever but you were the one who went and did that right and so that's so that really is important like people there's experiences all around you every day every year there's something where you could step into an uncomfortable space and just have an experience going up to a stranger like when you talk about uncomfortable yeah like yeah that's extreme like someone from another country but like I think all the time of times that I've gone up to someone that makes you uncomfortable because and I do I tell you I get that look a lot like what like are you cuz I'll kind of stumble through like I'm not the most like I come up to a con I was like I really want to talk to you you know and it hasn't always worked out too I've had people that literally have just walked away and I'm like you're crazy but the point is is like I'll never know and more of my doors have opened because I've gone up to complete strength really by myself and just jumped and I don't even know where I'm going I'm like I just know I need to talk to you so I'm gonna start kind of bubbling through this is very good awkwardly talking to you and then hopefully at some point we find like a conversation and connect oh my gosh that's so good I think people appreciate that they do appreciate that I do the same thing and I have awkward at it and it's gone weird for me a few times too but like I have I want a rich life like I want experiences I don't want everybody else's life and that's what I love about you you haven't done that you have this standard where like you want to dominate right and you did she's one of the greatest softball players that's ever played that sport before and it gets lost because you've become this pioneering broadcaster I think for a lot of people too and you're so great at that and I'm curious you went and played professionally after that but I want to go into this time because I think people can relate to this where your initial dream ends right so you you maxed out that dream but it kind of ends and so there's a lot of people that listen to this their first dream didn't work their first business didn't work their first marriage didn't work right there's things they've had where they're in that transitional period like how do I put myself back together how do I step into this space did you think and think you were going to be a baseball broadcaster and what did you do during that window when that dream ended what does that kind of window of time look like for you and I feel like the biggest thing for me and I mean you can ask my husband like I'm always I always have my hand in multiple things like I've never been able and even just in general like I can't do just one thing and so even while I was playing to be honest going back to why I chose to go to Stanford was like even though there were huge softball schools and I know to someone sitting there like why would you want to go to a softball school it's not like I'm some like football players gonna sign with the NFL or you know but when you're 17 16 years old like you want to go to the big name schools that are still good schools but they're like they're gonna win a national championship and all of your favorite players went there right I chose Stanford because my whole plan was like I'm not gonna play softball after college like I need to make sure that I'm thinking about like what this degree is gonna do versus just a great softball place you have a big life I always say that to people that many of my friends and I have this too I just have a big life meaning just have a lot of things going on at any given time and if you don't learn to navigate that when you're not successful just having a lot of things going on it's very difficult to navigate having a big life once you are successful that's why a lot of people get to a level of success they can't maintain it because you've always juggled lots of stuff and had crazy hours I assume true for you yeah yeah yeah and the bad part is is I don't know how to not do that so there is a negative that can come with it like it and by no means is my path been perfect in the sense like I've juggled too many things and it's gotten way out of control and me too now my off season so you can relate I literally plan stuff because like if I'm not working space ball season isn't going on I drove my husband crazy so I'm like let's fly here let's do this it's because the kids involved with that and like I'm just like over planning because I can't just like how do you balance that people I'd be really remiss if I didn't ask you then we'll get back in how are you at balancing all this stuff mother wife you know broadcaster author how do you do that I've learned that like even the word balance is a bad word for me me too I just put a video out before I pulled up here today I don't even believe in the concept I think seeking it's good but you can't get it because I get that question a lot like how do you balance especially family and work like being a mom and literally that word like makes me cringe because especially I feel like and I'm not saying that men don't have it too but I feel like for women that are moms there's this idea that like you know working mom I can you know be hair done go out and save the world come home apron on dinner served houses clean kids are sitting neatly with a little you know heck no like I mean you should see my kids are in school right now otherwise they'd be hanging all over crazy like you know wrestling you and you know it's it's crazy and it's not perfect and there isn't a balance what I've learned and accepted is that there's times when I'm on the road and I'm missing stuff at home so the balance is not like I'm all in on work and I'm not all in a home and that's that's hard to swallow yes there's times I'm at home and I'm with the kids and I blow off a conference call and I'm like you know what I want to be in this moment and honestly work suffers for you how do you navigate how do you you know it's definitely imperfect in the biggest message I just constantly want to get out there especially for women that are considering having children can I do it all it's not about doing it all it's doing what you're doing in the moment the best that you can and being okay like swallowing like and that's where because I get all the time the guilt and this image that I have to be like the PTA mom and the no wow I'm me and I think for every female out there is I just had a friend of mine who just was debate she's in broadcasting was trying to decide if she should have a child and I was like our kids will adapt to who we are and the life that we create not the life of society said you know what this is what children have to do this is the book on every family yeah this is just our family I like I'm so thrilled you said that because for you to say it's better than the way that I would say it and because you give permission to a whole gender of people who are the ones who most of the time are the most criticized for that for some reason it seems more acceptable for a man to have certain areas of his life spiking and that's what I say to there's at any given time different areas of your life are what I'd call spiking and take your attention and you're exactly right the way you even described it with your hands but it seems as if it's somewhat acceptable when a male does it and I want to overcook the pie here but it does seem like women take more criticism oftentimes or or maybe feel more guilt about certain areas spiking at any given time it's both like because I work I mean I work with all men and it's amazing to me how I even had a manager once asked me the question I think where it's spring training he was like oh how long you here I'm like oh like ten days I'm going around all the camps and he's like you have two kids and I was like how do you how do you do it how are you away and I was like how many kids do you have he was like two I'm like how do you do it you're here for three months like and I didn't mean it like and I know this person well it was just trying and he was just like oh like I'm like it's the saint your dad like a dad is just as important as a mom like we're parents right like it's not perfect but like 100% and there is guilt for sure that I throw on myself but 100% like I never see men even an interview user they never get asked like how do you be a dad and you're working like I've never even heard that question before I get it all the time yeah it's so true by the way judge yeah very very very compelling answer that's so true so there's this time your dream ended you're juggling multiple things at once you get into broadcasting through the softball space first right is that's how it ends up happening where you don't be humbly though I'm really curious because you said you weren't a good softball player at first right you had to work at that did this come more natural were you pretty good at this in the very beginning would you say I think I was just what surprised me because when I first got asked to audition because there was a need you know basically softball was exploding on television and they just needed more people I remember my agent called and I just started laughing and I was like you imagine a bike in front of me no filter like every fire first day like there's no way like and he's like just go and try like just it's not gonna hurt no one's watching it's an audition so I did and I flew out there and I was just so nervous I didn't understand I had called a few friends watched some games but that was about it show up Beth Moans who's now my broadcast partner like for life on softball had flown in for it never had met her before and we sat down and they show a game you know and we basically jump in on it I can't tell you how natural it felt so I can't say like I don't I don't have video of that early phase but I recognized right away oh I can do this okay it's like kicking it on the couch with your friends and stuff that I realized I was already doing like oh did you see her back foot like on that you know and that passion and excitement that just genuinely I have plus the like knowledge of being a coach's kid my whole life and and literally every night breaking down video what we did it's so weird to me but that's so cool that's awesome it's actually beautiful because it's part of this story that explains you like this work ethic and that extra stuff and the extra stuff and like it's what people need to hear it's like this is the true story of how you become special and you'll never I even were off cares like you just don't accept that you're when I say special I don't mean like someone else can't replicate it I mean like unique in that you've kept pushing past levels where most people said my will to wins over like okay I want that's enough and that's most people in life they do that eventually their will to win kind of gets bought do you know what I mean like that you can buy them with enough accolades or enough money or enough success or enough acknowledgement and the really unique people in life Alex is this way too is that there's no destination at which place they want to stop growing yeah their will is not for sale I hope that I think I'm that way there's a there's a screwed up I can speak for myself so I don't want to speak for you or Alex but there's there's a screwed up insecurity that comes with it yes and for me like that it's not like the best trait either like there's a part of me that just you know I've learned to be able to look myself in the mirror and see a strong athletic beautiful like all these positives but for a very long time there's that sense of like I'm not good enough I have to be better I got a work hard and I know now even in my own space like I have to work double triple as hard just to prove unfortunately that like I know you don't think I belong but I'm gonna kick your butt in like just proving by being great just that I'm prepared and that I'm saying my points and I'm I'm who I am I'm really glad you said that like I I'm loving this because I'm insecure too and most successful people I've had this insecurity that they're not good enough and it doesn't always come from just a place of confidence or identity like I have a really high identity so do you I have self-confidence self-confidence more like self-trust so I really trust myself but it doesn't mean I'm not insecure but I'm not measuring up yeah and I also think really successful people hold themselves as such a high standard that there's always this power that's pulling them to another place compared to where they are to where they know they could be yeah you know I'm saying and I think you have that but the way you became a baseball I mean you really got the seat as I understand the story this is another example sort of you had done some games but there's another example of an opportunity opened up and like you jumped and so we don't need to say who or what it was but isn't it accurate that there was somebody who had been suspended and other there was a role and if I'm wrong correct me and tell it the right way but part of it is someone had you ended up getting a shot for a very short window in the main seat because of an issue with somebody else and you seized the day sees the moment is that about right at that at some point I mean I would already yes and for Sunday night baseball right which is what I'm doing now and and you're right it was the timing of all of it because I had done my first ever national baseball game and it was kind of like hidden not that ESPN had hidden it was just the time of year was in August I was replacing so on an ESPN 2 on a Monday and it wasn't a great game at all as far as teams and markets so it was like yeah let's have your first game be on this like easier stage and that was on a Monday okay um the suspension happened on Wednesday and I got a call Thursday asking me to be on that Sunday night so I'd just done my first ever major league baseball game so the training wheels are off quick like like let's try this um and you had lots of on air time lots of softball time lots of lots of stuff and softball right and I covered baseball like I done features and more reporting yes um and I think for people that don't understand like the nuances of broadcasting reporting and being an analyst it all sounds the same but it's totally different okay and changing geography because I'd actually been an analyst for the men's college world series called baseball from the sideline so I was doing the same job but um Phil Orleans who's actually my coordinate producer my boss now he said the point to me um he's like I'd love for you to continue being an analyst but until we put you in the booth that geographical change of maybe 60 yards will change how people see you forever and I had never I was actually satisfied as long as I could get my content in of not I don't want to say just being a reporter but like really like breaking down swings and doing that I didn't care where I was I was gonna do it from the sideline yep and that was so accepted there because at the end of the day even if I was breaking down a swing per like oh yeah she's a female on the sideline that's where she belongs they've seen female silo pores in the NFL the NBA yeah that she can stay there that's good we're no matter what she's saying like as long as she's there we're good whoa yeah it's literally just going up the stairs and sitting in a booth that changed everything whoa so Monday you have to call Wednesday Thursday the suspension happened Wednesday Thursday they needed a replacement so I get a call and they still weren't even sure they were just kind of like we're thinking about using you and I'm like oh what's Sunday they're like oh like two days and I was like I need to fly somewhere and like for that Monday game ad just to give you like my nerdiness I probably prepared three and a half months for that one Monday game because I'd known I was doing it so I'd flown all over the country I'm out with the teams I was like okay I'm ready and I was like oh who's playing like what's going on like I just fly like and I live here in LA and it was a dodger home game against the Cubs and it was the game that Jake Arietta threw an O'Hitter which was the first ever no-hitter on Sunday baseball come on decades so God's it God's God is handed a little bit here then right like come on so your first day I go game is a no-hitter the only no-hitter to ever be on Sunday baseball that's so look at that my hairless arm has so amazing I didn't know that and so you step into that here's one of these things you said earlier there's a few of those moments in your life yes oh yeah this is one of them and I can remember that game and I like and you're so right with like they're being a hand for sure because I remember Buster only who's the reporter works on the game who I didn't know well at that point Sunday morning so I come in I you know I live in LA I know the Dodgers like thank goodness and I'm offensive-minded so I'm all about hitting so I came in with like tons of Dodgers tons of hitting yeah so you know what happens for those that don't understand what a no-hitter is like there's no offense from the Dodgers being attacked the game but that oh no Saturday had come over to the game and Buster introduced me to Jake Arietta who was gonna be the pitcher for the Cubs it was gonna obviously know none of us know this at the time and just inter just walked over recognized that this is her first day on the job she knows nobody let me just be a good dude really and introduce her to the starting pitcher tomorrow because that'll probably just help for a little bit he introduces me kind of breaks the ice to like I've never met Jake and I'm nervous and plus you're in a clubhouse it's just a you know different environment and the next day I know Jake and I start talking he's super I mean him and I clicked right away because he I mean his brain is understanding of his body we end up talking for 45 minutes I got more information on JK area than I could ever and I even write anything down it was just like you connect with some you use it during the game well then that's what allowed me it's all you have right that's what your stuff was yeah but I would have gone in with just like Dodgers offense like yes nothing there no hits yeah and instead I could dive into Jake because I just spoken him the day before about just like how he throws a slider why he gets his body into certain positions and it was like amazing stuff you guys have their sense of this is the first time Sunday night baseball right like it's and you you step in here and it's a dagum no hitter it's like history making game but you crushed you crushed and what what happens from there because guys in the history of the sport there's been one female to sit in house what happens to be a Latina by the way who sits in that seat right what happens like do they do you do another one and then another one they're like hey we think you're gonna come back or what what happens well it was just supposed to be the game and then um the suspension ended up yeah getting worse right um and so it ended up getting carrying out to the rest of the regular season but it was just supposed to be the one game and then it just it kept it literally like it was crazy because it was like okay like that was awesome now i'm gonna go back to like you know and the amount of media that came after that was incredible just because it was a no hitter so there's so many people like finally tuning in they're like wait is that a woman's voice like so just the like all these events happening and then they kept me on for them and this was early September by this point so it was another like four or five games it wasn't like a ton yeah but i got to finish off the season and then do um our wild card game which is the first post season game post season game too that year yeah it's after jenkeys okay um and then they asked me to come back and they signed me on to continue and i'm going into year four that's unreal and i gotta tell you i told you we met in a gym by the way in st louis through allux and i told you this when we met and i'm not i i mean this it's like perfect that i saw you in a gym because you know just like blended right i didn't had no idea and then here you are in a gym because you're so bop i was just like you're like a fixture of like the that's really whatever whatever they started to go kissing his biceps and i was like well once you guys went to that yoga room like i gotta go i know i thought you were gonna do the workout with us i left her in the yoga but i got to tell you i told you this then and i say this to you now i uh i was a broadcast major i have a show i also played baseball and i think you're incredible at what you do um you are my favorite broadcaster and whether you are a man or a woman and the reason is is that your content preparations off the charts but people that are great at something bring up particular energy to it and this is a lesson for everybody watching this no matter what you do influences energy persuasion is energy attraction is energy and there's you have the ability to transfer energy through a camera visually you also do it with your voice i think you're unbelievable at what you do and also the way you break down the game is obviously very scientific but you're incredible what you do whether you were a male or a female i just think you're excellent i just want to tell you that thank you you really are and i enjoy watching you and i watched you for so long and then obviously it morphs into just a couple questions about this too because now it's changed the dynamic now now there's like three of you in this box now right there's three people in there then sitting next you is one of now one of the five greatest people i think ever to then you could argue even the best but certainly in the top five ever to actually play that sport yeah how did that impact you at all i'm wondering that dynamic of working with Alex the fact that he was such an incredible player did that cause any thoughts changes the way you delivered things anything like that i mean so who had worked previously with was erin boone who was a hitter wasn't nearly the hitter obviously of Alex but was often something i didn't work with the pitcher so it is now also by the way the manager of the Yankees is now the manager of the Yankees and so that was like for him for erin and i like learning how when we're both hitting minded more so neither one of us or pitcher to kind of figure out that balance and we would talk and kind of to be honest like you just get to know what gets people excited because what it were a team so what's going to make a great broadcast like i could i could say the perfect thing Alex would say the perfect thing but if we're not all on the same page and matt veskersian who's our play by play it doesn't make for a good broadcast so what what's going to get you like what what so that was my thing with Alex was finding out what gets you excited like obviously we know how how your records everything you were as a player but then there's this whole knowledge side to him that you recognize which you don't see a lot in super talented players because i mean let's be real they're five years old and they just can hit they never really learn exactly right it's why many of them make the worst coaches yes they can't teach because they're just like just do it exactly that's what i did right exactly um Alex is the exact opposite like he not only is incredibly talented but then he does his his homework and his research and just understands and dives in and just it's endless like the amount of knowledge that he wants to learn um and even as a broadcaster now so what was interesting and what we had to learn was just like okay what what gets i never wanted to to let to step on him i wanted him to like our broadcast to make sure people someone has a home run like i realize this and as much as we can say like i'm great at all these things like i want to hear from Alex someone he thought you know because he's Alex like i want when we're breaking down like uh whatever it is anything honestly in the game i want to hear what Alex Rodriguez would do because that's i mean he's he's another level within the game that we're covering and i can read him now and feel his like body sitting next to me so i can tell when he's still thinking so okay i can jump in and he can always follow but then there's time and now like we you know we can tap and like yeah it's almost just like i got this you know i will always take a back seat to Alex with as far as when he is excited and he has that energy you talk about energy because when he does that i feel like he's one of the best broadcasters out there yeah there's team dynamics and everything that people are listening to here so it's like you can't just nobody wins in business or anything like solo there's people around you all the time one thing he tells me about you all the time is like you have no idea how hard this lady works and how prepared she is those are the things about you and then the other thing that he's told me is is like she always is thinking about how to put me in the best position to win and that's he this is what he says about you and that's a lesson for everyone with any company any business you have to be in a broadcast booth it's your work ethic it's your preparation and it's putting the people around you in the best position to win which you need to get credit for because not only you great on your own but you're great also and your knowledge level of the game is just through the roof but that also helps you like i just i don't know and this is playing team sports your whole entire life but like if you want to win i want to win and i'm competitive like it yeah i get it if it's me in arena like boxing match me versus you like there ain't no team like i'm kicking your butt like let's go yeah but when you're talking about success in pretty much anything you do even when you're working on a project it takes a team raising children and not just my husband and i i mean we got like lots of people that help us and support us like and i've learned that like i can't do it myself and i learned that as a teammate like when i played on teams where i could be the best hitter the best athlete hit a home run every time and we lose i don't want to lose i love that i want to win so you win by figuring out your teammates because of the role you're in not everyone's going to love you you've got haters yeah and detractors right how do you deal with that because people out there have them too if you're going to do anything great in your life get ready someone's coming at you do you not care does it bother you what do you do with it i mean i don't know like i i guess i'd love to sit here and be like does bother me screw all you haters like i think i tried that for a little bit um that they do they get to you and not all of them i mean i've changed my relationship with like social media not reading because you talk about you focus on the losses i also focus on the negative like people could come and say overly positive things over and over and over and i just i gloss over it i read it but i i don't let it sink in someone comes at me with something negative and i reread it and i reread it and it's like you know and i find out they have five followers or like you know and i'm like why am i focused in on this egg head because it's like not even a real avatar yeah i don't even know if you win you know and and here i am and they're gonna they're gonna affect my day they're gonna affect and my early early years like three years ago son and i baseball yeah back in the day a son and i baseball like i get on air and all of a sudden their words would come in my head like shut up you're not good enough shut up you didn't play shut up like and i would start talking and i would stop talking my goodness and that's when i realized just you got to stop like you got to figure out because they're not going away wow and so you can't let them affect the way that you go about doing what you do thank you for saying that i'm amazed that you said that what did you how did you do it i just i what i learned is so twitter is like the worst of them even though i i use twitter and i i love it for other reasons i don't look at my mentions for like 24 to 40 hours after a son and a baseball game because that's when they're strong and they're strong positive they're strong they everyone has a strong reaction of me yeah no one's just like oh it's unfortunately like no it's like oh it's a female no big deal right it's a big deal so everyone has some sort of reaction and so i just don't read them okay and when i come back on there it's died down if anyone has anything to say it's not like crazy um and if someone really wants to come up and say something to me to my face or i've found that that is always constructive like someone whoever has the balls to actually like come up to me and be like i didn't think you did a good job with it and i've had people come up and say that we can actually have a conversation right yeah and and to be honest i'm so relieved that because that means you listen to me yeah i mean half the time it's like oh you're all warm you're i'm like does anyone like you're me yeah right i know i'm a female i'm pretty sure bend this way for a while yeah thank you for making me realize my gender yeah um but it's it's literally when it's something that's like oh you you listen to me yeah because that i can take and we might even still disagree i might still argue i know his back foot was in that position but now we're having a real human conversation not an egg head i hate you go away i really appreciate you talking about it because i think people need to know that is part of what you face it's part of what everybody will face if they're going to do anything great in their life that's just different like if you're the first entrepreneur you're the first person trying to make six figures in the first person trying to go to college you know you're going to switch through a career your whole family thought you should be in but you do face that and so i've always wondered how because they affect me even it's really strange like i'm in this mental toughness position i'm supposed to be in and even yesterday there was a video out and someone made a criticism but i've also distinguished between you know what i think is legitimate criticism and just one of these blank avatars just hates people you know but i appreciate you but it's still like that's the thing is like and i've gotten better and i think our our skin gets thicker yeah over time yeah we get i mean i come from a sport and softball where everyone's pretty much like positive and maybe little things here and there but everyone's just lifting you up right and you uplifting you up so in the beginning it was it was hard yes like just hear like a lot of just and my thing is is like i don't know my husband makes fun of me because i'm very naive in that like i really believe like i don't know like there's something good and like everybody hey too and so when people it's not that it's more like i can feel their hatred and so i've said this i'm like i just want to sit down with them and be like why do you hate me why do you hate me and you can hate me after this right can we just talk about it but i felt i'm so angry yeah but what i found overall is that for the most part they and i don't mean this to hurt anybody's feelings they hate them like the time that takes to type something like that and by the way it always isn't more negative than positive because when you do something very well people aren't likely to go you did this very well it's usually you're going to get an overwhelming majority of the people who type something to you that's negative but typically they're projecting upon you something that's bothering them in their own life and i remind myself of that all the time and i actually try to help them if i'm going to respond i usually try to respond by helping them so but everybody listened to her everybody listened to her because that is one of the things when you're pioneering when you're trailblazing there's more of this than you can imagine with her and you deal with it very well the way you're dealing with it is your winning and so all of you that like how do i deal with it affects you got to win you're winning she's freaking winning like she just renewed she's so great at what she does you know the one percent of the people out there decide to type something obviously everybody else thinks you're going pretty damn good because you just renewed right and i think finding i was tested for the first time in my life since probably like high school when you're battling through like 50 like awkwardness like who am i like you know your insecurities are all-time high and then you know through my life i found this very confident like i'm like i can kick ass in life like i'm gonna do this you know and i found this very confident person and all of a sudden when you think you got it like you know i was right back to being 15 again i know and so i had to like really look inside me and find out like why is this affecting me what about me what's what are the weaker parts and i had to get strong again i thought i was so strong and i appreciate i mean all my whole life before this all i did was speak to young girls about like being an Olympic athlete and finding strength and standing out and here i am not even listening to my own words and so that like it was like a slap in the face of like how do i how do i find that strong person again that apparently i've been not faking but like thinking this whole time like i'm so strong and then one person comes or not one person but i know what you mean and they come and attack you next day i know i'm like oh wow and i start doubting myself and i'm stopping in the middle of a broadcast what i'm saying because i've heard so many people tell me to shut up and so i'm like you know what i need and i i really had to find myself again and i i'd lost her like i don't know you know i thought that she was always there but it was actually kind of cool because i thought once you graduate high school all the awkwardness of like figuring all that stuff out but income at any age and i learned that and i there's a lot of reasons why we did today but for me like this is the reason because it's interesting this is so good for everyone to hear like they're listening in on me and you on this but i'm in the space so of teaching people how to win and be mentally tough and change their confidence and their identity and all these things but talking about it forever typically in front of favorable audiences all the time right and i was that insecure shy very unconfident young guy too and it's amazing even the way that you worded it that dude's still there and i didn't know he was still there until i went in this and i got some criticism for a thing or two here and i i should say even me that sounds arrogant but i went back like oh i maybe i maybe i don't want to do this that's not worth it you know and i went back to that guy for while too i'm like oh you've been like full of shit for a while here like you aren't this completely strong studly completely have all the answers guy exactly the same thing and i had to kind of rediscover that in myself too like i need to practice what i'm preaching and i think for everyone to know this there's going to be moments where you do step back that i don't think that dude like completely ever goes away from who i used to be no and you have to work like hell to keep him away like once you think he's away he's still there or she's still there so but it makes you human like that's what i realize is like i'd be talking to these girls and i've learned the more i share that that i say there's times i look myself in the mirror and i don't see what i want i don't see i see all the things that i could be doing better and and it's real it's relatable and so then i have to find that strength now every day like i got to figure out and it's easy to have the cover you know because i i do i am a strong person yep that person is there but there are also is the other yes and it isn't until the haters come out or even honestly my own girl and criticism yourself me too like that's actually what comes out the most me too my own little twitter handle in my head no me too it's the worst one i gave a speech a while ago that wasn't good by my standards yeah front of a lot of people maybe like 30 000 people and these guys filmed me afterwards on my jet and i i think i almost look like the verge of tears you know like how do you feel like you did today i said honestly terrible you know and it's that's i'm back to that guy again but i actually think it's a little bit healthy like you said because it's i'm looking for improvement in me when i do those things so really really grateful that you that you shared that with everybody because everyone's going through that and you go through it to a large extent so i'm glad that you said it that way a couple more things then yeah um you got a book yeah it's right here it's been here the whole time hi book hi book so what is there's no base like home you and your sister wrote this book right who's it for and what is it about talking about a busy woman so it came out this year um and oh my gosh i never realized me you know like writing a book i don't know what i thought like oh yeah i'm sure yeah it took years yes and thank i mean honestly my sister wasn't a part of it at first um it was just me um they were gonna kind of like get like a ghostwriter that kind of helps navigate you and i just you know struggling to get through it because every my life had changed all this stuff was happening and then they decided you know what your sister who's she's 11th grade english teacher alana to san and they're like she ever written anything i'm like no like what if you guys did this together i mean the book was always about two softball sisters too okay basically girls growing up trying to navigate um everything right trying to navigate life trying to navigate um cultural you know there's a definitely a little bit of the Hispanic but it doesn't it's not even the Hispanics more of just like your family that all you've known but now you're you're getting pressured by friends to believe and think other things um you know and then the sport aspect which is what i love because it's got the softball in there but then two sisters and so they're right this with my sister oh cool and even though it's it's definitely a fiction it it is my family really and it just turned out that way based in truth the stories there i mean i cried when i finished it it was really cool because my dad and we had talked about my father earlier um when my dad who doesn't read books no offense dad which doesn't read books when he read this book i mean he he got emotional he did and it's because i mean even the illustrations like he's told he's got a big fumanshew mustache big mexican like and so even the illustrator like nailed it really getting his idea but yeah it's it's our family um but there's so much reality in there okay who should read it what age would you say i mean it's geared towards eight to 12 year olds um but i i don't know i i have so many i have so many people that have read it like honestly women that i'm friends with they've gone and read the book and you know it it it just dives into so many different things and like i said you might think it's eight to 12 year old stuff it's adult stuff too i mean we wrote it as adults with the the mindset of what was like then but it definitely i felt myself get in here and just how you kind of battle and find yourself not so so like you know but it really is a constant and what we talked about a constant battle and just getting back to like being different like and you said that you said special like what was special my thing is like everyone has something about them that's different it's right and and like it comes in all these different forms but we're so pressured and i feel like i can only speak as women but to fit in you know to look like everyone else to act like everyone else to have the cool like whatever it is to fit in yeah but standing out is where it's at yes and standing out is literally finding the things that make you different and owning them and waving that flag and being like this is who i am i already know where you're going to be eventually just so you know like this is the space you're going to be in eventually because that your stuff is so good and it's so true and the people that i know that are the happiest and most successful are the most self-aware and that's what you are and that's what we're talking about today it's about being self-aware but the things that you're strong at your struggles the the little girl that's still in there you're just a very self-aware woman and that's why you're so powerful how do they how do they find the book like now i want one you told me there's one here for me somewhere yes i know i know i know these books sounds like my son's version like this is your son's version what's cool is he bookmarked like so all these pages he like bent the pages oh wow so that he goes back and he like reads them his name is in here too so he loves that but i went and read it at a school and so he's got like 17 pages that's so cool earmark so if someone comes over and they ask him he has like well this is my favorite part this is my favorite part and wonderful how do they get it with you in amazon amazon um but like indie bookstores okay but yeah all the all the usual spots congratulations thank you yeah we'll put it on my instagram too we'll promote it for you so a couple more things real quick because we're i'm taking up a bunch of your time do you have a mentor i'm just curious uh i mean i have a lot i mean i honestly like i mean listening to you talk you could put in mentor in a bunch of different ways there's probably people that you continuously go back to but i find that like i love learning from people like the reason i got excited about this is that i started to really learn about you oh thank you no but like the more you can surround yourself with people they're like saying the things that you want to hear in yourself like that to me is like that's how mentorship happens just surrounding yourself and it i mean even when i was younger i i would literally gravitate to the varsity high school short stuff um julie borture like i would literally fall over around everywhere and she was like my i mean idol it was a local person yeah it was a 12 year old girl yeah she was going to college she had a four-way scholarship like she was big time and i i tried to emulate and learn and figure out who she was one of the coolest things in life if everyone has experience is to turn a couple of your heroes into your friends it's like the most miraculous amazing experience you know i'm conscious of that myself is like if i'm ever that role for somebody i always want to be available and accessible to people that are that's why we do this right here what we're doing so what would you say to somebody even though you wouldn't acknowledge any of that someone says hey i want to turn my life around it's not where i want it i want it better i want to make my dreams happen is there any advice you would give to somebody man or woman who they go i watch the whole show i'm fascinated like what would what steps or any advice at all tactic thought idea would you give me to improve my life i think it's it's like literally and you touched on this earlier but like finding what makes you different um and i see that i knew in your work um is is you're not afraid to put out there like the real the unique world i mean we're all different we all are and i think what people are craving now more than ever is is finding out so if you're whatever it is you know that you're you're in whatever age you are wherever point you are in your life whether it's it's personal whether it's business is like figuring out who the heck you are and there's definitely something in there that's like i don't recognize this in anyone else and normally i think our instinct is be like okay push that by no like i don't know where you came from but like that's not gonna fit in this room don't fit in don't fit in just like totally stand out and when i think about standing out that's like what successful people do they stand out whether it's because they're smart in a certain way or but i really believe in the person and what allows you to continue that success is just to own whoever it is when you know everyone knows that part of you yes it walks into a room and is like this it ain't like any of you yes and just own that and you're gonna get some weird looks sometimes yeah people they're gonna be like she's a weird yes i kind of be okay with that too i love that because i it's gosh like i love that because i think through that gift you have is also where your purpose is and your passion so what you said is like i i wouldn't i could not answer that any better or differently like i honestly believe every human being was born with some unique blessing or gift or multiple ones to them it could be your communication skills your intensity your math skills nurturing humor beauty kindness listening skills but you have them and when you can just get quiet and allow yourself a little bit of credit go you know that's one thing i'm good at you know because people have this long list of stuff i'm not any good at this but you were born with a gift you were born with some blessings and one of the great joys of your life is when you discover that and then if you really want to be happy you take that gift and that blessing and you use it to towards doing good work for other people and now you've got a formula for being fulfilled and so and not just for them but like connecting with them and that's what you do is it's not just i want to use this for you it's like taking that and being like i'm going to use this so that we can just meet in this like way and then you take whatever you created there and you take that to the next level and you just you meet all these amazing people and then you end up like just spreading that whatever that is whatever you just found together yeah instead of just being like me giving this to you it's like no we're giving each other i think you just described you better than you described me i just i think that's literally what you've been doing all your life all the way from in the olympics walking over there to the arachia athlete all the way to the way you described your relationship in the in the booth with your family and then with the book and then here today i think you're amazing like i'm so really glad we did this i knew this was going to be really good from watching you and admiring you on tv then we met i knew it would be good and things alex said but this exceeded what i thought it would be today
