    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast Welcome in everybody to the clay Travis and bucksxton show we're going strong here in the second hour my me man clay on vacation he sends his regards missus all of you will be back with you on wednesday and Tucker Carlson Does a great show I go on the show once in a while. I'll always appreciate it when I get a chance to hang with Tucker there It's a great show on fox news And it's just always interesting and that's so rare these days in a media ecosystem that quite honestly on both sides is often a little bit Derivative people saying the same stuff the same talking points That's just the nature of the cable news business in particular, but certainly of commentary, right? But tucker show you never know what you're gonna get I watch that monologue Most nights I would say I watch the monologue most nights I've very little time to watch anything. I'm always prepping for this show and doing Things in in you know my day today, but as you all know if you watch it, it's just it's really worthwhile I bring it up because the new york times went With this fellow mr. Confessore of the new york times nicholas confessore He's a been in the game for a little while. He's a smarmy lib. I've seen him on twitter say things before I go God another smarmy lib. I don't even know I'm guessing he lives somewhere in brooklyn Because that's where the msnbc new york times crowd likes to be in new york city and He's written this this attempted takedown of tucker and that's great. He shared a photo Um, I shared a photo of him tucker shared a photo of himself laughing at it. I mean the whole thing is so absurd I read the argument. I was looking at this thing. Oh, you know, did did they find something that they're actually going to be able to make A thing of and it was pathetic the answer is no The answer is no, but that's not a surprise right? Why are they going after tucker because he's effective Understand this the left doesn't have good arguments right now. They're not going to try to persuade you they're going to try To verbally hopefully just verbally bludgeon you into submission Where that mask peasant pay those? Crazy taxes peasant use the words we tell you to or else Support the trans agenda for children or else they're they're wanting to use Cultural political and yes, just playing old-fashioned force To get you to comply To agree to celebrate whatever they tell you to And those who are effective at making arguments on the other side as tucker is those who draw a A audience to what they do that is growing An audience that in the case of uh, tucker crawls inside has a lot of democrats who actually watch which that Terrifies apostasy from The dnc is something that terrifies the left or once we start bringing over their people right? Oh my gosh can't allow that But you can tell how effective someone is by the nature of the ferocity of their enemies So talkers got all the right enemies You know same people i'll tell you right now same blibs in the media hate him hate me Same people in the media who uh who come after anybody who's effective anybody who has a platform a large platform They you know, it's a badge of honor. It really is It's a badge of honor when the left when the new york times tries to cancel you now It just shows that you are worthwhile in what you are doing and when People come after me come after others out there it shows Not that they're bad people who are lying to you or racist or sexist or homophobes or any of these things or transphobes or whatever That's actually not what what it shows Is that the left is terrified of people who are effective at making an argument that they have no real rejoinder to They didn't explain how tucker is wrong. They don't explain how i'm wrong And they certainly don't explain how Chris rufo is wrong because really what does chris rufo do now we're transitioning to the Trans agenda and whether they want to teach this stuff to your kids in school Because i try to approach everything i do with skepticism and let me hold that for a moment We'll come back i mean i try to approach every Initial assessment with the skepticism of could i be going too far am i getting to worked up on this issue is it exaggerated in my mind? And i think actually on the trans agenda for children i've learned that no no If anything i was too far in the other direction of hold on maybe we need to see more of this No, no i've seen enough i understand what's going on here Why is chris rufo so effective why are why is the libs of tick tock account so effective right now and therefore The look at what they're doing i mean taylor lorans of the washing post tries to do docs and destroy the libs of tick tock creator Uh The new york times front page trying to take down tucker and it's laughable i mean, you know, it's it's absurd It's it's sad at some level two that A newspaper that is has been around as long as the new york times is willing to debase itself so thoroughly but You know tucker knows that it's birdcade birdcage lining anyway, and we all do Um and it doesn't have any effect no no one reads that and says oh my gosh you mean you mean tucker wants secure borders and and thinks that maybe We shouldn't have a transit gender for children. I'm never watching his show again If you watch it you're saying they're saying what are they even talking about? New york times is a joke. It is a joke. They lie all the time by the way about a whole range of issues No ethics no decency no morality over there in any meaningful way Um, but rufo is being attacked viciously by the left chris rufo and he has a very He's really creating in essence part of a i think a political movement here of parental involvement of truth and education That is going to deliver just a Butt kicking to the democrats come out in the midterms and they know it So instead of of the usual which is where they just say oh it's he's lying It's not true. He doesn't have those things He brings the receipts So to speak he has the evidence the documentary often video or textual evidence of what the agenda is and that's why Left and i'm talking about now trying to get your kids to learn certain things in school that that any Rational parent would say why is that going on? I don't agree with that. That shouldn't be taught to my children's schools. Here is an education Uh specialist activist former us assistant secretary of education. So a product of the machine as you know, I Diane ravage Listen to how viciously This person attacks chris rufo and again. This is a badge of honor for chris He wants children to be taught as they were taught in 1776 When most black people were enslaved women had no rights and the aristocracy made all the decisions and had all the rights They even have the right to sexually abuse their young female slaves. They were indeed pedophiles As rufo might say those for the days little days So here's what I say Be well. Here's what I say. She's a liar She's a liar. That's just all slander But again Notice the viciousness of the tack the same way the viciousness of the of the tack against tucker The viciousness of the tack against rufo built on lies Chris doesn't advocate for any of that tucker is not a racist or a white nashos or any of those things But they they go after on the biggest platforms they can In the nastiest way to lie in the most vicious way I mean that what that woman said about rufo is just this is a crazy person talking like that's nothing to do with anything chris says He's never said that. I know his work. Well, I talked to chris many times interviewed him But just lies But you have to see it if you're going to be a warrior for the truth in this country right now You have to see it as a badge of honor when they come after you with Lies When they come after you to undermine not your work who you are as a human being They're trying to destroy you socially. This is the way they approach it because they're desperate There are arguments are weak look at that. Well, look at what's happened in uh in florida look at what's happened with governor Ron de santis. Oh, it's the don't say gay bill What no, it's not here's what the bill says here's what the people of florida actually think about it Here's actually what democrats buy polls and no one has disagreed that that's what the polling shows Think of the bill and here's what the bill actually does and it'll by the way now disney is getting a bit of a slap For it's rolling all of this Now what you're going to see increasingly I think is they're not just going to go after governor de santis in florida On issues of policy they're going to try to they're just going to go the smear machinery The smear machinery will get turned on with everything that they've got Remember they think that lies about people. They don't like our righteous That's how you have to understand the left that we are facing today. They don't mean like that education uh Activists what said about rufo like what the new york times front page is saying about tucker They think that lies about people they don't like are inherently righteous It doesn't matter you see whether it's true or not as irrelevant to the greater cause in their minds Of destroying anybody who stands in the way And this is not policed at all on their side You'll you'll notice that no one no one is calling out the the new york times from the left and saying Okay, I scratched that there are a couple of people But they happen to be people that you'll actually see occasionally go on fox and speak to conservatives right? I mean glenn greenwald was pointing out what The truth is of the new york times and this was in a in a tweet that he had over the weekend um that the Reality here is that the new york times writing 15 years ago The new york times writing 15 years ago that somebody was a racist bad person would have destroyed their career would have ruined them in public life Now it's it's a joke It's a joke because of how far the left has gone how much the machinery of destruction um is willing to Embrace lies is willing to embrace character assassination To say the most look at kavanagh Why did they do what they did against bread kavanagh because however they found A way they thought however the left the democrat party thought they could destroy somebody Um was justified on the circumstances no matter how crazy it was no matter how many lies were told no matter how many people came forward with totally implausible stories about kavanagh didn't matter Stop him. This is about power So the lie about tucker the lie about rufald they will lie about anybody the lie about the aims The lie about the words that they use doesn't matter that is what we were up against and i'm just telling you this so that you recognize It's going to get Uglier It's going to get uglier Going forward because they don't have good arguments They do not have the ability to actually explain to the american people why they want to do some of the things they do And i'm going to tell you right now some of the stuff on the on the indoctrination of trans youth that's coming out because now people are looking for it Left has a big problem friends. They've got a big problem. We'll talk about it in a minute I'm happy to welcome another new sponsor to this fast growing program We love this company what they're providing the name of the company may be new to you. It's called chock CH oq they provide daily supplements that have a positive impact on both energy and focused chock is their name My days are full like your own and i need to be focused and have the energy for the podcast radio program and my tv show on the first tv And that's a slow day for me chocks products have a positive impact on my energy and focus It's the purity and high potency of chock supplements that make them work so well for so many people And chock makes sure of that by having their products lab tested twice for purity by a third party The people at chock are patriots making it that much more of a pleasure to introduce them to you and talk about their great lineup of products Their seventh generation texans and their products are manufactured right there in texas Start by trying chocks male vitality stack that contains three natural supplements chock daily tonkat 100 and ashwagandha Online go to chock.com. That's chock c h o q dot com and use my name buck for 30 Percent off site wide remember you might choose to start with the male vitality stack Chock choq dot com use code buck. That's buck for 30 percent off I Welcome back to play and buck and I told you we talk a little bit about the situation of fertilizer Which I know it's you know wow wow we're talking fertilizer Um, but no, it's really important actually it means a lot as certainly anybody who listens any of the folks work in agriculture in the The farming communities listening to this cross country. No, I'm fertilizer big deal cost of fertilizer Can make or break ability of a farm to actually Keep farming right it's it's a big part of the cost Of of planting and producing crops. So when the cost goes up i've seen estimates high is 70 globally Um, which is what is either happening or expected to happen soon It's going to have a big impact now this should be A moment where the biden administration you'd say is trying to get ahead of things and prepare But notice this is a recurring theme whether it's about the price of gas the price of food the price of anything And the way that people are feeling economic anxiety They're struggling to pay bills. They're seeing the rise and the bills that they're already paying with all of that going on You have a a moment in time here Where you say to yourself, uh, are they really? Trying to use this as a pivot point into you know more green new deal anti, uh carbon emission Hold the train. You know instead of looking at the on oncoming Crisis in food production and the price of it and food shortages that's going to globally happen and here in america It probably means you're just going to have to pay a lot more for food here's what uh Samantha power remember she was a think us ambassador The united nations are the abom ministration very connected in democrat circles She you know wants people to figure out, you know composting not's going to make the the big change fertilizer shortages are real now Because russia's a big exporter of fertilizer and even though fertilizer is not sanctioned Less fertilizer is coming out of russia As a result We're working with countries to think about natural solutions like manure and compost And this may hasten transitions that would have been in the interest of farmers to make eventually anyway So never let a crisis go to waste But we really do need this financial support from the congress to be able to meet emergency food needs So we don't see the cascading deadly effects of russia's war extend into africa and beyond Transition really does does she think now i know anybody listening this i know we've got farmers listening right now Then the notion that you would transition to uh All all natural as in no no fertilizer only what manure and composting I don't think that's going to do it in terms of being able to have the same crop yields of the same quality and And speed that you would now i'm not a farmer, but i read about this stuff But notice that it's always an opportunity. I mean she even says in that interview. It's a crisis. That's an opportunity So the suffering that happens and this is something that i want To always have it i want you to always have this in mind The suffering that occurs from bad democrat policies is not meant to be it is not a A moment for self honesty and self reflection for the left. Wow We did something dumb. We should do less of that dumb thing So that people won't have to suffer as a result of our decisions They do things that make you suffer make you poor or make you less free And they say wow Given that you have less money now and things are harder for you. Let's really push something else Now you're more pliable now you're a more malleable subject for whatever else they're trying for now the crisis allows for the pushing Of policies that if you were feeling more secure again destabilized because of some of the very decision making that they push but if you were feeling more secure about thinking you'd say i don't Want to i don't want to do that Obviously they want to shake things up. I mean the best example of this Was what we saw with covid all of a sudden covid wasn't just about a virus It was about political fealty and it was about reshaping society. It was about achieving something of a reset Inability of the government to have more uh more of a bureaucratic control over your day-to-day life that anybody had anticipated before that Now think about all the things we were told to do And if you didn't obey the force of the state was behind it You know remember they're arresting paddleboarders out on the ocean shutting down playgrounds Closing them off with uh with chains and locks They want to be able to do that again Soring inflation is pushing the fed to raise rates again this month's yo-yo month Yes, that means there's an interest rate hike coming to mortgage rates Take care of yourself your finances your investments do everything you can to come out ahead This includes spending less on interest payments whether it be your home loan credit cards or personal loans in fact Let american financing look at They're a family-owned lender not a bank but a lender that is known for its custom loan solutions They've got a no pressure approach to lending money I've worked with them for a couple of years now.

I happen to be on my way home saturday night This is just indicative. I think what's happening in cities all across the country On the way home and and there was a all the cop cars and it's clearly may i'm going on Somebody was stabbed to death right I drove past a daven busters and I apparently had just happened someone had been stabbed to death in a daven busters here in Times Square in New York City And you just want to know when is when is the tide going to turn and criminality going to become something that is On the decline instead of what we've seen which is just more and more violence and criminality all across all across the country in major cities We'll talk more about that come up in a few minutes. I I had been telling you though before I have my I have my moments where I say hold on a second are are they really trying to openly indoctrinate children into trans identity trans ideology gender identity issues As broadly as it's starting to feel like they are I know it's happening right but I I sit I sit back and I say We never want to get beyond what the truth is where the facts are So how much is this really going on? Where is it going on? And I happen to see Over uh, well actually just this this morning Discovery plus I didn't know until now that discovery even had a additional channel which unlike cn plus is apparently still going on discovery plus announced a new show Called generation drag here's some of the audio from the trailer How do I parent a child that wants to do drag? I never expected drag to be a part of our lives. These are problems. I never thought I had to prepare for Do you think I'm not whatever one of them are just gonna do drag? How do I explain this to my child? She doesn't fully accept no Bella. It's important for kids to understand that they're not alone What is going on? This is from the discovery plus press release five teenagers prepare for their biggest drag performance in the new series generation drag premiering on discovery plus on june first I I mean You got teenage boys Who are all part of this? This show that's going to be showing people doing drag shows I've got to say this is just not okay There's something very wrong here. There's something very wrong with the mentality of a lot of adults that are engaged engaged in this Promoting this and doing this and I haven't been gotten into the school component of it, which is There's there's more on that as well But our children are sacred to us right all of our children you want our kids to be Obviously protected and safe and to be You know brought up and educated so that they can be Successful happy productive people And yet when you see what some of the left-wing agenda really is and this is why they hate rufo so much And why they lie about him and why they lie about other people that why they lie about the parental rights bill and governor ronda santis in florida and they make up these horrible things about them Um because when you see what's really going on normal rational reasonable people Uh step back from it and say what the heck is going on here What what is this? All about imagine for a moment there was a show That had I saw the trailer for this it's being shared all over social media. It looks like some of the the boys involved in these in these drag shows are I mean, I guess You know 12 11 something like that I mean imagine if there was a a show that was going to celebrate uh the very honestly over sexualized performances and dancing of uh 11-year-old 12-year-old females you would say this is out. I mean this is outrageous Right. This is what what's going on people say? Oh, it's not there's all this the the the way the dancing is done the way the whole thing It is It is not okay um, there's something really wrong here And I wonder why people seem to think that this in any way should be defended why it should be Uh, and I'm talking about people on the left nevermind conservative see this stuff and say to themselves What the heck is going on? But you have all these all these libs Who I I guess they're so used to operating in this realm of whatever Whatever they need to be a part of the in-group, you know, if it's where two masks there were where two masks if it's three Though where three you know if it's 15 shots to slow the spread sign me up for number 16 or whatever it is They'll go along with it Right if it's put up a square on your social media for BLM, you know, they do put up six Ukraine flags That's what they do They just do what The the next thing is that they're told to do by the people on the left by the institutions of the democrat party In the media and in the culture that tell them to do these things You sit there you say okay. Well, what about this? Shouldn't parents see this for what it is irrespective of their politics Shouldn't they have an understanding that this is just it's just inappropriate right? It's just not Something that a that a healthy society would be promoting Um, and yet this is on discovery plus This is supposed to be entertainment And I'm sure that even people who recognize that there's something wrong here Are gonna say to themselves. Well, I don't want to come out publicly against this I don't want to come out publicly against what's going on because I won't be part of the in-group anymore You know the the parents at my very progressive school will think that I'm a bigot a bad person And they might lie about you even as it remember though They'll lie about people in public life to destroy them. They'll lie about private citizens too who don't go along with this stuff We all know that can happen You can find yourself at the center of a social media pylon Even if you or aren't somebody who's on social media doesn't matter. They'll video you they'll attack you There was a driver. Don't ever forget this there was a A Latino American driver for I believe was a power company in california Fired from his job because his hand was hanging outside of his car door at a red light And some lunatic lib driving by thought that his hand looked like a white power symbol That actually happened So you have to remember that no matter who you are no matter where you are If they can come after you if they decide to come after you they will And so that has a tremendous effect even on things like this and and then as for the The way this plays out. Oh, by the way, just so you know I didn't put out the call numbered everything so that we wouldn't take calls, but we're having a little trouble in the phone lines right now Technology is a little bit of an issue. So I would say I want to open up and talk to parents right now We're hoping to get that fixed here shortly. So we're working on it but the Seattle times Uh pretty big paper. We've got a we've got a great radio station out in Seattle. The Seattle times Says that most Transphobia, this was a an op-ed. I think they published most transphobia stems from a lack of understanding Of what it means to be trans or gender queer Providing comprehensive education on gender identity to all students Can help to change that So I just want to be clear is the left's position that they aren't teaching trans and gender identity to children Or that they must teach it to children so that they're not trans phobic, which is the term that's not being used. It's a just a variation on big it, of course Which one is it? I think it would be so much easier It would be so much better for this discussion If the left could just decide what the argument is going to be Are are they arguing that we should or should not teach gender identity to five-year-olds? Because if you're looking what they've said about Florida, it certainly seems like they want five-year-old learning about gender identity Are we teaching 10-year-olds that uh that you know trans identity? Is something that many of them not only should consider or know of but should embrace Are schools pushing children toward that? Well, there there are shows where there are uh young you know teenagers Doing drag shows right now and people are are clapping for that and saying that that's normal at least some people are So what is the what is the actual argument? I just want to know if their claim is going to continue to be oh, that's not happening Or yes, it is and we're proud of it. It should it has to be one or the other it can't be both And look for them to try to hide the truth from you on all of this And then just to go on offense like I said because they don't have good arguments the better option for them is to attack To ruin people to lie about them to lie about what they've said to lie about what they stand for Uh because otherwise everyone's sitting around in America who's at least open To facts reason and persuasion will start to say Oh, so the left actually has lost its mind Do they really are crazy on some of these issues like there's something deeply wrong You know just because it's an american political party and ideology doesn't mean that it can't jump the shark My friends, you know there are plenty of times in our past in our history where one party the other party was deeply wrong deeply immoral Don't get into this. Oh, well, both sides have an argument. Sometimes both sides don't have an argument, you know There are sometimes in history, you know the party that wants to abolish slavery. They're the right party Right, they're right the party that is saying. Oh, no, we have a different view. It's not all we both have our opinions Sometimes one party is right. Sometimes one party is wrong And I think on these gender identity issues for children Uh, that's what you're seeing play out right now One side is right one side is wrong and there is a furious effort to try to obscure and attack and uh, just Hope the american people don't come to the obvious conclusion Clay and I are making a donation every month to ton of the towers foundation We really hope you can too a lot of you are making similar donations and we really applaud you for that This is an organization that has been supporting americas heroes and families ever since the tragedy and heartbreak of 9 11 some 20 years ago When a first responder or military service member doesn't come home and young children are left behind Ton of the towers pays off their mortgage to lift the financial burden and bring their family stability For severely injured veterans and first responders ton of the towers builds mortgage-free smart homes Enabling our most severely injured heroes to live more independent lives And now through operation home base ton of towers is gifting compact homes to homeless veterans Our nation's heroes people who put their lives in the line for our country and our communities need your help Help these heroes and their families Join ton of the towers on its mission to do good in their honor donate 11 dollars a month at t2t.org That's t the number two t dot org Playing buck show going strong here almost in the third hour thanks for spending your time with with me today Clay out on vacation Be back on Wednesday Nancy Pelosi Is uh just finish or just finished up a visit to ukraine and Pelosi's out there not somebody who I think Anyone who has paid attention to a political career would think has much to add to the strategy And the reality of what is going on over there. Uh, here is Pelosi Doing the usual the talking points the boilerplate Do not be bullied by bullies if they making threats you cannot back down That's my view of it that you you Were there for the fight and you cannot uh, you cannot fold to a boy Pelosi not exactly giving henry the fifth sing christians day speech there, but you know, I guess People are supposed to be very impressed that Pelosi would even show up there um, obviously the fighting seems to have Lessened dramatically around keve and so the violence there the threat there is much much lower in the east of the country it continues on he here's my concern and I I have a You know, cia analyst background. So I used to do a lot. I spent a lot of time reading about wars Iraq, afghanistan involved in the analysis and what was going on in those countries for for years of my life Uh, I don't speak to you that much. We don't speak to you that much about the ukraine situation because There are I think limits to what the us's involvement should be And I think there's a lot for a lot of people this this has become a an issue of their own Uh, and I don't I don't mean me in the media in general. It's an issue of their brand building. I think oh, I stand with ukraine I have eight ukraine flags in my facebook bio or twitter bio or something So I'm a I'm a good person and anybody who doesn't make a big show of their standing with ukraine is not as good a person as me Um, which I think is a lot. This is also you see this with the activist mentality in general An activist so much of what? When you listen to what they're they're saying What activists are really pushing for is for everyone to think they are a better person than other people They're not actually doing anything to help anybody but they want everybody to think that they are and they maybe want to take some donations in that process as well Um, here's policy. They're also telling zalenski in keve That we're going to be there with them until the v The very end We are visiting you To say thank you For your fight for freedom that we are on a frontier of freedom and that your fight Is a fight for every party And so our commitment is to be there for you until the fight is done This is a fight for everybody she says It is very interesting to me to see And I do believe this is a long-standing historical precedent Democrats are generally more interested in war when there's some concept of Uh, the you know the global good that is involved, right? If it's a human rights-based military intervention Republicans tend to be more interested in what is in the american and just although Neoconservatives and there's a whole debate we could have over how much they actually adhere to that Um, but I would just say on this or have we're successful in trying to achieve that Maybe a better way of saying it about the neocons I'd say this about polosi telling uh telling Zalenski that we'll be there to the very end. What does the very end look like here? What are we really Trying to achieve mawscow keep saying things That are very bellicose about what they will be willing to do if there's any real intervention now the by administration Because we deal in facts here in reality the by administration has not militarily convened yet and says they will not do so I hope they stay to that promise. I can't say that I'm 100 confident that that's the case not even close to 100 So that's what I worry about here. I also think that there's a lack of seriousness about what is the end of this conflict supposed to look like Obviously, we want the bombs and the bullets to stop Uh, but we don't we haven't had much discussion. There isn't much discussion about What would bring that to be and what what does uh, ukraine look like and and us Involve in both military and otherwise, you know, there was a A it's kind of a meme A social media post that went mega viral over the weekend That showed Downtown philadelphia with just just the worst kind of urban decay fires lit on the streets trash everywhere You know a bad scene and the the caption was pretty clear was democrats are sending 33 billion dollars to ukraine meanwhile Here's downtown philadelphia, which just had its highest ever murder rate recorded in the city last year I think that democrats are very comfortable Moralizing about ukraine and sending taxpayer dollars over there because it makes them feel like they're Good people who are on the right side of things and I certainly think the Ukrainians we stand with the Ukrainians in their fight against Russia in uh in rhetorical and material terms But what does the end of the conflict look like and how is the by administration trying to get us To get us there get closer to it. I just think that when you look at the foreign policy failures of joe biden and his team You look at afghanistan you look at everything they've done so far the inability to stop this war This is not the 18 Clay Travis and bucks exton on the front lines of truth"
