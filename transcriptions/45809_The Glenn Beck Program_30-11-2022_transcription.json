Was Jeffy respect for marriage act? Is that what it is? I think it's respect for marriage act. Yeah. Cause we didn't have it before. No. Okay. So we have to have it now. Okay. No. Well, we do know that many DC politicians don't seem to have respect for their own marriages. That's really kind of a more complicated story. We go into that today. We have, uh, we also Glenn talks about Marxism and how we need to understand that it's not just another movement. There's real evil behind many portions of it and we need to recognize that. And we talk about something much more evil than Marxism, the movie Avatar, and why, why it's coming out again. Why are we getting a sequel? Why is it coming out again? This one is the way of water. The one before. The way of what a terrible title. The way that if you can't, I will say this, if you can't figure out what the movie is going to do and have happen, you probably shouldn't go. Yeah. Okay. It's that obvious. It's that obvious. I just hope it bombs. It's not going to. I don't really want it to look. We're, we're Earthlings and we want the on obtaining. And we're going to do what we have to do to get the on obtaining. Okay. That's what happened. Our country deserves to be destroyed if we make this the number one movie in America. All right. Here's the podcast. You're listening to the best of the event. Welcome to the Glenn Beck program. Glad that you're here. Thank you so much for listening. Hey, some good news. San Francisco, the board of supervisors did finally approve the proposal that would authorize the San Francisco police department to use robots as a deadly force option. So I think that's I mean, good news. Oh, that's good news. That's great news. That we're reimagining the police. I didn't imagine them being robots. Did you? No, no. I mean, and I say that from the very spot and the old Paramount movie lot that where Robocop was made. Yeah. So we got that right down the hall. Yeah. Right. It's fantastic. It's amazing. I heard a lengthy report this morning that apparently, and this is going to shock you guys. You're going to be stunned by it and you're going to have no explanation as to why it's occurring. I'm pretty sure that's an accurate statement. We're both going to. Yeah. Yeah. I just fall over. Okay. I'm concerned over it. But okay. The report was that apparently big cities are having trouble maintaining police forces. Shut up. Wait. Apparently, many of these individual police officers are thinking they don't no longer want to be police officers. Okay. So wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Yeah. Are you saying that the the movement to destroy the police officers in the country, the movement that was heralded by Silicon Valley and Big Tech and Washington DC and Washington DC, they they're in Silicon Valley have an idea of how to replace those police officers. Now, apparently, they want to hire robots to do it. Well, those will be much more fair. Yeah. Oh, yeah. They're perfect. Yeah. Oh, yeah. This is what happened in RoboCop. Yeah. Exactly. The robots always act perfectly. Our cops so sensitive that they don't like it when people want to take away their money and you know, any kind of safety measures that they now have. And they're always under question. Yeah. And they're being, I don't know, shot in a lot of times. And they want to they want to leave now? Yeah. Well, actually, that was not the reason given for most of the report. In fact, most of the report was some of them just found better jobs. Oh, yeah. So it was legitimately for centuries. Some of them just, you know, are going to be IT people. Huh? This is the report. Wait, wait. I tee people. Eventually they did get to what I think might be the main cause was, you know, the 2020 protests into defund the police was kind of maybe the reason. And I have friends who did this, police officers who were in the police force and saw this happen. We're just like, what am I doing with my life? I know. Yeah. I know. Yeah. I know. They just said, I got to be an IT person. Oh, I got to get into IT right now. I have to tell you that I mean, you know, they they have to have, you know, the cameras on their vest and then the cameras can be, you know, rushed to the media. I mean, unless you're Pelosi, but that that camera footage of your vest, what now will have robots that will be able to record everything from their visor face. And it'll be so much better because they'd automatically erase the tape if you're at Pelosi's house. Oh, that's nice. That's much better. Still won't give it. And if you question, it might kill you. No, well, to be fair, they are saying they are not going to be carrying firearms. They just be carrying explosives. Explosives. Explosives. I think I'd rather have a firearm. What are you carrying? What is this? Like the roadrunner? Just throw a stick of dynamite, you're, well, I mean, what is that? Acme is the producer of these robo I Robocops. I wouldn't doubt it. I wouldn't doubt it. Speaking of Robocop and the movie Robocop, there is another movie that is coming out and at least all three of us in this room agree. We don't get it. And I think we might be alone because it's the biggest movie of all time. It's Avatar from James Cameron, the way of water. What an enticing title. Oh, I'm on the edge of what is the way of water? Could it be wet? I can't wait to find out in a 16 hour cartoon. No, wait a minute. We did see that in Titanic, the way of water. Yeah. This is all this guy does and keeps making water moves. So I watched the first one. I've only seen it once. I saw it at home and don't tell me, oh, it's better on the big screen. Shut up. It's not. It's a bad movie. It's terrible. I didn't get it at all. It was so anti-human. Yeah, anti-military, anti-human. Okay, you got blue people that are tall and skinny running around. Big eyes. Yeah. Okay. It had very little storyline to it. It was not compelling in any way. No, I don't hear anybody clamoring for four more. Name a character from it. Name one. No idea. Kate, can you name a character from, I don't know, the other big movie Star Wars? Did any characters come to mind? Maybe one. Maybe one. Even Titanic. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Jack, right? Jack and Rose. Yeah. I mean, I get it. It's very little to do with why people went to go see Titanic. They went to go see the boat sink. Yes. But you can remember at least even that. I mean, movies that make this much money typically are iconic. There's moments where you're like, oh my gosh, remember when X, Y, and Z? They're all mean. Okay. Okay. Okay. So here's what I remember. I kind of remember the humans wanting to take fuel from their planet. That's the only thing I remember. I remember thinking, is this because they're raping the resources of the Blue People planet? Yeah. It thinks that's all I remember of the movie. Yeah. We generalize plotline had something to do with evil human beings and evil probably white capitalists who going around and stealing from these poor people, a peaceful one, beautiful blue people. And finally, they step up and defend themselves, right? It's essentially the Ewok storyline. Right? It's basically all it is. They took the return of the- Except I like the Ewoks. No, I know. They took the return of the Jedi storyline and then ruined it. The weakest of the original trilogy, they're like, what if we take the part there and then it turned it into a computer program, right? I mean, even the name Avatar, it's like a cheesy technical term that like an old person would think, well, let's use an internet term for the name of our movie, Avatar. It's just pathetic. Yeah. Was it the name of the planet or anything? What was the reason that Avatar was the name of that movie? I don't know. The only thing I could think of is when the movie came out, it was technologically advanced because they were basically making a- It was supposed to look really real, but it wasn't live action, right? It was like in the weird- In between area that was really impressive in what 2008 or 2009, whatever that movie came out, but like now, now, like what? So, what we've seen, like we're all now sick of CGI and no longer want to see it anymore. So I saw the, what is spirited? Did you see spirited yet? Did you say that? You know I did. We talked about it. Yeah. I loved it. So the Judy Densch part? I don't know if that was really Judy Densch or if it was- Or yes, CGI. Oh CGI? Because CGI is so good now, you have no idea what's real, what's not. This is not impressive technology anymore. And it looks, you know, you guys weren't big gamers, maybe growing up, but like there's that thing that they do in video games where things can look really realistic and yet people are walking around and it just doesn't look right. Yeah, there's, they don't look like uncanny valley, right? And it's like, it is like, it's that you even when you watch the preview, they don't look real, they don't look, they're moving a little bit strangely and it doesn't look natural. Oh, you're anti-alien. Sort of. Yeah. So do you know that aliens don't move that way? Have you ever been to the planet? It's a really good planet. It's a great point. It's got you. That's the avatars. It's a great point. And I know he has it. And they're spending billions of dollars betting on that point, which is incredible. And you know what? I think it will probably do well because it probably don't. I've never had a good explanation on why that movie is so popular. I've never met a soul who liked it. Well, nobody even talks about it. No one's like a non-issue because there's no for the biggest movie of all time. Yeah. It's like, you just said, you just said that nobody ever, there's no memes on it. There aren't any. No. I don't. No one references it. No. It's just a giant zilch of a movie that made a lot of money here. But a movie that had been erased for 40 years, let me just say, Mary's walking down the street in the snowstorm. Right. You know, that's it's a wonderful life. Go ahead. Mary. Mary. Mary. Don't you know me? Don't you know me, Mary? Okay. I mean, you can do that with your father. And you know, immediately. This is bigger. Yeah. And I don't know a single line from it. It's amazing. I've really, I've been looking at these movies, the biggest movies from years. I know, obviously the Avatar was the biggest movie in 2009. The ones, going back, Home Alone. You know, immediately. No, you could just do this. Right. Terminator two. You remember that. You remember the morphing scene, right? Yes. Yes. You know, Jurassic Park. Oh, I don't know what was that story about? Forest Gump. Yeah. Right. And that's a, that's a weird story to try to explain. Right. But you could do it. And everybody who comes here, because we have the park bench here in the studios and everybody, everybody wants to have their picture taken on the park bench. And they always say the same thing. Life was like a box of chocolates every single time. Right. Toy Story, right? Independence Day. I mean, Independence Day is not a movie that had like a, the test of time, all time classic movie, but you can still remember all sorts, the laser coming down. It's iconic. Remember all, Titanic saving private Ryan, Star Wars. Now again, Star Wars Episode One, which everyone agrees was bad. We all remember Jar Jar Binks. Yes. Right. Every single person remembers it. Yes. Does anyone remember one character from Avatar? It is a decade more recent. You gotta say something. It is almost like, maybe, did you see it in the theater? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, you did. Did you see it? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. That rules ethic. I thought maybe there was some hypnosis when you went to see it in a theater. Not in my theater anyway. There was some subsonic hypnosis where you're like, I love this movie. Right. I'll never be able to tell you what it was about, but I love this movie. I look at Harry Potter, Spider-Man, Lord of the Rings, Shrek, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean. Right. Even that Spider-Man, again, another Spider-Man, the Dark Knight, right? Like people remember this. Then Avatar, which no one remembers at all, Toy Story, Harry Potter, the Avengers, Hunger Games, American Sniper, which is an interesting one as far as the number one movie for a year that doesn't fit per se, but everyone kind of still remembers it. Star Wars, Star Wars, Black Panther, even Avengers 2020 is a bad one because bad boys for life was the number one movie because of the pandemic years. They can't use that one. But then Spider-Man and Top Gun Maverick. Right. Right. So wait a minute. What is it about we are going to run out of time? And let me take a quick break. And I just, I want an answer to this. What is the hero story? What is the thing that people watched? And I don't know the answer to this and went, oh, that's me. I see me in. I see me in Avatar. Yeah. Tell me. Tell me. Back in just a minute. This is the best of the Glenn Beck program. And we really want to thank you for listening. Mr. Daniel Horowitz. Welcome to the program. Hey, great to be back with you in these confusing times. Oh my gosh. Well, we are, we are, we are showing real respect for marriage in this act. Don't you think? You know, you know, it's funny even with the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, I believe there was never a time in history where the federal government ever technically prevented a state from adopting something like, let's say a gay marriage. And indeed under the defense of marriage act, which this repealed, eight or ten or so blue states did adopt a marriage. Right. The federal government never prevented states from defining marriage as they saw fit. Doma only defined it for federal purposes, the military, social security, immigration, things like that. Yet this bill gains states from defining marriage as a marriage. And I think what's so important here is the times we're living in, even if someone kind of evolves on that, as all these GOP senators said, over the last decade, the last couple years should give you pause. This is not even about Leviticus. This is more about Genesis. When you look at the broader transhumanist agenda, everything they do seems to lead to a result of depopulation, undermining the continuity of civilization. You now have 21% of Gen Z, according to Gallup, identifying as one of the alphabet soup stuff that can't procreate or won't procreate. That ain't natural, and that ain't good. And when the government makes it that it's an equal proposition, it's a 50 50 proposition. It's not even a biblical value issue anymore. This is straight up a continuity of civilization issue. This is why China reverse their one child policy. You cannot sustain anything at this level without procreation. We also see just there was a study out just this week that fertility rates for men way down all over the world. And now we are codifying in the way that Roe versus Wade did, where I don't get, honestly, I'm more libertarian on this where I don't really care. You want to get married fine. Just don't tell me what I have to do, and I'm not going to tell you where you have to get married. And the biggest thing on this is the fact that I think this is going to be used to start to discriminate against Christian organizations. Well, I mean, this has already been happening. So this thing kind of codifies bake the cake into civil rights and makes it a civil rights. And by the way, it's kind of funny at a time when all major corporations for public accommodations could collaborate with big government to box out people from the entire society, getting organs, getting a job, getting anything on account of not getting Pfizer stuff. But somehow, Bob shop, a cake shop, he has to service this, not just the person, but the event, even though there's 50 other places within five miles, they'll probably give the guy a discount and will champion it. I mean, that's what this is all about. It's about destroying the continuity of civilization. Because you're right, a lot of people I think kind of said, yeah, there's a couple people here and there. This is what they want, whatever. I don't care. It doesn't affect my marriage. But what I'm telling people is when you see the results since Obergerfeld, I did the math with Gallup's poll and the exit polling this past election actually seems to hone in on the same numbers. The amount of people identifying as one of these things grew 27% in one year. That is crazy. And that is not. That is all social media and all propaganda. You don't go here that is. People born before 1946. 0.8% said they were gay. Baby Boomers 2.6, Generation X 4.2, Millennials 10.5 and Generation Z 20.8. Come on. And it's growing every year. And my question is, how much is enough 30, 50, 60? Again, I mean, this is nothing to even do with religious arguments. You could be a San Francisco Bethout guy, but someone's got to do the pro-creating and think about the millions of people that takes out of the pro-creation business. And the notion that somehow Republicans thought that this needed further strengthening, that there wasn't enough momentum behind it, is absurd. But Glenn, it's worse than just the 12 names. It's the fact that all but a few of them were fine with it. McConnell and Thune, the leaders, they didn't whip against it. They didn't speak out against it. They were hope yes, vote no. With the exception of Cruz Lee Langford, maybe one or two others, that was it. They were all fine with this. As they're all fine with every other issue, the Democrats want to screw us on, including the omnibus bill. They're working on some immigration stuff. This is never ending. So what is Mike Lee right with his amendment, which failed? Is he right that this is going to affect all kinds of organizations where you'll lose your tax exempt status or whatever? And you'll have to hire people that are different. And if you're in a Christian organization, you want to keep those values, you're not going to be able to keep those values. That's what he really feels strongly that this is going to just open everybody up. Well, I mean, the courts were doing this even before Congress codified it. So this puts an exclamation mark on it. Obviously, he laid down that marker, made it very clear, look, you want gay marriage? Here's a grand bargain. You get your thing permanently even forced red states to always reciprocate it, but religious liberty is untouchable. And yeah, I mean, these Republicans, except for Susan Collins, did vote for it, but it's a joke because then once it failed, they voted for the bill that didn't mean it. And at this point, I mean, they have some very narrow carve out for some nonprofits, but certainly for profit. So if you're a business like Masterpiece Cakeshop, you are totally unprotected by even their weak protections in there. So this again codifies that the only saving grace, I would say, is that possibly by Congress putting this in a statute, it might make it easier to hit at this in the courts and disqualified it as an unconstitutional violation of the 10th amendment, even though Obergefell was as well. But you know, the judges are kind of reluctant to reverse their own thing, even though the Dobbs opinion clearly does reverse it. But this is a new statute that they could invalidate. So I do think there is an angle there in the court. And so this makes if you're if you're a baker, this makes it pretty, pretty hard to say, I can't, I can't bake that, right? Your religious objection is gone now, legally. Exactly. I mean, the the the baker could say anyone working in the 115 degree room back there has to wear a mask and violate occupational safety law. But he cannot say, look, I'm just going to sit this one out. I don't want to bake for something, you know, with my handiwork, something that violates my conscience. Yeah, I mean, this is the society we live in. It's a new set of ethos. It's a new pagan pheocracy where we mandate gay marriage, we mandate Pfizer's whatever product they come out with next. They fight for their values. I mean, you got to give them credit. You listen to their speeches, they were passionate, they believed in it. Kirsten, cinema hugged one of the Republican senators. They're very passionate, pounding the lectern on it. On the Republican side, again, it's not just the 12. None of them fell strongly about it. And this is kind of that imbalance we see on every issue. They are fully peddled to the metal unified in their beliefs. And even on the most fundamental questions of our time, we can't get any sense of not just unanimity of opinion, but we can't even get a modicum of opposition. So what happens to the Republican Party if this is what they're going to be over the next two years? I mean, there's no passion to get out and defend these people. I mean, look at any major issue. What are they saying on biomedical tyranny, COVID fascism? Are you hearing a word about that? No. I mean, what are they saying on blocking the FBI from arresting political opponents? It's nothing. I've had to bite my tongue for quite a while with a lot of our colleagues, but the reality is the Republican Party has been a controlled opposition for a very long time. People are a little bit confused because there aren't only two parties. So once in a while, you have a good guy that happens to be a Republican because there's no other option, but at a leadership level, if they control the opposition and it's conservative, we need to pray and think and strategize hard. What we need to do, it's got to start certainly with local and state affairs, I think. Obviously, we need to focus more on, say, the state of Texas is legislative session more than we do on Congress at this point and try to maybe build back better to raise a line. Yeah, at a state level. That would make you clow Schwab. I just want to point that out. One last thing. Have you been reinstated at Twitter yet? No, I have not. And I don't want to prejudge this because it could be at any given time, but I will say it is kind of interesting that Dr. Malone, Dr. McCullough, none of the big, you know, medical freedom pay creates have been restated. And I find that kind of interesting. But you don't want to go any further than that. It could be a takes time, but again, it just is an interesting observation that anyone who has kicked off on account of medical freedom has not been reinstated. Although they do say they've taken away the new censorship on the COVID issue. So we will wait and see. Yeah, they did remove some policy, right? It was the COVID misinformation policy they suspended. Does that mean anything? Yeah, that doesn't just mean that they are. They're no longer putting a little things. This is missing. This may be misinformation. Right. Go to the CDC for the truth. No, I mean, that has improved. So that is definitely a step in the right direction. But I mean, it's kind of like a lesson with the Republican Party. You can't hope it gets done. You got to make sure it gets done. Although I don't think this is really our decision. But we can't put our trust in man. I mean, that is really the lesson. No one man is going to save us. No one platform is going to save us. It's kind of like starting a campfire. It's ground up and there's no silver bullet. And we just really have to assert our will in the states where a majority of people think like us and make it clear that these Republicans are persona non grata with the voters. So Daniel, have you been following the Balenciaga story? Sure. A little bit from afar. Okay. There is real evil that is going on. This this pedophilia stuff is just marching through. And this is something that if you would have said 10 years ago, all the next thing you're going to know, you're going to be, you know, pushing for the normalization of pedophilia, they got crazy on the left. How dare you say that? How dare you? That is just a conspiracy. There is never going to happen. And now it's happening. And I can't believe the number of people that are just dismissing this. Have any thoughts on this? You know, when when our founders identified self-evident truth in the declaration, they identified God as the source of those self-evident truths. And I have no other way of explaining this other than when you go away from that path, you're in outer space. I mean, there's no limit to where you can float. So people are like, well, you know, I think kind of homosexuality is kind of great. Let's get involved in that. And then those alphabet letters got added and added. And now it's like a whole litany of them. I wish we could make an editorial rule to bend that acronym here at the blaze. It's just it's ridiculous to use their parlance. But I will tell you the P will absolutely be added to it within the next few years, along with other letters as well. The P as in pedophile and sexual? Oh, okay. Well, yeah, I mean, you walk in there. There's an unlimited number of options. And that's the thing. The the the breaks are off this train. It was never about accommodating a few people that are kind of confused or in a rough situation or feeling need to love. It was always a concerted effort. Marxism's lead ship in its armada is cultural Marxism. Familiar ties. The family structure is the bulwark against a government. You can't have a country, a big government overbearing government. You can't have a country without faith and family. And they needed to destroy the former two in order to destroy the third one, the country and consolidate this support and make everyone just kind of this undrogynous AI bot with no lineage, no ties to anything but fully controlled by government. So again, like even more than I think it had it had its roots in moving away from the Judea Christian sounding of America. But now it's really every bit as much part of the transhumanist agenda, almost like the biomedical experimentation, more than even the classical licentious agenda that the left has been pushing, you know, since the sixties. And that's that's really what this is about. And again, notice everything. Everything seems to land in the population. The more you make people confused about right and wrong about basic human relationship, the less procreation you're going to get. And that somehow seems to coincidentally align with their biomedical agenda as well. I mean, it's amazing. You look at what's happening with Canada, where they're about to let somebody, you know, kill themselves, doctor assisted suicide, because he's very sick and can't afford his apartment anymore. And so the solution is, instead of making him homeless, let's kill him. That I mean, this is so malthuzian, all of it is so anti human. It's crazy. That's really what it is. It's anti human. This is not about liberal or conservative or even communism. Right. It's anti humanism. We've never faced this degree of a pagan theocracy before. And it's something we got to update to our pro life cause. Daniel Horowitz. Thank you so much. He is, by the way, the co author of rise of the fourth Reich. You want to know what happened with COVID and all the behind the scenes. This is a tremendous book. It'll be out soon, but you can pre order the rise of the fourth Reich. Now the best of the Glendbeck program. So the left has been talking for a long time. I should also mention it's Stu and Jeffy in for Glenn. Glenn did most of the show today and it was called out for a family emergency. So we asked you to keep him and his family in in your prayers today as he's dealing with some stuff on the home front that we hope he's going to be back here for his TV show tonight. Of course, it's Wednesday. So Glenn TV tonight on Belize TV fall right right before that is Stu does America. Oh, that's so long. Shockingly, at least for a couple more weeks. As far as I know, it's still on. We'll see. But yeah, make sure to we'll we'll give you updates here during the day on social media as to whether the show he had planned is going to be able to happen because I know he's in the middle of something. So we do appreciate your prayers and I know he does more than more than anybody. So thank you for that. I know the audience always steps up in these moments and it does such a great job. So thank you so much. We're talking about about our country though. And the left has been for years and years telling us that global warming is the greatest existential threat that exists in the world. Now it's interesting because they have a guy who built the largest electric car company in the world and they now hate him. They hate him poison because he lets people tweet. He's the worst person in the world because he allows people to put 240 characters out there that the left might not agree with. So the greatest existential threat screw that. Don't worry about that. Let's criticize Elon Musk and make him out to be the worst person in the world. But the other part of this, which has always been interesting to me, I think it's a really defining line in the environmental sort of debated movement is if you see an environmentalist who does not support nuclear power, you know they're not serious. You know that person is a fraud because if you say you care about global warming and you're going to say we should not use unlimited clean energy with no emissions and you don't think we should pursue that at all, you're obviously not making any sense. Either you want to you're part of the de-growth movement where you think you know we shouldn't pave paradise to put up a parking lot if you're one of those people or none of this is serious because you find out over and over and even solar and wind projects people don't want them in their backyard. They're killing some bird you've never heard of. They're wales. They're killing whales. They're killing whales. They're mails up on the northeast where there's these the right whales. I think they are. Really? They're putting windmills in the water. They're like no, no, we can't put them there. Sorry, there's right whales that swim by there. I'm not a an expert on the sea, but my understanding of offshore wind, the part that's in the water is really not doing a lot. It's just kind of it's just a pole. Yeah, but you never know. You know a whale swimming around bangs into it. Are these whales drunk? What do you mean they're just swimming around bashing the bulls? I never know. I guess you never know. So you wonder about our nuclear program because we have not we've had no nuclear power plants. I mean we're closing them down. We are now two or three generations behind when it comes to nuclear power plants. We have so much advanced technology. We're not even utilizing because people can't get these plants approved. Well, in comes the Biden administration and they want to make sure they're on it. The idea that you might be irradiated at any moment is put in the hands of someone very, very serious. In this particular case, Sam Brinton love they them. You love they they them Sam Brinton. Yeah, because Sam Brinton you might say who I don't know who Sam Brinton is. You may have seen the photo of Sam Brinton, which is notable for for some significant reasons. You might notice something a little different about always worse. I mean, always wears a fashionable dress. They I'm sorry they them. These stories drive me insane by the way because they all start off with his preferred pronouns. Are they them? So then the story continues with them. They right instead of he or she is just it really is hard to follow really is hard. There are times where I really can't understand what to stop and go. Okay, and we got it. It's not just me making fun of it. It's not me, you know, being a conservative saying this is wrong. We're just changing the definitions of words that we are conservative trait where you think words should mean things. No, it's like, I really don't know what's happening. Is there a group of people doing something or is one person just in one person because they are they've already prefaced it with a preferred they them. So we're just going to call them they them throughout the whole story. Even when it doesn't make any sense zero sense doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. So anyway, um, okay, so Sam, Sam Brinton, can you can you walk me through the Jeffy the as if I didn't understand the the sort of biological physics of this situation. Is this a someone who was born a man? Yeah, no, he's a male. Yeah, he's still a male. Yeah. So he doesn't identify as anything else. No, he just, you know, he identifies he as well. He likes to, he likes to call himself a pup handler. I'm sorry, a pup handler. What the is a pop handler? That's when that's when men who are gay like to be treated as dogs. So he, you know, handles the pop. So he is not necessarily the one who wants to be treated as a dog, although he's not opposed to that, but he usually is handling. So what we have here is a biological male who is still a male, but often dresses as a female. Yeah, non-binary. Yeah, it's non-binary and is gay as well. As far as I know. So we're layering all that on top and we're like, Hey, go deal with the nukes. Oh, yeah, he's really smart. He's got all kinds of degree. It does happen. It does happen with a lot of degrees. It's really a smart guy. And I forget what his whole title is there at the, he's spent nuclear rods. I think he might be reading a different part of his, forget it. Okay. So, so this person is in charge of spent nuclear. Yeah, whatever his job is. I mean, he went to MIT and he's really smart. He does have a really a big, big resume. But it's important to understand it's not just education when you're dealing with an important job like this. It's also stability is an issue, right? And I feel like there are some signs unrelated to the amount of makeup or dresses this person is wearing that might make you think he's not the right person for the job. Wow. Do you have any evidence that would support this thesis? Well, other than pup handling early on in his career, because I know he's big with, he also started, and I think he, I think he started the Trevor project too. He's big on that. Which is, which is spoken now. Yeah, which is a part of the teen suicide and LGBTQ suicide and issues that's, you know, a disc, by the way, we should be clear. Yes, discurgent. But now he's had the gig, right? He's got the gig of the Biden administration. And we find out that he has now been charged with felony theft. And you know, I mean, he's faces, I think the, he goes before the court in just the first December 16th, I think was the date that I remember right. And he could face, you know, prison time and a fine of like $10,000 because he stole some luggage at the Minneapolis airport. And he just decided, no, I don't know, I'm sure that you still have a Vera Bradley suitcase. You're gonna be surprised to hear I do not. I do not have a Vera Bradley suitcase. Really? Now does, does our hero in the story Sam Brinton have? Well, he has a Vera Bradley suitcase now because he stole it. And so it was, oh, it was worth like 2300 bucks. I mean, 2300 bucks for those two cases. I know that's why I thought you would have one. Well, that's me. Guy just spends on fashion. You know, that's, that's me. No. Wait, so, so he was. So he's at Minneapolis airport and he decides, I like that suitcase. I'm going to take it. And he does. And he walks away. He takes the tag off of it, walks out of the airport, walks out of the airport. So obviously, you know, instead of just looking the other way, the person who owned the $2300 piece of luggage said, Hey, I'm missing my luggage. Where is it? And they look back at the footage because they didn't have it. Well, who would know that they have cameras at airports everywhere? You know, I mean, who would who could possibly have that sort of indefinite knowledge? You would think of it. You would think of it. No, you would. In Minneapolis. Come on. Come on. Maybe New York, but not Minneapolis. So they look back at the footage and there he is taking the suitcase and taking the tags off. I mean, that's bad. So, so what was the, was the excuse? Oh, I thought it was my back, because that's a typical excuse for people who speak luggage. And just a helpful hand from me, Jeff Fisher chewing the fat, I'm here to help. When you take luggage, don't take the tags off. Just keep going. Just take the luggage and go. Are you getting tips on how to stay if you're going to do it? What you're doing? If you want to be good, now it's like, Oh, shoot, you're right. I just thought it was mine. I'm sorry. You're good. But if you're caught taking the tags off, then everyone knows. You knew it wasn't yours. Now, did Sam have a bag? Yeah. He did have a bag because I was, I was under the impression that maybe he was flying without a bag. I think he had his carry on. I think he had his carry on or another bag that he was picking up. If you have a carry on, you don't need to go to the luggage. Well, depot there and pick it up off the little fancy. But my understanding, I mean, this was just an extra, he went there and he decided that he liked that and he took it. Now, whether, you know, oh, I have not seen the footage. Minneapolis Airport has not released it to me. I wish they would. I'd be happy to look at it. So then the police call him and say, Hey, I mean, again, if you're listening on radio and you've never seen Sam Brinton, it's not like you'd miss him in a crowd, right? Like it's not like you'd say, okay, oh, that's a typical nuclear scientist. That's not me. Right. It's like, there's no way to deny that if you're Sam Brinton, that you are Sam Brinton. And he says, no, I still had my clothes, the suitcase that I grabbed had my clothes on it. And I didn't do a thing. And they were like, Oh, okay. And then he called back. Because at the airport, guys, he calls him back. Okay. And says, you know what? Oh my gosh. You know what? Maybe I did pick up the wrong suitcase. And the police go, but it's really strange because all I had was my clothes. I just had my clothes really because the hotel found all the clothes that were in the suitcase that belong to the other person in the hotel room after you left. I mean, this is really sloppy. Again, it's wrong to steal someone's luggage. However, if you're going to steal someone's luggage, the clothes in the hotel room, no, you had to dispose of those someplace else. And don't worry. You say, Hey, you should really dispose of that. Those clothes properly. This is the person in charge of disposed nuclear fuel. It just seems like maybe you give the job to anyone else, like Homer Simpson, you'd put a Homer in charge over this person. Like that would be a better choice. Really? And again, like, I will say you look at the resume of Sam Burton as far as like education goes and you can find that they are, I guess, qualified for this job. But are they the most qualified? Are they? Did you look at this person to say, Hey, this person's the most stable. He's going to represent us good. Right. It's like they keep doing this where they're putting people in positions of power. They solely on either their genitals or their skin color or which genitals they prefer interacting with. All of these bizarre qualifications that have nothing to do with job performance. It's how Corinne Jean Pierre, who was hired for all three of those reasons, it has this job where everyone knows she's terrible. Everyone. Everyone knows. This is the single worst person possible to do this job. She has no idea what she's talking about. She's constantly just reading. She can't defend these policies. Many of them to her credit are indefensible. I understand that. Well, she's got her great big book of everything. And it's just we're just going to read out of that. And that's what that's what she has. That's what she has. That's really what she does. Yeah, every day. She opens it up and she reads the most basic things that anyone should be able to know. And stumbles over that. And stumbles over that. Says doesn't know what the words are. That's it. Wraps up. Picks up her great big book of everything. And off she goes. It's good. This is how this happens. When you hire based on genitals, I mean, unless you're running a strip club, then maybe that's something, you know, maybe one of the things you want to think about. Well, you have to. Still, I don't know. Of course, you do. If you're running a strip, I shouldn't have brought that up in your present. There are some jobs, perhaps, where you should think of this. When you're talking about nuclear physics. No. Sam Britton going to do jail time, I doubt it. And they probably pay a fine and give the suitcase back and be fine. But when they tried to reach out to them, they realized, oh, he's on leave. He hasn't worked here. Oh, oh, he's been on leave for over a month now. What are you trying to get ahold of him for? Oh, oh, oh, okay. Maybe they've already realized this problem. Yeah, they were just way out of the job. The way for it to happen. Very interesting."
