    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast Welcome in our number three Wednesday edition. I hope all of you are having a fantastic day Wherever you may be across this great country or this great land I am Travis. He is Buck Sexton encourage you to go subscribe to the podcast You'll give us five stars help us ensure that march is the best month for listenership on this show ever um So much that we've already talked about encourage you to go listen to dr. Marty macarra macarrie He was fantastic in hour one. We're going to be joined by wisconsin senator ron johnson here in about a half hour uh to talk about the latest inside of the senate but Wanted to hit on a couple of different things off the top here in the third hour One and i'm going to circle back to this in just a sec Remember that controversial bill in florida where kindergarteners first graders second graders and third graders were not to be instructed in sex related issues because they were too young And everybody on social media was telling you all my goodness. Can you believe it? They tried to brand it? That don't say gay bill turns out pretty substantial portion of the american public Supports that bill want to talk about that mitt romney Uh, I mean voting against a mask mandate. We still need to tee off on him It's embarrassing. I feel bad for the people of utah that mit romney is still bowing down to the quote-unquote experts in the world of uh, covid and uh also How about New york city bucks hometown? This is a story that I think is going to get more and more attention If the players on the new york yankies or the new york metts are not vaccinated They are not allowed to play Outdoor baseball games in new york city we've been talking about kyrie Irving indoors for basketball And by the way, he scored 60 points in orlando last night, but this is next level crazy But let's start buck Down in the state of florida ronda santas. It was labeled. The don't say gay bill Uh, this morning. I'm reading as I get ready for the show buck and politico came out with a poll uh that 51% of american voters Support banning the teaching of sexual orientation and gender identity from kennigardner kindergarten through third grade 35% are opposed to this all right, um, this is pretty massive when you are in a 50 50 country And you find an issue that you're winning by 16 points Uh, it doesn't surprise me because we talked about this buck. I'm a parent talk to a lot of parents I don't know very many parents who believe kennigardner first second third graders should be being taught Substantially about sexual identity early sex at all Were you surprised by this politico finding and what does it continue to tell us? About how out of touch many journalists are who cover politics? Well, it's it's fascinating clay because it seemed like in the early days of this the Activists the lgbtq activists who were pushing for this to be Essentially slandered as they don't say gay bill. They came up with this phrase. It's like when you call something Uh, you just say it's not a it's not a wealth tax is the death tax right? This classic politics or wellie and changing of words Newspeak trying to figure out ways to move the needle one way or another based on the very specific words that you use So it seemed like this was under substantial under substantial pressure because All the press was asking to sand and what happened? I think like I think the activist would have been more successful With this one at the florida state level if it didn't turn into a club for the live media To start swinging at desantis with right away because what happened? Desantis unlike a lot of other republicans say oh, I'm I'm not I'm not anti-gay. Don't hate me Right, which you know, this has nothing to do with being anti-gay Ron desantis goes where is that in the bill right? Remember that audio? We played it for everybody Where is that show me where that is? Why are you calling? Why are you renaming a bill as a so-called journal is something that it is not so that you can attack the bill with something that is a lie And then when number and everyone goes oh wait hold on a second. They're attacking desantis on this now It's a national news story. This was gonna be clay. Let's be honest Who would even heard of the parental rights and education bill outside of florida? Across the very few people right maybe floridians it mattered too, but to rest the country was all right This is a florida state bill And now it's become a national cause and now you have people saying hold on a second What do you mean these left-wing activists? Are are upset that there's not gender identity instruction happening For first graders. I mean as I said before a first grader may say you know Um, you know one day. I want to be an astronaut and the next day I want to be a stegosaurus and you know you got to just like let kids be kids here We're gonna start teaching about this gender and gender queer Which is is another phrase that I had to learn recently. I didn't even know what this means Um and and all these other terms in terminology now you might say oh buck They won't really do that. They just had a school in san Antonio in the critical race race theory front Where they were saying uh they they were separating kids by hair color And the lightest kids by hair color were to be you know mistreated and told they were dumber and worse than the rest of the kids in the class To teach them about inequity in society these left-wing activist bureaucrats Are lunatics and when parents find out about this they go, um, no actually I just want what's parents By the way across across socio-economic and racial strata. They're just saying no I just want my kids to be you know learning how to spell and do math and behave themselves in class I don't want them being taught this particularly in the first and second grade The right once again has an opportunity here conservatives have an opportunity to not just be the party of parental rights and education To be the party of normal people. Yes, to be the party of You know, we're not crazy. Like what is this stuff? Buck I had a conversation with my wife recently where I said it disappoints me how few people can't jbn So she wouldn't what's jbn since my acronym just be normal Just be normal Normal parents do not want their kids to be taught sexual related instruction in kindergarten for second third grade And I got to give a lot of credit to ronda santis Because not only did he fight back as soon as this bill got attacked But but but he actually went to war with disney Do you remember that because disney tried to come out and say oh, we're gonna take pot shots at ronda santis and the state of florida And most of the time Politicians curl up in the fetal position and they try to avoid these battles But this is a great example of why I think ronda santis is being Way smarter than his critics because so often the blue check brigade members The blue check journos as you like to call them They don't have the sense of what the real world is like And as a result They think the real world is twitter which is where a lot of the media spends their time And if you live in new york or you live in california and you spend your time on social media You can convince yourself that things that are wildly unpopular in the real world Are normal or supported because if I guarantee you if you analyze twitter for the way that this bill was talked about You would think if you're just scrolling through oh my goodness everybody's opposed to this The reality is exactly the opposite you know twitter is a carnival funhouse mirror It isn't a reflection of the real world and when I see these data points It just makes me so angry that we still have so many people in positions of power Quickly reacting to whatever the story of the day is on twitter As if what those people are arguing in favor of is in any way representative of the nation as a whole And yet when you add this all together You have Yet again a moment where we can see a pathway to getting people who aren't You know aren't uh mobilized by the usual talking points about you know the the left or the right or whatever They're seeing with their own eyes The reality of the school system during the pandemic and also increasingly With the left wing bureaucracies that teach this Uh and as some my friend ryan grudusky we've had on the show before he always says they don't teach crt They actually practice crt meaning that they put kid through these exercises That are rooted in crt ideology without even explaining the critical race theory as what's behind it And they make them do things like the hair color. This was in a san antonia school by the way San Antonio folks right? I mean, you know, this is in texas or this is happening This is not san francisco or or in you know in new york ciano. Yeah, um and and so Going into this midterm election I think this is really important because where where did republicans beat expectations the last election in virginia They beat it with people who were mobilized because of what they'd seen in the school system In the school system and neck the next time around Yeah, there'll be people that'll see inflation and the open border and all those things the republican base Understands and I think independence understand what a disaster the biden regime is But we talk about this a lot clave you can mobilize Suburban moms to realize the republican party at least wants you to have a say and is not crazy When it comes to your child's education matters a lot matters a tremendous amount And by the way, should we tee off on met romney right here? Should we do it in the next second? Let's come back and and give are you as angry as I am about him voting in favor of mass mandates effectively Yeah, of course It's such a quizzling Romney maneuver and I look I will say it man. I still I cast a vote for him in 2012. I have still You know, I mean, I thought it was the best option I had but I at one point voted for that guy and you know I a lot of people listening did too. So before you start, you know 2012 we're talking about here folks But yeah, he's fallen quite a ways from I think what would have been back then or what he said he was back Then yes, clave. Let's let's get into this we come back on it in a second Hillsdale college is known for their lofty goals the number of undergrads and grad students on the hillsdale college campus Maybe limited a number but their goals are large and ambitious Case in point they challenged themselves to give away one million copies of our constitution and the declaration of independence this year They've got your copy already set aside for you get your free copy right now at clay and buck For hillsdale.com these two founding documents have made america the freest and most prosperous nation In human history and these days with so much of our liberty under threat It's more critical than ever for citizens to read and understand them take a minute today and do this for yourself It's free with no strings attached. This is what hillsdale college does they inform and educate go to clay and buck For hillsdale.com Right now complete a simple form and you'll get your very own copy through the mail for free One more time that's clay and buck for hillsdale.com Welcome back into the clay travis buck sexton show we've got senator ron johnson joining us in just a few minutes here Of a great state of wisconsin talk to us about What he thinks of biden's speech that we cover just a little bit of uh, we took some of it live earlier today Uh where he said they're going to send a lot more munitions to ukraine and we stand in spirit with the people of ukraine beyond that And put in his evil and that was pretty much where he left it Uh how does senator johnson think that's moving along and also we can ask him about this move in the senate To have a vote they they held a vote on the federal travel or transportation mask mandate Which is a lingering idiocy of fauciism and the covid lockdown madness that swept through this country for so long We were talking before we're looking for it. We may be able to find some audio remember folks when they were talking about The the urgent need to mobilize And this was the cdc pushing and these were the experts pushing it mobilize a million ventilators No one even stopped asked do we have the staff you need i cu nurses to run, you know, you're a train I want two million new icu nrbi a million ventilators what they're saying. Anyway, there was a lot of stuff That's right. And then we found out that being put on a ventilator was an absolute absolute last resort Wasn't even a really good idea for most of the patients who were being put on it A lot of them might have died because they were put on the ventilator too early in the process That's the truth folks but Not allowed to go back and look at what was wrong and what we did and I don't know just get ready for your 15th booster Because fizer says it'll be good for you, you know, it's ridiculous But Your federal mass man. It still exists. There was a vote clay a vote here where eight Senate democrats came along with the republicans uh and voted for the repeal of this or voted I should say to get rid of mass some planes And the only republican who voted Against this was mit romney who loves to walk around. This is a guy who is just in love with himself I mean, this is somebody who whether it's marching with blm because if there's somebody who cares about The violence against minorities in america particularly, you know in cities that have high crime rates mid romney is really he really knows what he's talking about um That was Ridiculous, but this actually i'm with you this actually makes me angry because his rationale for you What's the rationale that he officially said that we have to let the experts decide right? Yeah his rationale is And i'll read directly the quote mit romney just gave this quote Why was he the only republican to vote against overturning travel mask mandates? He said and i'm reading Uh, this is from manu raju who covers the capital I just think it's a mistake for politicians and congress to substitute our judgment on health matters for the people at the cdc So even when I agree with something I just think we should leave those things to the people who are health professionals as opposed to congress I know the cdc has lost a lot of credibility, but they still got a lot more credibility than congress Uh, so this is infuriating me Uh, and first of all we should point out like you did there eight different Uh guys who decided to vote in the senate who are democrats in favor of this the vote was 57 to 40 In favor of approving Uh to overturn the travel mask mandate Uh, not surprisingly buck a bunch of democrats who were up for re-election Suddenly are seeing the light on the stupidity of mask mandates Uh, Bennett's up for re-election in colorado. He voted yes quartes uh masto up for re-election in nivada. Yes Uh hassan up for re-election in new hamster. Yes kelly up for re-election in arizona Yes, then you got mansion rosin cinema and tester So romney voted no and said he wants to defer to the experts I can understand voting no in march of 2020 When we were all still in the early grips of kovid and you thought the experts might have knowledge that you didn't But my goodness. We can't hold these experts accountable Because they are not elected officials And so when they make poor decisions when fauci makes a poor decision, it's almost impossible to get rid of him We can hold our politicians accountable, which is why they can't just defer to experts particularly because experts have gotten so much Wrong even fauci the vile bureaucrat tyrant that he is Who no doubt is lost somewhere in the couch cushions of an msnbc green room? That's why we haven't seen it They won't even have him on now. Yeah, it's probably true. He's actually probably waiting outside Where why won't you bring me all two years since i've been seen days just throw the spread and fauci can't even Give me airtime, but it's worth noting that fauci was even saying all along He would say things like when they would make these pronouncements remember we'd have all these video teleconferences with the cdc You know my colleagues and I it was always this collective But really if you talk to anybody with any familiarity with the cdc It was basically fauci determining wolensky seconding and then you know Ever knoath the room nodding their heads, but they would never even fauci would never come out and say this was my call I made this call you're masking up your four-year-old like an abusive moron By order of the state because of me Anthony fauci. No is always the science remember he represented. I am the science he said at one point And so this is why look I understand people of utah I would be furious right now with mit romney over this vote and uh The fact that every other republican and even eight senators who are democrats are willing to support it To me is a pretty strong evidence of how much support we're gaining on a day-to-day basis for team reality I want to tell you though all about Norton lifelock irs coming up on april 18th extension Maybe but imagine how many of us are going to be dealing with cyber hackers as we come up on irs deadlond It's a great example of why you need online identity theft protection with our friends at norton lifelock Every day we put our information at risk on the internet in an instant a cyber criminal could steal what's yours?

They want to continue to control our lives And that's unfortunate But I think the vast majority of americans just want to pandemic over and move on there with their lives senator johnson It's buck. How do you think the biden administration is is handling you probably saw earlier today? The uh short speech he gave on the situation with ukraine There was the zalensky addressed to congress this morning Is biden right now put aside that we shouldn't have been you know that this war shouldn't have happened in the first place And we all agree it's terrible is the biden administration making the right moves right now. What would you want them to do differently? I think the fact that their presence of linsky felt he had to come before a joint session of congress and plead For the help he actually needs that the Ukrainian people actually need to defend themselves against the atrocity And war crimes of poutin. I think it's pretty well proof that biden is not doing what he should be doing You know, we should have obviously supplied them a lot more lethal defensive weaponry Before put never invaded ukraine. Well, we should have also done is taken a full inventory of what other military assets would be available should Putin invade like the sc 300 anti aircraft uh uh Sirse air missiles like the mig jets and we should have Got that into ukraine Quietly without anybody knowing it whatsoever and tell those missiles slammed into some russian jets But that's not what happened. We we In many debacle with the whole dispute over the mig jets, uh denying uh zalensky some I think Probably pretty helpful assets as we saw they they undertook an airstrike against a an airfield that Russia had taken over Listen, the Ukrainians are showing such courage and quite honestly skill Uh in in many places. They seem to be fighting a rush into a scan still there they're Initiating counter offenses right now. They need support Uh and unfortunately the biden administration has been slow to been dragged in supplying the support. It's it's really shameful Senator johnson how much are you concerned? There's been a lot of talk about the jets Uh and what exactly should happen with all of these jets and whether we should allow Uh, Ukrainian pilots to potentially come into germany and take these jets back into ukraine Should we and uh, where is the line? If if we are concerned where we move from providing support to engaging in some way in Direct conflict with russia in your mind Yeah, I think everybody uh agrees that we want to avoid direct conflict but providing them You know what's during the uh, nig jet that can knock down a jet or a sting or a missile that can do the same thing And we were providing them lethal defensive weaponry Nobody's contemplating the ukraine's going to use those for offensive operations into russia defend their their homeland their freedom their their families their children That's completely appropriate. You know one thing we're not talking enough about though Is providing information to the russian people We've seen some very courageous russians protesting that one News producer her her protest Um, we need russian the russian people to understand what putin is doing the best case scenario right now Is for the russian people to pose But in ruputin we need to do everything we can to get the russian people up to speed with what's actually happening because Let's face him. Putin is very effective at controlling the media So that's something we really ought to Triple quad joupler efforts to inform the russian people what's happening. They don't they don't support this war They don't really understand what's happening Speaking to senator ron johnson of wisconsin senator the fed is raising interest rates First time it's happened since 2018 a lot of us are looking at this Trajectory of the economy with you know biden year one in the books your two looks like it's going to be Really shaky folks are talking stagflation some are even talking recession. What do you see happening here? Well, i've been warning about stagflation for a while over a year Uh, i stopped voting for this this covid relief after the cares act because every time we vote for a new trillion dollar covid relief package We had a trillion left unspent from the previous Uh session i i started hearing from wisconsin businesses pretty early on that just like when i started my business in the early 80s when price increases were Expected and readily accepted and then 30 years is like point t getting a price increase Uh once we started opening up the the monetary spigots and just flooded the economy with trillions of dollars Uh, we were sparking inflation and so for at least over a year businesses once again our position where price increases are expected They're accepted of course. I think we're in a wage wage price spiral right now Where the wage gains people have enjoyed have been wiped out by inflation Uh, i just remember how incredibly difficult was to break that cycle and it required two people of enormous courage ronald ragan and paul voker to do that in the early 80s I'm not seeing a whole lot of courage here in washington c today. So i am highly concerned About not only inflation really harming american families, but stay inflation on top of that senator johnson we're coming up on obviously mid uh mid march and soon people including yourself and i encourage people Uh listening on our number one affiliate there where we're ranked the best best in the city and milwaukee to be supporting you Uh all over wisconsin as people are listening to us What is going to happen in your mind in congress between now and when everybody goes back and starts officially campaigning in the summer and the fall Season do you think we try to get that the biden administration does a tax increase? Do they try to break up some of the parts of build back better and pass that or do you think? By and large we're kind of not going to have a lot of activity in congress in terms of passing bills How do you read the tea leaves as a democratic strategy based on what you see on the hill right now? Well my concern is for whatever reason democrats always want to increase Caxes on the american public. You know president biden said that he was going to increase taxes Anybody making a less than 400 000 dollars, but it's important to note that inflation is The democrat tax on the middle class But there certainly seems a desire on the part of democrats to spend more money to tax the hard earned uh Fruit you know fruit free the labors of the american public and so i'm always concerned about that i've got my antenna Um, but but hopefully the run out of time Hopefully, you know again i am concerned about that because let's face it Joe biden is actually saying the solution to inflation and he's backed up by a compliant media is literally more justice spending It's insane. It makes no sense But that's uh, what they actually say and you know you got to be careful You got to watch what they say because they actually carried out the as best they can Senator johnson i get yeah Building on that when do you think this the the congressional session will be over? And basically the clock will be run out and everybody will pivot towards midterms Is it july when when are you anticipating? Hey, we're out of dc and people don't have to worry about tax increases occurring in 2022 and we can go vote in the midterms Well One of two scenarios either we reached the august recess and i think that it's pretty much campaign mode or uh, the public opinion polls continue to turn south to a point where democrats really are Afraid that they may be looking at a blower election here. I think that's to certain extent. We're starting to see that scenario which Is evidence of that is what happened with the uh, the anti mask mandate to vote in the senate so Even democrats are concerned about the polls. It's not the science has changed on this stuff. The polls have changed Senator johnson august constant sir always a pleasure. Thanks for coming by I appreciate again ron johnson for senate.com.

We got some more thoughts for you on something that we could say might Improve your life just a little bit and is actually truly bipartisan right now Uh, so we're ending on on something of a happy note The us senate has approved a bill to make daylight saving time permanent now There's a clay i we have to break this down for a moment here because to me I just don't want the the time to be changing. This is the dumbest thing This is before there was double masking. I think the dumbest thing that we were all made to do Was changing your clocks twice a year as if this is some Like why right it makes no sense at all. I am seeing people though apparently I didn't know this was possible Who are upset because they don't like that the hour will be moved it will stay forward They like the way it what have you seen this? Yeah, I I understand arguments and i'm sure there's a breakdown of a certain Percentage for our audience and the nation as a whole. I think most people I say most people Prefer to have hours later in the day as opposed to early in the morning, right? So for example when I get home with my kids I would rather be able to run around with them outside and still have daylight Longer in the winter because i'll look for instance where I live in Nashville. It's dark at 430 central time So you talk about uh, how Crippling that feels you barely get the kids out of school you get home and it's pitch black already It feels like it's 10 o'clock at night. It's five o'clock in the afternoon So having an extra hour in the evening. I think would be great. I'm just anti-changing the time in general I live and I lived in the Caribbean. I live in the u.s. Virgin islands practicing law down there No time change. No time change at all. I loved it part of the year We were on the Atlantic time zone all year round Uh because the u.s. Change is that means part of the year We were on the eastern time zone other part of the year we were on the atlantic hour ahead of eastern time zone I loved it. I think the way to go is to never ever Change the time again. So we have to get it passed in the house Right and uh and then biden would have to sign it and it would become national law because the senate has uh has passed it Yeah, the senate the senate passed the bill. I think it was a hundred zero Am I or it was I don't think anyone voted against it. I think that's correct I think even mit romney Have you had the gall had the backbone to vote for this one? Yay mit you should be so proud of yourself, but I'll tell you this man. I this is You know, this is opportunities may sound a little crazy This is an opportunity that is saying, you know a lot of this stuff is what we all agree to and what we decide society will be Four-day work week clay. I mean now I know I'm like the guy who's running for student council president who says We're gonna have you know, no homework and ice cream every day at recess and whatever But you know five days we only get a two-day weekend doesn't feel like much I know you you are tweeting until like midnight every day. So you work. I work way too much And i'm trying my goal in 2020. I don't know a year when 2022 was to work way less and Then it's like whenever you make that goal something crazy happens Like we got a war in Ukraine all of a sudden, right? I was like, hey, you know what? I'm gonna have a couple of months where it's chill We know it's gonna be wild as we cover what we do as it gets closer and closer to the midterm But I felt like hey, maybe things are gonna be chill a little bit Won't be much going on for february march april may a little bit of a relaxed time And then we got a war in europe. You know, you never can just take a breather Here's my I mean one thing that we saw because of covid Is that there's that there are people who when they have a truly flexible work schedule Will be even more productive They're not there when they don't have to come into the office and they can do do whatever they want to do And that most people this one of the movie office space is so brilliant I still recommend every I love that movie And when he when he breaks it down for him when he breaks it down for the two bobs And he says you know on any given day. I'd say I do have 15 minutes of actual real work Yeah, right anyone who's had kind of a boring office job, but i've had in the past knows A lot of time you spend at the water cooler talking about the sports or you know hanging out with folks and just sort of uh killing time We could look at how how work from home has changed the way we think about work for so many people millions of people across the country We could get it all done in four days folks. I know it seems crazy I know you're thinking i'm nuts But we could monday through thursday and then the weekend could be established for all friday saturday sunday We'd all be living better. I lived in greece for a summer clay. They take like three hour naps every day It's i'll tell you this uh, this was my big issue with practicing law If you told every lawyer in america you get paid the same amount But you can finish your work as rapidly as you want right the problem with practicing law for instance You have the billable hour system. So it's not only how long Something takes it's how long something should take you could have 95 Lawyer efficiency and probably cut 70 of all billable hours. There's no need for 80 75 70 or so of all legal work So this was my issue with being a litigator. I just hated how inefficient it was And uh, and so I always thought you know Hey, if you told everybody if you get all your work done And I think that's what's happening a lot with people who work at home Because there's not somebody looking over their shoulder all the time as long as you produce quality work You can get it done fast. You got way more lifestyle time built around you And I think there are a lot of people who buy into this this stuff You know, we we we take for granted that there's a system in place you have to do it in a certain way certain times But I I think uh, I think we should really have Bigger social conversations not only about societal conversations not only about what about the work schedule thing I don't really mean I really think we should have a four. I know it's crazy people. We just have a four day work week It's a bold. It's a bold claim. I didn't know you were gonna go This pink o uh, commie here. I'll say this One thing parents who do homeschooling one of things I always find so when oh yeah Is they say that they have their lesson plans and stuff and they often get done by noon or one o'clock And then the kid can just be a kid. That's right. I I agree I mean, I think it's there's no doubt that there's a huge part of the school day that is wasted Um, and by the way, speaking of wasted. How about all the craziness going on in New York city buck? We've talked about kyrie Irving. We need to mention this tomorrow. There's a lot of Mets yankie spans listening to us in the New York city area They're not going to allow unvaccinated players in the New York city area buck To play outdoor baseball games for the entire year could involve the erin judge Based on the way he's answering questions.
