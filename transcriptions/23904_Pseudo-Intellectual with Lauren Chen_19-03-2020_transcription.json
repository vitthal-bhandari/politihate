    "text": " Hey guys, welcome back to the show. My name is Lauren and this is Liam. Hello. And we want to say a big thank you to everyone watching, especially our live viewers. And by the way, if it is your first time watching live, we will be going over all of your super chats, comments, questions, concerns, sometimes riddles. Actually, this one particular person likes to give us riddles. They're very hard. We rarely get them. We're going to be doing that about an hour into the string once we finish the main part of the show. So stay tuned for that if you are watching live. And aside from that, we have a show tonight that's going to try to, for the most part, keep your mind off of the more serious things that are going on in this planet because, yeah, everyone needs a distraction. That which we will not name. Yes, for algorithm reasons. But yeah, so we're going to be going over a simping, this thing that is just sweeping the internet. We recently, there was a girl Nico, her TikTok blew up. We had some simping going on really hardcore with that, then an update on quarantine life, including some of my streaming recommendations for everyone stuck inside. And then Philadelphia in a move to, I guess, stem the spread of a certain illness, which I'll remain unnamed. They've decided to stop arresting people for certain and offenses, which makes sense. Of course, why wouldn't you just stop enforcing the rule of law during an emergency situation? And then finally, Marvel introduces two new characters, safe space and snowflake. That's that serious. That's not parody. And before we get into it, when I think our sponsor candidate, everyone, it's finally happening. This is the year that I'm straightening my teeth with candid clear liners and you could be too. So if you are unhappy with your smile, self-conscious and photos, I recommend you check out candid beyond delivering clear liners directly to your door. Candid treatment includes remote monitoring by your orthodontist throughout treatment. That means you can get the same treatment oversight you'd get by seeing an orthodontist in person without inconvenient office visits, all for fraction of the costs, unlike braces, candid clear liners are comfortable, removable and totally invisible so you can transform your smile without anyone noticing a thing. Plus, you never have to set foot in a doctor's office or waiting room. Your treatment is prescribed and monitored remotely by a licensed orthodontist, which is amazing for a time like this, where so many businesses aren't accepting people in their doors and everyone's trying to stay home. Unlike other companies, candid only works with orthodontist, never a general dentist. That means your treatment will be designed by an expert in tooth movement and with other remote clear liner options, you may never hear from a doctor at all as you go through treatment. But with candid, not only will your treatment be designed by an experienced orthodontist, it also includes remote monitoring. So and if you are planning ahead for a special event with candid, the average treatment length is just six months and you will start seeing results even sooner than that. So it's definitely worth it. You can get started from the comfort of your own home with their risk-free starter kit. So are you ready to take the first step towards straighter teeth? For a limited time, you can get started with $75 off. It's a big deal using the code Lauren at candidco.com slash Lauren. That's candidco.com slash Lauren. Use code Lauren for $75 off again, candidco.com slash Lauren with code Lauren. Yeah, a quarantine friendly way to get those straighter teeth that way when we all emerge months later from our houses, we'll all have amazing smiles. Yes. So we're going to be talking about simps. How would you define a simp? For people who aren't familiar with it yet, the term. It's tough. It's a little bit of an ethereal term. I think that a simp is someone who is kind of like an overzealous follower of I guess a female internet celebrity or just female celebrity in general, you know, someone that especially tends to give money to them. Yeah, I would say a big part of simping is it's not just you're watching a female creator. It's usually men who watch a female creator specifically because they want to date them or sleep with them or attracted to them, not necessarily because they think their content is good. They respect what they're doing with their work, like their videos or anything like that. It's just like you are hot a piece of meat. Therefore, I will kind of give you money in the hopes that you notice me and maybe date me. Yeah, and they might they might like your personality too or whatever it is. But in their head, they're thinking somehow that they can get a relationship out of their interaction with an e-girl. It's kind of like the nice guy or male feminist equivalent of a fan. Yeah. Is the way that I see it. So recently, there's a lot of simping going on when a video of a girl, a cutie went viral. I don't get it. I don't get the video. I was talking like I don't just understand the male brain. I don't. She was trying to decode like what the meaning of the song was in this video that we're about to show you and you'll see the what meaning. Yeah, I don't I don't get it. But anyway, you guys have probably seen it if you're on social media. But here here's the video. So for anyone listening on an audio only platform, by the way, we are on Spotify, iTunes and Google Play. If you'd like to check us out, that that video is just it's a girl dancing in a Bernie Sanders crop top. I don't fully under she's just dancing in the crop top. And it's cute. No meaning to it. Yeah, just there's just the male brain just like, all right, that's that's nice. That's I will watch this several million times, which is the number of views that it has. Millions of millions of millions of views now. Yeah. So apparently that girl is a Twitch streamer and she she already had a decent sized platform before this, but she kind of blew up when that clip went viral. But the simping that really came into play when I guess a ton of guys, yeah, like I after this blew up, a lot of people started following her and you know, more guys were giving her a donation. So it became kind of a meme online about how this girl was just turning everyone into a simp. I do want to distinguish though, simping from a guy just watching a female creator. It's not it's not the same thing. So how can we tell the difference between simping and just, oh, there's a female whose content I appreciate. First off, do you actually enjoy her content? Like, would you watch her stuff if she were ugly? Do you find her insightful, funny entertaining? If the answer is yes, then it may it's probably not simping, right? Men can watch females and it not be simping. But if you're only watching them because you want to date them and if they were, I don't know, to gain 100 pounds, you would stop watching them because you're no longer interested in their content might be simping. Do you support them by like, you know, sharing their content, buying their merch or donating to their to their channel for the same reasons you would a male creator? Like you you just like their content want them to continue making it that kind of thing. If that's true, probably not not simping, right? You want to support them just like you support the the male creators you follow. But if you if you're supporting them because you're trying to get their attention, you're trying to get them to notice you in the hopes that either maybe some internet magic happens and a relationship happens or at the very least they show Bob's and Vigine. Yes, probably. Fans only. I think there's the website that someone am used for that. Fans only sims only actually. But I mean, listen to me, it's like if you fantasize about a girl that you follow online and having a relationship with them, I don't think that it's not necessarily simping if you have a crush on. Right, exactly. Because I mean, I think that men have always done that which it just might be the girl next door or the girl you go to school with the girl you work with. Whatever it is. I mean, you might don't make you a simple. If you're yeah, if you're single, it's totally normal to me that where it's like becomes weird is where it's like, all right, you start giving money with an expectation of some kind of return and be you detention or pictures or whatever it is. That's when it's like, this is this is behavior that isn't healthy. What didn't happen before the internet really? This is like an anonymous thing that tends to happen. I don't know if it didn't. I mean, because I'm sure like beautiful girls in the past, medieval Europe men would like give them flowers or tokens of their affection. Like that's always been a that's that's true. I guess there is some degree of sympathy. But there was also yeah, there was also like a bigger barrier to the ratio of how many sims a thought can acquire as greatly been elevated because of the internet. Yeah, especially. Can you imagine like the most beautiful woman back then the best you couldn't you wouldn't even know how they look like, right? You just you just have to take the bar's word for it. Yeah, like the immediate area. How many people have seen you know? And it's like we've seen kind of like e-girls now like Bell Delphine like this. I think her name is Nico. Nico. Nico. Her Twitter handle is Nico Lull or something like that. They've really like blown up and I mean, I'm not sure about Nico specifically, but I know Bell Delphine has men giving her thousands of dollars per month for things like snapchat. But I mean, I follow so many. Oh, yes, bathwater. I follow so many female contact creators though, where I mean, I see online like they're constantly called thoughts or e-girls. Even though like they're not selling ludes or nudes or not. They're encouraging this behavior in any way. Yeah, they're very open with the fact that they're not single, but they still get that kind of label thrown on them. And it's like, no, just because you're horny and you find them hot, that doesn't make every woman a thought or her support or simps. You have like the simp and then you have like the rabid anti-simp who thinks that anyone that follows a woman is a simp. And that's not that's not true either. Or anyone who replies to a post by a woman is a simp. And it's like, all right, calm, calm down. But anyway, what kind of drew a lot of people's attention, including her fan base for negative reasons, was some comments that Nico made on one of her streams indicating that she's apparently perfectly fine with guys simping. In fact, she thinks it's a good thing. We have this video clip here. If you're a discretion, there's there's not full frontal nudity, but there's a lot of cleavage going on in this clip. But when someone is talking about guys simping for a girl, I just don't understand what's wrong with like, worshiping a girl. There's nothing wrong with that. Okay, not saying specifically me. Okay, but girls should be worshiped. All right, it doesn't mean you're a simp. All right, simping isn't bad. Simping is king sh**. Okay, you're a king if you're if you're not afraid to say so I can see why she would say that I have some issues with what she said. And I know before this definitely do. Yeah, before the stream started, someone in the live chat was like, oh, is this another case of a, you know, a woman tearing another woman down? I'm not trying to tear anybody down, but I actually am more critical, maybe even of her fans than I am for sure. Yeah, but yeah, I don't. Okay, worshiping. I think men should treat women well and women should treat men well. But if we're talking about like the level of devotion that I think she's implying, that should be reserved for girlfriend slash wives only, not for random people. You don't know. Sure. I mean, the term worship, I think has to be thrown out in the case of direction towards another human being, right? Yeah. Even in the case where you are in a committed relationship, say a marriage, and I think that you should treat the other person with more reverence than anybody else in your life. You're kind of an extension of each other in that sense is the way I see it. But yeah, worship is definitely not the term for it. That's like, you're putting something on a pedestal there. And I don't, I don't think I think that's completely out of place, frankly. Yeah. And I mean, the idea that it's not the reason why people make fun of simps so much is because it's miss like that that's not something that a man who is confident in himself and who has other real life prospects for dating does. So for her to call it like king behavior, it's not really, I don't think it makes you a terrible person. Don't get me wrong. I just think it makes you unfortunately a little bit naive as to what these girls are trying to do. And again, like not every female Twitch streamer, of course not. But if yeah, someone who's going online and saying specifically, yeah, no, simping is good. Like you should definitely sim it. Definitely not my channel though. Yeah, just like in general, you should simp. I don't know. You know, shirt gets two inches lower, but yeah. I mean, why not just go, I mean, like the 50 year old male equivalent of this is going to the strip club on a regular basis and giving lots of money to your favorite dancer. Yeah, that's like the evolved simp. I mean, it's still like a higher T simp in my mind. If we're getting down the meme, if we're getting all these like internet memes, yeah, at least they're paying attention to you in person. Yeah, so there's more to the transaction, I guess, that requires a little bit more confidence to some degree, because you're in person. But it's yeah, that's also behavior. I've never, I've never understood any of this behavior, because it's so clear to me that in those situations, the transaction that the male is looking for is not the transaction that the female's looking for. She's looking for an economic stimulus. Yeah. And he's looking for a stimulus of another type. Right. Exactly. And it's just like you're kidding yourself if you think you're getting it the way that you're going about it. Yeah. But I mean, like then you, you've kind of always, I think the internet has made things worse, but you've always had that subsection of men and women who are perfectly fine with that, like with being a sugar daddy or sugar baby, for example, and those people find each other. And it's, you know, I'm not saying it should be illegal for them to do that, but widespread as a behavior, no, it's not good. It's not healthy. And actually, Nikko actually recently found out the dark side of simping because she, you know, sims giveth and simps take it away. She ended up losing thousands of followers, tens of thousands of followers after she revealed some maybe sensitive information about ourself on a stream. We have this article here, because apparently this type of stuff actually makes mainstream news. Now, woman goes viral after dancing video endorsing Bernie Sanders, then loses all her new followers. They start off by explaining a simp is a person, usually a man, but not always, who tries to attract women by acting subservient and submissive or simple. Yes. Yeah. I think that's a good definition because it's you don't have alpha simps, right? It's, it's kind of like that reverence that is off putting. Yeah, for sure. Well, I think it's an indication, first of all, the lack of self-respect. Yeah. Because you don't see yourself as the same on the same level as them. And that's, first of all, widely unattractive to women. Yeah. Or just even to men. Everybody. Yeah. So there also a self-respect aspect that I think is lacking. So anybody that's on the simp train is just you probably need to work on a little bit of things on your own end, first. And they continue the relatively new term is rising popularity as a sort of update to classics like nice guys who are usually anything but and reply guys who consistently respond to woman's tweets with overly familiar or suggestive comments. I'd never heard the term reply guys. No, me neither. That's good though. As the label is still in its infancy, people are yet to decide whether simp is a fitting insult for guys who think they're entitled to attend from a woman as a result of basic decency or politeness or a misogynistic term to shame men who treat women with respect or just not like trash as described by online men's magazine. Mel in the case of Nico Lull, it appears to be the former after she revealed one detail of her life that saw many of her new sim followers abandon her after surging in popularity on Twitter after posting the video of herself dancing in her Bernie shirt last week. Nico Lull lost close to 65,000 followers in the space of 48 hours after revealing the 78 year old senator isn't the only man in her life. And then here we have a I think this is a screenshot from Social Blade, which is a it's a site that kind of monitors engagement follower count and all that kind of stuff on different platforms, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and things like that. So as you can see, it started Monday, she lost 4750. And then Tuesday, I guess by the time the news got around, she lost over 59,000 followers. Yeah, and in perspective, that brought her down to only 30,000 at the time. Now she's rebounded after this, because there are there are sims that were late on the train, I think. So they missed the announcement that she has a boyfriend. So she's now got about 220,000 Twitter followers. So behavior in the way she does is highly lucrative. And we know this already. Yeah, it's highly lucrative. I mean, Bell Delphine's perfect example of that. Who became famous for selling bathwater in the likes of that, like on real media, like. Everyone was talking about it. Yeah. And she sold out of bathwater. So and she on Patreon is making tons of money, Snapchat, or maybe that's part of her Snapchat. I don't know, she's she's making money hand over fist to use a but but yeah, I mean, this girl lost almost 65% of her total viewers at that point, of a total subscribers. And I think that's a pretty good indication that the people who are following you aren't just following you for your content, right? Well, they're following her for her content. Yes. But not not like, yes. Yeah. They're simple. Yeah, they are. So you wouldn't do any girl, right? That's not a challenge. No, it's not. It doesn't even occur to me. Like my brain does not work this way. It's just like it doesn't even I don't even blink. Like I typically don't watch. I don't watch too many social commentators, but I don't think I watch any female social commentators. Like when Lauren and I started dating, she had just started her YouTube channel. And I never watched it. And I never even thought about watching that, frankly, she asked me not to. They were the last three not to. Then my face was in it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So I didn't even see, I didn't even know that because I've still not watched them, by the way. The only time I watched them is when I started working on the show. Yeah. And but as an aside, that is like people are like, Oh, you're only popular because of your looks. It's like, A, I have more followers on Twitter than Instagram. I think that says something and B, I started with like no, no video to support Silver. You haven't you haven't you haven't played, you know, the e-girl card at all. Well, the thing is, like, I wouldn't even like that. I would hate that. I would imagine so, but it I there was a strange thing when I did the Harley Quinn video and put on pigtails. A lot of you guys like that. And I don't know how if the views were representative of that, or if it was just because it was a popular thing, but also like I'm 25. So I'm too old to do that regularly. But I dubs if you guys know, he's like a huge huge YouTuber, maybe one of the biggest ones, definitely an original gangster. Definitely. Yeah, he's apparently dating someone who is people call her an e-girl. I'm not familiar with her too much. But apparently she has a what's that? A fans only. One of those accounts. I think, I don't know. Yeah, I find Sims are kind of like the nice guys of content creators, right? I mean, they're they're gonna really try to placate you, compliment you, throw money at you, but the second they realize you're not interested in them, like they will try to destroy you. Ladies, if you're interested in becoming content creator, that's great. But try not to just mark it to men who think you're attractive, because it's that the longevity of that is not very good as as we saw. And it's also, I think not safe. Definitely to that woman as well. Like in the early days when I was an independent YouTuber, I did have to deal with like I had a couple of supporters who they like would email me or like message me. And then when they found out that I wasn't interested in them or that had a boyfriend, like at the time boyfriend, like they would just 180 that tried to dox me, smear me like threats. And I'm sure male creators get this too, by the way, like when they have fans who are attracted to them and they don't reciprocate, but it's it's not the type of behavior I think you should be encouraging as financially lucrative as it as it could be. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, moving on, we're going to be talking about the Rona, which is the the closest we'll get to saying it, less we be put in the algorithm. Yeah. Algorithm, good leg. First though, I want to tell you guys about Express VPN. There are a ton of VPN providers out there you've probably heard at least a couple of them and you may have even used a VPN before.

Okay, so what's going on where we live and probably where a bunch of other people live is that bars are shut down, theaters are shut down, Jim, St. Patrick's Day. Yeah, what a travesty. That is so sad. As schools are shut down. That doesn't matter. Schools are shut down. The colleges say they may be shut down until like for the rest of the semester, no more in person classes or anything like that. Also, shame. Yeah, restaurants are still open, but I think a lot of them are doing either just take out or delivery and take out sort of thing. McDonald's near us has closed some of our favorite restaurants nearby has closed, have closed. Yeah, it's it's kind of like a ghost town. If you do look outside and news is that it's probably going to get worse before it gets better. We've heard people say that we may need to do this until July, August, Stephen, which is pretty shocking to think of. We're going to keep going though with this show. And you know, I know you guys are probably like us anytime you open the timeline. It's nothing but news about this. Nothing. Nothing. Only that it's also people like us that are just like or like just like I'm on Corona. I'm I'm not the Roaner expert. Dang it. I messed it up. I'm the producer too. I'm also. Talk about beer a little bit. So maybe the algorithm will think yeah. You have a nice frosty with lime. I did have a Guinness yesterday on St. Patrick's Day. That was a good time. But yeah, we're not we're not experts on this. Yeah, I don't know. I'm not a public opinion. We don't work. Yeah, exactly. We're not epidemiologists. We're not none of that stuff. So you're probably tired of hearing the opinions of people like us about the Voldemort. Yeah. So instead we're doing a segment about stuff that you can do. Yeah, to like a service. Some escapism or some a bit of a distraction, not that I'm saying we shouldn't take this seriously and do everything we can to stop the spread anymore, which of course we should. I really didn't leave the house since like Friday and it was the last time. Not that different from my regular life. I will admit. But it's a little bit different. So here are some shows that I think you should stream. If you have time, a lot of people are working from home now just to you know, sense of normalcy. I don't think panic is a good thing. I don't think being stressed and afraid is a good thing. And with ExpressVPN, these are shows that you can watch from anywhere in the world because they allow you to kind of bypass some of the country restrictions. Okay, so the office, just classic, I watch it. British or American American. I don't watch the British one. Me neither. Maybe I should because I do like Ricky Gervais. We watched his special humanity the other night. It's very good. It was good. It was fun. Yeah, but the office I'm constantly, I always have the office on repeat. Yeah, I don't get I can't watch stuff on repeat. But it's I can't watch everything. But the office is so good that and I used to be friends before that. But yeah, if you want to, I've okay. Liam reminds me of Dwight. If you watch the office, you know what I mean. It's you look at him. He's cute. You might think Jim maybe Dwight. It's the animal facts. It's the very strong respect for order and authority. He's a Dwight. That's nothing. I'm definitely more of a Jim, but I will say that one of the things that I recommend doing during this this time that you spend at home would be checking out some animal documentaries. That's a great way to pass the time. Exactly what Dwight would say. Night on Earth just came out. Yeah, I only watched one of the episodes with you. But what I saw was good. The Witcher is also great. If you haven't seen it yet and you enjoyed like high fantasy stuff like Game of Thrones, there's one season out so far, but a second season is in development. So we have time to watch it now that we can all watch the second season together and talk about it. If you like true crime, also check out the trials of Gabriel Fernandez. It is it is about a young boy who was unfortunately killed as a result of extreme neglect. I was bawling my eyes as I was watching it. One of my parents came down and they saw me just crying in front of my laptop and they were like, are you okay? It's like, no, I'm not okay. CPS is not doing good stuff. But if you enjoy true crime, you like stuff like making murder, I think you like it. Then you is another good series. It's about, I know it's a weird title, you. It's essentially about a crazy psycho stalker, but it's told from his perspective. So he's sort of like an anti hero, you know, he stalks and he murders, but he also cares. So mixed bag there. And then on prime, Jack Ryan and the boys, both both solid shows Jack Ryan has two seasons. So we have a bit of content to get through there. The boys has one, but the second season is in development. So check them out. If you guys have any recommendations of what you got, you're watching during this quarantine and definitely let us know I'm actually couldn't find anything to watch, which doesn't make sense because I have prime Netflix, Disney plus and Hulu. There are there are things to watch between those four platforms, but I started rewatching the Witcher. And there's some chronological stuff people weren't happy about it, but it made more sense to me the second time. Yeah, around. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, for me, the way that I've been using my time, because I've got I've had more time on my hands now, which might not be the case for everybody. Some people are still working. Some people might be busier actually. Yeah. Right. I mean, I'm still working, but but my other aspects of my life is cleared up quite a bit. And it's been awesome for me because, you know, one of the things that I recommend doing is is I work out every day and then that I have the more time, you know, for a lot of people, I might need to be like a prison style workout where you're just out. Yeah, I'm gonna callisthenics are amazing. You could get super fit with calisthenics. You don't need to spend a lot of time doing it. So working out every day feels great. I have the time to cook more, eat healthier, you know, just do have a stretch and get all the chores done that have been piling up. It's springtime's coming up. You can get spring cleaning done. Yeah. You know, that's a lot of things you can do to be productive in this time, which I think will also not only help with the boredom, but give you a sense that you're progressing in your life when things might feel a little bit stagnant after a while. So I think that, you know, I saw one of my friends sending me a meme that like, you know, everybody's jacked before the coronavirus before the before the the the rona season. Yeah. And then at the end of it, they're just like nice and plump. It's like, should be the opposite. Why not do the opposite, man? Why not do the opposite? The opportunity is here, you know, heck, I don't know how many calories we'll be getting in by the end. Maybe it's time to start all that diet too. Yeah, and it's interesting to think about what the world will look like once we kind of come out of this, because it will eventually, but will globalism be reduced? Like, will we start to recognize that, hey, maybe outsourcing such essential things like the production of medicine, maybe or a lot of food, maybe that's not a good idea in case anything like this happens. Maybe some wet markets will be looked at. Maybe, maybe swell, maybe borders aren't the worst thing, especially when it comes to emergency situations, like needing to quarantine. And we actually have people saying, Oh, socialism is the answer because of this, right? Yeah. For me, the most interesting and I think like plausible, tangible thing that might come from this is telecommuting being everywhere. So many people now, they're being white collar workers mostly, but they're being forced to work from home. These are jobs that could have been remote for like a decade for so long, but it's just a lot of a lot of industries have embraced it. And they've kind of factored that into their workflow. But a lot of companies are really lagging behind there. A lot of jobs where people have to spend an hour in traffic every day going to and from work, maybe even longer. And they don't need to. I certainly mean, shouldn't seen the effectiveness of someone working at home versus in an office. Because I do think that the office probably inspires productivity. They said that it inspires productivity certainly up until the early afternoon. Yeah, that's what they say most of the stuff time in the office. The productivity is like peak hours, like between like nine to I think before lunch and then after a really like two p.m. like nothing gets done. Yeah. So maybe this will help us rethink the way we approach work. I don't know. I mean, like I work remotely almost all of the time and it's I mean, it does take discipline, but I think you could slack off in your cubicle no problem. Like people figure that out. Yeah. Yeah. Another thing is maybe we should all be better prepared in the future. I think a lot of people were kind of taken aback, especially when they started seeing people both buying just I mean, I'm not a survival expert. I am a little bit into the whole prepping thing though. I am a little bit into that quick list of some things that I think everybody should have in their house or apartment at all times like not just Corona related but just in general, you don't know what's going to happen. Toilet paper, it would suck to run out of that obvious. We got you've seen this now. I was I'm watching people buying and I'm like, I'm wondering, do you guys live on a toilet roll by toilet roll life or something like this? Do you not have toilet paper at home? We like my family make sure that we have ones to spare just in case. First aid kit, obviously over-the-counter drugs, Tylenol, aspirin, cold and flu medication, gravel, pepto bismol, just because again, you don't know what could happen. You don't know when you might be forced to stay at home for a couple days with it because of the weather, something like coronavirus, who knows? Bottled water, obvious toiletries, shampoo, soap, toothpaste, again, if you're stuck inside and you can't leave for maybe like a week, you want to make sure that you have everything you need. Food storage, canned goods, frozen foods, dried foods, emergency rations, just to make sure that they actually say that you should have like a week or so food per person in your household. I think my family has more than that but it's important. Radio, flashlight batteries, bug out bag in the car, be great. Here's one. Know someone outside of the city who you can stay with if it hits the fan. That I think is an important one. We've got that land up north. Yeah. Lots of it. It's like, we have a big family though, so there'd be some, I'd have to maybe shave off a few of them. Yeah, I mean, yeah, there's definitely stuff like that that I think are useful. One thing that I want to get into in the future is going to be something like raising chickens of my own. Okay, that's all you. I have no chicken. Well, that's like easy peasy, I think, from what I can, from what I actually, I have no idea. Speaking completely out of turn, I hope it's easy peasy because I want to do it. And then like if you a few basic vegetables would also be pretty cool. I don't know how hard that is either, but it's I don't think it's probably that bad. I think it's doable. And I think it's a, not only does it give you something in situations where you might need it, but also on a regular basis, it's healthy stuff that you grow in your backyard, it gives you some autonomy, save you some cost. You know that it's either organic, it could be GMO or whatever, but at least there's no pesticides, there's certain types on it. And it's clean. I think a lot of people now are seeing the appeal that like homesteading life has, right? Because there are people out there who this is are totally fine. This hasn't affected them at all. They're still worried, of course, that everyone stays safe and all that the economy is also going to be affected by this. But some people were definitely in a more prepared situation than others. And hopefully, if there is somewhat of a silver lining to this, it should be should be to illustrate people that, yeah, no, this stuff matters. I know it's fun to make fun of preppers, but they're the ones who are kind of laughing throughout this. And it, you know, what is something that's also shocked me is I'm surprised at the number of parents on social media who now that the schools have closed seem overwhelmed with having to spend time with their children. Like what? It's like it's just been a few days. Yeah, a lot of movies are being released earlier, actually, on streaming services. Now, there's one thing that's been going around frozen to yeah. Yeah. So that's kind of interesting. One to see the movie industry maybe changing. It's the way it's operating because they're releasing these movies as like you got a premium rental for like 20 bucks. Yeah, basically. So it's going to be interesting to see how that works out. Yeah, because I think the movie theater model is somewhat outdated. And because of people like movie theater costs are too high. And so people end up pirating who might not otherwise if costs were lower, but because of the space they need to rent it's higher. If I personally would actually prefer if new movies were like, all right, pay us $20 and you can stream it in your own home, then it could, you know, you can invite some friends over and split the cost. I think that. Yeah, well, the idea is, I think it's targeting those people because $20 is a lot cheaper of a ticket than bringing your whole family to the movie theater, especially with concession. I mean, yeah, I mean, for people like me that just tend to get these videos, you know, it might not work as well. But for those people, it'll be interesting to see how that works. Yeah. All right. So we're going to carry on to Philadelphia with some news related to the virus. But first, I want to tell you guys about Grove collaborative. Living healthy is more than just eating right. It's about reading potentially harmful chemicals wherever you can from the soups and deterges you use to the cloth you use to wash your face. If this sounds a bit daunting, let me introduce you to Grove collaborative. It's an online marketplace that delivers all natural home beauty and personal care products directly to you. Grove takes the guesswork out of going green. Every grove dot CO product is guaranteed to be good for you, your family, your home and the planet. So you can save time reading confusing labels with everyone under quarantine. Cleaning supplies sent right to your home toiletries sent right to your home clearly seems like a pretty good idea right now, I would think. So with Grove, you don't have to shop multiple stores or search endlessly online to get all the natural goods you need for you and your family. Join over two million lifetime customers who trust Grove collaborative to make their homes happier and healthier. Shipping is fast and free on your first order. So for a limited time, when my listeners go to grove dot CO slash Lauren, you will get a free five piece cleaning set from Mrs. Myers and Grove, which is a $30 value. So go to grove dot CO slash Lauren to get this exclusive offer. Again, that's grove dot CO slash Lauren. And I got to say in time, like this, I really love how many options there are to have things delivered to you. And I know that obviously it means people like in the delivery service are still having to work. But when you compare that to gathering everybody in crowded stores, I think it's kind of the lesser of two evils, especially if you're, you know, you're someone with older family members, you can have stuff sent to them and they can kind of remain at home and not risk going outside. And I think that's great. So in relation to the Rona, we have a story out of Philadelphia. This is shocking. I saw this and I'm like, there's, there's no way this is like the onion. Apparently not. This is from Breitbart. Philadelphia ends jail for non violent criminals because of the thing. The Philadelphia Pennsylvania Police Department is implementing a new policy where accused criminals deemed non violent will be quickly released after their arrest in light of the sickness. Police officials confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that accused criminals charged with nonviolent crimes will be processed and released. So as not to fill up city jails, police officials said those accused criminals considered to be violent will not be released. They said in a statement, it should be noted that if a police officer believes that releasing an individual would pose a threat to public safety, the officer will notify a supervisor who will review the totality of the circumstances and in the interest of public safety, utilized discretion in determining the appropriate course of action. Nonviolent criminals will be re arrested later in the year. Police officials confirmed the authenticity of an internal memo that states that those arrested for crimes like burglary, auto theft, vandalism, prostitution and theft will not be held in jail. Instead, they will be released back into the general public. The new arresting procedures comes as Philadelphia, especially in categories deemed non violent offenses, but that still leave victims in their wake. So here's the thing. It does make sense that things like prison and jails would be at special risk for something contagious like what we've been talking about, but that this still does not seem like a good idea. No, I know it's even a worse idea. Shouting it from the rooftops. That's like, I'm sure many Philadelphiaans who were thinking about their neighbor's toilet paper all of a sudden are a little more motivated to go and get some. And I think the thing with right now is people don't feel safe. They don't feel in control of what's going to happen. This seems like a relaxation of laws at a really vulnerable time right now, especially like there are predators out there who will use this to their advantage. And there was a memo that was leaked that this article references we have an excerpt of it here. So here are the crimes that effective Tuesday, March 17 at the start of 4 p.m. Arrest for the following offenses will be effectuated. All narcotic offenses. Okay, that seems pretty fine. Theft from persons, retail theft, theft from auto burglary. Okay, so this distinction between non violent crime, I think we should be looking at more victimless crimes or at least in terms of another person. Sure. Because if someone's going around stealing things from people, that could be potentially like mugging someone or just grabbing stuff, looting, letting them right back out on the street is not a good idea, especially if like there's nothing you as a police officer can do. And now they know that, right? Because even if you say we'll re-arrest you later, well, they still have a bunch of time to get all the looting done to sell all this stuff. It's just seems like a really bad idea. They also list vandalism, all bench warrants, not sure what that refers to stolen auto. So like, I mean, stealing cars. It's a pretty real thing. Yeah, I know. It's like, you know, when you say, oh, it's non violent stuff, you kind of think like another one that's mentioned here is economic crimes, like fraud or bad checks. And I think, oh, okay, that's reasonable. But you know, stealing cars like this. That's like the second biggest investment a person makes. They're live typically. Yeah. And I think like there's a lot of people right now who are trying to stay inside and close up their shops. The last thing they want to feel like is that their property is not safe. And the thing is like, I saw this kind of story floating around on social media. And all of the people were saying like, thank goodness, I have the Second Amendment in my state like, Oh, no, I don't have a gun to prepare myself. Like this is escalating things, making people more scared. This is not helping the situation. And as someone who is for criminal justice reform, I feel like when when the left or left leaning cities like Philadelphia do this kind of thing where they equate kind of criminal justice reform measures with let's essentially stop enforcing the laws, we saw this recently with the whole bail reform disaster in New York, where people were beating people up and then being back on the street layer that same night to do the same thing again, like it gives criminal justice reform a bad name. Yeah, which is which is really too bad because it's needed. And there there are a lot of things that we could do like focus more on, I guess, treatment, not just throwing everyone in a box so they can be radicalized by actual dangerous criminals. Like let's focus more on monitoring like ankle bracelets are a thing now they give people so much, I guess the justice system potentially so much control over monitoring where where someone goes and what they do. Like let's lean on that technology, not just be like back on the street, whatever you want. And like you said, even if you were to do this, don't don't it now sit like this. This was just a terrible thing. And the ACLU actually has kind of one up Philadelphia with a similar sentiment saying, we're calling for the immediate release of individuals in prisons and jails who according to the CDC face heightened risk of severe illness or death due to COVID night. I don't know if we can say that this is this is tricky. So here they're wanting people to be released and they're not differentiating between what kinds of crimes these people have committed. This is the the statement that they attached to that post. The public health crisis presented by the sickness highlights the need for the Department of Justice and the Bureau of prisons to take immediate action to safeguard the health of those under its care. Time is of the essence and BOP must act swiftly and responsibly. Yeah, so I think they they're referring to the decarceration is a term that I've seen thrown out there. And it's like, I again, I agree that in a lot of cases, most cases locking people away isn't necessary, but a that doesn't mean they should go without any supervision or sort of retribution, right? Paroles, fines, treatment, community service, location monitoring, those are all good things. And like B, sometimes people should just be locked away. Like that is still a possibility, especially if they're dangerous. I feel like these people are insane. Like, are you trying to bring us to a Mad Max style apocalypse? Yeah, it seems. Yes. Absolutely. I mean, a lot of those guys that I think they want free are older dudes, but they're, you know, you can still be very dangerous when you're older and you still need to be locked up. We should mitigate any any exposure that they have to other people, I guess, in order to ensure that they don't get sick. But it's it is what it is. Yeah, yeah. And I think like this kind of mentality, like the the sweeping declarations of not enforcing things, releasing people, that's what led San Francisco to the part or to where it's at right now. There have been cries to instead of like, you know, condemning theft to actually go and help other people rob, right? If they're robbing, like, you know, yeah, well, it's like there's, you know, someone needs something from a grocery store. Well, the grocery store. Oh, yeah. Stuff like that. We have seen that. So we've seen things like that, some calls for that. And to be fair to Americans, we've had our own kind of thing like that up here in Canada, where we had this, Laura and I were shocked, because I think it was a couple days ago that the Canadian government announced that it would be closing its border to America, minus essential travel. And we were like, wow, I can't believe that the truth is true. Actually, a stopping migration, like, he's going to close down to legal immigration for a little while. Yeah, this is amazing. It took a huge virus to do it. Yeah, the border. But lo and behold, no, the RCMP has announced that it will allow. What do they call it? Regular border crossings to continue. In the wake of those virus, the test the virus is they'll use our COVID tests on them, of course. But it's like, why are you allowing it ever? Never mind during a pandemic. Right. Exactly. Especially during a pandemic, where it's like, this is probably like, if you're going to get Corona, if you're going to get, I'm bad at this. You know, I'm glad you're not a huge swear, because otherwise it just be F bombs, like, oh, yeah, if you're going to get the virus into Canada, that's how you're going to get it to the country. That's all. Yeah, especially it's like we border places like New York, which are some of the highest rates in the US right now. A large portion of our people that caught it, apparently, did come from down south. Yeah. So it's and it's frustrating because, like, again, I'm, I want criminal justice reform. I'm not like some totalitarian throw everyone in a box who's ever done something wrong. No, but also laws exist for a reason. We can't just be like, oh, everyone just do whatever you want, because that that doesn't work. We've seen that it does not work. Okay. So last story, this is actually something that I thought was a joke or actually a parody when I saw it, but it turns out it is real. Marvel has a new group of superheroes coming up. The new warriors, and one of them is called safe space. And the other is called snowflake. And I'm not, I'm not kidding. And no, they're not called that ironically. They're serious. Compowery. Yeah, we have a clip of one of the creators explaining the concept. Snowflake and safe space are the twins. And their names are very similar to screen time. It's this idea that these are terms that get thrown around on the internet that they don't see as derogatory to take those words and kind of wear them as badges of honor. Safe space is kind of a big, burly, sort of stereotypical jock. He can create force fields, but he can only trigger them if he's protecting somebody else. Snowflake is non-binary and goes by they them. Snowflake has the power to generate individual crystallized snowflake-shaped shurikims. The connotations of the word snowflake in our culture right now are something fragile. And this is a character who is turning it into something sharp. Snowflake is the person who has the more offensive power. And safe space is the person who has the more defensive power. The idea was that they would mirror each other and compliment each other. I actually, when I saw that I actually didn't think it was real, I thought it was making fun of how woke it was. Like I thought, oh, that's a funny skit that someone made of it. It's a little bit too on the nose. It's like a little bit too. This is what they do though. I've said this before, but they like to weaponize language. They like to take the means of words and try to use it for their own uses so that turning things like snowflake and safe space into empowering things rather than things that we mock. The thing is with safe space, they're the ones who try to use it as an empowering thing. And then people made fun of them. And now they're trying to double down. And it's like, okay, a no one says safe space or snowflake anymore. Like that's that's 20, 16. Yeah, like the only people who say that still are yeah, boomers on Facebook. No offense. If you are a boomer on Facebook, I'm just, I'm just letting you know, we don't really say that anymore. Or progressives who are like lamely trying to make fun of conservatives. They're like conservatives think. Yeah, because I've I've like tweeted about some like ridiculous things that progressives are doing like, huh, this is stupid. Look at them. And then I'll have like a progressive say snowflake. And I'm like, that doesn't make sense because I'm making fun of you. This other person is actually triggered over like this word. So that's not what snowflake means. It's not just a person who is saying things. I also want to say that that guy described safe space is a stereotypical job. Oh, yeah. I took issue with that personally. I don't know about you guys, but I was like, I've my idea of a stereotypical jock is a little bit different from his guy in like pink leotards. Yeah, with pink dyed hair and pink earrings. And I think that his idea of a stereotypical jock is going to change when whoever that is that's taking a toilet paper from him shows up. Yeah, that's what I think. And what I thought was so we have a copy of the or insert with the cover of the comment here. And if you look, so either one or both of them are non binary. I don't even remember, but it's funny because they're very clearly a male and a female, right? I think it's snowflake is very clearly has a female body. And then she's a non binary one. Yeah, and then but it's clearly is clearly a female, right? And also what people were commenting on is they're in a very intimate looking embrace. They don't like their twins. Yeah, I don't know, like what's happening here. Manisters. Yeah, I've never seen siblings hold each other like that. That's kind of strange. So here we have a actual further printout or write up of each of the characters that was released by Marvel and this press release. This press release that they did, I had to check like I literally had to check that it was real because I thought there's no way there is no way they would be this tone deaf, this bad at reading the room where they would think that this is a good idea. But here, so snowflake, their psychic twins, all twins are psychic, but we're a psychic or someone someone got paid to write this. It's good. Snowflake, a cryokinetic can materialize snowflake shaped shi, shi, shi, rakan. I don't know, I guess those are like the ninja stars. Yeah, projectiles for throwing. And then safe space, her brother can materialize pink force fields, but he can't inhabit them himself. The reflux only works if he's protecting others. They're hyper aware of modern culture and optics, apparently not because this is like this is terrible. And they see their super heroics as a post ironic meditation on using violence to combat bullying. They're probably streaming this. I've never wanted to bully anyone so much in my life. This is this is not this is not the thing is like this character concept had to go through so many different people, right? Even like our small show that we do, the stories they still, you know, it's like three people who end up seeing them. If something were really this bad, I would like to think one of us would say, hang on, I don't know if that's a good idea. I don't even want like at least a dozen two dozen people were part of bringing the these characters to life. It tells you how far these companies are because they've gotten rid of all the dissenters. Yeah. And that's the thing we did a movie or sorry, an episode a while ago about Hollywood woke. And I think I mentioned some sort of Marvel character in like a movie or TV series that it was woke. And then someone said, no, it's not it's not actually going well because they they did that diversity switch before in the comics. And it's like, just because the comics did it first, that doesn't mean it's not well comics are super woke like comics gate. They're one of the it's like, you know, certain game developers, they are some of the wokest of the woke safe space, snowflake, unironically, just terrible. And what's that guy also looks exactly like I would think you would look by the way, the guy who was describing it looks like, bro, he's definitely simping. Yeah, I can tell you that I'm sorry. Somebody out there. Yeah. And what's funny about this is that if you look at the other characters they introduced, they're also not good. It's not like, you know, this is just the weak spot. And then the rest of the comic looks amazing. No, they all look really bad. Here we have another one screen time, a meme obsessed super teen. This this just screams of Hey fellow kids, like what you're like, they like safe space and memes like oh my goodness, but a meme obsessed super teen whose brain became connected to the internet after becoming exposed to his grandfather's experimental internet gas that makes that's poorly written. That makes sense. Now he can see augmented reality and real time maps and can instantly Google any fact. Does this make him effectively a genius? He sure acts like it does. Okay, so essentially his superpower is the internet. Yeah, which because smartphones everybody has like this is a very weak, weak superhero. So we have the girl who can do snowflake throwing stars. That's pretty good, I guess. The guy who can only protect other people, it's defensive. I mean, whatever, that's fine. This guy who was like Google or ask Jeeves. And then here's this thing, be negative. And if you're listening on a podcast or platform right now, he looks like someone from a panic at the disco concert from the 2000s. It's bad. He's called be negative. A teen living vampire exposed to Michael Morbius's blood as a child in a rogue, but life-saving medical procedure, he's still ages like a regular kid. Okay, that's less cool than but has all the abilities of Morbius. He's also obsessed with all the music and attitude of a classic long past of classic long past decades like the 90s and the 2000s. The world is a vampire and so am I. That doesn't even make sense. And also it's like 2000s nostalgia. It's too recent to have been to be cool, right? Because you have like the 80s and even now 90s past each maybe, but this is like hot topic stuff, which is like it's not been long enough to be trendy again. It's so cringy to watch these these. It's only like the writers of the surprise were like between the ages of 35 and like 45. Yeah. It's so cringy to watch what they think the kids like. You're so far removed from actual pop culture is staggering. Oh my goodness. Oh yeah. Okay, so trailblazer. This is this is my favorite one. A regular kid scooped up into the world of teenage superheroing who by the way is a body positive superhero of color. Her magic backpack is actually pocket dimension with seemingly infinite space from which she can pull out useful or random objects. It's not always under her control. She claims to get her power from God but quote not the God you're thinking of so very edgy there. Yeah. This this is a crap superpower. Like you can just it's random stuff. Who knows? I can give you my first reaction was why didn't someone better just take the backpack? Yes. Like it seems like the backpack is the thing you wanted this equation. Yeah. Give it to one of the useful people. Give it to be negative or something at least I would like trim the fat down. I mean that's not I didn't mean that but like you know like make your your fighting for a little leaner a little more effective. Yeah. Who who's going to tune in for the adventures of these people? Well no one that that's the short of it. I don't think anyone will. I think that Marvel recently has come up with a series of things. Now I don't know the actual financial details behind this but I know the lot of them that they've put out have been you know like the black swans and things like this. They're like it's like very peripheral success if anything right. And I just think this is such a I think people have gotten jobs because of ideology not talent. Right. Because I'm thinking I saw people I was scrolling through social media seeing what people were saying about this there are people who are hating on this who admit I'm I'm a lefty I'm progressive but this is just bad and like I'm someone who I can actually put aside politics if I want to watch something. You know to a certain point if it's just like a two hour long sermon I'm probably going to get bored but this just seems like really bad writing very lazy the characters are ugly and I don't just mean like they're not attracted but it's like the character design does not look good. That's why it was part of why I didn't think this was real because I thought if this is something from Marvel the characters should look better than this just in their concept in their naming and their abilities just everything about this is low tier. It shocks me that this is Marvel and actually I think this will probably be another example of like get woke go broke. We recently saw that so Shira there's the new Netflix Shira which if you guys remember in 2018 I think got a lot of attention because people weren't happy with the redesign and the kind of very clear feminist bent of its creators. She was essentially redesigned to look like a little boy it's just been announced now that the current season will be its last as we have a release date. So that series received rave reviews from critics everyone who is in the media loved it but apparently people aren't watching it because it's being cancelled after just I think like two years on the air or something like that. I think this will probably be a similar thing and actually Thundercat's Roar is another thing where they they tried to like do the super woke edgy Kalar style thing. I don't know if that's been confirmed that it's canceled but a lot of people are saying that it is and it's like I used to think that capitalism meant that you know companies would do whatever for the money and I think in a lot of ways that's true but what we're seeing is that there are some people in these jobs who are so ideologically motivated they don't care. They're not capitalist people running the company anyway yeah so happy to take the laws to push their ideology. Yeah it's like yeah you know people we're not really making money but at least some people are watching this non-binary twin set called safe space and snowflake and I can only imagine how bad the actual comic is going to be but the story lines are going to be. It's all funded by their big movies you know that. Yeah. That's the other thing and then their movies those movies are by the way littered with progressive propaganda it's not as obvious but it's it's there too. Yeah very true. But they'll survive by virtue of those movies if we keep going to. Yeah well that's why they call them tent poles right because they're the ones that prop everything up. Part of me now is kind of I'm thinking maybe we should get like an addition when it comes out just so we can see how bad it is like do they go to fight against microaggressions like the pay gap. I mean I'm trying to think of anything else their powers could be suited for. Couldn't be some blonde blonde kid too microagression of course. Yeah with some like jaw that could shave ice or something like that he'll be the bad guy. Maybe that would actually be something to do in the future but I think that's going to wrap it up for today. If you guys are watching live be sure to stay on this stream because we're going to be back in just a few seconds to go over your super chats but for now we will see you next week."
