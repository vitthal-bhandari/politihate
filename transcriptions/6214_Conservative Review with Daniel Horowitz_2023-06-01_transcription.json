    "text": " politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative true. The conservative review with Daniel Burns and welcome back fellow American Patriots and Minimans standing at the ready to fight as if our lives liberty property and all that matters is on the line because it truly is here at CR podcast. It is Thursday the first month first day of June which has been hijacked for the rainbow Ramadan where we have a national religion promoting sin licentiousness disgustingness but here we always have family pride patriot pride fidelity pride here's here's where we're at okay it's been a busy week but here's where we're at on the one hand we have never faced so many existential crises to our way of life our economy our bodies our religion our minds our souls our children and we're gonna talk about some of these things with the nexus between mental illness autism and transgenderism and vaccines all kind of loosely tying together we're gonna have on Dr. Peter McCullough coming up soon but to tie into the whole debt ceiling adultery betrayal Trump actually saying he doesn't care about it like every other important issue and everything we're at on the one hand where we face this onslaught on the other hand there is this budding bottom up movement I think we are seeing some degree of backlash people did call their congressman we are seeing the boycotts against the rainbow jihad be more successful than they've ever been but here's where the rubber meets the road we do not have at a leadership level a movement at a leadership level to connect the dots to connect the fire and put that led down radiance to where the target needs to be see ultimately we face a crisis of truth that no matter what comes out and more information is coming out exposing the debt ceiling thing was a fraud the covid stuff was a fraud the vaccines were dangerous as hell but the policies don't change is like there's no way we're all looking at this debt deal and it got worse every day the more we found that about it there's no way I mean there's gonna be a whole sale rebellion but less than a third of the Republicans voted against it they got what they wanted even though more Democrats actually supported it than Republicans which is all we need to know but nothing changes and this is what I saw yesterday when I saw the headline it was kind of washed away in the news cycle that the FDA gave full approval to Pfizer's RSV shot and I'm thinking after everything we know about what Pfizer did never has a private company been so empowered by government to commit such an atrocity against life and liberty in its most literal sense and yet they could come along with a new trial oh it's 67 to 85 percent effective against RSV here's another shot for you knowing that there's nothing we can do to stop it just like the debt ceiling betrayals like come on Kevin McCarthy cannot get away with that yeah you can because we don't have a serious movement with a serious leader as we see we have this guy writing these psychotic screeds about DeSantis's name every day sounds like a retard so we don't have a critical mass we don't have the sons of liberty we don't have a Sam Adams we have a bunch of vaccine injured retards running the show on the fake right that's too busy embracing rainbow Ramadan month and we're left with this onslaught against our society of this most disgusting agenda the salt on our bodies with every seniors now gonna be convinced to get this death shot wherever you turn we don't have a team on the field which is why no matter how compelling our case is for or against something the policies won't change until we get some sort of political leadership to lead that fight and I don't have easy answers to this I really don't not show what to do with it but it's amazing how Pfizer could come out right in the open right in the open in their own data their own data shows that it would take 16,000 doses to prevent 22 RSV cases and seniors remember seniors already got it so it's gonna be mild doesn't know evidence even in their data that it prevents death that there is death because there is no RSV death among seniors meanwhile the vaccine group had 22 more serious adverse events than the placebo it had 14 more severe adverse events and three more deaths so there's no evidence that prevented an RSV death but in their own lying data imagine a company that literally lied about everything from my or Corditis to strokes to fetal maternal problems and menstrual bleeding everything from A to Z they could put out another more lying data but even their lying trial and by the way Ventavia that same company that that fabricated the entire clinical trial for them coordinated it they also did this one and they could show more all-cause mortality in the vaccine group and I forget the amount of time but it was a short follow-up time one month one month it was I'm looking at it now table eight one month follow-up okay so that's that's a big deal in one month to have three more deaths you can imagine it gets worse over time and also the negative efficacy kicks in over time like we've learned with these respiratory viral vaccines and it's like it doesn't matter I mean this is a big deal this will be given to every senior at a doctor's office at a pharmacy and then in short order will go down the totem pole of the age stratified approvals and eventually be placed on the child vaccination schedule so we're gonna talk about that with Dr. McCullough as well we are nowhere closer to having Republicans focus on that so let me just say the good news let me read to you a quote this from Olivia Beaver she's the political white not White House Capitol Hill corresponded Randy Weber who's supposedly a Freedom Caucus member but never sides of the Freedom Caucus he said he thought the debt deal was good but that he and his wife were inundated back in their district well I would like to think that people don't understand that this bill does actually move the ball forward they're not getting it and so they're saying don't vote for it so if I listen to my constituency I'll be voting no so I always tell you guys calling your congressman and organizing other people to do it and certainly a state legislature because you'll have more of a outside share impact you'll be more impactful than than even voting so this along with the boycotts is starting but imagine if we had the top 50 shows and voices doing what I do so I would encourage you to still call your members look at the ones who voted for it there are 71 really would have been 72 Lauren Bobert couldn't make it or something so on the one hand there were 72 Republicans would have voted no only 46 Democrats voted no you saw Hakim Jeffries the minority leader of the Democrats working hand in glove with McCarthy the uni party was on full display full display before our eyes and by the way 29 Republicans voted against the rule so that forced him to come to Akim and get Democrats to vote for the rule and Axias is reporting that he promised them earmarks he promised them favors to do it so he sold us down the river to get Democrats to support such a horrible thing there will only be a handful of Democrats voting against it in the Senate and by the way even the ones voting no it's just kind of like because there are so many provisions in it so it's always easier to vote no you don't want to be hit by your base for even cosmetically voting against something that could be portrayed as cutting welfare benefits but it's not like even the AOC and Bernie Sanders types are hopping mad at it it's on full display in front of your eyes whether it's vaccines whether it's the transgender jihad whether it's obviously the debt ceiling and the spending and the weaponization of government this entire conservative movement and Republican party is fake what do we do about it that is what I would challenge my colleagues with what do we do about it it's just unreal here is a clip of Donald Trump he was finally asked on a Iowa radio show what do you think about the debt ceiling deal take a listen here there's a lot going on in our country and there's a lot of things we need to discuss the debt ceiling has just passed I think it's a horrible deal but I don't know what you think well it is what it is it was going to pass and then plenty of votes and then we'll get it done permanently and properly so here it is what it is was gonna pass they had the votes he sounded he wasn't too interested in it but if you look at his facial expressions in the video because there's a video of it this is how he governed this is what he did when he was present it's like yeah you know that's the votes let them do what they do yeah okay I'll sign whatever you give to me the notion that this man has somehow changed and learned his lesson if anything he's gotten worse again it is indefensible from any MAGA America first populist conservative any perspective to support this guy it is indefensible I'm sick of my colleagues like I like them both this like fake gay neutrality that they're putting on you know what I mean give me a break take a freaking stand for once no one's perfect but between the two it's night and day on every issue that matters give me a break but that's where we are now anyway obviously following this debt ceiling deal I will tell you we're gonna have major problems with the dollar with we're gonna have a repo crisis from this like we did last time they raised the debt ceiling now is the time to diversify with gold as they talk about fake diversity this month talk about financial diversity birch gold makes it easy to convert an IRA or 401k into an IRA in precious metals here's what you need to do text Daniel to 9898 to get a free info kit on gold you'll see their array of different silver and gold

a lot more on the table going on with the rainbow ji-had with debt ceiling stuff I want to get to if not today tomorrow but I want to kind of zoom out for a little bit more of a the generic discussion but it's just as important as the other things we've been talking about so dr. Peter McCulloch doesn't need much of an introduction to this audience it's obviously been a fixture in the medical freedom movement notorious for fighting for early treatment fighting for truth about the vaccines fighting for informed consent but one of the things I think we've all discovered throughout this fight is that covid likely wasn't the first go-around of this mass psychosis among the medical profession where they will literally do what's antithetical to the Hippocratic oath and it certainly is not the last time as we're seeing with RSV shots with the monkey pox shots all of these rushed vaccines that are prima facia problematic have a negative cost benefit matrix and they just get approved but then there's other aspects of this so we have a lot of these trends and civilization and typically you'll have trends with physical health mental health over time people become sicker with certain illnesses and there's often a reason for it but then you have a scenario where according to CDC over a period of two years the number of high schoolers who identify as transgender has tripled then you have every every major hospital medical association promoting castration mutilation hormone this cutting off breasts there and I'm thinking what this can't this can't be true and then we have all these trends with autism we have all these trends with mental illness now you have to see what's connected what's not but dr. McCulloch has actually been working on a theory of medical malfeasance that runs much deeper than what we saw with COVID and clearly it's deeper than just the code vaccine there's problems with other vaccines that we've been lied to but also their mentality with this transgenderism and what they're doing and not doing and how much does that tie into mental illness how much does that even tie into this mass violence we talked about this school shootings certainly they're not exclusively transgender but we've seen a lot of it that's been covered up by the media so dr. McCulloch has really branched out in terms of his research his thoughts he has a terrific sub-stack courageous discourse it's really a must read every day in your inbox you could follow him at p underscore McCulloch MD on Twitter dr. McCulloch it's been way too long welcome back to Blaze Media well thanks for having me and thanks for all your courage out there I tell you what you've been a crusader for truth and so many of us feel connected in this battle I can tell you as a practicing internist and cardiologist like any doctor now we are becoming very familiar with LGBT and with the T being transgender since the rise of transgenderism it's actually in our medical practices now so it's ubiquitous so so here's the thing I thought in my mind I never looked for any medical physical explanation to me it was very simple we never had social media before this generation and now you have the ability to make something ubiquitous you can make a fat ubiquitous for example in three seconds everyone could do something so unnatural as covering their breathing holes with masks you know in the most absurd situations you could have people obsessing about Ukraine that they couldn't even find on a map in three seconds so you could have people you could have a fad now with kids with rising mental illness here's here's a thing you're really you know you might not be a man after all maybe you're a woman maybe you're this if you tell people that it's cool to dress up like a cat and a dog on TikTok there's no question you'd be able to gain a lot of traction with that over time so to me that explains a lot of it but but you have a working theory that I wanted you to share with the audience a pandemic of mental contagion autism and the rise of transgenderism take it from there you know I asked the question as an epidemiologist are two exploding epidemics are they related and the two epidemics are the explosion of autism when I was a kid the rate of autism was one in ten thousand the CDC now says it's one in thirty six there is no childhood illness that is more rapidly epidemic than autism which is a severe disorder it's a neuropsychiatric disorder to forever influences that child the rest of their lives family members there's quite a spectrum of autism from being severely disabled unable to leave the house you know needing full-time 24 by seven care to to being mainstreamed but with what's called autism spectrum disorder where there's some features of it but child is able to go to school and then ultimately enter society independently and the other epidemic as you mentioned is transgenderism and while there have always been homosexual males who want to dress as a woman that was relatively rare among homosexual males and there were always women who may have tendencies towards men what has really evolved almost it seems like in the last you know year or so is an absolute explosion of transgenderism to the point of it influencing marketing various brand trends etc so I asked the question could autism be related to transgenderism and sure enough Vander Miesen and colleagues published about ten years ago from the Netherlands an observation that 20 percent of young people in Dutch transgender clinics had a clinical diagnosis autism 20 percent and so there's a giant spectrum beyond those with clinical autism called autism spectrum disorder and so it I said oh my Lord this is an incredible overlap and then study started to hit one after another one this paper by warrior and colleagues I thought was very important and what they demonstrated was that and let me get the exact citation for you warrior and colleagues which was published in nature communications a really high-level journal analyzed 641,860 individuals with gender dysphoria so that so gender dysphoria is the clinical diagnosis for which transgender hormones and surgeries are prescribed and they assess people of gender disorder for autistic tendencies with some standardized scores and there was about four different I'm sorry about five different transgender scores used and guess what those with gender dysphoria are off the Richter scale testing out for autism Wow so it's not that every woman who has this gender dysphoria is necessarily autistic but a good number of them are a good number then seem to be right very large overlap and then more data started to come in which was I think very very disturbing so a paper was published by by Mendes and colleagues and it was a literature review describing 2,921 murders murders where an LGBT person was the victim this is in the peer-reviewed literature this is absolutely stunning 16 papers in total and in general it their perpetrator is generally a male the victim is generally a male and about 40% of the time they knew each other and so that paper was out there and then to really bring it home was a paper of mortality and this just hit the mainstream mainstream this was in JAMA journal the American Medical Association first author is Sarah Jackson titled the paper is analysis of mortality among transgender and gender diverse adults in England and this is alarming suicide homicide death from accidental poisoning many fold higher in transgender compared to normal men or normal women so mortality is higher and again that was you know published in a very high-level journal and the burden of psychiatric care is much higher after the transgender procedure so so this paper was published by Heisel Gorman and colleagues from the uniform services University in Bethesda titled the paper mental health care utilization of transgender youth before and after gender affirming treatment so to actually take the hormones and surgery worsens the psychiatric problem and so finally I think the coup de gras on this Daniel you're gonna be astounded by this because states are moving forward with legislation to ban hormones and surgery in the youth to show to ban this you know nobody has a problem in adulthood if someone wants to whatever they want to do an adulthood but during childhood to ban this with this idea that you know autistic children in a sense are being preyed upon by this transgender industry but so because this legislation came out I was astounded to realize this and I posted this on May 4th that the the autism self-advocacy network ASAN condemns restrictions on gender affirming care they they came out with a statement on this so this is an advocacy network these are largely adults with autism or other concerned individuals and so it's basically saying the autistic people want gender change so you know this brings it full circle here I think it's conclusive that that transgenderism is driven by the epidemic of autism the autistic people want this and the question on the table is should it continue because it increases the burden of psychiatric disease and increases mortality so obviously increasing mortality you know when someone is this severely mentally ill they're gonna be prone to suicide and things like that and certainly when you start screwing with the hormones obviously you have the concurrent rise in general mental illness depression to me it's not a surprise that this same hockey stick that you're seeing the last few years with the rise of people saying I'm the opposite gender suddenly you also have the just the explosion of you know 25 30 percent rates of clinical depression among among teenagers just just a perfect storm obviously the lockdowns you know certainly aggravated that all going on but you referenced another extra point there that you brought up in the wake of that you know shooting in Nashville of that Christian school by this this female who said she was a really a male and you have this theory about hormones this hormone treatment creating this undercurrent of violence that has not been noted could you be it could you elaborate on that a little bit well you know as I pointed out the Mendez studies shows that LGBT are the victims of homicides in a large number but the the Jackson analysis that was in JAMA points out that both suicide and homicide are causes of death in these individuals and some of these suicides occur in the context of mass murders and we just need the case example now and I think we're close to half a dozen or more of transgender individuals young ones actually becoming the perpetrator in a mass murder in the case you you pointed out and and so there remember autism is a neuro psychiatric illness meaning there's neurological and psychiatric aspects to it and there are certainly outbursts of anger inability to control various you know emotional states now add into this hormones particularly the post-pubular hormones which are straight androgens or estrogens you know that makes even normal people irritable so you can imagine having the neuropsychiatric disorder or some other related disorder and then hormonal manipulation creating this situation where you know it's sad for everyone because in these mass murders many times the perpetrator loses their life as well and this I think the Jackson analysis is so disturbing that you know it increases mortality all the way around it's it honestly if there was another surgery or hormones that were increasing mortality they'd be taken off the market so so you're saying we have an autism bubble that no one denies you have a broad mental illness skyrocketing across the spectrum and then we have this rise in violence okay we have this rise in you know these mass shootings now obviously you know you take this whole gender dysphoria out of it you still have there's clearly this culture of violence we could just talk about the way our youth are raised and just this lack of wholesome life there's so much to say on that but but you rightly noted it is covered up by the media there is a growing percentage of these cases that actually are from from an gender dysphoric individual and more than we think so you're saying you take a 15 year old girl a 17 year old girl and you and and especially if they're already autistic I don't know if that was the case in Tennessee and then you juice them up with hormones well what happens yeah it's not it's certainly not good the Jackson analysis again JAMA open network January 30th of 2023 so it's pretty recent data let's just take compared to normal women just use the example of the I believe it was Nashville where it was a transgender woman a girl who wanted to be a man you know the the risk there is the relative risk was 5.62 greater risk of suicide or homicide and the confidence intervals were 2.65 to 11.91 that's highly statistically significant it's very hard in the psychiatric literature to ever achieve statistical significance so these are striking results and the fact that they're coming out in the peer reviewed scientific literature where you know in general medicine doesn't have an opinion on people's choice you medicines a very diverse you know always have had equity inclusion people make their own choices as a doctor you know I take care of drug abusers well I don't go if if you didn't get the shot yeah I take it and they weren't so diverse I know but listen you listen I take care of drug abusers I take care of prisoners I take care of people of all walks of life homosexual heterosexuals bisexuals I mean that's just medicine we see people of all walks of life and I don't think anybody has any problem with someone's choice however when when physicians are prescribing the hormones in doing the surgery and the result is a transgendered person and the result shows that there is harm it has to be stopped it just has to be you know it took with it from the time we knew smoking caused lung cancer it took doctors 40 years to ultimately come around to doctors used to smoke they smoked in the operating room from the time we knew the opioids were addictive and could be life threatening it's taken over 20 years to get this opioid pandemic under control is largely prescription opioids that doctors prescribe doctors are not quick to recognize systematic errors and delivery of care and this one this one I think is going to be shut down honestly before the the doctors shut it down themselves there was a recent paper in New England Journal of Medicine highlighting the fact that there will be severe penalties for programs that continues papers published by Mallory and colleagues and it was in Gemma May 18th 2023 and they indicated that boy states have legislation all over the place moving forward there is going to be bans on care with clear legislative attraction in it highlights everything that's going to happen the states include Alabama Arkansas Arizona and Texas 118 bills across 31 states total they're all going to move forward 11 bills have been passed into law Arkansas Georgia Idaho Indiana Iowa Kentucky Mississippi South Dakota Tennessee Utah and West Virginia and yeah and listen to this yeah Daniel listen to this 15 states have laws and policies that ban gender affirming care for minors with the stipulations the state bans physicians who continue to face four major direct penalties one medical license disciplinary action to private right of legal action against physicians which can include extensions on malpractice and statutes and limitations three civil actions against this the states can take against physicians and four felonies felony provisions this was in New England Journal of Medicine Wow no I mean that is definitely something I think because it's just so jarring cutting someone's genitalia off it doesn't take a doctor to understand how systemically damaging that is but I think this is a good way to transition into the second half and really we need a whole show just for this but you mentioned something very profound that it takes generations for the medical profession to correct an error and let's talk about what could be the greatest lie of the century I think you and I are in the same boat you as a famed cardiologist published and so much so much medical literature and me as a layman we're you know it kind of never questioned it we back we were born with with the notion that there's vaccines and okay this vaccine that vaccine all right you know you just kind of put in the body and it stimulates an antibody response and okay you know everyone's happy you're now immune and never really thought about it and then you know I heard people over the years saying well you know vaccines is caught all cause autism like that's crazy of course it's debunked it's debunked and I thought that really up until um covid and then even when the vaccine the covid shot started coming out and we're like oh my gosh this is poison I had this cognitive distance yet this thing is really I mean this is like a bio weapon but everything else is amazing but then is 2021 went on and I had people like you and Dr. Cole and all these other people on and we started learning immunology and epidemiology in real time so we're able to really learn these things I was like wait a minute I'm learning a lot about antibodies they're not all good there's God made the right type in the right amount in the right classification in the right location like well wait a minute the stuff we're seeing about the IgG 4 and the tolerating rather neutralizing and the auto antibodies and all these syndrome autoimmune syndromes we see in theirs I'm thinking wait a minute what's with all these other respiratory viral vaccines and even other vaccines that are ever increasing and then to bring the show kind of full circle we have this explosion of autism which you know could come from neurological inflammation which we certainly see this crosses the blood brain barrier we see the explosion of the allergies I'm a lot younger than you Dr. McCullough but still we never had peanut allergy issues when I was in school it started like abruptly shortly after my time as a school age kid you have all these allergies all these auto immune that the colitis and the the um well these stomach auto autoimmune stuff exploding and there's no good explanation here's the question for you is it does it take Sherlock Holmes to figure out that taking a kid and just shoving an ever-increasing amount of uncontrolled antibody spikes might be problematic for some people you know when I was a kid we had the oral polio and we had diphtheria tetanus pertussis and smallpox so basically vaccinated against five things now it turns out that diphtheria and pertussis are easily treated with a Z-pack if we would have had a zithermize back then we wouldn't have needed that and then tetanus is largely managed with wound care there is neonatal tetanus but that occurs before that you know the the baby has a chance to defend against it so a maternal vaccination is thought to handle that and then of course polio which which could could be devastating that's pretty much what we have and as I mentioned the rate of autism one in 10,000 now today a child today receives 72 shots 72 different shots that's before SARS-CoV-2 the COVID shots which add a lot more because they're every six months I think it's up over a hundred and about 16 different diseases with new ones being added all the time including recently the rest choice and social virus so it's causing all of us to re-review the data so here's just one paper just one paper Gayer and Gayer published from an early paper from the VAERS system this is long before COVID it's published in 2002 the title of the paper is an analysis of the occurrence of convulsions and death after childhood vaccination so convulsions and deaths so we we you know we're not even talking about autism we're just talking about something that occurs immediately with these shots and what they found is that the more shots that are given together so diphtheria pertussis tetanus together as opposed to separate shots markedly increases the risk and and and then the time at which these occur is strongly related to you know the outcome so if they have been closer and closer to the time of vaccination the relative risks are become even higher in terms of association like 60 relative risk of 62 which is which is through the roof and what what the Gayer and Gayer is is saying is basically listen this is this is real there are kids who die and in this analysis that sadly there were as I recall I believe there was I believe there was over a thousand deaths so you know this occurred over a long period of time but you know we have a situation where papers like this have been published in the literature there's about 80 papers or so publishing in the literature suggesting vaccines could be related to autism what's most convincing are the vignette papers so the vignette is there's a normal child comes in gets six different vaccines at one six different antigens at once has a febrile seizure doesn't die but then from that point forward the child is autistic and there are many of those vignettes published you go on social media and mothers will tell you that all the time and I think what's going on those because usually talking about a kid a few months old so you don't have much of a baseline go off of but the mothers do the mother the eye tracking is different the breastfeeding becomes different suckling response to the environment and the mothers believe they can tell that they can tell a difference and then on top of that we have a growing literature which is very interesting about going natural going natural meaning that there are parents who say listen we're not going to take any shots now interestingly the parents who decide to go natural tend to be older and they tend to have another child with autism so when the next one comes there a bit wait it turns out those are the two risk factors for autism older adults and siblings with autism so here we have a child that who's already predisposed autism and I can tell you in all the studies done so far going natural that is getting no vaccines has a much lower rate of autism and neuropsychiatric disorders asthma allergic dermatitis need for tympanostomy tubes a pharyngitis it's it's clear that natural is better there's multiple studies Paul Thomas published one hooker and Miller published another multiple pediatric practices you know and looking at this concept so in my analysis so far I you'll see a bunch of these come out of my subject I don't think it's any particular vaccine that is the smoking gun for autism but it looks like the process of hyper vaccination that is it's the multiplicity and it's the multiplicity of antigenic exposures with the right susceptibility the cytokines are the inflammatory mediators they that you know quickly rise they penetrate the blood bane barrier quickly some of them are neurotoxic and they look like they forever change some of these kids to becoming like autistic where it was all at once like like Aaron Siri always says that you know with the kids it's gray it's gradual and be generally they're given to babies and you have so many people that either the person themselves say you know I just don't feel right I just haven't felt right since I got the shots or their relatives are like is that guy okay either physically and I know you've written a lot about this there's um our friend Aaron has put togethers the 29 case studies on psychosis from the covid shots but but with the traditional kind of childhood schedule shots you can't really the kid can't articulate that and it's not as apparent but now that we understand the mechanism I'm thinking like yeah I mean you got all that inflammation from the overstimulation of the immune system and now that I understand the relationship between that and pathogens but also cancers autoimmune allergy response and then yes the neurological which we see all over theirs and all over the case studies so here's my concern I don't doctor mccoll I don't understand how this is not the biggest public policy issue this affects every human being I got four kids unfortunately we're already over most the hump but but we're running around from one pediatrician to another and when we think we found a good one that they harass the heck out of you make you feel like you're a dirtbag for questioning it you're stupid it's all good any make any manufacturer any amount but the more I study I look back even to things that I thought were like gospel I mean like the pertussis one and by the way now they're they're loading it on pregnant women more than ever because in 2016 they expanded the indemnification to shots used during pregnancy so there's a torrent of them and they even pressure the the husband to often get another DPT for pertussis and I look at the data and I see more negative efficacy like we saw with covid I see immune suppression we see with a lot of the flu shots the T cells tamping down there's been tons of studies over the last 15 years on that that we never noticed on which make a lot of sense we see a lack of rationale we see a lack of all cause mortality benefit and and and you know to be fair I was always saying oh the covid shots we never did anything like that it's rushed and the manufacturers were like we've never had bigger trials than ever and they were actually right they're fraudulent but they were bigger I look at like HIB and some of this stuff and or HEP be I mean they had like a few day follow-up with this stuff well yeah I mean hepatitis B is the is I think the most egregious giving it on the first day of life the registration trials were just a few hundred children and there was only five days of follow-up and the only clinical indication where as a doctor I would say a child needs a newborn child needs it is is with a mother who has active hepatitis B who's actively IV drug abusing which is very rare but for every baby born to be blasted with the hepatitis B shot on the day of birth is is simply overkill you know a paper is going to come out of my sub-stack regarding homophilus influenza B which by the way there's almost no disease that's had a greater reduction coincident with the with the introduction of vaccines as homophilus influenza B it's a it's a bacteria a encapsulated bacteria introduced in 1985 and the rates of invasive disease plummeted but I asked the question do people still get the illness and does the vaccine really protect them and I a paper by suitors and colleagues from the CDC published in 2018 summarized it now remember the vaccine only stops homophilus influenza serotype B it doesn't stop any of the other serotypes it turns out that only 1.8% of all homophilus is serotype B and of those there were 77 cases reported it turns out that 73.9% of people who got them were either fully vaccinated or partially vaccinated they were following the vaccine schedule so you know while it may have had a broad public health impact you know we can't look at somebody in the eye and tell them they're protected here when the majority of people who get the disease you know are vaccinated I used to think this stuff was like a coat of iron I you know the vaccine was synonymous with a cure and the more we look at things you know this concept of a leaky waning efficacy it's pretty ubiquitous it might have been really egregious with this one and particularly respiratory viral ones are never really successful but you look at a lot of these mumps and measles outbreaks we've seen it we've seen it obviously the monkey pox is a joke that recent cluster in Chicago I believe was at nine out of twelve or something like that were you know just got the two doses of Johnios this whole thing we've been lied to and then also just the rationale a lot of people say are you anti-vax or pro-vax and to me it's like saying are you pro-surgery are you pro-kimotherapy well you know I mean rarely is something good for all people at all times I think of something like German measles I never even realized this that German measles really aside from pregnant women you know giving birth to a fetus and potentially being problematic to a fetus no man should ever get this I mean before you even look at safety and efficacy just the rationale for it um isn't isn't that true that a lot of this stuff is not necessary for everyone it's true that I remember as a kid that German measles also known as rubella they had a big push for rubella vaccination well it's compelling for women as they enter the child bearing years we used to have 20,000 cases of congenital rubella now we're done like two cases a year so the vaccine is very effective but it should only be restricted for women as they entered the child bearing years there's no reason for a boy to even take the rubella so that's MMR that's actually the R in MMR measles is a non-threatening illness you know mumps is worth a discussion there is mumps orchitis and sterilization that can happen in boys but doesn't happen in girls you know we have to look at each one I I think what's gonna happen is you know 72 vaccine shots plus COVID-19 over a hundred it's too much they're just getting started I mean you got nipa and Zika and I mean they have everything in the pipeline um and obviously the RSV thing really scares me because that was the original ADE shot with negative efficacy and and even Fauci just published a couple months ago admitting that the respiratory viral vaccines are all leaky that they just don't don't address the mucosal and and they're just there's no backstop well Daniel let me say that I can tell you as a doctor we're gonna need to do risk stratification so respiratory syncytial virus in you me our kids and our grandparents is nothing it's honestly like a cold at most we have to do a nebulizer but RSV and a kid with cystic fibrosis could be severe so we're gonna need to do risk stratification some people will need vaccines but not everybody needs a routine schedule I think what needs to go away is the routine schedule and vaccines need to be given according to risk stratification there needs to be a medical necessity and a clinical indication but this idea that you either you're either in or you're out and parents being made to feel uncomfortable by pediatricians that needs to go away because right now it's too much and we need to do risk stratification this is what I fear but you know getting back to the beginning of our discussion with the with the castration stuff it just so I guess evident the draconian nature of it so it has drawn sharp backlash that has spread not just from the people but actually to the political representatives at least in you know the so-called red states but I look at what the second half of our discussion here and forget about the other shots I mean those are sacred whenever we try to address them in legislation and when I'm talking about just the mandates mandating them it was a non-starter in every state but even the COVID shots despite everything that has come out about it itself evident negative efficacy attacks every organ system every corner of the body potentially there's only to my knowledge one state where the health department is putting out informed consent you know dr. Joe latipo in Florida putting out information warning about the risks and and while most people still aren't getting it at this point they're on to it but if a woman becomes pregnant that's kind of a status change the OBGs are pressuring them and I'm thinking here's the thing certain things are like you said a concern for newborns RSV is a concern um rebel is a concern but what's gonna happen now that you take a pregnant woman we all know the European medicines agency documents seem to show that Pfizer knew about um the the intervention spreading through the placenta you take a woman and now you give them flu RSV COVID another MMR another DPT and who knows who knows what else what does that portend for the fetus no one can know I mean any injection that a mother takes is risky um I would say this that anything that can cause a fever in a mother that just put that alone a fever a fever in a mother can cause precipitous delivery of the baby it can actually cause a miscarriage or a stillbirth it's too risky so the benefit of any of these shots in women is far outweighed by the risk of losing the baby and and so many mothers are going to decide to go natural in pregnancy because it just makes a lot of sense and a recent Kaiser family foundation survey suggests parents are in a much higher proportion gonna go natural on the childhood vaccine schedule and decide later on you know there may be compelling the kids go to college to get the meningococcal vaccine it may be compelling if they go into health care to get hepatitis B vaccine they're gonna basically opt to go natural because they've lost trust in the CDC ASEP group because of this hyper vaccination adding COVID and they don't seem to show any concern over safety now that's what scares me because you want to tell me hey there's some risk whatever that's believable but when you start saying everything is good for everyone and needed at all times there's just something funny there final question here if I make you king for a day what is the one policy change that you feel could bring out the truth and up end this entire racket but I think the big policy change that would happen immediately is we would outlaw any mandates associated with vaccines any so any at the school level K through 12 college for any vaccine routine vaccines COVID-19 and so if vaccines became completely elective then we can let them you know stand on their own merits and the evolving data what makes everybody uncomfortable is a mandate and also the the indemnification I think is the big one every day you see Honda you know recalling different airbags because they're on the hook for liability and often you wonder how dubious those recalls are whereas with with this I mean it's an all you could eat buffet and there is no incentive for them to make this stuff safer I mean I'm just looking with my mouth open watching these a sip and verboc hearings and they'll openly admit that yeah we don't know if there's all cause mortality benefit we don't really see seniors getting sick from RSV so we can't tell yeah there's a signal for Guillain-Barre yeah someone died in the you know GSK Pfizer trial or GSK RSV trial and the Pfizer shot is pretty similar but we'll approve that anyway and it's like nothing seems to ever matter what is it gonna take is it doesn't have to start from the medical profession does it have to start from the political realm does it have to start from parenting I just I feel like there is more of an awakening because I'm an example of that well let me let me respond to what you said what makes people uncomfortable is a mandate they feel like they have to take it for some reason to go to school go to work and then if they take it if they're harmed there's no recourse there's no liability there you know there's there's indemnification the manufacturer so I say if the mandates go first if you know we can't mandate that you swallow a pill or mandate you have a surgery we certainly can't mandate that someone takes a vaccine if the mandates drop and even if the liability protection is still there then people can make a choice and people can say listen if if if if there's there's no liability you know if there's no recourse if something happens I'm I'm probably not gonna take it it be similar to renting a pair of skis you may say listen you know you rent the ski rental you know there's no there's no liability for the guy who makes the skis that you know you may not ski so people can make their own choices now the 1986 liability legislation said the vaccines have unavoidable harm and that's the reason why they have to have liability protection for the manufacturers because no one would take them and the vaccine manufacturers wouldn't they provide them because they have unavoidable harms but we have to address that that's really the the elephant in the room is the harms and one of the ways to make large numbers of people harmed go away is to have fewer number of people take the product there there has to be targeted protection for people at risk no absolutely and there has to be an honest discussion of what those risks are of the shots themselves boy we've come full of circles has been very enlightening folks you could still get the courage to face COVID-19 Dr. McCullough's book with John Lee courageous discourse and sub-stack and again could follow him at p underscore McCullough MD on Twitter let's do this more often very enlightening and thanks so much for joining us today good review thanks for having me oh boy was there a lot to digest their mental illness autism transgenderism leading to violence and then what causes autism or at least turbocharge is it when you look at the depth of what these bastards have done to us I mean we used to think evil was Iran al-Qaeda North Korea even China what the western cabal has done to us and for longer than we probably are willing to recognize it is truly unconscionable and it really is the legacy of the third Reich is the fourth Reich again they were very sciency and you know medicine and science and cultured and advanced beware of evil embodied through a suit rather than a primitive uniform because those are the worst people imaginable we need a full commission auditing everything we're doing it's funny like you know Kevin McCarthy said he wants to have a debt commission it's like we don't need a commission on that you see prima facia what government does it's wrong and right this stuff is more complicated we need a commission auditing vaccination mass vaccination each one individually the rationale the safety the efficacy the confluence of multiple shots together we need to start from scratch on this we need an honest discussion the tranny stuff is pretty pretty obvious to cut someone's balls off ain't healthy so i don't think uh we need to convince people on that but we do need to fight it in the culture and we will do as this rainbow ron rama don month proceeds again let me know your feedback on this show questions comments concerns for dr mcculler uh daniel harowitz at startmail.com at rm conservative on twitter and you can follow my
