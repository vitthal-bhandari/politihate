On Instagram, I am at Monica Crowley underscore. And on Twitter and through social, I am at Monica Crowley. Also by email, I am at Monica Crowley podcast at gmail.com. Send me an email and let me know what's on your mind. Thank you so much for joining me on this holiday week. We are having a fantastic time. If you've been with us all week long, you know that we have had a very special journey on the Monica Crowley podcast this week. We have been talking about the spiritual war that we are all in. Every single American, really everybody around the world. But America being the beacon of human freedom, which is truly a gift from God, America for that reason is in the spiritual crosshairs of the enemy. And what our guest all week calls the little gods, the small G gods, but we are experiencing this spiritual war between good versus evil between God versus the enemy. However, you want to put it, we are under severe demonic assault. And as I've said before, and I will repeatedly say, once you see the spiritual battle, once you see what's going on in the country in those spiritual terms, you can't unsee it. It's right there, clear as a bell in front of you. So we have spent the week extrapolating what is happening today to something much bigger. What is going on on the spiritual plane. And how it explains how it appears that evil is rising, how it's on the march, how it's winning, how it is so in our face and obvious how it doesn't care, how it no longer hides. What is going on and where can we find the answers? All week long, we have been joined by my dear friend who is just an extraordinary spiritual leader and person. Rabbi Jonathan Khan. He is a messianic Jewish rabbi and a new number one New York Times best selling author. He's written all kinds of bestsellers. But his latest one is called and it is so fascinating to me, which is why we devoted the entire week to it. It's called the return of the gods. You can find this extraordinary book at the return of the gods.com the book website. You can buy it through there. You can also get it through Amazon. Barnes and Noble.com wherever you get your books. This book is so important because it digs deep into scripture and biblical prophecy. To describe the dark forces at work in America today and explain so much of really everything we're seeing. So today is our final day with Rabbi Jonathan Khan. Who is going to tie all of this together and leave us with a sense of hope about what we can do about it. Jonathan, welcome back. Great to be with you Monica. Such a pleasure to have you with us all week. For people who are just joining the show today, I hope that they will go back and listen to Monday and Wednesday show this week because really we we have created the arc of the storyline. We have created that the arc of the dark trinity, which he writes about in the return of the gods. So if you're just joining us today, that's great. But also please go back and listen to the first two shows this week because today we're going to tie it all together. For people who are just joining us, Jonathan, can you reset the stage of what we're talking about and the mystery behind the return of the gods. Yes. What the return of the gods opens up is is literally a mystery behind the biggest transformations that are happening to America, to the West, too much of the world that have been changing our lives, our cultures, our families, every single one who's listening to this to this broadcast has is dealing with it. It's affecting you in one way or another. It's affecting our politics, our entertainment, our, our educational system, our future, everything. What if this mystery goes back to ancient times to the Bible and to the ancient writings, inscriptions of the Mesopotamia of Babylon. What if the ancient gods, you know, were there was actually something real to them and what if they returned today, what and why would they return, how would they return, what, what, how would they act, what if they are the invisible agents upon what's really taking over America. That is so irrational, not even natural. Well, that is what this mystery is. And the mystery goes back to what the Bible very clearly establishes that behind the gods of the ancient world, there are actually spirits called an Hebrew shadim called in Greek, Diomania or the demonic realm. And so the thing is that that what what happened is back then, you know, if you look at ancient the ancient world, kind of where the exception, ancient world was pagan and it was under these spirits. Well, then the word of God came in, the gospel came in, came into the Roman Empire, came in then spread. And what it did, it was a revolution in the spiritual realm. Now we're seeing the opposite, we're seeing the undoing of it. But there was a revolution in the spiritual realm. It drove out the gods, drove out the paganism, drove out the spirits. It was it was the greatest mass exorcism in human history. That's what made the West so unique. That's what made America. That's when all the gospel came in, transforms society. But there's an ancient one morning of Jesus that what that if such a nation civilization, culture, society, should ever turn away from God, should ever remove the very protection that that is inside it that has cast these things out. Becomes empty of God turns away from God, the gospel, the faith that saved it, that cleansed it, that exercised it, the spirits that were cast out are going to come back into it. The ancient spirits are going to return. The in it is the ancient gods are going to return. So they're going to return to the to the modern world. They're going to return to America and they're going to become the the unseen invisible agents that are transforming the culture and they're going to seek to repossess it. And and so and and pagan spirits or these dark and spirits are going to seek to take a Christian to Dale Christian civilization and transform it morph it into a pagan one. That is exactly what has happened. If you want to understand what's been happening to our culture, America, the world, our children, it is exactly that. And it is increasing. It's accelerating. And we need to know it because it has to do with you, with each of us. What do we need to know? Where is it going? And what do we need to know to prevail to to stand to overcome? Well, what I get into in the return of the gods is not just the overall, but the specific. And that is that there are specific entities or gods or spirits that we can identify and we can even see what they're doing now based on what they did then and based on their mythologies. It's amazing. And so we've watched as something called the dark Trinity that was back in the time of ancient Israel when it fell away from God has returned to America and the world. And it's basically a triad of gods of Prince of out is the first one's called the possessor. We spoke about that as America began turning away from God in the 1960s. This spear comes in starts the paganization process. The second one is called the enchantress. This is the one that comes next that is the goddess of sexual immorality, sexual revolution, revolutionizing sexuality, changing everything, marriage, family, all that. The third one is the destroyer, the one that causes parents to offer up their own children. Well, that came with abortion. Now 60 million children later. We are. This is where we are. Well, all these things, by the way, none of these things have stopped. Every one of them has continued. It lies behind. Woke ism. It lies behind a political correctness and lies behind what's happening to our children, everything. And now when we get we go to another realm today, it's going to get if you can imagine, it's going to get even more explosive, but it's a fascinating thing. Things are going to be, I believe, are going to become very crystal clear. Oh, throughout the entire week, everything has become even clear. In terms of what is happening in the darkness that has settled across this land. OK, so you mentioned the three, the dark trinity, the possession, the enchantress and the destroyer. And in our last session on Wednesday, you began speaking about the transformer. Who or what is the transformer? The transformer, which is especially relevant right now, the transformer is actually the enchantress in another realm or another dimension. Of her, this is the one of sexuality, but she wasn't just the principality of unbridled sexuality. And they see the sexual revolution, but there was another side to her. There was something strange about her. Remember, I told you that this goddess, Ashtora in the Bible, Ishtar in Babylon, but also Aphrodite and Venus in the West. She she is linked to, you know, when you look up in the sky and you see that that star, it's Venus. And the reason why it's called Venus is because that star has always been linked to this goddess long before there was a Venus was linked to be to this goddess. That was the star, that was the star or the planet, the light. Well, they called it the morning star. They also called Venus the evening star. Now, that's a that's a little clue right now that these are two different things. She's morning star, evening star, two opposites. This principality that's going to give you a it's going to give us a clue into this. Is the principality of merging opposites, blurring opposites. This goddess was now listen, I looked at in the book, I actually show the the inscriptions that, you know, that are there from ancient Mesopotamia. It says something the goddess says, I am a woman. And then she says, I am a man. The hymns to this goddess, the ancient hymn say, you are the one who has the power, you turn a man into a woman and a woman into a man. This is the goddess who is affecting everything right now. This is the spirit of the times right now. This is the spirit behind a spirit of androgyny, the spirit. She blurs the lines of male and female. She confuses the identity of man and woman. She merges them together. She replaces the one with the other and the other with the one. So what would you again, we've asked this question. It's an amazing thing because what would then we, what would we expect to happen if she comes into a culture? We would have, by the way, here's another thing. It doesn't happen at the beginning because it's too radical. You know, you said something, Monica, a few times in these last few days, you said that, you know, it's now it's out. You know, now it's brazen. Now it's out. You know, well, in the beginning, it wasn't because in the beginning, you know, the Godstone come and say, we're going to do this, this, this, because we would say, no, it would be too shocking. You know, America would have rejected it, but they come step by step. And so at the beginning, you have the sexual revolution that's linked to this principality, but you don't have this other part is the deeper part. And so as she begins to take possession of the culture, the more she takes possession, the more this can now come out. And so that's why now we're seeing it more than we have ever seen it before. And so what happens is what we expect to happen is in the culture, we'd expect there to be all of a sudden the breaking down of gender, a war against gender, a war against maleness as man as male, women as female, a movement, a spirit that would blur the lines of sexuality of gender that would try to replace man with woman with woman that tried to merge the two together. And and all, you know, and so, and so that's exactly what we have seen. And this has affected us in every possible way. I mean, because, you know, when you think about this, you know, it's one thing to take sexuality out of marriage. You know, that, that is, that's, that's destructive enough. You know, that, that's what happened in the sexual revolution. But when you take sexuality out of gender, when you take, you know, when you take it out of then you're, I mean, you're destroying humanity. I mean, you're going to, you're doing something big. You, you are going to transform everything when you transform that. And that's exactly what we are witnessing it all goes back to this principality and the return of the gods. Jonathan, I'm going to ask you to please hang tight a lot more ahead. OK, everybody, listen up. We all want to be healthier, right? Well, to get there, we have to have a healthier diet, which is not always easy to do. I can attest to that. You know, that shredded lettuce in a double double and the fruit filling in a doughnut are amazing, but they do not count toward the recommended five servings of fruits and vegetables a day. Sorry to be the one to break it to you, but they don't. I don't always eat healthy either, but I will share that the Mayo Clinic says, if you want to help prevent heart disease, lower blood pressure and cholesterol, eat five servings of fruits. And vegetables every day. I don't and you probably won't. That's why I take field of greens. Unlike other supplements, each fruit and each vegetable in field of greens was medically selected by doctors to support your vital organs, like the heart, lungs, kidneys and the immune system. Flu season is here and I trust field of greens to help me stay healthy. Field of greens works fast and tastes so good. It's really delicious guys and you'll feel better with more energy and you'll notice your skin, hair and nails will look healthier too. I certainly noticed that in me since I started taking field of greens. If you don't always eat right and exercise, join me and take field of greens.

We are back with this absolutely fascinating conversation with Rabbi Jonathan Kahn. You can point so much to the revolution that we've seen starting in the 1960s, right? And so much of this part has also began in the 1960s. Really, it sort of went on steroids in the 1970s. It's tied to radical feminism as well, which told women that they could be men, right? That they could have the career and be in the C-suite and the rest. And I, you know, you think about how these entities, these dark forces, use prominent personalities to sell it. So you think in the 1960s and 70s, David Bowie, gender bending, right? Or in the 1980s, Madonna coming out on stage wearing a suit with a tie. It all of the cultural cues coming from the celebrities, from the pop culture, we're reinforcing this to lay the groundwork for what we're experiencing today, which is actual surgical changing of the genders. The app absolutely. I mean, you know, the amazing thing and you're saying this. And the amazing thing is that people don't connect this and it's so obviously connected. What happened in the 1960s, it's all connected. Radical feminism, I mean, this is going to sound may sound great. You may sound weird to say, but it's totally absolute. Radical feminism is connected to transgenderism now, to the surgical, to the changing of that. It's, and I'm not saying one caused the other. I'm saying they're all part of the same thing. They're all manifestations and spiritually, they're all part of the same spirit. And it's the same spirit. You know, if you're saying ultimately that there's no difference between men and women, you know, wait, you know, in one form, well, then you're going to get what you have right now. You're going to get everything, you know, all is part of the same thing. And exactly as you said, it started in the 60s too. It was, you know, again, on the, you know, it wasn't, it was like the seeds that have now flowered, you know. And so one of the things is that radical feminism, well, well, first of all, what does she do to women? She the goddess is going to transform women. So, you know, and so the thing is that the goddess herself was a woman, but she had male attributes. You know, she's a woman, but she's very masculine in her nature. In every way, she's the goddess of the sword, the goddess who was. And she by the way, well, she so she what she does is she's seeking to defeminize women. And she's seeking to masculinize women. She's seeking to make modern women in her own image. You know, so what was that image? It's the image. It's a woman, but it's a woman who is seeking to be a man and seeking. And so, you know, and so you see this, interestingly, you know, one thing she said, and you, you, you are right on that track that she said, you know, she said the first thing to in order to do this to women in order to transform more women take to take women away. She's going to take women away from womenhood, women away from motherhood, women away from marriage, because all the things that are women, she's going to take them away from. So you're going to and you, you can see this spirit in our, I mean, we all know it. It's it's so it's so thick. You could cut it. You know, this spirit in our culture, we all we all know it. And so it's a spirit that has to take femininity away from women. It's so strange. You know, if a woman acts, acts masculine, you know, she's there. She's applauded. If a man has masculine, he's condemned. It's so crazy. You know, that is what this, that is what this spirit does. That's what this goddess does. And in order to do that, she has to separate men from women and women from men or, or, you know, and so what happens is that's what she does. She's women, you don't need men and men, you don't need women. Women, you don't need men. You don't, you know, you, you are your own man. You can be your, your, your own provider, your, your own protector, your, your own, you know, men are bad. You know, you don't need them. You are divorced from them. And so, you know, and by the way, everything goes together, divorce, destruction of marriage, which is based on male, female, all that. All that leads to this. So she does that. And Monica, one of the things is, you said, you said radical feminism. She, she's, she's the spirit behind it. She, she had, she had an anger. She was an angry person. She, you know, her father, you know, in the mythology, Anu, you know, of the, of the Sumerian pantheon, pantheon, of gods. She, you know, he was the leader of it. And she always challenged the authority of her father. So in a sense, she challenged the, you know, the word from the word father, we get the word patra, patra, patriarchy. So you get all the, all this stuff. Again, fight the patriarchy, fight the patriarchy. Well, she was the one who started that. She went against that. And so, and she raged against, she had a problem with men. That even her lovers would end up most likely being destroyed. You know, she always came against that. So to have this spirit, the angry woman, you know, and by the way, as we mentioned last time, women have by all every single study has shown that every decade since then, women happiness has gone down the tube, gone down and down and down. This is promising as you, promising liberation, promising fulfillment. What happened? What happened is destruction. So that's what that's what happened. And Monica, it says in the ancient inscription says she gives weapons to women. Now, now I'm not getting into any, you know, political part of this thing. But here's the fact. She was the goddess who bore weapons, you know, weapons has traditionally fighting and defending as traditionally, you know, a thing of what men are supposed to do, you know, and, you know, that's challenged by the culture doesn't mean anything. That's always always been that's part of life, you know, but so what you're going to see is the militarization of. Women militarization. So I mean, starting with getting into the army, of course, but all and I'm not getting into the thing. It's just this is what's part of it. But also, you know, you have these now you have, when I grew up, I don't know, you, Monica, but I never saw women fighting men punching men or men punching women. I just didn't see it. You know, now, you know, women, you are your own man and you see it all the time. This is a glorification of this is all this. This is all the image of the goddess and what you and then, you know, you, you mentioned, you know, the other. So there's thought of it is men. What does she do to men? There's an ancient inscription I found, which says, says that she caused she, she grinds away the masculinity of men. So what else are we seeing? A war against men. A war. It's not an accident. A war against masculinity. Again, if a man acts masculine, he's condemned as being toxic. You know, there's this war against anything with anything with men, you know, in an authority, anything. And so the idea is women replace men and the culture applauds and the more women can replace men and men replace women. You know, that's the other part of it. So she seeks to defeminize women, but she seeks to emasculate men to demasculize men to feminize men. So that is what she's doing. It's attacking them, attacking fatherhood. You know, I don't know, you know, years ago, America had programs like Father Knows Best. You cannot even imagine a program with that name being on today. Father Knows Best. Well, today we have Homer Simpson. You know, today fathers are depicted as bumbling idiots or overgrown children or dangerous toxic predators. You know, if they're there at all, Jonathan. Yeah. Yeah. Because we've got fatherless homes everywhere. That yes, and you know, that it will actually read in some of the ancient inscriptions about the goddess. She attacks the authority of men, the authority of fathers. And because when you do that, you will you will transform the entire society. You will when you do that, you will destroy family. You will you will do that. You're taking out what was supposed to be the defense of a marriage. You know, sounds like it sounds like an act that we just destroyed. Defense of marriage protection, a marriage protection of children, and you're destroying it. You take that out. You're destroying it. And once you take away the father, as you said, you've got you've got, you know, statistics, spirit out, you've got a skyrocketing of the chances of crime, of drug use, of, of sexual promiscuity, all that destruction of society. Well, congratulations. This is what you got when you took away the father. You know, and so this is, this is all part of the goddess and, and also to feminize men. And so we're watching that too. You know, a man acts feminine, the whole society applauds him. The other thing is that, that also notice as she's training the women, I mean, she's training the children. For instance, girls are being trained. Hey, you know, forget, you don't need men. You know, you know, fierce power, all with, you know, you know, girl, it's girl power. It's girl being girl with, you know, girl acts masculine. Wonderful. Boys, though, are told not to do that. The boys are being corrected for acts, acts acting masculine. And the other thing, and so boys are being pro are being discouraged, are being, are being, you know, shot down and they are being, they are being channeled away. The natural impulse of a man, which is supposed to be to protect family, protect life is being channeled into video games. You know, the impulse for marriage and for marriage formation is being channeled into pornography. So you got, you got young men who are never going to get married. They're never going to have responsibility. So she's destroying it from both sides. And the end is to destroy, you destroy marriage, you destroy family, destroy life. And look at what's happening now. We're at the point where even she's eliminating the word women, you know, eliminating women, you know, where you even have the old school feminists are saying, this is crazy. You can't, they're fighting this because it's so radical. You say, you can't say women anymore. It's a birthing person. It's a, it's a, it's a person with a cervix. I mean, lunacy, but that's where it's lunacy, but that's the logical conclusion of where this is heading. And that is what the goddess does. And it's all sold to both men and women as progress. That's the great deceiver. That's the demonic control over the language. This brings us to what, what we are steeped in now, which is the logical end to what you're talking about, which is gender dysphoria, gender confusion, the entire transgender agenda. Can you talk about that? If you would. Totally, it is totally, totally rooted in this mystery. And that the, the, you know, the goddess had a, a priesthood. You know what a priesthood was? Her priesthood was, um, was actually were men. They were called the Aasino or the, or the Kalu, the gala. And they were, they were men dressed up as women, men who spoke, acted as women. Um, they walk around her temples as that. Well, when you see that returning to the culture, you know, the gods have returned. And this was part of pagan culture. Well, you know, it's got, let me have a short term memory. We don't realize we don't understand what's happening. And you said, yeah, the name of progress, it's actually regress. It's a regression to pagan culture. Um, and the thing is that so the first thing is you see this beginning with androgyny and you mentioned, you said, you know, David Bowie, Madonna, and, and on and on. And it's, it's, it's accelerating with every year, every generation. And so you see the confusing. So when you see men dressing up as women again, that's, that's basically her priesthood. You, when you see children being told that they, they, you know, the boy, you may not be a boy. You're a girl, girl, you may, you may be a boy and dress up as this dress up as that. You know, this is, this is what she does. The, you know, but it's remember the, the Lord said Jesus said they come back worse. So back then she, she did this to her priest, or she possessed a priest. Now she's seeking to possess an entire generation, including of, of, of children. She is seeking the children, an entire generation. These are the end times. And so now remember what it says was what the ancient inscription says, she turns a man into a woman. She turns a woman into a man. Now you take that to its ultimate. It means she actually, she's the goddess who transitions a man to a woman, transitions a woman to a man. And even her own priesthood was actually included, not just people who dressed up as women, as women, but men who she had surgically transitioned surgically altered. Those were her priests. Now she's seeking the children to become her priesthood. So yes, that happened. She is the goddess of transsexuality or transgender. She goes from, she's, I'm a man, I'm a woman. Some one of her, her, her helpers is a principality that goes back and forth between man and woman. She is actually the one who transitioned them. So yes, you know, I actually, Monica, I put it, I put it in the return of the gods, but it's a, it's a quote in the description where it describes the people, the men who were transitioned by her, her priesthood. They're dancing before her, dancing with scalpels as if to, to celebrate their surgical transitioning. So what is happening to America? What is happening to our children? Now remember, I said that gods are after the children because because the children are more open. And if you can get the children, you have the future. Listen, they remember they're the ones who sacrificed the children. They love destroying children. So they're being destroyed in our, in our school system now, the same school system that once led them in the Lord's prayer is now leading them to be surgically mutilated. You know, and, and you know what? That's the logical progression because remember what she said, you take out, take out God from the schools. That's how it all began. Something else is going to come in. The house is not going to stay empty. Look at what has come into the schools now. What's come into the schools is now something very dark that's destroying them. And you might say, you know, even there are liberals who are saying, what, what's possessing adults to do this to children? What's possessing them is this. And, you know, they, when you talk about the transgender agenda being introduced to children at a very, very young age, they're being led down the path of their own sexual mutilation. Right. That the confusion that that that worm of confusion from this transformer gets into their brain and begins the whole series of questions and confusion. And that then leads to the sexual mutilation of these children without parental consent or involvement in many cases. And it all gets back to what we were talking about earlier in the week with regard to children, which is you got to get them young. And these, these dark forces understand that it's about separating children from their parents and their family so that they can be controlled by these dark forces. Yeah, yes, because once you once you take out the authority of the parents, you can do what you want with them, you know, and that, you know, the gods wanted the children. They wanted the parents parents to relinquish their children on their alters. They destroy children. They abuse children. They sexualize children, you know, one after the other. And that's exactly what is happening. You know, together and again, when you take away, it all goes together. When you take away the father, you take away the first, you know, the first pillar of what's going to protect the children. Then you take away, you know, then you try to take away the mother, you know, and that's exactly what happens and it's happening and it's destroying them. That's why this is so real. You know, I've said this on this show before, but I want to pose this to you, Jonathan. The sexual abuse of children is such a singular evil. And in fact, all child abuse is such a singular evil that we all, well, maybe I should just speak for myself, but I think the supplies to a lot of people. We all just assumed that it was rare. And yet now we see the sexualization and exploitation of children everywhere. We talked earlier in the week about the Balenciaga high fashion ad campaign with the children, with the bondage of teddy bears and the rest of it to university campuses to international child trafficking, including at our own border to the Jeffrey Epstein case. It seems to be far more widespread and pervasive than we ever thought. And what you're saying is this is a direct result of the return of these gods. Absolutely. You've randomly said it earlier on, the pagan world was not safe for a child. If you're a child in most pagan cultures, it was not safe because you're vulnerable because you're weak. And that it's only when when Christianity came when the Word of God came, it said, no, the child is sacred. Jesus said, Jesus said, you know, such is the kingdom of God. You know, if you harm this, if you cause this child to stumble, it'd be better that you weren't even born. You know, that's what caused this. It was that, but when you take Jesus out, you take God out. This is what has to happen. And even in all works together, you know, you destroy marriages that you destroy families. You destroy protection for children because, you know, now you have other men coming into a house who aren't married or other. And you have the children are more in danger of abuse. This is true all over. This is what happens. And, you know, it's like we should have known and look at how this all began. We said it began with the children began with, let's just remove prayer. Let's just put a little separation between God and the children. Well, you separated the God from the children and now you're brought in the gods to the children. But this is exactly we should have expected it, you know, and bringing children to drag queens, you know, for story time, I mean, you know, to sexual. What is that? Well, you know, that is what in one form or another, that actually happened in different forms in ancient in the ancient world. Children were sexualized. Children were watching the destruction of gender and children were being destroyed. This is it. This is a real. This is this is this is why this is so important. OK, please stand by more with Rabbi Khan straight ahead. OK, we are back with Rabbi Jonathan Khan, you know, just over the last couple of weeks, our friend Kirk Cameron, who was big Hollywood icon for a long time. He is now a Christian believer and produces a lot of Christian content books, documentaries, films, all the content that we should be supporting, like the return of the gods. You know, he he and his publicist and his publisher went to about 50 public libraries because he's just written a children's book that is faith based and he said, look, I'm a big star and I would love to come and read my new children's book to a bunch of kids at these public libraries. The libraries came back not a single one, Jonathan said that they would welcome him to talk to children and read this faith based book, not one. They said the messaging does not align with their institutions. Meanwhile, they've got drag queens doing drag queen hour for children all day long. This is exactly what you're talking about, right? Yeah, well, you know, if I was just one of those who call evil, good and good evil. And this is where we are now, you know, this is this has taken literally taken over our culture. And that's exactly listen, that's exactly what the agenda was, you know, possession. It's a possession and as it would be like a person getting possessed and they get they get more and more irrational. They're not they're not reasoning things. Well, that's what's happening to our culture as a whole. The the entire movement where, you know, where I really exploded on the world, which I won't get into for a time's sake, but I get into it in the regards, but when which is called Stonewall, you know, which all this came from and the gender and everything, you know, same sex and ultimately destruction of marriage and transgender and all that. That began in New York City, you know, in 1969. I won't go into it except to say that on that night when the Stonewall riots came, all the signs of the goddess from her mythology, from her, it was amazing, manifested on the streets of New York. I mean, even the timing, all part of this thing. And this has overtaken our society where again, to I mean, just a few years ago, what you just described would never have happened. I mean, it's just craziness. It's madness. It's a possession. But but to give you an example of this, of how it's how it's taken over the whole site. You know, this ancient goddess was actually the goddess of parades. And so she had parades through the ancient world, through the cities of the ancient world. What were her parades like when I looked at the inscriptions, her parades, it could she made men parade in the city streets as dressed up as women, women parade in the city streets dressed up as men full of color, full of sexual licentiousness and full of gender bending. Does that sound familiar? Every year, our our streets are filled with parades. This is all that it's the return of the ancient parade. We don't the people who are doing it, they don't realize that they don't know. It's because of that. They have no idea. You know what? You know, the another thing here is the goddess claimed one month of the ancient world, particularly to possess the culture one month. There'd be there'd be possessions for her. People would be like possessed by her spirit. What was the month? Well, I looked in the ancient writings of the early the early Christians and actually I put in the book, I quote Saint Jerome, because at the time they still had those parades, they still had the festivals of the goddess. And so he actually records it in Latin. He says the month of the goddess or the month of the celebration, the month of this was the month called Iunium or June or June, the month of June. So now look at this. Look what has happened to the month of June. Remember that Jesus said that the spirits return to possess what the house they once had. Well, she once had the equivalent of art of the month of June. So now she's repossessing it. And so that's why June has become something totally we never could have found. And so now not only that, you know, it's it's also that that June has become the month of this. What was what was the goddess? She was the goddess of of altering gender, of altered sexuality. So June has now become the month of altered gender, altered sexuality and parades. And you know, the goddess was also called the goddess of pride. She was the known for being the pride goddess. So we have the month of pride and not only that, but now think about this, you know, how irrational this is, you know, we have now America, not so many nations, celebrating this, you know, they celebrate their own independence day for one day. They'll celebrate this for 30 days. I mean, isn't that crazy? They're they're celebrating a form of sexuality. Isn't that crazy? We have, you know, that makes no sense. You would just not it's not rational no matter what, it's not rational, but it's not rational. It's a possession. It absolutely is. So now that we have gone through all of this and we've taken apart the dark eternity from the return of the gods, what is their end game? Like, how does this end for America and for the world? Yeah. Let me and let me let me throw in two things that's going to lead there along that line. One is, let me just tell you that there was an ancient sign of the goddess. She was linked to an ancient sign. You know what it was? The rainbow, the rainbow. And actually even the cult, every color of that rainbow, the original flying that they even said is linked to the goddess. So actually people don't realize this, but when you see that rainbow, it's taken from God is God, he bought, but taken away, but it's become a sign. It's a sign of the goddess possessing the culture. American embassies, you know, cereal boxes. I mean, craziness all over everywhere. Schools, it's the possess the goddess possessing the culture. And also, and the other thing is, just before that, how this has been part of how they're they're seeking to take the culture, which is part of the engine, is that, you know, if you look at the last, the three landmark Supreme Court decisions that have altered marriage and altered sexuality, every one of them took place in June, the month of the goddess, the specific time of the goddess was the last days of June around the time of the summer solstice. Every one of them took place in the last days of June, the time of the summer solstice. Every one of them, this is from from 2003 to 2015, the overturning a marriage took place on the exact same day, June 26, which is linked to the mystery. And I'll just tell you one more thing about that. And that is that remember the night when marriage was was transformed, which talk about transform was overturned and the White House was lit up in the colors of the rainbow. That's a sign the goddess saying, I possess this now. I possess the White House. I possess the culture, but that on the here on the ancient calendar, that night was the 10th of the month of Tamuz, the 10th of Tamuz. That marriage was changed. So a man can marry a man. Well, that day on the I found an ancient inscription, I put it in the book from Babylon that it says that that day, the 10th of Tamuz is appointed or ordained for to to cast a spell to cause a man to love a man. That was the day that marriage was changed into that on that day. The Supreme Court had no idea what it was doing, but it all manifests the ancient mystery. So what so what is the end game of the gods? The end game is total dominion. You know, it is every knee shall bow. It is that it is that every tongue will confess them. You know, when they first come in, they come in with the name of tolerance. Remember everything was tolerance. Do your own thing. Hey, anything goes, do your own thing. That's that's changed. Well, you know, that's gone. Now it's do our thing. Now, if you don't if you don't speak what we say, if you don't act the way we say, if you if you think along a different line, you are going to be canceled. You're going to be the program, the platform, defunded. That's what because once the gods use tolerance only to get in, you know, open your doors, Christian civilization so we can get in. Once they're in, now close the doors. Now every knee will bow. In the day you mentioned Jezebel, the days of Jezebel, it was every knee had a bow before bail. They hunted down the profits. The end game is total dominion. That's why you have cancel culture now. That's why you have political correctness. That's why you have this new culture. It is because we're entering a new stage, you know, the beginning stage. The Bible says one of those who call good evil and evil good. Well, well, the first stage is calling good evil. That's say, hey, I'm sorry, first stage is calling evil good, which, hey, sin is good now. But the second stage is now we're going to call everything that's good evil. We're going to call Christians evil, God evil, the word evil, family evil, marriage evil. We're going to do that. So that is where we are now. And when the gods come back, remember they were cast out by the gospel, by faith, by Christianity, by the Bible. So they have they have a vengeance. They've come back with a vendetta. They've come back. They have to attack religious freedom, attack Christianity, attack traditional religion, attack Christians, attack the gospel, attack the word of God. They were cast out by the word of God. Now they're trying to cast the word of God out of America, just like you said. So we are in we are in a gigantic war. And that's why we have to we have to know that's why also why I wrote the book is their hope and what is the hope and what we need to do. All right. We've got to hit this quick break, but we will be right back with much more. We're back with Rabbi Jonathan Khan. So we need an awakening because that's going to be the only thing to rid the country of these dark forces. How do we do that, Jonathan? First thing is that if we are going to stand as much as we are take part in any of these things in our life, whether it's pornography, whether it's whatever it is, as much as we give ourselves to something else, substance, whatever it is, we have to get that out of our lives because we cannot do things with the culture of we can't stand for God there if we're not going to stand in our own life. So God will give you the power to do that. That's number one. Number two, the people of God, when you look back at all the great people of God in the Bible from Moses, they all dealt with this. Moses dealt with the gods of Egypt. Elijah dealt with the gods of Canaan, Baal. Paul dealt with the gods of Rome. The first Christians dealt with the gods. That's all part of it. So the point is we have to stand. We cannot, if we are silent, we are giving them the victory. If we are timid, if we're intimidated and we go with that intimidation, then we are giving homage to the gods. We are not to do that. We understand. We have something much more powerful. The power of God is much more powerful than any God of any age. You know, you know, when Moses crossed the Red Sea, he said, he wrote a song and he wrote, it says, mikha mocha bele mato nai, who is like you, oh, Lord, among the gods, there is none. If you first of all, if you are, if you don't know God, if you are not born again, if you don't have him in your life, you got to get him in your life. You got to say, yes, just say yes, come in my life because that is the only life that is going to protect you from this darkness. Number one. Number two, if you have God, it is time to stand. It's time to be, you know, if the dark is getting darker, it means it's time for the lights of God to get brighter. These are days, you know, the grays are disappearing. So these are days that produce greatness for those who will be great. It is time, you know, if the world is kind of going back to where it was spiritually to a pagan form, then it's time at the beginning of the age. It's time for believers, the people of God to go back to where they were, the beginning of the age, which was the book of Acts. That is the power of God. God will empower the one who will stand for God. It says the eyes of God are searching the entire earth, looking for the one whose heart is his. He will lift up that one. You be that one. He will show himself, might listen, the power of the gospel is stronger than anything else, but we cannot back down. We cannot be on the defense. We have to be on the offense. Yes, Monica, as you said, absolutely right. Revival. We must pray for revival because without revival, all the political change in the world is going to it's not going to last. Revival is the only thing that can change America that can save America. We have to pray for it. We have to intercede for it, but we also have to live it. Live in revival. The revival begins. And also what revival begins with repentance, whatever we have to do in our own lives, let's do it to get right with God. God will empower it and then then move forward. Do not be silent. You are the watchmen. Do not be afraid. Speak. Proclaim. You've got the power. You've got God and all God is enough. If you have God, you are more powerful than the majority and you are to stand. Do not bow down to Baal. Do not bow down to Molot or Ash Torah. Do not bow down to political correctness or wokeness. Do not bow down to any sacred cow of this culture, but stand for God. He is the he was the same. He was the answer. He's still the answer. He will still be the answer and it will be he'll be even more powerfully. The answer is for such a time as this, when it's dark, you will shine. God has appointed you to stand for such a time as this. And that's exactly why we did this week of shows because I want everybody to understand God has not abandoned America. I know a lot of people even believers, Jonathan, say, hey, you know, things look so dark. It looks like God's taken a powder on America. And we want everybody to know he is not abandoned this country. But he does want us to stand up and fight back against the small G gods running wild and tearing apart our country. He wants us to stand for him. And if we do that, the small G gods will be banished and God will see to it that America is restored. Yes, absolutely. And what we if anyone missed some of the programs, the keep in mind, the note, when I finished this book, the return of the gods, that was the day that the altar, the greatest altar of the gods right now of abortion was cracked. God was giving us encouragement. You know, the fight is not over. It's not over till it's over. And the power we have is still greater. There's always hope as long as you have God, you've got hope. And you know what? If it's getting darker, OK, listen, bring it on because you know what? This is what will this is when we'll all become great. It's going to force us to go one way or the other is to shoot you. You choose God. We will become great. Let it let it be our greatest moment. You know, Monica, what is the most exciting, the exciting time or moment of a movie, the last 15 minutes? So listen, God put us in the last 15 minutes. Let's make the most of it. This is the great. This can be our greatest hour if we stand for him. Yes, don't give up five minutes before the miracle. No, John, and I want everybody who was tuned in this week to be encouraged today. Don't allow what's happening. I just want to discourage you. Turn it around, absorb all of the messages from Jonathan today and across the week because this is what's going to save America and really what's going to save all of us. Jonathan, it has been quite a journey with you over the past few days. I can't thank you enough for being here for spending all of this time with us and sharing these revelations. The the incredible arc is just fascinating and it's so important to understand what is happening and why and what we can do about it. Rabbi Jonathan Khan, the book is called The Return of the Gods. Go get it. You can get it on their website, TheReturnOfTheGods.com. Also Amazon Barnes and Noble.com, wherever you get your books. I promise you, you will not be able to put it down. You need to read it and fully absorb it. And then, of course, act on it. Jonathan, thank you so much. God bless you and happy new year. God bless you. God bless."
