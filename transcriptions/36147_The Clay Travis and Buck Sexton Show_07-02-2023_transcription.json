    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast second hour of clay and buck is underway right now my friends and We had we had talked a little bit at the top of the show about this that in Oklahoma right now. There is a bit of a kerfuffle. There is a protest that has been underway where they seized the state capital and This is all because of a transgender Law a transgender laws that have not been signed yet as I understand it But there are issues Issues around it people are upset about it and we wanted to talk to you about what exactly is going on here so it's called Senate bill 1 2 9 and Well before actually before we get into Exactly what's in all these bills clay last we had checked in on this they had stormed the Storm the capital and there was a trans lives matter group Trans lives matter which I had never Heard of this before I think it's interesting because blue lives matter got so much anger from the left. How dare you appropriate How dare you appropriate the oppression all lives matter got all eyes much criticism So but trans lives matter is apparently okay for the left which is is so It's so interesting to see us see how this how this goes and They're they're here. We actually have some audio here. They are chanting just in case you're wondering trans lives matter play it So that that's they're very clear about what they're there to do and who they are So there are about a over a hundred of them from Oklahoma Oklahoma's for equality and freedom Fascinating the way they name these groups, isn't it? They were outside the capital. They made their way into the rotunda The protesters were calling on lawmakers to vote against Variety of bills that would have prohibited gender reassignment surgery or hormone therapy for those under the age of 18 specifically The Senate bill 1 2 9 which is being called the Millstone Act That would ban treatment for people under 26 years of age by punishing the doctor So effectively clay if you're a doctor and you do a trans surgery for people under the age of 26 you Can lose your license and even be criminally prosecuted So there are a few different a few different bills that are all at issue here. Like I said, there's the Millstone bill There's also a bill the less restrictive house bill 101 Now that would stop doctors from giving a referral for puberty blockers cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery for anyone under 21 and then there's Senate bill 252 which would prohibit anyone under the age of 18 from receiving gender reassignment surgery And then Senate bill 250 would prohibit medical officials and entities from receiving Reimbursement from Medicaid if they do gender transition services. So there's a whole variety of Stopping gender transition surgeries within certain age ranges in Oklahoma. I Think that I think the governor's there. We're gonna have them all next hour I think that they should continue through with this I think the notion that anybody under 18 should have any of this done is barbaric and crazy Yeah, I think the under 18 is a really easy argument. I don't know what the law will ask the governor I'm not sure what the law is on for instance tattoos in Oklahoma But there are many different states out there where you cannot legally as a minor get a tattoo And I think that's always good to focus on because let's take it outside the transgender issue for a moment Why would you have that rule on tattoos for people under 18? Because for everybody out there listening right now if you allow to 14 or 15 year old to legally get a tattoo You might well end up with a tattoo that looks really ridiculous when you're 22 or 32 or 42 Like that doesn't seem crazy to me at all to believe that that is a law that makes total sense That relatively speaking you may not like the barbed wire tattoo that you're 16 year old got on his biceps But by and large that isn't going to remember when the barbed wire tattoo Has anyone gotten a barbed wire tattoo on a biceps since 1994 clay alright in 1994. That's my point 1994 you got the barbed wire tattoo You were a badass by 2004 you were like why did I ever think getting a barbed wire tattoo on my bicep was cool Everybody's like why do you think you're an in sync? Yeah, that's true and so People make bad decisions with tattoos But in the grand scheme of things you can get a tattoo removal I think like all those things If we're as a reason society out there of the opinion Oh, we got to keep tattoos away from kids under 18 We got to keep beer away from kids under 21 We got to keep rental cars which to me is still pretty crazy a lot of you out there remember you couldn't rent a car in college You got to keep a rental cars away from kids until they're like 25 How in the world does it make sense to allow someone to get their breast removed at 15 That's child abuse like I don't even understand how this is remotely controversial and this is where this moved very quickly buck from We're trans and we just want the right to live our lives as we are to if you don't agree with a six year old's ability to choose their own gender Then your barbaric transphobe. I mean buck. I had a friend talked about this. I think on the show before and I bet there are people out there listening to us right now Especially if you're in New York or LA or you're in a big city a left-wing Location there are regular emails that go out where they say hey So and so is six years old and she now identifies as a boy or she doubt Identifies as gender non binary and so we're gonna take it seriously and my wife we had this conversation And I think it's perfect for anybody out there as a parent We don't let our six year olds choose what they eat Because we don't think that they have the mental you know where with all because a six year old would say I want Cake or I want ice cream for every meal you say no, you know if you're gonna have a cookie You've got to eat your broccoli or whatever it is beforehand. That's what parenting is Parenting now in some of these communities and in some of these schools and this is happening Increasingly an elite high-end private schools is where this is taken off You're gonna treat a six year old like they could choose their gender I mean, this is this is madness. I also want everyone to know that while this is playing out in Oklahoma the issue of transgenderism for children for minors has For one it exploded by the numbers and anyone who is looking at the data honestly will say this is something that is more a Fad than a scientific reality. That's just this is clear. There's there's a rapid onset gender dysphoria was the term coined by the Brown University study that looked at hey What happens when a seven year old says I think you know a seven year old boy says I think I'm a girl Oh, oh the adults gather around they make a big deal of oh, what can we do for you? And what are the other seven year old sync who are you know, maybe at a point where they're a little unsure of themselves They're seven their kids. I don't know anything they go well if I say I'm a girl too that everyone's gonna Oh, what can we do to cater to you and make sure you're happy and oh, you're so brave. You're so brave This is the stuff and they can show this through the data that the chance of another kid in a class all of a sudden Now I know the activists are you that's because they're just finally willing to speak out that they're trans to the seven years old They probably thought they were a platypus the month before it's absurd We all recognize this is absurd the Biden White House meanwhile We remember this this is just back a few months. This was a about a year ago March of 2022. They put out the Equality and visibility for transgender Americans statements specifically Specifically singling out how we need to make sure that transgender kids children are a focus of this effort and You know that they're talking about reinforcing protection for transgender kids and Including this is the key part gender affirming care So while you know the left-wing activists and everything you can see that you're the crazy blue-haired nose ring Maniacs running around shrieking trends lives matter, you know, they're doing that clay Everybody's understand Biden White House is totally on board for this pushing this using federal power to try to advance this As well. This is not a minor thing. This is not a a side effect. This is the main effort Yeah, and yeah, I think it's also important to emphasize They chose this battle So everybody's out there like why can't you just leave because that's the other argument though, Mike What does this bother you so much? Why can't you just leave trans people along alone? Well because we don't think that 14 year old should get their breast removed Like that's a surgery that we don't think should occur for minors We don't think that 14 and 15 year olds and younger 12 year olds should be given puberty blockers Which keeps someone from hint going into puberty and have massive as you can well imagine Developmental issues in fact buck there was even in the New York Times the story recently where they said hey if you take puberty blockers the overall strength of your bones is Brittle because puberty is when you get all of those extra hormones that help to strengthen your body and your bones And if you get that delayed then in your 20s and 30s and certainly on for the rest of your life You're more likely to have significant issues with your bones. That seems like a really big deal So we're not choosing this battleground. They are we're just trying to provide some sanity here the lifestyle lives who? won't buy Apples unless they're organic because they're so concerned about pesticides, you know won't put that their bodies a temple They won't do that but they think that puberty blockers for a 12 year old there You know that's a great idea that's gender just even the term it is Orwellian gender affirming care notice They have gone from gender transition it used to be called gender transition surgery because you were trying to change from something Now what they say is its affirmation affirmation implies you already are this We're just making it more clear that that's what you really are it is intentional. It is dishonest It's odious and and another way that you can tell this argument clay is made in bad faith These protesters for example the ones in Oklahoma. They're referring to these legislative acts as genocide that is a quote Genocide because of all the trans youth that they claim whom they claim will commit suicide Unless doctors will cut off their breasts at 15 and give them puberty blockers at 12 They're going to commit to you are literally killing kids. They say unless you let us chop off their genitals This is how insane the left has become just for everybody out there listening How many huge percentages I would bet of listeners have been tomboys themselves remember when that was a phrase You know like you'd have a seven or eight year old girl Maybe I don't know 12 13 year old girl before puberty running around Thinking and feeling like she had a lot of boy characteristics and how many of those girls as they age become Women and are very happy to be women now How much different would that be if when we were all seven or eight years old if instead of saying oh, you know She's just kind of going through a phase. Let's let her develop, you know She'll decide what she wants to do. She gets older. What if we had said oh, yeah, you're a boy Let's stop puberty from happening. Let's totally change your gender Let's keep let's have a surgery to remove your breast Which of those feels like a healthier way to treat seven or eight year old kids say hey You know, you're probably gonna work through it. It's a phase you're going through you'll be fine and by the way If you don't when you become 22 You have the right to change your gender Almost all of those girls out there almost every single girl who had tomboy characteristics a lot of you I bet are listening to us right now your kids or your grandkids. Maybe it was you you grew up your girls. You're totally happy and And how much different would that be if everybody gathers around to bucks point and says oh my goodness You must be a boy in a girl's body Let's go ahead. What about you? You never hear about the people and they exist and you've heard from them their interviews with them the people that went for that that go through this and They realize they've destroyed their lives. They'll never have children. They're not they'll never be gender normal They'll never have a normal love life. They'll never have an orgasm. They'll probably be in content if their bones will break What about what about the suicides of those people?

I can't even hard he's an amazing storyteller She says listen giving a speech that even if it's 40 million people watch it which is less than the Super Bowl But still that's a huge number of people. That's a big opportunity for any president It's the biggest speech of the year any president gives but what he needs to do is tell a story Joe Biden is an amazing storyteller I mean you sit in the Oval Office and you can story tell for six hours He needs to do that in this speech tonight people aren't sitting at home and just like writing down data points, right? They support people they feel something from so he needs to tell the story An amazing story I mean he tells a lot of lies buck and they also are claiming did you see this story that Joe Biden wrote the entire Speech by himself. There is a To do to do a sequel to the to the corn pop story remember that Maybe that could be the theme of the entire Tire state of the Union he and corn pop sit down and have a good discussion I want I want Biden to tell some of the old the old classic Biden stories where even The Staunchest Democrats look at them like what is this crazy old man saying but he had hairy legs They're very very legs and the kids would feel the hair standing up on my legs You guys all remember that that was that was bizarre at a level that I still can't begin to fathom What he thought he was even talking about but you know he's president somehow What would Biden's say to the Union actually sound like if he truly wrote every word in the state of the Union? I mean, I mean, I would love to hear that that would be worth watching Yeah, I would I would make sure that I had a stiff drink with me and kick back and I was ready to roll We're gonna watch it tonight because that's what we do we watch it so we can tell you what's going on And if something you want to watch it, I'm sure there'll be some moments in it The town of the towers foundation my friends delivers on its promise to do good and never forget the sacrifices America's heroes have made for us heroes like Air Force senior master sergeant Israel del Toro Jr Israel promises father he'd take care of his family and his son that he wouldn't grow up with that a father when his humvee Explidered in Afghanistan. He suffered severe burns over more than 80% of his body With only a 15% chance of survival del Toro focused on the promises he made Later, he became the first fully disabled airman permitted to reenlist and a gold medal winner in the Invictus Games now He shares his story to help others thanks to the time of the towers foundation and your generosity Del Toro received a mortgage-free smart home The home has a myriad of smart features to help him live his life more independently help heroes like del Toro when they need it Most join us in donating $11 a month the talent the towers at t2t.org That's t the number two t.org tunnel the towers foundation donate today t2t.org well, we just heard the the beats that some of you will know come from the German singer Nina with her 99 Luft balloons Or this is right here What? That's what this is okay. I'm just what I was not paying attention to the music we came back to Get a lot faster. We know we should I got to come into like the there we go now. I recognize there we go 99 Okay, anyway now that part first part I didn't get I had to get the beat picked up there I've been I've been I've been bothering our team to play that ever since the balloon went up So thank you team. I was like where's my where there is my 99 balloons? Yeah, but the 99 balloons was many too many because we only needed one big balloon So that song by the way is about balloons Traversing from West Berlin to East Berlin triggering Defense systems that then lead to nuclear war and the annihilation of the planet So I'm just gonna say wait happy or sounding that I would have presumed for For something that would be reflecting of that design as the neat as the New York Times Describe it a bunch of balloons floats over the border to West Indies Germany triggering defense systems and leading to a war that destroys the Planet that is what that song is actually about so when you're in the bar and you're having that seventh shot of Quairvo And you're like 99 balloons you're yelling it. It's about the end of the world just so everybody knows Man what a downer. I mean everybody was in a good mood You just brought him right back to the the square you sound like Biden doing the state of the Union No joke, that's like, you know, you know, you do when you were a kid you ever hear people playing a ring around the rosy Right. Oh, yeah, I know that I know that story Yeah, people say it's from the black death and that this is supposed to they taught kids this and the idea was that it would You know ward away the any about is effective about triple masking outside of a say Just the modern day mask So Carine Jean Pierre since I got to play the song that I've been wanting to play for days Carine Jean Pierre was on the view because when you are addressing an urgent matter of national security importance Clay, where do you go? You go to the geniuses of the view Obviously, that's the first stop on the media tour So you can have you know joy Bayhar way in on whether we should send a patchy's to Ukraine, etc, right? As bet joy Bayhar is the dumbest person on television daily. I Don't know that she would be any worse analyzing information than Joe Biden is which is really kind of scary But if joy but Bayhar was in the situation room I don't know that she could be much worse than Biden is Actually ever I've ever before we get to the view. I have a real question for you Something really bad China invades Taiwan. Yeah, okay. It's happening the the flotillas have mobilized They're on the first airstrikes have happened. It's it's on and You only have a choice between Joe Biden Answering that phone call on you know the red phone or Kamala Harris Who do you prefer to answer that call if it were to happen, you know in the next year Kamala Harris? Not because not because I think that Kamala Harris is in any way Should be in the position that she is in But I think that given the fact that she is I think 58 I think she could synthesize information and competing arguments Better than Joe Biden could Which could lead to a better result? I think I was actually talking about this buck with my wife yesterday because we were talking about the balloon and her argument I think it's a good one. She's like I know Joe Biden is ostensibly the commander in chief That is the military officials have to come speak to him and say mr. President here's what I Don't think that they speak to him and that he in any way is actually the commander in chief So I think really the question here buck is Who is the military official? Who is the decider right what should happen is when we select a president? We are selecting the decider in chief Whatever the toughest issues are in the world. They come to his desk You've been in there for these briefings, but yes, you have a lot of smart people This is true who have elevated themselves Inside of the government and they will make the case we should choose option a mr. President And they will give you all the reasons why option a should be selected then B and C And they're all really good options and the job of the president is to decide between several challenging options the best He's the decider in chief. That's what scares me the most about Biden I think you're right about the Kamala choice between the two. I think maybe Biden 20 years ago I would take over Kamala, but but by now I think I think Kamala is the right choice under that very very frightening So they're both the wrong choice. Yeah, the best of two bad option of the two of them if that phone call would would have come along And then also on the on those kinds of briefings and those moments You know one thing I will say I'm very critical of the deep state and the apparatus and everything that goes on from the top level Whether it's FBI CIA there are freakishly smart people who Can sit there and just tell you everything that you would ever ever want to know about Every Soviet missile system devised in the last 50 years those people do exist in the CIA and the DIA and you know They're there. They're just not the ones that are you know going going for big photo ops with the president They're not the ones that are appearing on NBC. They're not the ones that are you know So just to be clear there is that repository of knowledge that exists, but they're not involved in the Political nonsense and they're also not the ones who you'll you'll be hearing about the opposite of those super brilliant people That know a lot about a lot of things and they just quietly do their work every day inside the intelligence community and inside the You know Pentagon and the military intelligence would be The view if you does not bring a lot of knowledge Skill and wisdom to anything certainly not to daytime television Korean jump here though. This was interesting to me She went on the view to talk to them about blocking us transmissions from the ground to the balloon play to One of the things that we were able to do is to make sure none of the sensitive security Information national security information on the ground was transmitted so we were able to block that but at the same time We're able to gather information form the balloon as it was traveling on its path And then when the time allowed and it permitted the president who was also the commander in chief as we all know And when it the balloon got over water and as he had asked for the Pentagon to do which is to take it down They took it down By the way, can we just say shoot it down? We shot it down. Yeah, we didn't we didn't take it down like you know Like party streamers in the office birthday setup like we we we shot it down Let's just use the real terminology anything so we just like gently glided it to the ground, but clay First of all, okay, so let's let's say we just take this at face value They were the block the transmission back to China where they have the block at the whole time Where are we to believe that they were just hovering there blocking the trends? How long was that going this went on for days right this thing doesn't move fast and also? The Chinese never they didn't have some uplink that would send back that I mean if they thought a slow-moving balloon was going to have to get back to Chinese airspace in tact This is the crappiest surveillance plane You know in history. I mean you'd be better off with a hot air balloon back in the Civil War days, right? Yeah, something's up. Well, not only that. What did China expect? That we spend a lot of time talking about what we do right? But a big part of this to me is figuring out what were China's motivations? I Asked a question earlier buck. Where did China launch this from? Did China when they did their briefing on what the Chinese spy balloon was going to accomplish? Did they ever in any part of their analysis think this balloon's gonna enter United States airspace in Alaska and exit off the coast of South Carolina? And then the United States gonna shut shoot it down like what did they think? My expectation would have been if I were China the United States is gonna shut the shoot this thing down over Alaska as soon as it Significantly enters airspace right like I think the story of the Trump thing may be true But I think they were kind of probing hey Do they notice if we go into Hawaiian airspace a little bit? Hey, do they notice if we go into Florida airspace a little bit? Do they have the NORAD defense mechanisms in place to recognize where this balloon is? I think that was their test I don't think they ever expected that it would go all the way across the entire continental United States And so I suspect that they adjusted the game plan like they're like, okay. Well, we're in Montana Why don't we go over this Montana airfield and then we're gonna drift down? I think they thought that this thing would get shot down So if that's what they thought was gonna happen What is their analysis right now in China of what took place to me? It looks like oh the United States defense mechanisms are not very strong Biden does not have the political will to act aggressively in short order when given new information Which is why I think your question buck is such a good one What is he gonna do if he gets woken up at 3 a.m. In the middle of the night and they say China has begun its invasion of Taiwan Everybody asked about this by the way claims that well rather Agrees that no one really knows what the US would do that that this this strategic ambiguity is really a We're not sure what we would do We think we have strategic ambiguity with regard to Taiwan so that we keep China on its on its toes You know so we don't give away the game, but actually we don't know That's the truth. We don't know what we would do and buck. Here's the other question What are Biden's top advisors going to suggest to him to do because if my wife's right and basically? Biden is commander in chief and name only then whomever those top military advisors are Whatever their recommendation is is what Biden is gonna do So don't worry. That's a lot of power Secretary of Defense of the future Buddha judge will be Handling it just like he's handled the transportation situation in this country So it'll all be fine folks, you know clay and I really do love learning we consume data and information Constantly and we love sharing what we learn and we have these you know nerd nerd dumb sessions every day here We talk about random history all kinds of stuff.

We'll ask him that question about it potentially Taiwan Invades China what the impact would be there and also certainly Discussed with him the Chinese supply the Chinese Balloon spy issue but buck I got a confession for you last night And I may need advice from the from the clay and buck audience out here Did you play horse against your dad when you were a kid growing up ever? I? Gonna lie I definitely defeated him in horse many many a time so last night I Played against my 12 year old son my sixth grader and he beat me H O R S e to nothing now we have in the Travis household Pre regular matchups between the two of us and we have a belt Championship belt that is bestowed depending on who wins But when you get beat H O R S e to nothing it was a it was a dark moment I mean it was sobering to get crushed like this by By your sixth grader So I don't know what at this point I should do there are a lot of different suggestions out there I'm only 43, but there were a lot of claim injuries a lot of you know trick shoulders a lot of issues associated with that How do you handle one of your offspring becoming better than you at a sport particularly at this age? It's one thing like you know 16 17 18 when a kids hit puberty 12 year old beating you pre puberty is a is a tough one to take Humility is an important thing clay. So however you achieve it. I think it's all for the better the funniest Comet buck was that I saw it. I can't keep up with all the comments because I tweeted about it last night The funniest Comment was one guy said you should have just told him you slept with his mom Which is which is accurate and also his and also is terrible I'm gonna have to put that one in the back pocket because there is some trash talk that goes on sometimes during the course of the Horse game, but when you get blanked H O R S e to nothing no letters on him There's not a lot of trash talk. I could be involved in I'm pretty sure sometimes with my dad back in the trash talking days A lot of it was around ping pong by the way. This is we're really and we all I had a grandfather who was the best in ping pong in your family. I Mean I'm the best at ping pong in my family You know my brothers are gonna break down there freaking out especially if the but you know Maybe they're not listening so they won't even know some days they do some days. They don't I am the best at ping pong I am Absurdly good for somebody who doesn't play very often. I'll say that okay So like do you have spins like is there substantial spinning or you more of like a Trudet like because if you watch really really good ping pong players They have an inordinate amount of ability to spin. I'm talking about like are you just kind of a traditional player Yeah, I'm a traditional player But I mean I I look when I play it's like when Forrest Gump is doing his thing in the movie on the ping pong So you're taking swings like it's I think I'm pretty good at ping pong to I'm racking the oh, okay Travis all right probe there. There's gonna be some big wagers There's gonna be some people who's do you have a ping pong table at the at the Travis residents? We do not because I've been so afraid of my boys are so competitive all three of them and you know Whatever it is. I am concerned with introducing paddles Into the house for fear of what those paddles might do both as weapons and also as Projectiles that could break things all throughout the house depending on who's winning or losing We used to have the brother the three brothers and our cousins would even set up our own Paintball wars in the backyard when we would go upstate that didn't always end well I could tell you because because you know when you shoot somebody with a paintball gun and You think that maybe they didn't actually have the ball, you know, it didn't splat Maybe you shoot them three or four more times people don't like that So things can get those things out there those things hurt too. They do hurt you take a Paintball in the wrong place like it is a it is painful I got hit in my hands a few times in the fingers Let me tell you the fingers is one of the worst place to get hit with a paintball Oh, I took one in the back of the head one time in paintball Usually you have like some protection over the eyes Hopefully but I was gonna tell you to you know a line that you know when I when I would sort of talk trash to my dad Other in basketball or ping pong back in the day or at the rifle range You know what you just say to me sometimes I made you Which is which is true. That's accurate. Also not a bad line. Not a bad line. I'm gonna have to throw that one I like I slept with your mom. I think you would have a tough time dealing with that one"
