    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast welcome back to clay Travis and Buck Sexton show here in the second hour and We have tragic news to bring you unfortunately out of the Nashville, Tennessee area this coming from the Tennessee and That three children have been killed in a school shooting Earlier this morning at the Covenant school which the private Christian school in Nashville the suspect was engaged by police and is dead according to the ports Currently there are scores of parents and and others gathered together in the parking lot of the school who were waiting for updates There are helicopters in the area The incident was reported around 10th 1030 a.m. I think Tennessee time so 1130 a.m. Eastern time was the first time there were reports of this and Parents are currently reuniting for their kids, but obviously we have three fatalities and a community that has been Just devastated by this clay. This is right in your area You have kids in private school in Nashville not at this school Yeah, look at Buck. I mean this is this is brutal for a lot of parents out there the worst possible thing you could imagine I've got kids at three different schools one private school to public school not this school and I can only imagine what those parents are going through as they are waiting to hear More details and we've kind of waited because this is Literally just down the road from me not far from where I live Green Hills is a sort of suburb just outside of Nashville. This is a Religious school small kindergarten through sixth grade We don't know the ages of these kids Vanderbilt Medical Center is reported that three kids are dead We don't know who the shooter was other than what you just referenced which is Metro Nashville police arrived on the scene and confronted the gunman. We don't know What might have been occurring here why the gunman was there what connection if any he had to the school All we know is this is a small religious school and there are a lot of parents panicked all over My city of Nashville right now as they try to figure out what exactly went on and at least three kids are dead as well As the shooter now on this show we try not to share the names of shooters in these mass shooting incidents because Overwhelmingly the data reflects that helps to encourage more of them to occur But we do want to always point out that Police are responding on the scene what exactly happened at 10 30 central time this morning 11 30 East Coast time We'll continue to update you as more of these details continue to materialize But but hopefully the police were able to arrive and do and protect as many people as possible and And certainly the fact that this occurred at all is is awful and again It's an elementary school and we have not heard who the shooter is or what his or her motivations might have been in this situation or who these kids are so I'm sure those details will be coming out but as you know a parent who's got kids in three different schools. This is every parents worst nightmare and Frankly, you know, we talked was it last year about the U-Val day Situation where yeah, they allowed that shooter to sit in that classroom for hours and hours It does not appear and again every situation is different, but it does not appear that the responding officers from Nashville Did anything other than move quickly now bucks, you know, you know this well sometimes these shooters They they have targets and then they kill themselves, right? Sometimes they're hoping to get killed by the police Certainly anyone who goes into a school for any reason to commit an act of violence is a profoundly evil human Being and or oftentimes very mentally disturbed so I do think that happening here. I do think that that part of the in the the long-term, you know aftermath of of U-Val day from a law enforcement perspective there There was such a a revulsion across the country at Their response of law enforcement officers there that I just think look there You can't law enforcement across the country was paying very close attention I think to what happened there and and how those failures occurred and it's I'm sure When they do active shooter training and a lot of departments large and small It whether they explicitly address this or not in the back of the minds of every man and woman who's going through that training is If this kind of thing ever comes up, I'm going through that door Come what may and I do think that that because in testimony that he said well that individual had effectively a really a really Scary-looking or scary firearm and so we just couldn't do anything So really telling everybody that in U-Val day They decided that they even though they had a stack of people outside They had long guns the police meaning the police and they had ballistic at least one ballistic shield there There was an active decision made it was in confusion There was a decision made by those officers We're gonna sit and wait and we all know that resulted in more casualties of defenseless children It seems and this is very early stage, but it seems in this case Based on the figures the numbers and and the time you know the timeline that we've seen so far and the number of casualties that have been involved That the officer response was fast and that there was at least a confrontation that's often That's often all that it takes for one of these incidents a the good guy or you know Good man or good woman with a gun to arrive on scene and the shooter will whether is engaged by those You know by the good guy or takes his own life. Obviously the threat is over So this was it seems that there was a rapid response here from law enforcement which likely saved Lives in this circumstance and what we don't know too Buck is did this school have a school research Resource officer right on site Private schools make different decisions about security. I know the elementary school In in my neighborhood where my second grader goes we have an off armed security guard that is there all the time and different school districts make different decisions. There was not a confrontation Before that shooter and you've all they was able to get inside the school buck We also don't know the shooting occurred at 10 30 We also don't know did the shooter enter the school because a lot of these schools have outdoor playgrounds for instance Was it something that occurred outside of the physical facility of the school again a lot of details still to come? But if you are if you're turning on your your television right now It's obviously the lead story all over the country and it's here in my backyard and it's awful and it's terrifying and every parent In the back of their mind their worst nightmare is that something like this might happen when their kids are away at school And again, I've got three school-age kids at three different schools in the Nashville area. So I can particularly Empathize with how awful this situation is for any of those Nashville parents as they wait to hear What happened to the to their kids and and who this person was and what the motivation was if you're if you're just joining us just by by way of Keeping everybody informed here. We're talking about this shooting that happened at a Nashville area private school of this morning about mid-morning there are three children who Have been pronounced dead who they they're taking the hospital They they were killed by the shooter and the shooter is also dead. We do not have More information about this at this time We'll updated and as it comes along through during the show and you know clay I just also I feel you know, you're there you're in the community And so this is is very close in every sense to you right emotionally Psychologically close and proximity wise. This is not I've lived in this community green hills so in my time living in Nashville I've lived right here in Evans and evil strikes and takes the lives of of Completely innocent children that you know the the national response to this Will mirror what I'm sure will be the local response, which is coming together healing prayer people trying to Do what they can in this moment of devastation for the community to support those and certainly to support the families First and foremost and those who were close to this and and it's just always unfortunate that After you know in the immediate aftermath now it feels like the politicization of these things Depending on the circumstances that we don't even know but it moves it moves in a way that's so fast and so so Opportunistic that I mean I do think it shows disrespect to the community and to the families often You know that you'll have and I mean this from the very top You'll have top politicians and people in the media and they'll immediately start to push an agenda And they'll do it not even within 24 hours. They'll do it within Hours even minutes perhaps of the incident so I'm hopeful that that won't be what we see here I'm hopeful that you know This isn't an op this isn't Joe Biden deciding that this is when we need a lecture about politics It would much better to try to heal the country, but I think that's well We'll see how that hope a couple more details I'm not sure if we're back on in Nashville yet. I think they've taken some local programming but a If you are able to listen in the Nashville area Senator Marsha Blackburn just tweeted unless you're a parent or a loved one Please stay out of the area of the Covenant school again in Green Hills a part of Nashville Please don't go into the active scene and the Nashville fire department says a reunification area has been established at 2100 Woodmont Boulevard. That's a Baptist church there for parents to meet the kids who attend Covenant school In Green Hills, and this is one of those awful situations Buck I mean just brutal for any parent to think about where you go to that Reunification area and you may be going there thinking I'm going to get to pick my kids up and you find out there Your son Yes, and so I mean for anybody out there will be other parents You know possibly there also though Maybe the law maybe law enforcement has already informed those families so they know and they what but you never know Depends on how quickly all of this goes and and also hopefully that the They don't have any more casualties here again the report from Vanderbilt Medical Center is that three kids are dead We have not seen any more additional comments about About any of the any potential injuries casualties anything more will continue to update you as the show progresses And any any additional news will bring to you over the course of the program And also we will return in a few minutes here to I had mentioned this this Wall Street Journal polling on The feelings of Americans on a whole range of issues We're gonna dive into that and unpack that for you here coming up in just a few If you're a customer Verizon AT&T or T-Mobile don't fall for their free phone deals There's no such thing as free without a hook attach like locking you into a long-term contract That's gonna cost you a fortune every month instead look to pure talk and get a brand new iPhone 12 from pure talk for just 12 bucks a month at 0% interest and no contract You can cancel or leave at any time get a new iPhone ultra fast 5g service and cut your cell phone bill in half So now grab your phone dial pound 250 say clay and buck and pure talks us customer service team will help you make the switch in As little as 10 minutes choose from a variety of unlimited talk and text plans starting at $30 a month with plenty of high-speed data All backed by 100% money back guarantee dial pound 250 say clay and buck for this special offer That's pound 250 say clay and buck pure talk is simply smarter wireless Helping you separate truth from fiction Every single weekday the clay Travis and bucks X didn't show we are getting welcome back in clay Travis bucks X didn't show We are getting more details as we speak Right now literally there's a press conference for Metro Nashville Police Department spokesperson Kendra loney and Couple of details before we go and we'll listen to her speak live the shooter is a woman at a local private Nashville school elementary school shooter is a woman three kids have been Killed in that school also three adults here is more of that live press conference again Kendra loney Nashville fire department spokesperson set up for parents to call But right now that is where they should go 2100 woodmont boulevard, which is woodmont Baptist Church Additionally, we do have a debriefing site set up for on staff or personnel who are working this incident And there are mental health professionals set up there for them as well There was one police officer that was injured with a hand injury as a result of making an attack on this incident but other than that that have been no additional injuries to first responders or personnel responding to this and as Don mentioned earlier, we will have further updates coming later on in the afternoon Okay, so Buck that is a live Briefing that has been provided right now outside of this small religious private high school in the Green Hills area of Nashville Obviously, this is my hometown. I have lived in Green Hills for part of my life here as a as a lifelong citizen Of basically the state of Tennessee in resident of Nashville. So this is hitting very close home for me I also have three kids at three different Nashville schools from second grade through ninth grade and again details female shooter Three students three kids killed at the school as well as three adults and there is more of a Update going on right now. Let's get a little bit more This is Don Aaron who is the Nashville police spokesperson We have the shooter who was engaged by two of our police officers part of a five-member team and she is deceased for a total of seven individuals There are no other gunshot victims Non-lethal that I'm aware of at present People were shot before the police engaged the shooter. No They shot anyone after they engaged the shooter. Do you know the shooter was able to shoot anyone else? We do not know who she is at this juncture we're trying to identify her She does appear to be in her teams Again with two assault type rifles and at least one pistol No, I'm not No, this is a church that operates a private school There was no Metro Police personnel assigned to that building at any time You said to There are a total of three adults three adults who have been fatally wounded No So let me let me go over this again. You have a total of six victims three students who are deceased and three adult staff members from the school who are deceased the Shooter herself makes seven I do not There is video from the school that we are viewing now to try to learn exactly how all of this happened I cannot at this juncture as you know Five of the six were transported so we will get that information later in the day It is an upper level part of the school that's kind of a lobby type area It was not in a classroom per se Clay will continue to monitor this or just the big the big moment there that I think was a surprise in this press conference a Teenaged female shooter Nobody would have seen that one coming Hug your kids the tunnel the towers foundation delivers on its promise to do good and never forget the sacrifices America's heroes have made for us heroes like us Air Force senior master sergeant Israel del Toro junior He promised his father. He'd take care of his family.

He shares his story to help others Thanks to tunnel the towers foundation in your generosity del Toro received a mortgage-free smart home You can join bucking myself in donating $11 a month to tunnel the towers at t2t.org. That's tea the number two tea Dot away Travis and bucks section on the front lines of truth. This is clan buck and we're continuing to Get details and we're falling very closely here the story out of Nashville Seven total dead six killed by the shooter the shooter then engaged by police at a private school in the Nashville area the Covenant school and We know right now so we have we have seven total dead six casualties from the mass shooter and Three children three adults. This is a school that is kindergarten through sixth grade and the detail that is for incident like this and we we've seen Tragically school shootings in the past that tend to fit a certain patter to profile of The individuals involved right now the the major surprise Report out of this as everyone's still reeling from the shock and the devastation this community and the loss of those Six families now three children's families and three adults families finding out in just the last The last two hours or so about this horrific incident that they lost a loved one to this violence That the shooter is a teenage female The shooter according to police had two AR style rifles and also a pistol That's all been confirmed by law enforcement as of now. It is worth noting in these incidents in these moments Where you're getting the first? Reporting from the press that even law enforcement reporting can be subject to updates and changes It did usually that's most important from the perspective of additional casualties that could tragically turn into fatalities It did seem based on the press conference though that there are no others children or adults with outstanding Gun shot wounds at this point so the so essentially there's not no one's fighting for their life According to police in the hospital right now, so it's unlikely you'll see unless there that report is wrong There will be no additional casualties to this right because we've seen other school shootings the number and it's just a gut punch every time It goes up it goes from two it goes to five it goes higher It seems that we know for certain now that there were six innocents who who were killed here by this mass shooter and as I said everyone is still the whole country now is is Is finding out about this and? Everyone I think clay is still processing first the grief the loss the senselessness the evil of this and then also that that in the background in the back of our minds the a theme I cannot think of Another this does qualify as a mass shooting mass school shooting Based on how the FBI statistics, you know anything above three. I believe is how the FBI does it. I cannot think of another School shooting like this where there was a femur first a female shooter And and have never I can't remember I don't know I'd have to go back and look at the FBI Data in the archives if there has ever been a female teenage School shooter like this before yeah, and let me give you a little bit more detail to as someone who lives in Nashville if you've been to Nashville 21st Avenue runs through Hillsborough Village if you keep taking 21st Avenue Which is right why Vanderbilt University if you keep taking 21st Avenue down you run right into Green Hills? And so in this Green Hills area. It's a wealthy Nashville suburb And this is a private religious elementary school very small the spokesperson said there was no school Resource officer on site is a religious school They probably did not think that they needed to have a security guard again I'm quoting from What was Don Aaron the Metro spokesperson who's been the Nashville spokesperson for as long as I can remember since I was a kid it feels like growing up in Nashville. This has been the guy who shows up and And and informs the public about incidents Three guns Three guns in addition buck to your point about this being a teenage female shooter Three adults and three kids Murdered in this school three guns meaning this is a planned attack Who is this person Why did they select a small private religious school in Nashville to engage in this attack, right? It's a planned attack when you go in with three weapons You are attempting to create a mass casualty event The police responded but as we have talked about for some time I think one of the lessons of you Val day is going to be for many different police departments out there You go full speed, right? You don't stop you engage whoever the killer may be and you put risk of lot a little life and limb in the back burner There is a report that one police officer had a hand injury may have been shot in as part of the altercation But that individual was shot and killed evidently by Responding police officers who may well have limited her ability to create even more Anymore even more chaos. I think you could say sir I think you could say certainly I think the law enforcement based on the data we have in the reporting we have right now Law enforcement response. I assume this would be Nashville. Let me call you know the area very natural Police to Metro Nashville they had to get up to the second floor, which is where this shooting went So these officers let's take a moment here to praise their response to go Balls to the wall and go after this shooter 10 30 central time 11 30 East Coast was when this reported shooting happens I don't think it lasted for very long before they were there in responding those offers first of all those officers clearly were engaged by the shooter And the shooter did have a long had two long guns So we were talking about before you know the disaster of of you Val day Across the board but specifically from the law enforcement response Component of that here. It seems the law enforcement response was Rapid and and what we would expect and and what is representative of The vast majority of our law enforcement officers across the country, which is they went in there to stop the threat and to save lives right away but This is to your point a Clearly a pre meditated mass murder and Where we're all just there there is the shock that the community feels and then it reverberates throughout the entire country I know the whole Nashville area right now is Just trying to you know, how could you even process something like this happening and the part of this that we're gonna I'm sure hear a lot more about because I Cannot I can't think of and unfortunately I've had to cover and you've had to cover School shootings in the past and it's been something we've been seeing in this country for a long time I have never even heard of a Teenage female School shooter like this and this is again not it wasn't the individual's school So that's another it wasn't a there wasn't some dispute with with you know This isn't a a gang situation or fellow classmates or something at a high school where someone comes in and starts shooting This was an attempt, you know a mass assassination effectively a mass murder of children and adults at a Primary school by a teenager who I you would assume is obviously too old to be a Student perhaps we don't know beyond that. We honestly just don't know anything about the individual but There's there's gonna be a whole lot more that comes out and all I could say right now is Clay We'll continue to watch very closely forward and thoughts and prayers for for all the folks of Nashville and Tennessee right now. I know this is this is the thing you never want to wake up to and see in In anyone's hometown certainly your own hometown No doubt and We will we'll continue to update you. We've got some audio that is clear From what was taking place in terms of the press conference and availability They said they're still trying to figure out who this shooter is What the motivations may have been but to your point buck. I can't remember you guys can tweet us if you can't I can't remember ever a mass shooting event with a teenage woman as the trigger person Right, I I maybe it has happened. I cannot remember it ever having occurred almost all shooters in these situations are male Typically and and so we'll wait and see what exactly could have happened here who this person could be why they were there So we'll continue to follow us very closely 802 a 2 2 8 a 2 if you just want to share thoughts on this and if you're in the in the Nashville area We're all thinking about you right now. So please if you want to call on 800 2 a 2 2 a 2 Now I got to switch gears for a minute and just talk about our sponsor here You find yourself reaching for yet another coffee or energy drink because you're not alone I mean I deal with us all the time But our friends at chalk can help you out They make natural supplements for men and women their male vitality stack includes a key ingredient that replenishes deficient amounts of testosterone and most men You don't notice how decreased your tea levels are until they're replenished with chalk for women their v their female Vitality stack helps with hormone health the endocrine system skin and hair Whether you're a guy or gal chalk hit a home run for anyone wanting more energy stamina and just an overall sensation of feeling good Learn more about their products online at chalk calm that's Coq calm use my name buck and save 35% off any chalk subscription for the life of that subscription Chalk choq calm and the name buck my name in the purchase process for 35% off Turn that yawn into a roar with chalk natural supplements Download and use the new clay and fuck up listen to the program live Catch up on any part of the show you might have missed use your C&B 24-7 subscription to get access to the guys find the clay and fuck up in your app store and make it part of your day shooting private religious school in Nashville Covenant school Green Hills area of Nashville just outside of downtown for those of you who are familiar with the city of Nashville my hometown I certainly Can empathize always with parents but in particular as one who put three kids in school this morning This is every parents worst nightmare. We know that this was a female shooter according to authorities three kids three adults killed Responding Nashville police officers then killed the shooter shooter was armed with at least three weapons. I believe we have audio set up now of the spokesperson for the Metro Police Department Don Aaron Laying out these details for you succinctly listen to this we know at this point that this shooter is a female She appears to be in her teens although her identification has not been confirmed at this juncture We know that she was armed with at least two Assault type rifles and a handgun We are efforting now to identify her She entered the school through a side entrance and Traversed her way from the first floor to the second floor firing multiple shots Okay, so that is again directly from the spokesperson for the Nashville Police Department One thing that just strikes me and again. This is very it's very early stage Of all the reporting on this and we could get we're gonna get more details, but we also could have some details that change here But that the shooter would go From the first floor to the second floor seems to be indicative of to me Given that we know it was a pre-planned A plea plan a plea sorry pardon me pre-planned murder spree, right? This person was going to go in there, but it seems there was a target in mind Specifically beyond you know an individual target to go to the second floor. I think that's likely here I don't know if it's an adult eric You would think it would be or one of the children But to not go on the first floor to go to the second floor seems like there was a there were some there were some choice of Who this individual was going for that's just my first reaction to it. Um also This is automatic. I don't know how I don't know if you even heard this yet, buck the minute that the press conference was over someone co-opted the the press Availability and immediately started screaming about the need for gun control I just want to play you this because this is where we are as a country They literally just finished updating. We still don't know who is responsible here any of the details And this was a woman who took over the mic and just started talking aren't you guys tired of covering this? Aren't you guys tired of being here and having to cover all of these mass shootings? I'm from Hyone Park family vacation with my son visiting my sister Emma I have been lobbying in DC since we survived a mass shooting in July. I have met with over a hundred and thirty lawmakers How is this still happening? How are our children still dying and why are we failing them gun violence is the number one killer of children? I'm gonna stop that so buck think about where we are as a nation this woman according to her own statement there is vacationing in Nashville sees that there is a mass shooting at a school Goes to the mass shooting event as soon as the update is over before the microphones are turned off She coops the microphone and immediately begins making a political argument They won't even wait. They won't even wait till we find out the casualty figure from the police They're making arguments about politics right away. That is the mentality think about think about that for a minute everybody out there As we are waiting to see what happened Why it happened who did this? this person vacationing in Nashville travels to the scene of a shooting and Immediately co-ops the microphone to make a political argument Literally seconds after actual officials step away from the microphones So for those of you out there who say well, you know, let's give thoughts and prayers to the family Let's try to figure out exactly what happened Buck as you well know virtually every time a mass shooting occurs It's the case that the person who had the weapons violated the law to have the weapons, right? So this idea that oh if we just had more gun laws these people wouldn't have access to guns No, most of the time they have broken the law to get their guns or they never should have had them because they already had violent acts in their past that would have kept them from having access to fire Assuming that the report is correct that this is a a teenage female in possession of the two rifles in the handgun There's definitely crime. There's definitely possession crimes. This person broke the laws persons now deceased also, but broke the law with regard to that and also as we know there are there are laws about Guns in a school zone this person broke those laws too so The and then there are the laws against murder and and all the rest of it So when you look at this people trying to make a policy or a political argument out of it They're just going to try to exploit the very raw emotions right now the sadness and the tragedy surrounding the incident and It's it's wrong. It's gross honestly people should be more respect Remember what I say just 30 minutes ago I think they're just going to jump onto this as a political issue right away No grieving allowed no coming together as a community allowed without a lecture that was one gun act anti gun activist I think we're going to be getting lectures. Unfortunately clay from a much more prominent place than that here We'll see thoughts and prayers to all the Nashville parents out there I am one of them certainly anyone with school kids in Covenant school It's been a brutal Monday start to the week here in Nashville more next hour"
