    "text": " Hi, this is Rudy Giuliani and you're listening to the audio version of Common Sense. Be sure to head to Rudy'sCommonSense.com. That's Rudy'sCommonSense.com or the Rumble or YouTube channel to get the full video experience of this podcast. Let's get into it. He's the mayor of New York City. Rudy Giuliani. Make our nation safe again. Our God-given Common Sense. And now, Rudy Giuliani with Common Sense. Hello, this is Rudy Giuliani and welcome to Rudy's Common Sense. Another episode and this episode is going to be devoted to the, to the, to the, almost can call it a war. Of course, it's a, hopefully it's a peaceful war, but a war between the parents and the school board. So the parents and the activists really, with the school boards either being captured or not being captured by the left wing activists and it turns on the education of their children. Education on the traditional subjects, which by every measure, when you compare us to other countries, is slipping badly, at least with regard to public education. And then the traditional subjects that have been removed and the new subjects that now appear to be on the horizon, different forms of critical race theory, which might be under different names and denied as critical race theory, but actually take place. And then sex and gender identification education, which I think most parents didn't even realize what was going on. A lot of this came about because of the pandemic with people, people at home, children getting at home instructions, parents picking it up and being shocked as I would be if I were, if I had children of that age, or parents, or children just coming home and telling them what teacher sent to them. Teacher said white people are all racist. So a teacher said that Abraham Lincoln was really a bad man. So many different things encompassed in this. But as you know, what's happened is broken out in these debates heated at school boards and extraordinary act, the president and the attorney general and the Biden administration has declared there's going to be an area of federal enforcement. Hearts for me is a form of federal prosecutor to figure out what laws they're going to use. There are no federal laws here. But this is so important to them as part of their agenda that they're frightening everyone with, you know, this is a federal case. And we have with us John Saylor, who has over this summer and before written very, very cogent articles on this subject. articles that are well balanced and most importantly articles that are accessible. And I thought it would be useful for all of us who are going to be facing this issue for some time to hear from John. So John, how are you? Doing great. Thanks. How are you? Good. Welcome. Welcome to Rudy's Common Center. Great pleasure to have you here. And the articles, the articles that the articles that I mentioned will get to in a moment. But right now you're a member of the National Association of Scholars. I saw the press release on June 1st of 2021. Tell us your background before that. And then we'll get to that. So I am a former teacher. I've taught at charter schools, Christian schools from everywhere between Harlem and rural North Carolina. So I have a background working in K through 12 education. But I'm also very interested in public policy, which is why I eventually signed on to become a research associate here at the National Association of Scholars, which is why you find me writing these articles today. So now what motivated you, I mean, there's so much you could, your, your, your, a belly wick is so large. How did you come to focus on the current issues about, let's call it controversial educational programs, whether they be critical race theory or gender or sex education or versions of the 1619 project? Well, I think it's one of the key issues of our day. And I think it's that way because there are a lot of organizations, a lot of people in power who adopt what amounts to an orthodoxy, certain views that they think you should not be able to disagree with. And I find those, many of those views to be damaging, damaging to children and to our country. Well, how long has this been going on without our as a society really knowing it? Or let's say it was confined to a very small group of people because it seems to have broken out now to the whole of society. But this has been going on for some time. I'm almost going to say below the surface. Yeah, I would say that there are sort of two waves of this movement. On one hand, a lot of it arose from the universities becoming more and more ideologically charged, which of course is a big focus of the National Association of Scholars. And as the universities have become more ideologically charged, education schools in particular have trained teachers and people with really sterling credentials to think in this way, to treat these wild ideas about gender or about racializing ideologies as unquestionably true. And so you start seeing organizations like gender spectrum come into being and become prominent in the early 2010s, although the ideology that informs gender spectrum and the ideology that informs the new movement toward, for instance, activist civics, that's been going on for a lot longer than that. These ideologies, for instance, critical race theory can be traced back to the 1980s and 90s. I would say that that was the first wave where it was happening sort of under the radar, but a significant amount of change. It was really hard to overstate this occurred in the summer of 2020. So the reason I know so much about this organization, gender spectrum is because I've done a lot of research on private schools and the way that the top private schools in the country, the ones that you've probably heard of, have all issued massive institutional changes that touch every part of the curriculum to change the their institutions to fulfill, to carry out diversity, equity and inclusion goals. And not only, I discovered that it's not just private schools doing this, it's not just private schools totally overhauling their institutions, it's school boards. Well, you know, it's a bunch of stuff. So it may just, it's a reference to John. It's interesting because I think most people, until your articles and a few things that happen here in New York with private schools, most people thought of this as a public school problem. And until recently, I mean, schools have been an issue, I was the mayor between 1994 and 2001. And schools were an issue then because of lack of performance because of comparisons where we were slipping to third and fourth and fifth and sixth. Now we're somewhere in the twenties or thirties with math, English, the basic subjects. And parents, aware parents were very upset about it. And there was as early as 1988, 1989, there was a big debate here in New York about daddy has, or Sonny has two mommies and Johnny has two daddy's and there was a big debate about whether it should be taught, whether there should be parental consent, whether there should be parental opt out, should it be consent opt out or nothing. So those debates go back some time. But they seem mild now compared to, they seem very mild compared to what happened. But what you're saying is it started in the universities and then it became part of the schools. Has this agenda been introduced in the public schools before it was introduced in the private schools? I think that both kinds of institutions have sort of followed the same timeline. So you start to see them taking a much more explicit stand for these kinds of things, especially in 2020, but really it's been happening for a couple of years. So you see private schools using gender spectrum, the organization that I've wrote about for training for professional development, using the resources as a guide to how their schools operate. But you also see public schools doing that. But their mission, if you look at the institutions, are often very clear. Their mission, the mission of gender spectrum is to teach children that gender is non-binary and to make sure that that kind of training shows up in school curricula all over the country and primarily public schools. How would we define the sort of the basket of programs that are at issue here? Maybe not all of them in every single school district or private school. That sort of the basic, it seems to me it's in part race, in part history, which also relates to race. And then we have gender and sex education. And they seem to be part of the same package. And interestingly, if you read the Black Lives Matter literature, they're very much part of the same package. When you look at what they want to achieve, almost everything you're talking about is in that Marxist literature of Patrice Coors. So how would you define this basket of things that they are trying to have in the public or private school curriculum? And who is they? Who's doing this? So I would say, broadly, they would be the vast sweep of elite college-educated professionals who buy into what their education and training has taught them. But specifically, they might be organizations that do professional development or activist organizations. If you want us to sink definition of what it is they're going for, some people call it social justice ideology. Some people call it critical race theory or critical theory in general. It goes under a lot of names. One person calls it the successor ideology, the ideology that comes after liberalism. That means that everything from gender to even civics education is looked at through this lens of oppression and oppressor, through the lens of these identity categories, especially race, class, gender, sexual orientation. So what we're seeing is an outsized focus on these things. Of course, nobody wants to ignore America's history with race. But that's not what these people are really proposing, just look at America's history with race. Rather, they're proposing that we look at virtually everything through the lens not only a race only a class, gender, gender identity, but also separate people out into either allies or oppressors. And that's what I think is really pernicious about all of this. So there are groups, a number of them like gender spectrum that are quite involved in programs like this. But is gender spectrum one of the larger and one of the bigger ones? Gender spectrum is unique because they're the primary organization pushing for what I call gender ideology. So they go into schools and they tell fifth grade teachers to teach their fifth grade classes that gender is non-binary. And then tell their students to chart themselves on three different gender spectrum charts, sex, gender expression, gender identity. This is deeply confusing material. And so they are by far the largest organization that does this in schools. So you describe in your article something I think that's very graphic and very useful for people to understand this. You say in one particular classroom, one of the teachers teaching this put up on the board on the white board three circles. And in the circles they had tell me exactly the categories in each of the circles. Yeah, so it was a line, a straight line, three straight lines. And on those lines they marked one sex, one gender expression and one gender identity. And they said everyone, most people appear somewhere in between male and female on all three of these spectrums. They even say this about sex. They say, well, some people are born intersex. They're born with characteristics, physical characteristics of both sex. And then they ask children to identify themselves on that spectrum, don't they? So what do you do? So what are the choices? What are the choices at the child? How old is the child and what choices does the child have? These are fifth grade students. And if you look at the video of gender spectrum's professional development, there's a lot of the students when they come up to the sex chart, they will say that their sex is either male or female. And most students are not intersex, they're not born with characteristics, physical characteristics so they're doing that based on biology. The sex is an interminable first, biological. The second one that is what they feel? The second one, yeah, so there's a gender identity which they say is the deeply held internal feeling about what gender you are. And what I found remarkable about this portion was that students came up and virtually none of them said just male or just female, they all said that they feel somewhere in the middle. And now that strikes me as just deeply confusing because what they teach is that essentially there are a lot of different genders. And if you feel somewhere in the middle, then you're probably not male or female, you're probably something else. They don't feed them particular identities but there certainly are hundreds of these so-called gender identities. You can be a demi girl, a demi boy, demi sexual categories that are used. Not only are those actual categories but you have major schools, especially these private schools, publishing long lists of accepted gender and sexual identities that include precisely those categories. And this is how we get to what inherently confuses the heck out of me, which is that we have 50 or 60 different genders. I have no idea what that means, that we have 50 or 60 different genders. I mean I always thought it was two, I can figure out how you might squeeze in a few more. But how do we get to 50 or 60 different genders? We'll be back in just a few moments. And remind you that we have got to help our friends. And I've asked you before, but this time I want you to do it for sure.

If you're a police officer, a uniformed officer, remember the military. So check with them right now. Let's get back to our interview. It is confusing and one reason it's confusing is because it comes mostly from people posting on Tumblr. Kids are post on Tumblr deciding that they've coining essentially a new gender identity. And then it gets picked up by the activist organizations like gender spectrum or like certain major independent schools. And suddenly it's got an institutional stamp of approval. This is problematic though, because the entire medical establishment in the United States has almost a uniform policy of accepting whatever a child says about their gender. So if they suddenly decide that they are gender non-binary, if they are not male or female, or if a girl, a young girl decides that she is now a male, if she identifies as a boy, then children can now go into various medical offices and get puberty blockers and begin to take the test. So or get testosterone. So how prevalent is this test in the fifth grade? If I'm doing the calculation correctly, we're talking about nine, 10 year olds, right? By and large, pre pre puberty, right? So we're talking about nine, 10 year olds who wouldn't generally know much about sex. At least they didn't usually know much about sex. And they're asked, number one, what are you? Well, you know, I wear a suit or I wear a pants on the boy or I'm a girl. Then they're asked, how do you feel or what your identity is? And you're telling me that most of them put down medium in between. Most of them don't just follow it with what they appear to be. That's a really. She puts down a boy. She looks like a boy. She puts down boy. That's the really pernicious thing. It's not just confusing for us. I imagine it's confusing for every have to be more confusing for the nine year old. Absolutely. In essence, the nine year old is beginning to develop their notions of who and what they are. It's now being encouraged to be confused, particularly if he sees the first two or three, put down. What would they, how would they answer that? They would answer in the middle or unsure or. Well, what was striking was one, one young girl's answer. She said, I was born a girl. But on the inside, I feel in the middle and I express myself. OK, in the middle. So now she says that. And what you're telling me is that when you say that the majority, like 60, 70 percent or so, put down middle. So I that's one of the default answer. I watched this video, a video of their training. And so this is just one example. But in the video that I watch, I don't think I saw anyone, any child, put an X next to expression, male or expression female, identity male, identity female. They were told sort of the jargon. And so and they took these adults at their word. They took these adults at their word when they said gender is non-binary. So you're probably somewhere in the middle. So wait, wait, they told at the beginning of this. Almost they're almost given the answer at the beginning. They're told that gender is non-binary. That is that is I mentioned orthodoxy. When we first started talking, that is the publicly accepted orthodoxy among these people. And that is the number one message. They don't give the children. They don't give the children, for example, or maybe they wouldn't be able to do it at that age. But they don't give them a chance to decide whether they agree with that or not. This is not something. This is not a college course where you're presented with alternative ideas and figure they'll decide for themselves. No, this is the way this works is that the children are instructed. This is why it's evil because these children have, I mean, you really should start with the question. Do you agree with it or not? But these children are too young to agree with it or not. Now, if you did this to a maybe 20 year old, the 20 year old would probably have something to say about that. You know, have developed it with their parents and their life experiences. And do you think gender is binary or non-binary? And then people who feel it's binary just stay out of the game. And people who don't get in it and try to determine what they are. But it's a very, very strange way to make children really, I think, very disturbed and upset. Not just disturbed and upset. That that would be moderate compared to the negative effects of this program. Because like I said, the medical establishment in the United States is pretty uniform in accepting gender affirmative care for minors. You just said that, well, kids this age probably can't make up their mind. And in a lot of other cases, we say, absolutely children can't make up their mind on an important life, life altering decisions. But when it comes to things like puberty blockers, which can lead later on down the line to infertility or testosterone, which can permanently change the way a girl looks, it can permanently make a girl, for instance, grow facial hair or double mastectomies. So how do you get to that stage? How do you get to that stage, John? So you put down middle. And do you do you then? Are you then asked? How middle are you? I mean, are you middle and you feel more like a boy or more like a girl or you're really dead set right in the middle? We'll be back in a few moments. Time to continue our very, very interesting interview. So that's where the coherence of this ideology is very much in question. But the main point is that a lot of people either say they identify as the gender that they were not born as. They were born as a girl and they identify as a male or they say, well, I don't identify with any gender or I identify with some obscure made up category that I have discovered. And after they do that, they very well might opt to ask people to refer to them by different pronouns. They might then ask people or seek medical care to change the way they look. So they look perhaps a girl will look more like a boy or perhaps just they'll look more like nothing. And it's remarkable how this particular ideology encourages children to do that. Once you start referring to yourself as a different gender and start referring to yourself by a different name and start asking everyone else around you to do that, then it becomes a it becomes a lot more difficult for people to say. Or for people to change that to say, actually, I was wrong. I was 10 years old. A lot of this began and you wrote one of your articles. I believe it was the one. It was one of those for the for the for the city journal about the professor. Can't can't can't can't can't be. Yes. So Ibram X. Can be is is one of the early writers about this. And his book is almost. I mean, people, I think, pick it up thinking it's a sort of a moderate middle of the road book because it's read so often. And it's really quite it's quite out there. And he is he is he is he is he is also called upon to lecture at many of these schools. Does he also conduct programs at them? So Ibram X can be is probably the best example of the racial racializing component of this new ideology. Ibram X can be basic. His basic philosophy is simple. He says that any difference, any difference at all in outcomes for different groups is just automatically racism. So if African Americans perform in a different way than white people do, then automatically that is by definition, racism. And there are a lot of problems with this this sort of policy or this way of thinking and the policies that result from it. But nevertheless, he's incredibly popular and he's incredibly popular, especially at very wealthy private schools where he he is. His books are assigned for all students. His books are assigned for faculty and staff. And he often is invited at a very high price to come and give public lectures to those students, essentially preaching this idea. And there's a woman of almost equal stature. Can you tell us her name? There's a woman of almost equal stature has also made millions and millions of dollars doing this. I believe you're referring to Robin D'Angelo. That's the course of a murder. That's right. And she does similar thing. She goes to school, school boards, private schools, public schools, and she lectures on a combination of critical race theory, some forms of 1619 project and this whole issue of gender. What should we call a gender identification or gender ideology is what I refer to. And Robin D'Angelo, her main point is this concept of white fragility. The notion that if you even question that you're a racist, that is evidence that you are a racist. It's an evidence that you're that you embody white fragility, which is a trap. That means that nobody can question what she's saying, even if the factual basis of her arguments are very much suspicious. How many of these people are in fact communist and how much of this is supported by communist groups? I can't speak to how many is supported by communist groups, but I can absolutely say that the principles of Marxism either implicitly or explicitly are all over this kind of material. Some people are explicitly influenced by Marx. So anyone who advocates for critical critical race theory, they are working in the lineage of Marx and they'll they'll straightforwardly say that there's there's. The only thing I can give them credit for is they are completely unashamed to say they are extremely dedicated extreme Marxists. And actually point out the connections. So you don't have to go make them between critical theory and critical race theory and Patrice. Kowars considers us of both a Marxist scholar and a very effective Marxist activist. Some of the others hide it, but Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, which everyone thinks is primarily about police brutality, really is primarily about gender. It began as a gender group and they assume the name Black Lives Matter because of the protest and it got them a lot of, but if you look at the literature, it's more about gender than race. And they really are a perfect melding of the two. And once you accept certain premises about what they call intersectionality or about identity, then all of these issues blend together. And I think you're correct to say that they primarily focus on oppression based on identity. And when they focus on that, they absolutely use the paradigm, the language of Marx. There is a direct lineage and there are also a lot of people who find that kind of speak to be persuasive. And so they they catch on and repeat it whether or not they actually have ever read Marx or think that they're Marxist. Well, what is the what's the prognosis? Where are we now? Where are we going and how can we change it? There are many organizations that so I don't want to be overly optimistic. But when you have plans that totally overhaul a school district or totally overhaul a school and create diversity officers, chief diversity officers, it's very difficult to change the institution. But this is no longer in the dark. People are no longer afraid to speak up against this kind of ideology. And as a result, I think that a lot of people are going to make some significant change around surrounding gender. It used to be unquestionable in the United States. This kind of stuff is still difficult to talk about in the mainstream media, but that is changing. And it has already changed in certain European countries. There's a much broader level of pushback in places like the UK. In Sweden, they they completely stopped all gender affirmative care. So they were ahead of us. I knew that they were ahead of us in this because I can remember even in the early part of the century going to Europe. And I used to spend a lot of time there and friends of mine complaining about what, you know, and also I should get in contact with them again, predicting it would happen to us. I mean, I would say, Oh, this is the kind of European thing. This is what you've become broken broken down old culture. Where the great America said, Oh, wait, just wait. And they're right. It has spread here now. But the parents now have caught on to it. So you absolutely you think over a period of time, particularly their work in the school boards and will will will tend to reverse this, put it, put a break on it. That that is essentially our our our charge, our mission. We have to we have to change these things. And that's the work that we're doing at National Association of Scholars. We are providing resources that say, no, this is not how civics ought to be taught. This is not how gender ideology. It should not be spread. And I think a lot of parents are catching on. Well, I'm going to have you back because we've only covered maybe 10% of the subject and you really are excellent at this. And and may I say that I just personally congratulate you and your organization to see now that we're finally focusing an effort against it. I really congratulate you and thank you. And you're performing maybe maybe one of the most important services that we need to to save our way of life. Thank you. And thank you. Well, I will. And I really appreciate that. Thanks so much for having me on. If you can educate me more, I certainly will be as helpful as I can. God bless you. Well, I hope you found John's description as interesting as I did. And I'm sure you found it as disturbing as I did. And no reason to sum it up very much. I think you got it all. But I think few few things have to be pointed out what John is describing really goes back quite some time. Oh, my goodness, it may go back to the 80s and 90s with the beginning of infiltration of the educational system and the readjustment of history and the attack on our founding fathers and so many things. As I said to John, the whole putting sexuality and gender into the school system that goes back at least to the late 1980s with attempts to explain homosexuality and lesbian behavior in a more tolerant way. I mean, there were two sides to that. And all of that seems quite mild now when you look at where we are. But here's the example that I wanted wanted to use. And it comes from actually it comes from an article that was originally written, I believe, for for City Journal, which is a publication of that truly remarkable institution, the Manhattan Institute, which does unbelievably great, intellectual, actually honest work for years and was a big, big support for the reduction of crime. This was written for the New York Post, ultimately, and really created shockwaves just a few weeks ago. So he's describing a particular class that's applying the the gender spectrum curriculum to fourth and fifth graders. So this is sort of a chart that we're going to use in this. So the teacher begins the election, or the, I guess we would call it for for a child, we would call it the teaching lesson begins the teaching lesson by basically stating a fact. We remember that gender is not binary right children. Well, there's no room here for, I don't know if some say no, but there's not much room for that. That's a given gender is not binary. I don't know. For the last two, three, four, thousand years, it has been. So if it isn't, this is kind of a big shock to everyone. When I was in school, I think if system Margarita asked this question, the answer would be a sister of you gone crazy. Yeah, it's like boy, girl. So I'm not saying I'm not saying that this is right or wrong at this point. I'm just saying this is shocking to the sensibilities of people who grew up as late as 20 years ago, maybe 30 years ago. But the answer now is, no discussion. Gender is not binary. Meaner gender is not boy, girl, male, female. Okay. So now that's a given. So then the teacher asked, well, what does that mean? And the student replies dutifully. It means that there aren't just two types of genders. Okay. So this scene comes from something within the gender spectrum program, part of their curriculum. And it's called creating gender inclusive schools. And when I explain this to you, remember, this is being done to fifth graders. And although it's not exactly 100%, I assume that we're talking about nine year olds and 10 year olds. We're basically talking about pre-pubescent children. So what they know and don't know about sex is very debatable. And how much they've been able to think about it. And how much they be capable of thinking about it in a critical way is highly debatable. I'm showing a matter of mex about this, but I'm just raising these questions because I know these are questions that are completely overwritten here, as is the original question about whether gender is binary or not, which I don't know, I don't know if that's a settled issue. Then the student is asked, in this case, it was a female student was asked to come up to the board and was given three, three spectrums, they're called spectrums, which were put on the white board and labeled biology, expression, and identity. Now, what does that mean? It means how you were born, how you express yourself now, and how do you feel on the inside? About your gender and the girl answered as this particular girl answered as follows. I was my biology. I was born as a girl. Okay, we got that said. How do you express yourself? I express myself in the middle. And then what's your identity? How do you feel on the inside? Middle. So you got it, right? Now, children come up now, all of them come up. And based on at least this program and several others that were observed by John, the large majority of answers on what you see on the board, not girl. I guess an equal number of girls and boys, depending on the school. But this answer may change and this answer is binary, boy, girl, right? Unless we've invented something I haven't heard of, that would really be shocking. But who knows? But generally this answer gets answered, girl, boy. And now we get to expression and the majority of answers are middle. And then the majority of answers here are middle. And I would have thought for sure that this would be a minority of answers when you consider that I've always labored under the impression. All through the development of dealing with sexuality and the sexual revolution. I've always thought of homosexuality and lesbianism and that that's about 10% of the population. And I know the estimates for transgender are about 10% of the population. I assume that 10% overlaps to some extent. So I don't know what it would be. I don't think it'd be a full 20%. Probably let's just say for argument sakes about 15%. So you'd expect if this is all, you know, determined by genes and what's inside you and you have no choice about this, which has been a very, very strong, strong argument about why homophobia is wrong and all those other forms of bias. So you assume that it's about 15, even 20%, that you'd expect that here, most of your answers, 80% of your answers, even if you grant another 10% for confusion, would be boy or girl. But no, no, most of the answers are middle. And then over here, how do you feel inside middle? You'd expect this to be no more than 20 to 30%. The actual number that genetically are and those that might be in some state of legitimate confusion about it. So how do we end up with 60, 70? I don't know how many percent he wasn't exactly able to get the exact number of things. You said the most people answered it this way. This happened because of suggestion, doesn't it? You know what children are like and children are not chugweighted than adults. I mean, you saw during the pandemic when they closed the churches, instead of objecting all the very religious people just went along like sheep, right? People basically follow us. They follow the leader and they follow the default position when it's set up. When the first three kids get up there, male or female and put middle down, 80% of the class can put down middle. Because that's the cool thing to be. And if you're middle here on the inside, you're middle. No, this is very, very dangerous. I don't think I have to emphasize why it's dangerous and I'm not. I'm going to have you think about it because everybody's going to have different reasons. But I can tell you in part, in addition to the Black Lives Matter and the critical race theory and teaching children that all whites are racist and that America is a terrible country and that we were founded in slavery and that Christopher Columbus is some kind of a horrible human being. And Jefferson is not much work better. And Jefferson statue had to be taken down from City Hall in New York. And we've taken down Abraham Lincoln statue. We've taken down Theodore Roosevelt statue. Gosh, almighty, we've taken down Frederick Douglass's statue. He wasn't he wasn't for abolition enough, I guess. This is a systematic effort to destroy. For the American child, the love of America, America's a hateful place. And the respect and inculcation of our traditional values that have been century long, many century long values that civilized human beings have held. And they're being thrown away without analysis, without discussion. Remember, how does it begin? Well, we know that gender is not binary. Let's begin with that, right kids? Wow. And if we don't know that, what do we get canceled? Nobody talks to us in school. I've represented some kids like that. One kid who got caught holding a Reagan sign and got tortured for it in a D.C. school. This is prevalent very, very much in D.C. This is prevalent in New York. It's in the rich, rich, private schools where a lot of the parents don't know it, but a lot of the teachers are left wing, chowd heads. That was an old expression. And it's taught in the public schools, much more than you think. And this is where we're going, unless we stop it. And this is the emotion and the rationale behind the parents being so upset about what the school boards and the schools and the private have been doing to their children, indoctrinating them behind their back, making a large percentage of children who have no genetic propensity to being trans. Question it. This should never be more than 20, 30% at best. And you cannot escape the power of suggestion of peers for children, particularly nine and ten years old. This should result in a prosecution of gender spectrum for child abuse. And for the teachers and for the school boards. If we had prosecutors and we had a government with any courage and wanted to protect our children. Let's see if we do. But don't stop. Don't be intimidated by fascist actions like those of, I don't even call them, attorney general. What the heck is he? Commissar, Commissar of the Biden enforcement program. That's our attorney general. Once a judge. Now fascist. He's going to prosecute on the federal crimes. People go into school board meetings and making just, making just ruptures. He can make that up. This is where we are. But you got to know it. You got to understand it. You got to understand how bad it is. And when you see these parents very upset, you just think if your child came home and said, mom, dad, today I was told that gender isn't binary. I don't even know what that meant. But all the kids said, that's right. So I said, that's right. Then Mary Jane, my best friend and Susie, the prettiest girl in class and Joanie, the meanest one in class got up. And they all said that they were in the middle here. So I don't even, you know, I just put that down. I don't want to get, I don't want to get canceled by the, by the mean girls. You know, this is pernicious. Who I need you. Stay with me. Huh? Stay with Rudy's common sense.com. We're going to fight all this. We're going to beat him. You know why? Real simple. We're right. And they're wrong. Our system of government is the greatest, the history of the world. Our way of life is the greatest in history of the world with all of its flaws because we correct them. And what they are operating on is a Marxist, Leninist playbook, word for word, chapter for chapter, step by step, destroy schools, destroy the parents, just take God out. And then we got him. And centralize power as much as possible. And isn't that what they're also doing? So to combat it, you got to know it. To know it, you got to get around the censorship. I'm going to help you with that. And so a lot of other people. So stay tuned for the next episode of Rudy's common sense. You know where to get it on Rudy's common sense.com.
