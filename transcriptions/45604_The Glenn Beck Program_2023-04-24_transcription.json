    "text": " What did we talk today talk about today in the podcast do that? not from a parallel Is there any story today that you would say that you wouldn't say Five to ten years ago that come on Was there a single story in in today's show? I Don't think so I can't think of one that seemed even Mildly rational tonight. I'm doing a special on Blaze TV. I'm gonna show you how it gets worse. We are now officially in the place That I said top down bottom up inside out the top is now Solidified in charge they have their hands on all the levers They just need the country to be turned inside out and us fighting violently against each other that way they can come down because the bottom has risen up I'm gonna show it to you tonight with the trans army. We talk about a lot of this on today's podcast You don't want to miss a second of it It's brought to you by American giant Every time I think about American giant I think about going into the clothing store my little hometown of Mount Vernon where we used to buy Levi's and He's still kind of by Levi's like this if you buy them, you know In a regular story you can go fancy pants stores. I don't sound like this, but they used to just put them up on shelves And then you know my mom would take me and I buy all of my clothes, you know one time a year I'm if I was lucky I could get a new pair of Levi's That's the way it used to be it's not that way anymore 95% of the clothing Americans bought back in the 60s made here in America now 97% of it comes from some foreign place I welcome American giant as a sponsor to this program To them, it's not just the products that they make it's the American workers that make them It's about good paying jobs that allow people to take pride in their hard work that they do that you want to fix the country That's how you do it you begin restoring our dignity I want you to go to American Dash giant calm and look at their clothing if you're in in you know looking for any kind of clothing Get the best American made clothing all source the cotton is source the the cotton farmers are from America It's all cut pieced sewn together here in America Changing the world one customer at a time. It's American dash giant com slash Glenn American dash giant comm slash You're listening to the best of the planet There is a developing story in Wisconsin and We have an exclusive interview here with Libby Sobek She is with the Wisconsin Institute for law and liberty This is really this is an absolute sign of the times This story is something that I think is happening over and over and over again and everybody knows it But the parents are being slammed for saying anything about it Libby welcome to the program Thanks so much. So tell me what tell me what happened. This was At what school is the name of this school? It is the very Wisconsin Sun Prairie okay, so what happened? So earlier in March there were four freshman girls Going into the girls locker room after a gym class been involved a swim unit and decided to rinse off before class very common practice And while they were in the girls locker room an adult Biological male a senior student was also in a locker room with them proceeded to walk into the bathroom Naked and as he exposed his body to them said I'm trans by the way This was incredibly uncomfortable for these four freshmen 14 year old girls and When they brought this incident to the attention of their school administrators The school administration completely failed to do anything in accordance with federal law including notifying their parents Oh my god and after weeks of parents reaching out to the school asking for conversation with the school administration Asking for clarity around school policies the school only met with the parents a month after the incident and has yet Today to identify a policy that really clarifies What should have happened and how they're going to prevent this from happening in the future? So Is this is this boy has he claimed he was trans before do you know? Yes, it's our understanding that this senior student has a socially transition and identifies as a transgender woman She's this really raises questions about the Biden administration's push to school districts and other institutions of higher education About what sex means under title 9 right the last 50 years We've understood that title 9 protects young women and girls and ensures to provide them with spaces that are safe from sexual harassment yet today under the Biden administration all of that has been turned upside down and in fact we don't know what safe spaces should be provided for young women and under the Sun Prairie school district current statement of policy The girls were the ones that were expected to leave the locker room. That's completely backwards Oh my gosh. I have to tell you For a group of people that were the ones that were screaming about safe spaces the the disregard for our children and for our girls in particular to have a safe space is Remarkable just remarkable I completely agree. I'm not only an attorney I'm a mom of two young girls and these are the sorts of item issues that are really of nightmares for parents Right. We want to put our students in school and expect that they have a state space to learn and participate in educational activities and school districts quite frankly are receiving these directives from the Biden administration and In instance instances like these that apparently corner quote never happen are only going to continue to happen as the Biden administration pushes these regulations to change what the definition of sex means under Title IX so You're taking them to court. You're taking the school district to court We are not actually Unfortunately, there's not really an avenue to bring the school district to court under federal law And so these very brave parents said we want to bring light to this situation we want there to be accountability for the school district and That's what the Wisconsin Institute for Long Liberty has stepped up to do We want to protect these young girls from the cultural backlash of cancel culture by being the ones to bring this issue to light and talk about Why we need to have transparency and clear policies around Title IX and sexual harassment so if there's no road to litigation, how are you expecting to Change the mind of of the school district Well, I you know in today's world Bringing to light these issues can be a really powerful tool We're already seeing the school district having to respond in multiple instances Now they started off saying that this wasn't clearly reported they are now saying well This in fact did happen and that they're taking steps to make sure it hasn't it won't happen again And we want this to be a lesson for school districts around the country You can't shy away from hard conversation. You need to have clear policies around What sexual harassment means and how students can access spaces for students of one gender or another and most importantly we hope that divide an administration is paying attention and really considering before they put these regulations into law Really thinking through what the consequences of their actions are We'll stand that the ready to you know join when I expect to be a national movement to hold the Biden administration Accountable once those regulations go into effect. We're still waiting for that to happen But for now we really want to hold these school districts accountable by having a national conversation. Okay, Libby Thank you so much Liberty or sorry Libby is with The law firm the wisconsin Institute for law and liberty And you can find more information about what they do and how you can get involved at will Dash law Dored Libby. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. I um you bet I have to tell you did you see the story that was in the news? Uh Today's do I'm just looking for it where the doctor A doctor who says Uh that this is not hang on. I'm finding it here. Uh that this is not what? Transgenderism is not what Everybody thinks it is. He says there is a known psychological phenomena And it is called auto-gynophilia And it is a man's sense of being sexually aroused at the thought of himself as a woman Trans activists are pushing back on this he said but this is a psychological disorder And uh, he said when they are linked to sexuality of wanting to get you know dressed as a woman Then you get shame and guilt and fear and people don't want that so they deny this Condition and he says the problem with it is is it is a it's a sexual disorder so You're putting some of if if one if we could just save one child if one of these guys has this Putting him in the locker room with girls is Just the worst that there could be It's amazing. We have to make these arguments particularly from people who spent the previous Three to five years telling us if a male co-worker makes a joke that is a little bit blue They should be fired and humiliated and thrown off of a off of the workforce and never to be seen again Yeah, you know if if a male asks a woman out or flirts with her it is some massive you know Crisis right. I mean like the entire like the there were multiple levels of the me too thing The harvey Weinstein level being a very valid one and then it trickled down to like hey He he wants asked a co-worker out And therefore he's you know toast and it's like these same people are like, you know Teenage girls should probably be naked with teenage boys in the same locker room against their will in this case An 18 year old and a 14 year old should be in the 14 year olds don't want it to happen are saying no We should ignore that That's the same people are making these arguments. Well, no means In this case no means yes, right? I guess I don't know Yeah, huh, which is just fascinating and this also goes to the the parade Situation that happened over the weekend where what was the city was it? Florida Florida right yeah where they had this port st. Lucie. They're gonna have a pride parade organized by the pride alliance of the treasure coast love that and The law stepped in and said look you have a pride parade I'm gonna stop that and do what you want to have pride for whatever you're having pride for one of the seven deadly sins Go ahead and just have a parade to celebrate that But go ahead do that the thing is if you're going to have nudity and People you know here. Here's what the law actually says. Yeah, go ahead You can't have if you're doing something in front of a live audience And in whole or in part depict or simulate nudity sexual conduct sexual excitement Specific sexual activities lewd conduct or the lewd exposure of prosthetic or imitation genitals or breasts You cannot do it in public with children present apparently you could still do it in public Yes, which is actually news to me. I didn't I didn't know you could but yeah, you can do that in public You just can't do it in front of children and they're like oh we can't do it with the front of children Let's cancel the entire parade. I mean what is legitimately they decided to cancel the parade because they could not do it in front of children that is like Am I missing a step in the logic train here? I'm just wondering what you were gonna say that is like what not what it seems as if What their goal here was To do it in front of children to have nudity and sexual acts depicted in front of children And then they're like I can't believe these conspiracy theorists who think that there's all this weird stuff going on with kids Yeah, I mean it seems like you keep backing up the conspiracy theory like are you Trying to convince us it is true It is incredible that this keeps happening and I guess maybe they're arguing as well If you're not gonna tell us how we're gonna do our parade blah blah blah well That's what the law is it's kind of telling you what you It's one of the reasons why we resist a lot of laws not this one though The innate nudity in front of kids act is one that I support they should not have it It is just amazing to me just amazing to me that we have to say that I know it's It would be weird you have a parade That is all about sex and you're carrying all kinds of The issue knows things that you're carrying with you like replica reproductive replicas. Yes Call it that you were carrying those you are I mean you're just pushing sex that's all that is and You think I mean I I really think this is the beginning Of giant pushback And I I really hope that it becomes sane and uh, you know that You don't flip, uh the to the other side and the other side becomes as nasty as People on the left are I I don't want people to just be rounded up and thrown into jail because they're all a politician I want fair and just Trials for anybody in Washington that has been doing hunter-biden. I want a fair and just trial I don't want to just throw them in because I say he's guilty Even though I know he is and I I have no problem with transgender people As long as you're keeping it, you know in the appropriate place, which is never a school Never or stripping in front of children. It is never an appropriate place But I'm telling you this is the beginning of pushback. I think america has had it up to here And if if these people aren't careful careful Yeah, I mean, you know because they're how dare them think that we shouldn't be able to do that in public with children How dare us Oh, I think I think we're just getting started. I think we're just getting started This is the best of the glenbeck program and don't forget Rate us on i2 So Stu have you been following the Nashville shooter the manifesto thing? I think it's fascinating. I do too Just one of the strangest things You know, you you think you know a country and then and then this happened. Yeah, okay, so the Nashville shooter She goes in Kill six at the covenant elementary school. She shot by police They grab a manifesto and there's two manifestos apparently one is Why she did it and all of her thoughts behind it. The other one is like here's what i'm going to do And they're now saying that the fbi Won't release it. So it's out of the Nashville police hands apparently Now with the fbi And who doesn't trust the fbi? so they um They're not going to do it because they said that it is it's very disturbing And it would be astral i'm quoting astronomically dangerous Wow Astronomically dangerous very very strange and and Seemingly there's a path here right Astronomically dangerous to whom Now she's talking about apparently and again i'm calling her her because she's a woman. Okay The entire media has abandoned their policy of Welcoming a gender transition because she identifies as a man Yet Nowhere in any article do they actually call her a he Why Why in this one case have they abandoned this policy That they say you are a complete hate monger if you It's dead naming they are dead naming this shooter Now i am completely for that Whatever she would want in life. I want the opposite to happen in her in her wake That's what i mean. I don't need to be it. I don't want to be vindictive about it. I just want to tell that And she went and killed a bunch of nine heroes. Yeah, I know I kind of feel like I want to be a little bit Yeah, I might not be the most biblically based belief that I have I don't think that's Really biblically based at all Yeah, perhaps but I don't there are times in which uh, my emotions maybe get the best of me I know so we'll just say believe that aside for a moment You know, it's it's it's hard to be like me all the time, especially the humility part of me. I mean There is nobody more humble than me And you know that you're the humblest I know it's there should be an award for this, but anyway, I'm too humble to ask for it But the power here is interesting. I think yeah because they're saying it's incredibly dangerous like I don't does she have a decoder ring for our nuclear arsenal What do you mean? It's astronomically dangerous. Yeah, so there's two things though. There is her Why I did it and what i'm planning and what the I guess the fbi is saying is uh, the the part where she was planning Somebody else they said to be very very dangerous because somebody else could get this and just pick it up where she left off Well, I don't think it's all that hard. I mean unless like stu said she has codes to the nuclear sea We don't need that but I think you're fooling yourself if you are Thinking that you know crazy people can't come up with a plan to kill a lot of people You know, I mean right now. Maybe it was let's target the gop headquarters and because I I believe the Uh the fbi is trying to protect Something I just don't think it's the american people and what I think it is if I my uh Propose a gas here. Yes is glenn. Do you know what evil conservatives would do if they hurt if they read this Manifesto by this trans person They would target the trans unity. They did say that that's that's that is what they're saying So like when a trans person kills nine-year-olds The danger Are conservatives who might go after other unrelated trans people can I just tell you something here? Can I tell you something? We have 350 million guns they're in the hands of Most of the conservatives very few liberals, okay Just want to make this really clear if there was a problem You know about it I mean it is a she it is a bizarre Inconsistency in their argument as you as you note here But like in there's a there's a quote from a guy from john jay college of criminal justice And he says I think what the fbi is really concerned with Uh, and I think law enforcement is that if there is something in there that is truly dang damaging for the transgender community I think they are hesitant to do it because they are afraid of a violent backlash against that protected class of people Would be in there that would be so damaging. This is a crazy person What honestly what could she have written that would be worse than murdering nine-year-olds I like I I don't know like and again. I have not seen any backlash against your everyday trans person for them these murders What would I think what you know about conservatives that we tend to treat people as individuals So the people actually murdering nine-year-olds. Yes, we want consequences to come to them The people actually jiggling their naked genitals in front of kids faces We think there should be legal consequences there too But we don't blame every single person that has similar immutable characteristics or or mutable Characteristics Because they share them with with criminals that you don't blame the group That's the left's thing to do And maybe that's why every media source seems to get on these bandwagons because that's the way they think Well, they always finger themselves They they oh, I sorry for that they all People people you with your dirty minds. I know you This is the audience's fault. Not yours Glenn. This is a careful for what their mind went my god I blame them I have disappointed in every single person in this audience from what they just thought you You're sick. That is you're starting to side with the media So the media always points to us on the things that they do the things that they believe yes, you know what they do So i'm going to move off of that point and let me get to uh Okay So the guy in Louisville that shot five people And killed them at the old national bank in Louisville remember that story. I do remember that for sure. Yeah, okay, okay Remember that was going to be you know, oh, we got to ban these guns 13 page manifesto which the daily mail has Allegedly disclosed that the 25 year old shot and killed multiple colleagues In part to prove his belief that guns are too easy to obtain in kentucky He wanted to draw attention to mental illness Something his parents later disclosed he suffered from and took medicine from Gun control backers latched on to the shooters crimes to embolden democrats to move forward with an unconstitutional red flag law and gun grabs But that's What he wanted that's what was in his manifesto And you know, let me just let me just say this They are on They're on television and uh in public Imagine if I were on the air every day and I said those people for january 6th I'm bailing all of them out I'm you know, I'm with all of them except for ray abs I'm for all of them And I think they did good And we will bail them out and provide them with tournies Anybody who ever does anything like that Do you think that that would encourage more people to do that? Be neutral or discourage. What do you think? They are telling people like in nashville If you have a good reason You're fine You're totally fine. In fact, you might be a hero We'll bail you out. We'll clean it up. We'll cover it up You just you just do your thing They are breeding killers And setting defizing the behavior. Yes Because they're all sick All of them have a mental illness You don't go and do this Without a mental illness so they are playing on there Supping up the people who have a mental illness How many times have you Have you ever Heard anyone on any of these Lefty talk shows or you know, cnn Have you ever heard anyone say to their audience Be careful who you're surrounded by there are a lot of crazy leftists There are also maybe people that want you to strike out and do these things whatever you do Don't that's not the way we do things. We don't burn cities down We don't riot We don't do those things Have you ever heard them say that? No, you've heard them say the opposite over and over and over again So when a guy shows up at a bank with a gun and kills five people And he says in his manifesto, it's because You know, Joe Biden is right and all these people are right. We got to grab guns Does that give you anyone Pause on what you're doing anything No, because with the left the ends justify the means and that should chill americans to the bone What's the difference between killing five and 500,000 ends justify the means Americans America's going down the wrong path And I think most americans know it You just have to remind yourself all the time who we are who we are They're doing everything they can to destroy our history To destroy our values destroy our churches They're coming up this this is a new religion This is a religion whether they like it or not they abandoned god long ago And what nichi said is true You can't just banish god. It leaves a vacuum And you will worship another god Well, that's what happened to a third of jerems They worshiped a god of science and a mythological pagan style god and eight-off hitler and look where they look where they ended up And nobody stood up to stop them because the churches were too slow to asleep Too worried about losing things America's different always has been When our churches begin to get it and that's really for you You need to start leaving your church if they're silent and go find another one They're silent on all of this stuff. You need to say what what what is the deal here? What is the deal if they're not at least you know preaching against silence Preaching against you know chaos Trying to make people better and come together and teach people How to do that if they're not doing that if they're not pointing out evil, why are you going? Why are you going? And don't you dare leave your church without telling your church exactly why you're leaving the best of the glenbeck program This is the glenbeck program The big story of the day one of the biggest I think in In in news for a long time. Oh, yeah, uh, tucker carlson is out at fox news now I don't know what that means You know in we're in wild speculation territory, you know could be that he was fired um because of You know, they just paid out, you know, almost a billion dollars and they don't want any chance of anything But that's suicidal to me. This is a suicidal move for fox if it's their move, right? If it's their move we don't know could be that tucker decided he wanted to leave could be that tucker They they asked tucker to do something. He was not comfortable doing That could be let me yeah, let me read this statement to you. Tell me this is the way it's framed This is from fox news They say fox news media and tucker carlson have agreed to part ways That's exactly what they said. I think when I left Right and that has always been framed as you got fired, which I know for a fact was not true considering I saw their offer for your extension Yeah, so it was always a weird framing from media. So we parted ways so that that bodes well that tucker I don't know may have been asked to hey, you got a you got to stop with x y or z No See ya right could be that yeah he I you know, I don't know what his contract was um And it you know it probably was it very well could be that they um Couldn't fire him because they didn't have cause And so they wanted to change maybe the format of the show wanted him to do things differently, etc, etc Make it unworkable for him So that way he would say all right. I'm not doing that and they'd say well the only other thing is you leave Well, I got a contract fine. We'll pay it out Because if you fired him he had to pay it out anyway Um We thank him for his service to the network as a host and prior to that as a contributor Mr. Carlson's this is I mean amazing mr Carlson's last program was february april 21st The fact that you have the number one host and all of cable news And he doesn't even come back on to say hey, this is what's going on. I mean that No, goodbye show. No none of that just he's done Fox news tonight will air at apm eastern this evening on an interim as an interim host helmed by rotating Fox news personalities until a new host is named would you sign up for the blaze right now?

Tucker was the only guy out there that I felt was in the mainstream media that was telling america the truth Who's doing that? There's nobody in the mainstream media nobody And I I now include Fox Getting rid of tucker carlson wow letting him walk out the door even wow Guys at the top of he had what three days with elon musk last week Hmm you get a sit down with elon musk at this time with everything that's going on between the starship and uh twitter And you're gone the next week never seen anything like it Never seen it really is a remarkable. It's not the way I thought this day was going. Oh no. That's that's for sure Yeah, it's uh You know, it's I kind of like every day. I think well It's going to be interesting to see how all that works out amazing too as as I'm watching succession And they're in the final season just like watching all the you wonder how much of this stuff is real Um behind the scenes. I think a lot of it is real. Yeah, it's certainly based on stuff Again, it's a negative take on what you do basically the fox news channel Um, it's I think fascinating to watch this because you've really have we ever seen A situation like this. I mean they they got rid of uh billow riley at very near his peak Or else this thing you could come up to is um um Oh shoot. I just forgot his name. Um, he was at nbc did the morning show matt lauer matt lauer But again, that was totally different. I know totally different scenario But he still was the big the big name but he wasn't even at his peak You know, this is really I mean, this is hucker carlson world Peak You know the damage this does to the right If if the left and sorrels money which I guarantee you was involved If that If they can learn that they can do this we're done by the way Have you seen that uh the automakers are dropping all am radios? Mm. This is in fact, let me get you something. This is from the The national association of broadcasters text am To five two eight eight six and tell congress we need am radios in cars There's a lot of reasons, but this is another way just to silence us on am radio Uh, please they are they're going to drive us out of everything They can get away with this Oh, they are so emboldened Uh text am To five two eight eight six tell congress we need am radio in cars Please do that.
