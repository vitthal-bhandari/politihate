    "text": " Bloveating hairdo Jim Acosta has been banned from the White House, at least temporarily, after refusing to shut up and playing keep-away with a female White House intern.

An awful shooting occurs in California, but the political activists are already out in force. Finally, the mailbag. I'm Michael Knowles, and this is The Michael Knowles Show.

Visit expressvpn.com.com to learn more. This was Jim Acosta's favorite day. It was his favorite day probably of his entire life. He gave us a little bit of reaction. He explained even more what happened after the scuffle with a White House intern and nagging the president with a bunch of questions. He gets his past revoked. Here's what he says to Anderson Cooper. Yeah, I went back to the White House actually to do a live shot for your program. Just before eight o'clock and when I arrived at the gate, the Secret Service came out and informed me that my press credentials were being, I guess, revoked temporarily suspended. And the Secret Service officer came over to me and asked me to hand over my credential. And I did. And I told him, I said, listen, I know you're a professional, you're just doing your job. And thanks for your service. And, Michael, a credential I've had for five years. I want to read a reaction from a few of your colleagues covering the White House. Jeff Mason from Reuters has tweeted, I was seated next to Acosta at today's press conference and did not witness him placing his hands, doesn't quote, on the young intern as the White House alleges. He held onto the microphone as she reached for him. So that's what they're saying. That's what this is all about that allegedly Jim Acosta pushed this girl, this White House intern who was trying to take the mic away, just pause and take a moment and realize how much Jim Acosta loves this. This is what his entire career of being a journalist has built toward is going on CNN saying, I'm here. They took away my White House press badge, me little old me. I'm E my all through the night. I'm E my, I'm E my, I'm E my. He is loving every second of this. It's all about Jim being in the spotlight. And this is the story. This is actually why it's right for the White House to revoke his press credential. It's not because he played keep away with this reporter. Some people right now are trying to say that he physically assaulted this reporter. He didn't. He did get physical though. He didn't go in beaters. She's not gonna have a bruise, but he didn't, you know, he didn't, he did get physical in the moment. What he really did is play keep away with the reporter and that this is the big problem is that Jim Acosta was there. He asked all of these questions. Trump answered the questions. He kept asking more. He kept making more accusations and he wouldn't give up the microphone. Think about all these reporters in the room who could have asked questions if Jim Acosta had not been stealing the spotlight for himself. And then it's all designed to create this polarity between Jim Acosta and the White House. And then it's all about Jim Acosta. One of the things they tell you when you're trying to be a real journalist is not to make yourself the story. You, the reporter, are not supposed to be the story. The story is the story and you're covering. And Jim Acosta doesn't do that. Jim Acosta takes every single chance he possibly can to make himself the story. That's why his press potential should be taken away because nobody benefits from this. Nobody benefits from Jim Acosta going out and making a star of himself. That's what we should be covering the president. We should be covering the White House, not covering a bloviating hairdo. So the question is, did he put his hands on the woman? Did he actually assault her? You can take a look at the clip right now and judge for yourself. That's enough. That's enough. The other folks. That's enough. Pardon me, ma'am. I'm mis-pardon me. That's enough. Pardon me, ma'am. Pardon me. Pardon me. He keeps the microphone away. So if you couldn't see that, it's a quick exchange. We've slowed it down in super duper slow motion. If you can tolerate Jim Acosta's slow motion voice, take a closer look. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. Pardon me, ma'am. I'm mis-pardon me. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. Pardon me, ma'am. My beautiful hairdo is about to fall out of shape, ma'am. No, I need more gel in the mousse in that. So that's what's happening in the room. Those of you who are listening to it. And what happens is he's holding the microphone. He has gone on now for several minutes, monopolizing the time in this room. And so, Trump says, that's enough. Okay, I've answered several of your questions. I'm not good. We're not going to get in a tit for tat here. And so the White House intern, this lovely young woman, comes up to take the microphone and he pulls the microphone away. And as he pulls it away, his other hand is there and pushes down on her arm that's going to reach for the microphone. So the left is saying, well, she went for him physically. And then the right is saying, he hit a woman. He pushed or shoved a woman. He assaulted a woman. That's not the issue. That isn't the issue. She was perfectly within her rights to take the microphone away from this bloviator. And he, just reacting like the bloviating star seeker that he is, pulls the microphone away to try to keep it. And as he's doing that, he pushes her arm. That's the problem. He's not behaving like a gentleman. He's not behaving with any dignity, befitting his occupation. The whole argument for CNN right now is that Donald Trump is this loud, this boar, this Bulgarian, but CNN, they're the serious people. They're going to restore dignity to the country. And then this is dignity. This is what happens is you play keep away with this young White House intern after monopolizing the White House press corps time, after monopolizing the president's time and preventing other reporters from asking questions. Are you kidding me? That's why his press pad should be taken away. He should be taken away because he's getting exactly what he wants right now. And what he wants is not to cover the white house. It's not to cover the president. It's not to cover national policy. It's to make himself famous and go on air with Anderson Cooper and pretend to be a super serious person. I'm speaking, I'm actually sort of defending Jim Acosta here in that I don't think he's a woman beater, a sailor or something like that. I think that he is a narcissist. And I have a little bit of insight into this because I knew Jim Acosta before Jim Acosta was Jim Acosta. Actually, when I was up in college, I was working on a campaign to try to get Mitch Daniels to run for president, Indiana governor. And the campaign got big enough that CNN sent their young reporter Jim Acosta up to cover us. Here is a younger Jim Acosta and a younger me. It might be a stretch to call him the big man on campus. But Indiana governor Mitch Daniels is getting some presidential buzz at colleges across the country thanks to Yale University students Max Eden and Michael Knowles. So the thing goes on and I spent an afternoon with Jim Acosta and I left that thinking because we were told, watch out. You're doing a right wing campaign and CNN is coming up. They're going to cover you poorly. So I assumed they were going to be really critical of the campaign and really left wing. It wasn't that. I don't think Jim Acosta is really left wing at all. I don't think he's left wing. I don't think he's right wing. I think he's just all about Jim Acosta. And so the reaction to this, everyone's focusing on the disrespect he showed to the woman. Think about the disrespect to his colleagues, to the president of the United States, to the White House. That's really the disrespect here. This is not how gentlemen behave. This is not how journalists are supposed to behave. And if they want to pretend in the mainstream media that they are restoring the dignity of that office, even if President Trump is allegedly degrading the dignity, then they've got to put up a shut up and they shouldn't have show voters out there. So it's very fun. And by the way, I mentioned this on the show the other day that Trump gives everybody everything that they want. The high civic engagement, high voter turnout unifies the Dems, unifies the Republicans, attacks American labor and industries, also gets foreign adversaries to lower their trade barriers and lower their tariffs. Everybody gets what they want. Jim Acosta gets what he wants to. He gets to look super serious and become the story again. But how much longer are we going to tolerate this guy becoming the story? Speaking of actual threats to journalists, not fake threats, like a 90 pound White House female intern and the president making fun of Jim Acosta, Tucker Carlson has been attacked at his home. Tucker Carlson, fortunately, he wasn't home at the time, but there was a major left wing attack and it tells you everything you need to know about them by what they were chanting, how his wife had to hide in fear in the pantry as they tried to bust in. Before that, speaking of entering people's mood wars, let's talk about Purple Mattress. I love Purple Mattress. You know that I proselytize Purple Mattress. If you're struggling to get a good night's sleep, you've got to try it. I naturally have back pain. It runs in the family. I've tried a lot of different mattresses. Purple is completely unlike any other mattress. It's not like an inner spring. It's not like the memory foam. It's this new technology. It's unbelievable. It was developed by an actual rocket scientist. It's very unique because it's both, it's a totally unique mattress in that it's both firm and soft at the same time. It keeps everything supported. I know that sounds crazy that it's both firm and soft. It is. Somehow it really is. It sleeps very cool. It feels zero gravity. This morning, I woke up early to go do a news hit at three in the morning or something. By the time I came back, I kid you not the first thing I said to sweet little Elisa's. I got back in bed. I'm dead bone tired. I said, ah, I love our Purple Mattress. I love it so much. It lulled me right back to sleep. A hundred night risk free trial. If you're not fully satisfied, you can return it for a full refund back by 10 year warranty. Free shipping and returns. Here's how you get a free Purple Pillow with the purchase of a mattress. These things are expensive. The Purple Pillows and you can get one for free with the purchase of a mattress. That's in addition to the great free gifts they're offering site wide text. Ko-fefe, C-O-V-F-E-F-E to 47, 47, 47, 47, only way to get the free pillow text. Ko-fefe, C-O-V-F-E to 47, 47, 47, C-O-V-F-E-F-E to 47, 47, 47, 47, and get a free, super cool, sweet pillow. Love Purple. So, well, Tucker Carlson's family was trying to rest at night and their home, hopefully on their Purple Mattress. This screeching mob of Antifa left wingers attacked his house. Let me be clear. I'm not saying that they went into his neighborhood or they chased him out of a restaurant. They went to his house. They cracked his front door because they tried to bust in these sick thugs, tried to bust into his house. Tucker wasn't even home at the time. His wife was home making dinner and she heard that and she assumed it was a home invasion. So, she had to lock herself in her pantry and fear for her life. Nice Tucker, call 911 because these sick left wing thugs were trying to bust in. Here's some video of them. What a bunch of pathetic little sad womanish, not womanly, womanish, unmanly, hysterical children thugs. How pathetic. I wonder what sort of relationship these little man children have with their fathers. Probably not great, I would guess. I think all of these Antifa, all of the screeching left wingers in the street, whatever they're chanting, I think the subtext is, F you dad, F you dad, I'm not, you can't make me, no. That's what I think the subtext is. I think these are psychologically very damaged people who have glommed on to a sick, perverse, political ideology to fill the gaping, mowing hole in their hearts because of the sick shame that they feel when they gaze at themselves in the mirror. The shame that their parents must feel to have raised such horrible failures of children like these. What shame, what shame they've brought on their families with whom I suspect they don't have a very good relationship anyway. Awful, awful stuff. I bring this up for a couple of reasons. One, because of what they're chanting. We know that the left has been encouraging violent attacks on prominent right wingers. We know that. That's been happening for a long time. But what they're chanting, they're saying, we know where you sleep at night. That's pretty sick stuff. But then one of the other chants they said was, no borders, no wall, no USA at all. That's what you're dealing with. You're dealing with people who are openly calling for the destruction of the United States. This is the same group in DC, by the way, called Smash Racism DC, which chased Ted Cruz out of that restaurant. They're calling for the abolition of the United States. A lot of these videos now have disappeared from social media because obviously they're quite violent. What the left is saying in response is they're saying that there are right wing extremists too. What about that guy who sent the mail bombs, none of which went off a couple of weeks ago? What about him? See people on both sides. So what you're pointing to is one homeless stripper with a Make America Great Again hat who failed to commit violent acts against left wing, who failed 100% to commit violent acts against left wing. Okay. Yeah. Bad guy. The entire right unified and condemned that guy. Now what the right is pointing to are these mobs of violent wackos who are busting down Tucker Carlson's door who are attacking Ted Cruz in public attacking Mitch McConnell and public. And how are the mainstream left wingers reacting? They're encouraging. The right condemns their lunatics. The left encourages it. Political commentators, mainstream ones, and elected officials alike. Maxine Waters, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton. And just to look at the talking heads, I often recommend that people read box.com, that left wing website, insane left wing hack website. But it's good to read it to figure out what the left is thinking. I encourage people to go read that. A writer at Vox.com, Matthew Iglesias, this is how he responded to this attack on Tucker Carlson's family. Quote, I think the idea behind terrorizing his family, like it or not as a strategy, is to make them feel some of the fear that the victims of MAGA inspired violence feel thanks to the nonstop racial incitement coming from Tucker, Trump, etc. The victims, Tucker Carlson's victim, the victims of what? The victims of tweets? The victims of enforcing our laws? The victims of having a border at all? Is that what you're saying? So he's defending these thugs. This is a very prominent left wing commentator at perhaps the most prominent left wing online media outlet. He then goes on because that wasn't enough to defend them. He says, I honestly cannot empathize with Tucker Carlson's wife at all. With his wife at all, I agree that protesting at her house was tactically unwise and shouldn't be done, but I'm utterly unable to identify with her plight on any level. Right, because you're a child, because you're a little whiny child. I wonder what relationship you have to your family to speaking of you because you're lumping yourself in, Matthew Iglesias, with all of these sick little children who are trying to commit violence against an innocent woman for the crime of being married to a television talk show host. Six stuff, really, really six stuff, and he's defending. So don't ever let them tell you that there's a moral equivalence between the left and the right. Oh, yeah, there's a Trump fan who sent a pipe bomb and there are left wingers who attack people's houses. It's all the same. No, the entire right condemned the pipe bomb homeless stripper. Donald Trump came out and said he should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. But when the left does it, they're encouraged by elected officials and by these news media outlets. He goes on, I mean, Matthew Iglesias went on this crazy Twitter rant today. He said, I met a woman who didn't leave the house for months because she was afraid of being picked up by ICE and never seeing her US citizen, kids and husband again. What sense was there in terrorizing her family? She's in violation of the law. She's a foreign national. We have laws for a reason. We have a border. We have to be able to decide who comes into the country, who doesn't come into the country. What he actually said is I met a criminal who didn't go out very much because she didn't want the cops to catch her for her crime. Okay. Yeah, it's too bad that she committed a crime. She shouldn't have done it. But we have to have a border because when you don't have a border, you incentivize horrible things like 60 to 80% of young women and girls across the border illegally being raped or sexually assaulted. According to the Huffington Post infusion and Amnesty International, like human traffickers bringing drugs and children across the border to do nefarious things with them. Like unvetted people like the national security risk that opposes, like the fact that every other country on earth gets to determine who enters and who leaves the country. Mexico gets to Guatemala gets to Honduras gets to Nicaragua gets to but the United States not allowed to. Okay. Absurd, absurd comment and true moral idiocy from this guy. Tonight, I was at this event at Loyola Maryman with Drew. We did a joint speech and at this speech, race became a big issue. There was an exclusively black student group who came and they were protesting and they were very angry. And this really reminded me of some of the insanity that's going on right now at the college campuses. At Ohio University right now, there is a proposal to have a minority's only gym, a gym that can only be used by racial minorities. Now I assume that the campus administrators are going to tell us that the gym has this equal facilities to the gym for white people. It's just separate. You might call the gym, I don't know, the separate but equal gym. That's my, you have Democrats advocating for racial segregation because there is nothing new under the sun. Flu sashange, flu cela mim shows, nothing changes ever. And this is going on across the country. There is a self segregation that is going on. There is an insistence by minority students that we return to the days of racial segregation. There are a couple reasons for this. One reason is that they don't know anything. They don't know anything about history. They don't know anything about politics. They don't know about the American founding and they don't know about the real state of politics in America. The other reason is that victimhood carries a currency today. It carries a real currency. There is a social status associated with victimhood. Obviously, you can look at one particular example of affirmative action and say that victimhood carries advantages because if you can show that your race or your sex or whatever has been historically oppressed in the United States, then you gain an advantage in college admissions. But it also carries a social advantage beyond that. At this event at Loyola Maryman, there was this group of exclusively black students and they came in and they had duct tape on their mouths and they were protesting. But they were protesting. I don't know. The suggestion seemed to be that they were being censored and so they were going to protest that. But of course, they weren't being censored. They put the duct tape on their own mouths. So Drew and I confronted them to show the hollowness of this victim ideology. Here it is. All right. This will be our last question of the evening. Well, you know, before we go, I should point out there are people in the back of the room who have put tape over their mouths as though they've been censored, as though they're not able to speak. So I just like to take the opportunity. Nobody is stopping you from speaking. Nobody is. We're actually inviting you to speak. If anybody would like to come up and ask a question, now's your opportunity. You can cut the entire line. Would anybody who has a masking tape over their mouths? Well, you don't have masking tape. You can come ask a question too. But I mean specifically the people who are making a statement and saying, I am being censored. Would any of you like to remove the masking tape which you put on yourself and come up here and ask a question? Or would you rather stand back there and play the victim? I think we got my answer. Okay. Next guy in the line. Let's hear the, let's hear it. He's been waiting. How did I know that that was going to happen? They stand there. For those of you who couldn't see, they're standing there with the tape and they're just staring. They're staring looking if they, they look slack, if they didn't have tape on their mouths holding their mouth up because the point that they're trying to make is totally empty, but it is a wonderful reflection of race hustling and race politics in America because they put the tape on their mouths themselves. They did it themselves. They did it because there's a currency to being a victim. And when you call them out for it and when you say you're not a victim, you're not a victim at all, you're here, you can speak, use that beautiful hand that God gave you to take the tape off your own mouth, the tape that you put on yourself and speak. Use your voice. Use your political speech. Use the thing, the very thing that makes us human, the ability to have meaningful speech. Use it and we'll engage and we can talk. They can't do it because they have nothing to say, nothing to say other than insinuation and race hustling nonsense to suggest. The suggestion on their signs that they were holding up is that a Drew and I are racist. I don't know where they got that from. I don't know what their evidence is that Drew and I were somehow preventing them from speaking. So I wanted to point out that nobody's preventing them from speaking, but nobody is. Candace Owens started this walk away campaign. Now she's calling it Black-sit, I think, the Black-exit from the Democrat Party because for so long, Black voters have voted 90% with Democrats between mid-80s and low-90s percent with Democrats. And it's bizarre that a race would vote so uniformly with one political party. You don't see this with other races. She's saying you can walk away. You're being sold a bill of goods. And what they're being told is that the Republican Party is racist. Conservatives are racist. They hate you, they don't like you, they don't want you, they want to hurt you. Whatever. Whatever and sick lies that they're being told by race hustlers. And so they've gone along with this. Nobody is trying to stop you. Nobody is trying to stop you from speaking. Freedom is a wonderful thing. Opening up your mouth and using your political speech and engaging with people with whom you think you disagree. Even though I suspect you probably don't disagree on very much. But you don't know that because you're so interested in looking at yourself and preening and making yourself into a victim that you won't actually engage and open your mouth and talk to your fellow Americans. Really sad, really pathetic. That university has clearly failed them and their families have failed them too. There's a theme, I think, growing today among the people we're looking at on the left. And this is a theme broadly that as social structures have collapsed, as family structures has collapsed, local communities have collapsed. People are really falling into political idiocy and political extremism on the left. And it's a sad state of affairs and it's being encouraged by elected officials. You know, now the guy who is running for governor of Florida, Andrew Gillen, he's a socialist race hustler who baselessly accused Republican Ron DeSantis of being a racist. Absolutely no grounding for that whatsoever. He conceded because he got beaten by DeSantis and then he unconceded because Democrats can never concede an election. They just need to dig up a few more dead votes and then they'll be able to put them over the top. So he's unconceded. Stacey Abrams, who is running in Georgia for governor of Georgia, she has unconceded, or maybe she didn't concede in the first place even though she got beat. So Bernie Sanders has come out now and he is blaming racism for not electing Stacey Abrams who is black and Andrew Gillen who is black, blaming racism. That's all they've got. That's the only thing that they can say and it's meaningless. And I highly recommend it was a cathartic moment last night when you go out and you say, here's your opportunity. Tell me everything you want to tell me. They won't say anything because there's nothing to it. There's nothing to the charge at all. It's just sick race hustling and it's the sign of a desperate Democrat party. You know, one of the great aspects of the midterms is that in those key races, the Democrat candidates whom the party really wanted to propel, really wanted to make into stores failed. Bido O'Rourke got beaten, Bido O'Rourke, Stacey Abrams, Andrew Gillen was being talked about as a possible Democrat presidential nominee. They all got beat. And as a result now, there was a poll that Hill TV took. It was the Hill TV American Barometer poll, 680 Democrat voters. So a relatively small sample size, nevertheless, who do you think came up first? We know all the people we've talked about as possible 2020 candidates. Joe Biden, Lia Watha, Cory Booker, Hillary is still being talked about the re-vivified corpse of Hillary Clinton marching on to her 75th try at the White House. So Joe Biden got 168 votes. He came in second. Bernie Sanders got 123, came in third. Hillary somehow found 80 votes. Kamala Harris, 28 votes. Mike Bloomberg, 27 votes. Do you know who came in first? None of the above. None of the above won the Democrat preference poll. And this is especially to among younger voters. So for older voters, they still selected none of the above, but that the percentage increased among younger voters, which is obviously the case. Nobody wants Hillary Clinton to be president, though they might nominate her anyway. All of these desiccated old corrupt crony Democrats, all they've got is they're running on resentment. They're running on racism and sexism and all that sick hustling. They've got no issues to back them up. And Democrats want a different choice. I'm not surprised. But their future store has just got beaten. They're out. Michael Abenadi is probably going to start wearing an orange jumpsuit pretty soon as he's been referred for criminal investigation by the Senate Judiciary Committee. They've got nobody. They've got nothing. They're running on empty. They're running on racism. And it's really sad. We should speak for just a second about the shooting in Sht. 1000 Oaks this morning. This shooting happened very early in the morning. It was a massive shooting. Twelve people are dead so far. Also the gunman is dead. And a lot of people are injured up there. This was in a country music bar, country music dance bar. This guy comes in and just starts shooting. It turns out he's a Marine Corps veteran. He served in Afghanistan. Already, of course, the gun control activists are out. This was trending on Twitter within an hour, I think, of the shooting. This obviously prayers to the victims and their families from the political angle reacting to the political activists who are already trying to push for gun control. This is an interesting case because it's an ex-military guy who committed the murders. So this is a guy who was well-trained with weapons, who had security clearances, who read background checks at least, who knew how to use a gun. By any measure, when we're talking about gun control, we say that law enforcement and ex-military should be able to have guns. He had his guns. He purchased the guns legally. The gun was not an AR-15. They always try to, on the left, say that AR-15s need to be banned and this will stop the problem. Even though virtually nobody is killed every year from AR-15s, the vast, vast majority of people killed in gun incidents, those incidents involved handguns. This guy used a handgun as well. So none of the boxes that they would typically be pushing out for gun control would qualify in this case. However, there is one aspect which is not gun control, which might have helped prevent this shooting, which is that in recent years, deputies have interacted with this guy for domestic disturbances. A sheriff's deputy was one of the victims, one of the people he went in. He was first on the scene. He went in there to try to stop him. Unfortunately, he was killed. Deputies have interacted with this killer in recent years for domestic disturbances and they came in and they realized he was almost certainly suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. He served in Afghanistan. A lot of soldiers come back with PTSD. Seemed like he was suffering from it. They couldn't do anything about it. They couldn't do anything about it because they couldn't involuntarily commit him. It's virtually impossible to involuntarily commit people to mental institutions today. That's been the case for decades and decades because they couldn't do that, because they couldn't throw him in a loony bin to protect the public from him. Twelve people are dead today. There is no gun law that they could have passed short of confiscation and even them. Even them. There are 300 million guns in the country. Criminals will get their hands on guns. There's no gun law that they could have passed to prevent this shooting. If you made it easier, I've been saying this every time there's a mass shooting, if you made it easier to involuntarily commit insane people who are a danger to themselves and to others, you could have prevented this shooting. That's the one thing you could have done that would have prevented it. But very few people are talking about it because it doesn't serve people's political agendas, especially on the left, and because it's a very difficult thing to say that we need to use the force of the state to be able to commit insane people who pose a danger. It's a tough thing. The right doesn't like it. The left doesn't like it. Nevertheless, it's true. Okay. We've got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube. We've got a lot of mailbag coming up. If you're not on dailywire.com, that means you're on social media, but you probably won't be for long because you'll probably get censored. Go to Daily Wire. It's $10 a month, $100 for an annual membership. You get me. You get the Andrew Plabenshow. You get the Benshow Pirrochow. You get to ask questions in a mailbag. You get to ask questions in a conversation. I think I'm coming up on that next, by the way. You also get the most important thing in the world, which is early access to another kingdom. You get to watch another kingdom on Mondays. Other people who are not subscribers have to wait years and years and years, or at least until Friday, to get the audio. You'll get to see the whole thing with all of that artwork. And oh yes, there it is. The leftist tears tumbler. You get the leftist tears tumbler. I wish that I had brought some of these last night's loyal, a merry amount, so that I could have used them to swim my way off of the campus. You need yours as well. It's the only FDA-approved device to handle salty, radioactive, delicious leftist tears. Go to dailywire.com. We'll be right back with the mailbag. We're going to get through them all today. Probably not, but we'll try. From Jerry, in all of entertainment, what industry, that is music, film, TV, theater, fiction, et cetera, do you think would have the best? The best cultural impact if it became more politically balanced. Music, the music industry. That's the one. And it's not even about political balance. It's actually a little bigger than political balance. It has to become less tribal and passionate. This is true of pop music, it's true of rap, it's true of dubstep, EDM, whatever. If it became more sophisticated, our politics would improve greatly. Look, it would be good if we had movies about how great Ronald Reagan is. It would be good if we had TV shows that describe the world as it is rather than some leftist fantasy. But music is the most important of the art forms. The ancient Greeks talked about this, Plato talked about this, and hearing is the most important sense. And throughout the Bible, you always hear the word of God. God speaks to you. You hear the voice of God. Christ is the word, is the word made flesh. You hear the voice of God, and it's because to hear things, it cuts right through the soul. And this is true when you listen to music. When you're in your car and you're listening to Haydn, or Brahms or something, you're doodoo, you're driving down the road, listening to Bach, doodoo, doodoo, doodoo, doodoo, doodoo, then you get out of your car, you feel a certain way. Your head is in a more rational place. If you're in your car and you're just blasting EDM, like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, you're going to get out of your car feeling more like an animal. You're going to feel like a brute for lack of a better word because percussive, tribal, brutal music deadens your rational faculties and incites the base passions. I don't know how to say that more politically, incorrectly than that, but the ancient Greeks knew what they were talking about. And this has been true throughout the history of Western music. Specifically, percussion really arouses passions that are at odds with your rational faculties. So if we were able to get into music, and I'm not saying we need to play the maga song or something, start to get pop music to use more conservative words, I'm saying that the music itself should be more conservative. I think it would really tamp down passions because also that's the art form we interact with the most. We hear it in coffee shops, we're playing it on our iPods, we're playing it when we're in the car, we listen to it at bars and clubs, we're constantly interacting with music. If music were better and more sophisticated, our culture would be better and more sophisticated too. From Peter, Mr. Knowles, I recently subscribed, but now face a dilemma. I have a wonderful girlfriend who wants my leftist tears tumbler. I can't say no as I'm lucky enough to have found a conservative girlfriend. Could you find it in your charitable, Catholic heart to intercede on my behalf and ask Ben if I can get a second tumbler? Absolutely not. You sick monster. You hedonistic, entitled millennial. You hit the goldmine. So you're a subscriber, you've been able to use the leftist tears tumbler, the only FDA approved advice to safely dispose of leftist tears. You're getting along and then you meet a beautiful, wonderful conservative girlfriend. And she wants your tumbler and you have the honor of giving to your lady, your tumbler. And then you have the temerity to ask for another one. That's not how it works in this life, Bucko. Count your blessings. You have a wonderful woman on your arm. You've got at least one leftist tears tumbler that you two can share, that you can come together as one flesh and guzzle leftist tears and you want another one. Talk about, talk about modernity. Talk about just never knowing when you've got enough. You should think long and hard about your life and can stop and count your blessings. From Margot, hi, definitely not Michael Knowles. Why is it that leftists tend to degenerate and use profanity? It seems that conservatives tend to use more polite and eloquent language. What's the point of the profanity? It's not appealing and makes me think even less of them, cheers and cofefe. They speak in a profane, vulgar, incoherent way because their thoughts are profane and vulgar and incoherent. They can't state what they believe. They don't have a coherent view of the world and so they have to pepper their spasms of speech with profanities. They do this because they're not confident in what they believe and they're trying too hard. They're pushing. They say the F word, then you'll take them seriously. That's the pod save America guys. They don't really say anything. They say it's so effing important. I'm a serious person. That's why they do it. There are uses of profanity. There are plenty of uses of profanity but not the way that they use it because they use it in this whiny, emotional, earnest way. Really swearing in the sense that they're making a swear. They're making an oath. They're cursing you. They're literally cursing their opponents when they do it. You can use profanity in a way that's funny. When you're hanging out with the guys and you've got a good joke and then you use profanity to make that joke funnier. That's a very different use of profanity. You're not doing it out of anger. You're not doing it to hurt or curse or swear. You're doing it to liven up the conversation and make it funny. This is why guys will use profanity when they're around each other but they'll use it a little less when they're around women. Traditionally, they don't use it around women at all. Now in culture, it's much more common to do that but it's because it is foul. It is disgusting. It's not fit for public use. I was on a panel about comedy and someone asked me if I would swear or I was on a podcast or something and said, or are you going to start using a lot of profanity? I said, no. I'll do that if I'm at a bar with the guys but I'm not going to do it if I'm in public on a public platform. There's a time and a place for everything but the left doesn't know about appropriate situations and the right times and places they want to behave like hedonists and little children all the time everywhere and that's why we think less of them. That's why you think less of them. From Arun, dear Dr. Kofefe, what are your thoughts on marijuana use? I drank beer in college. I liked it a lot and still do. It reminds me of a Supreme Court justice I like but I've never used marijuana and have a gut feeling that it's immoral. That said, I cannot justify this feeling philosophically or alcohol and marijuana fundamentally different moral entities. I'm curious about your opinion at a secular level and in terms of your Catholic faith. Alcohol and marijuana are fundamentally different entities at a physical level, at the level of drugs. They're different. I have smoked pot. I've smoked pot before in college or whenever and I don't really like it. I think I actually have a pretty good take on this because I've definitely tried it. I've used it but I've never wanted it. I've never had some in my house so that I could have it alone. If someone has offered it in college or something, I've tried it. I don't like it one because it makes you stupid or two because it makes you less funny and it makes you really inward and really introspective. Alcohol does the opposite. Alcohol relaxes you a little bit and then it's a social lubricant and can liven up a party. I don't know whether it's immoral to use marijuana. It's immoral to become belligerently drunk or intoxicated in so much as getting really high does that then I suppose that's immoral. It's really just a question of why are you using the drug? I know plenty of people who drink alcohol socially. Virtually everyone does that. 80% of the people I know who smoke pot are huge pot heads and they wake and bake and they just use it all the time. That suggests something's wrong with that. It's also foreign. It's foreign to our culture. Alcohol has been around forever. The first miracle that Christ performs is turning water into wine for drunk people at a wedding. It's been around for a very long time and we know how to use it in social situations. Pot is now being introduced for the first time on a broad level to the culture and the question is if these things can be abused why would you introduce a new one? Why would you add that to your repertoire? Look at the kind of people who drink and the kind of situations in which people drink. Do you like those people? Or do you like being in those situations? Then maybe it's okay to have a drink. Look at the situations in which people are smoking pot and the kind of people who are obsessed with pot and legalization. If you want to be like them, if you want to be in those situations, go for it but I suspect you probably don't. From Adam. Why do democratic voters overlook the corruption of politicians like Hillary or Andrew Gillum thanks Adam from Florida? Oh because they have no standards. They have no standards at all. They don't care for them. The personal is the political. They're in an all out blood war with conservatives. They treat politics as religion and so they don't care if somebody is totally corrupt and hollowed out on the inside as long as they can be effective, they'll go for them. They'll overlook it because they are all about the petual revolution. Stalin either apocryphal or actually said that Stalin and many other people. They say one death is a tragedy, ten deaths is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic. You've heard communists for a long time say that you've got to crack a few eggs to make an omelet. You've got to be perfectly fine dealing in things that are fundamentally wrong and immoral because they think it's going to lead them to paradise, that it's going to lead them to utopia and to progress. This is the lie that the serpent told Eve and the garden, oh just break this one little rule and then things will be really, really great and it turns out that when you break those little rules you breed a lot of misery for everybody. From Sarah. Hey Michael. Since you were kicked off Twitter I decided to finally subscribe. My question is when you have kids do you plan to take them with you to vote and how important do you think this is? I have three kids and they all go vote with me and they love it. Absolutely I will. I came in with my mother when I was nine, I was six years old to force her to vote for Bob Dole. She kind of liked Bill Clinton. I loved Bob Dole. I was the only guy in the country who really wanted Bob Dole to be president, probably including Bob Dole but I really, really liked him and my mother finally relented. We committed voter fraud because I pulled the lever on behalf of Bob Dole and it was terrific and it really got me enthusiastic about voting and I highly encourage that for your kids as well because something tells me if you subscribe to this show you're the kind of person that we should have voting and you're raising kids that we should have voting too so make sure that we do it because Democrats make a business out of coercing people into voting and we should make sure that we get our people to vote too. Final question from Laurel. I think this is from Laurel who paints all the pictures on the wonderful artist on Twitter. Hello to my favorite Catholic besides Tolkien. Several times on your show you've talked about links between witchcraft and feminism. Do you know if the rise of the interest in witchcraft could have anything to do with Harry Potter? Of course we know it's a favorite story of the left but do you also think it could have a link with people actually practicing witchcraft? Laurel. I don't think so. I think the rise in the popularity of Harry Potter has to do with the illiteracy and shallowness of our culture and the fact that our generation in particular is so illiterate that the only myth they can ever refer to is Harry Potter which is a very mediocre series of children's stories about going to boarding school with a little witchcraft sprinkled on top of it to make it a little bit spicy. I don't think so. I think Harry is a moral figure. I read some of them when I was a kid and Dumbledore is clearly a moral figure. So I really don't think so. This was a big debate especially among Catholics at the time as to whether this should be banned because it promotes witchcraft. I don't think so. It's a fantasy. I think the people who now are practicing witchcraft and who boast about practicing witchcraft and try to put hexes on Brett Kavanaugh, I don't think it's because they read Harry Potter as kids. I think it's because they're into way darker stuff and there are way darker things in our culture than a mediocre children's book. The only thread I think that mediocre children's book poses is for many millennials. It was the last book that they read. It's the only book that they ever referenced. But that isn't J.K. Rowling's fault. That's the fault of institutions of higher learning and families which have not inculcated a sense of reading and a desire to read and know our culture into the generation. I'd like to blame J.K. Rowling for tweeting crazy leftist things but the decline in culture in the rise of witchcraft are not her fault. Okay, that's our show. I am going to be on the road. I'm going to be on the road next week giving some speeches all around the Midwest so stay tuned for that. That's going to be a lot of fun but we're still going to have a lot of shows. Make sure you tune into another kingdom and get caught up because it's doing really, really well. It's getting huge ratings. Huge, huge. The biggest ratings, folks. Okay. I'm making it and it's certainly going to be my last job I ever have as an actor in Hollywood. So be sure to check it out. Have a good weekend in the meantime. I'm Michael Knowles.
