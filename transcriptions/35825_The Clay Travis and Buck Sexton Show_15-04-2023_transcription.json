    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast Welcome in clay Travis Buck Sexton show appreciate all of you hanging out with us as we roll through the As we roll through the what is it? What is it? It's the Tuesday edition of the program, right? I'm flying down to South Florida will be with Buck Thursday Friday in Miami. It's gonna be fun. I can't wait for that. All right. There's a scene in Season four of succession episode two aired a couple of weeks ago Where the main character the dad the media Baron is Addressing his children and I feel like we need to get this Clip and just keep it on constant refrain because I heard it and I was like this is so amazing and the main character The media Baron who is a Rupert Murdoch like figure Says to his children. I love you, but you are not serious people And I thought it was such a perfect line And I know there are a lot of parents and grandparents out there that are like oh my goodness They just distilled my entire life I love you, but you are not serious people and I feel like many left-wing Arguments when it really boils down. They're all cosmetic theater They don't really have substance behind them because at their essence They're rooted in emotion and emotion is frankly the enemy of logic And so I love you, but you are not serious people is such an amazing line And it was in season four succession episode two. I thought about that There's been a big controversy, right? We still don't have let's start here. We still don't have the trans shooters Manifesto in Nashville. It has now been 15 days and The left wing has been a droid. They've been skilled. They've been incredibly well Trained and they have turned in Nashville my hometown. They have managed to turn this crazy Trans shooter into a Democ Republicans or racist argument. That's what they've pivoted from we still don't have the trans shooter manifesto Kamala Harris can travel to Nashville won't meet with the victims of the shooting because they don't want to Reinforce that this was a crazy trans shooter Instead Kamala Harris comes here and they try to say oh all Tennessee Republicans are racist, right? That's the argument now to be fair Tennessee Republicans did screw this thing up when they didn't vote the crazy white chick out too They just voted the two black guys out in the crazy white chick Survived by one vote. Can we just also add to that that? She begged them not to expel her and then the moment she got her wish She turned around and said you who failed to expel me did so because you are racist Yes, you see that is in microcosm what it is to deal with a lib politician in America today Please please I beg you I want to keep my job fine. You weren't quite as egregious as the others You're letting me keep my job out of racism sir That is what they did and if you fell for it. You're an imbecile frankly if you were one Look if you wanted to say hey on principle. I don't think we should be voting anybody out in the Tennessee legislature I don't think this makes sense. I'm gonna vote against all three. Okay. I can see that argument Because you kind of turn them into martyrs you can see that argument But if you tried to split the baby and you're like I'm gonna toss the two black dudes out But I'm gonna keep the white chick who begged for forgiveness and then immediately lit one outside Had those crocodile tears and then as soon as she survived and wasn't kicked to the curb She immediately said oh it's racism. That's why I didn't get kicked to the curb You got played you played yourself and speaking of playing yourself This is one of the two expelled members of the Tennessee Democrat Party I believe we have this audio all queued up and ready to go right? So he went to Bowdoin, which is a super elite Promised Bowdoin cost probably seventy five thousand dollars a year buck. I mean probably tuition something like that It is the same conference as my school amorous not as good as Amorous, but it's pretty good So in Maine it is the One of the richest whitest schools historically on the East Coast this guy went to that school Alright, and he didn't just go to that school He ran for student body president and guys I'm going to ask you to stop it if we can Right at the end of his this is the same guy that was expelled that now is trying to pretend like he's Malcolm X I'm Martin Luther King, Jr Here he is in 2016 running for student body president of this elite super white liberal rich kid school In Maine listen Dustin J Pearson and I'm running for president of PSG There are a few reasons that we're running this campaign this year one has to do with representation How can we represent all voices in a conversation? I want to do this by partnering with organizations from the booty Democrats to the booty Republicans I want to bring together different voices dissenting voices voices that may be more liberal or more conservative in order that We can reach a point of sort of the radical middle Okay, pause great job there guys. That is his campaign message Bowden bow. Do you pronounce it? Oh, I want it Bowden alright Bowden he wanted to be the student body president. You need to watch the video That is 2016 here is this past weekend in a Nashville church He now has a monster afro same dude listen seem like the In-game lobbyists might win but all that was good news for us I don't know how long this Saturday in the state of Tennessee my last but oh we have good news folks We've got good news that Sunday always comes All right now think we just I want to put them now back to back now you heard him separated This is the same dude again Separated by seven years running for student body president at his super white school in Maine that cost $75,000 a year talking about how he wants to bring everybody together and then it's suddenly like record scratch 1965 and he's Martin Luther King jr. Listen to the whole thing Dustin J Pearson and I'm running for president of PSJ There are a few reasons that we're running this campaign this year one has to do with representation How can we represent all voices in a conversation? I want to do this by partnering with organizations from the booty Democrats to the booty Republicans I want to bring together different voices dissenting voices voices that may be more liberal or more conservative in order that We can reach a point of sort of the radical middle seem like the in our in gun lobbyists might win But all that was good news for us. I don't know how long this Saturday in the state of Tennessee my last But oh, we have good news folks We've got good news that Sunday always comes This reminds me buck of remember the movie eight mile when M&M's going up against the the other elite rapper and M&M just takes all these poor white kid Literally eight mile and he points out that Clarence if I remember correctly was his name went to Cranbrook Which is the most exclusive and expensive private school in the Detroit area for anybody listening to us who grew up in the Detroit area And he just says Clarence went to Cranbrook and everybody just loses it because the guy is a total poser, right? He's and I wish we could curse sometimes. He's full of crap He is pretending to be What I'd like a cosplay a really bad actor That is trying to pretend like it's 1960s in Tennessee I mean, I I get nervous if I say Y'all that people are gonna think that I'm appropriated, you know, but it is such a good My wife was super nervous because she's from Michigan She's been in Tennessee for 20 years and I remember having a conversation with her When can I use the word what y'all and not sound like I'm a faker, right like not sound like I'm a real thing Everybody y'all is the is the best way to say what you're trying to say period is better than you guys better than you Yes, you guys is a very is a very I think it's definitely northeastern midwest Atlantic West you guys Yeah, yeah, you guys You know, but we say you guys in New York y'all makes a lot a lot more sense or or if you're really a New Yorker You know Manhattan that you might say all of you, but all of you is quite a mouthful So look I think we've got another great clip here too But because I always love seeing this too and I bet a lot of you are also having this reflection here is Hillary Clinton Who suddenly this is one of the all-time great like I'm gonna totally sound different depending on what audience I'm talking to 2007 here's Hillary Clinton from the Chicago area pretending that she's southern listen I don't feel no ways tired Nobody told me that the road would be easy I Think we may have just violated the Geneva Convention by playing that on the air because I think we actually used to use tapes of Hillary To you know to torture prisoners to get information back in the day. That was brutal Southerners know well Really bad southern accents because you're trying to To pretend that you talk like us right I'm born and raised in Nashville I've been around movies are filled with people with bad southern accents. We'll talk about it You know as southerners like you watch them. There's two things that always happen one There's a lot of really bad southern accents to every time there's a movie set in the south Everybody sway it's really if you go back and watch like a time to kill It's as if air conditioning doesn't exist in Mississippi. I've also never actually I've covered I've never seen someone Chewing on the long like almost looks like a piece of wheat or something. You don't talking about yeah straw Yeah, they do this in movies all the time. I've never actually seen this anywhere You know who was really good at that by the way Fred Thompson Rest in peace with former Tennessee senator also an actor But other politicians used to complain because his whole campaign was I'm just gonna get in a red pickup truck in a drive around the state And he was a legitimate elite actor, but all of his commercials He was phenomenal like I can't act people are like Oh, you know if you watch we used to do skits for the sports gambling TV show that I would do if you give me lines to recite I am the worst actor on the planet like they would all make fun of me because we'd have a script and I'd have to memorize Lines and I couldn't do it if you just tell me ex deparaneously. Hey, just go act normal I can do it I'm fine on TV, but if you tell me you have to deliver this I can't do it at all a lot of these dudes are actors right? I mean that's embarrassing if you're represented by that guy I Mean that is pretty pathetic and if Saturday night live was actually funny or made fun of left-wingers This would be a gold mine and look there are a lot of a lot of people on the on the Democrat side have gotten away with very obvious pandering and and acts of you could call it in a personal fraudulent right I'm pretending to be something that they're not we all river. You know John John Kerry Famously all of a sudden is I love Shooting at the ducks that go quack quack and I'm you know I we had the butler gave me this wonderful shotgun to use I borrowed it from him I mean he was the least man of the people man of the people you could ever see and I think one of the things Honestly not to make this a Trump conversation One of the things about Trump that people found so appealing is he's like yeah I'm a billionaire and I like cheeseburgers and that's really you know or you know McDonald's cheeseburgers and that's really who I am And and I do think that increasingly authenticity is an asset report and trade But I think it's there are a lot of frauds. There are a lot of frauds who get very very far in politics to this day And you know I mean even I mean Tucker's done a lot of of talk on on his show about Alexandria Ocasio-Vartez was was Sandy Cortez and then realized and you know went to BU which was at one point the most expensive school in America Most up there with GW where I went. Yeah, yeah right up there with GW And then all of a sudden we're being told that she's from the Bronx. She had this heart No, I mean she you know grew up in a household with working professionals who sent her to a $70,000 a year university And I think it was Riverdale, which is actually a not just oak It's a fancy part of New York, but it is in the Bronx. So there's this interesting I think Tucker says she's from Westchester anyway But you see a lot of that a lot of people changing around Their identity in a way that is more suitable Politically for them because it makes them seem like they're of the it's a false populism is really what you're it makes them Just like you Clip is one of the funniest things that I've heard. I mean that that look this little Tennessee rep whatever his name is I don't even know his name that's funny, but Hillary Clinton was legitimately convinced that she was gonna be the first woman president United States and that is the most insulting Bad southern accent she has a bad southern accent and then she tries to speak in likes southern black vernacular Which is even more awkward and ridiculous. I would just have I mean, I feel like if you just ran that that clip anywhere in the South like she would not win a single southern state Because it's you can't look any more inauthentic and that dude I mean, it's just it's it's pathetic and it also raises the question Why and this is a good one for all of you out there? Why do so many Democrats want to pretend it's still 1954 or 1965? Like why are they they they want the mantle of the civil rights movement when you've got all the rights you could possibly need Because their mindset is that they don't have to engage with the other side or deal with even facts or reality because they stand in a position Of moral righteousness from the start that is both unassailable and unquestionable And so that's why they love the 1960s civil rights positioning in 2023 because it's how dare you we're the ones that are saving the country and we sit around saying I don't know Pretty sure transgender surgery for 10 year olds is not actually saving anything and it's pretty horrible And I don't think MLK would have been like hey, you know what? I really hope that one day we can live in America where 14 year olds chopped their boobs off I don't think that would have been the next step of the MLK progression just throwing it down there I want to tell you something else friends inflation and prices are rising and now there's a banking crisis to worry about With the current stock market volatility.

She is brave. She is fearless She is fighting for women's sports and she also I believe is like me from the Nashville area Riley appreciate the time How are you? Of course, I'm doing good and I am from the national area not too far from you Yeah, for sure. All right So for people out there who have not seen the viral video and have not Experienced what happened to you take us into that speech at San Francisco State University The reaction to it your experience and what has happened since Absolutely, so I was invited to San Francisco State to give a speech on Protecting women's sports, which is what I've been doing this past year Highlighting what it takes to get to that top level of course what my experience and competing against Leah Thomas looked like not just for myself But for my teammates for the other girls with that meat what the locker room piece looked like The silencing and the suppressing of our voices that our coaches and our administrators participated in after the fact and I just explained why why Putting title 9 at risk is harmful to women and why deserves to be protected I get right there was many pro go ahead. Sorry. I was gonna go ahead. No, sorry I was just gonna say get the speech there are many protesters in the room and it went relatively peaceful until afterwards That's when a mob stormed in they turned the lights. They flicked the lights. They stormed they rushed me They pushed me to the podium and there was lots of pushing and shoving and hitting and then I Cops came up which I was supposed to meet with the campus police an hour and a half before the event and they never showed up And so I wasn't even aware there was a cop in the room But she eventually escorted me out of the rooms which in the hallway was just filled with more people and we ultimately got pushed into Another classroom in the hallway where we were barricaded for three hours Riley so you were just so everyone's very clear on this you were physically assaulted you were hit someone someone attacked you is that correct? correct And was it a was it a transgender? Individual or just one of the activists or it was basically were you assaulted by a man? To my knowledge, yes again the lights were flickering, but I believe this was a man Dressed as a woman So you were attacked but you to your belief to your knowledge. You're certainly were attacked by what you believe is a man Dressed as a woman. I'm very curious and first of all this is this is just horrifying You know the whole incident we saw it on video So I think that at least people have some awareness of what a a shrieking bunch of lunatics the protesters You know quote protest was really a small riot was what you faced What were the police saying to you during this and why didn't the police pull out pepper spray? I mean that's that's a standard for a crowd control situation like that I mean people that are gathering around you assaulting you these sorts of things pepper spray would seem to be right within law enforcement escalation of tactics Absolutely, you would think that that would be necessary, but these police to be totally honest A granite they were campus police, but they were terrified to do their job To which they pretty openly admitted they didn't want to be accused of being racist a Lot of the protesters when we were barricaded in the room of course I could hear them behind the door screaming You're just protecting that white girl because she's white These police were put in a position where they didn't want to risk their job They didn't want to be seen as anything other than an ally to that community And so it did hinder their performance. I miss my flight home I was supposed to fly home that evening, but because the police couldn't safely evacuate me from the building. I miss my flight These protesters they were demanding money for me if I wanted to make it home safely and the police did nothing They were negotiating with the the Dean of students about my safe passage home And I couldn't believe they were negotiating this like this is something we were genuinely having a discussion about Wait, wait, wait, we said negotiating like what what did that? What do you mean like take us into that specific? What does that sound like? From my side of the door I could hear them talking, you know, they were saying well Riley got paid to be here So why shouldn't we get paid if we want to let her leave? First of all the university did not pay me to be there that is not true at all by any means yet They felt as if they were entitled to reparations just from a conservative speaker being on campus I mean, this is to be clear you were there three hours They kept you inside of a barricaded classroom for three hours Yes, the whole three hours yelling violent obscene terrible Awesome things to both myself and the officers They were screaming if you didn't want the smoke you shouldn't have come to this university Trans rights are under attack. What do we do we fight back? I mean, it's kind of chilling to think about What they would have done to me had someone not been able to step in because there was no way I could have safely Removes myself from the situation. I was totally stormed and surrounded and so it does kind of put you in fear for your life in the moment a little bit Um, you have no idea how unhinged these people really can be until you see it with your own eyes and they're coming at you I just want to be clear What they found so unacceptable was that you said men should compete against men in sports and women should compete against women in sports And basically that biology is real and there are two genders The people on that campus found that to be totally unacceptable for you to share and maybe for people out there who might not have experienced your story This comes out of your experience in swimming against a man And as you said so few women athletes including now mega and rapino and su bird are even willing to stand up and say women Should compete against women and men should compete against men. Yeah, I mean a trans man stole the national championship from riley in her event effectively Right. That's what happened at the nc double a finals. We're speaking of riley gains for anyone who's joining us in progress here um about what happened at uh San francisco state university Um last week riley To your not what it was the response after all this happened. So now we know what the incident was like After all this happens did a university Take any disciplinary action against any students has anyone been expelled No, the university doubled down by saying they were proud of their brave students literally word for word. They said um It can be very hard to have someone who so egregious come to campus and speak and it takes tremendous bravery to stand in this Challenging space and we're so proud of the moments where we listened and we asked in site for questions And we're proud of the the students who demonstrated the value of free free speech and the value to protest peacefully We must be a different definition of peaceful because what I experienced was by no means peaceful Why do you think so many women athletes are afraid to say what you are saying? And I want to go back again specifically because you tweeted about them earlier Meghan rapino and subert megan rapino is an elite women's soccer player subert an elite Basketball player women's basketball player. They're both saying oh we're opposed to the idea of preventing trans athletes That is men identifying as women from competing in their sport. That's almost basically Endorsing the erasure of women's athletes from women's athletics What are they thinking in your mind? Why are they saying that and why are you out there in many ways? On an island making the arguments that you are Well to be totally frank people are scared because what just happened to me for saying something as simple as Men and women are different that easy, right that common sense yet. I was still ambushed Um, no one wants that to happen to them. No one wants to be labeled as transphobic Of course people would rather like megan rapino and like subert and like billy june king who were trail blazers for woman's sports So of course it's ironic But they want to be seen as inclusive and kind and accepting and welcoming and loving and all of the things which of course who doesn't want to be seen as those things But newsflash it's not inclusive to allow men to take a podium spot from a woman. It's exclusive and it's not kind to allow A male equipped with male janetelia to change in a locker room with girls. That's not kind That's not inclusive And like I mentioned the double standard here. These are women who fought relentlessly Megan rapino in particular. She fought for equal pay and equal access and equal resources for women But now i'm realizing it was a sense of faux feminism because when you're fighting to have um Really for title nine to be taken down some men can compete on women's teams it's hypocrisy Riley just want to ask you before uh before we we finish up Are you oh? Goulclay also has a follow-up, but um do you plan on taking legal action Against the call against the university against any of the individuals? I mean they they very clearly I'm not a lawyer clay is they very clearly broke the law though. We all know that Absolutely. Um, I definitely intend to if nothing else to send a message because When is enough enough? Um, we've gotten to the point where there are no repercussions There are no consequences for acting out in this manner, but I I've had enough it has reached enough for me And so I will be pursuing Um some sort of legal action to hold someone accountable whether that's the university the campus police the individuals themselves Um there needs to be a message that Last question for you and thank you for speaking out you can follow riley on twitter We'll be sharing this interview so you guys can uh can find that as well Dylan Mulvaney is a Man pretending to be a woman Nike gave him a sports bra endorsement deal and a women's leggings endorsement deal I'm just curious has anyone and they said he's brave for living his life Has anyone at nike reached out to you and asked you if you would like a women's apparel deal Oh goodness. No And I don't anticipate that but I don't I don't know if they can understand the mockery of what this makes of of women Especially the video of dylan I guess portraying what he thinks women look like when we work out doing jumping jacks and doing different things That is so incredibly degrading and for nike to take this stance Um they can forget getting my money and I I've talked to a lot of female athletes who agree with exactly everything. I just said Riley gains fighting the fight. We appreciate you. We appreciate your bravery We're sorry about what happened to you a lot of the guys in particular And i'm sure a lot of ladies in this audience wish we had been there to be able to help you out under the circumstances But please keep speaking out and come back on the show whenever you want Awesome sounds fantastic.

Is that her event or butterfly? I can't remember I think i'm not an expert in the swimming world I think she did I think you do a lot of them But she was one of the she's an elite women swimmer for the university of kentucky Uh, and she lost because I I think you got to keep telling the story of how she ended up as a spokesperson here She lost to lea thomas a dude and then there was the picture of her on the stand Standing next to six foot three man and it was like it's clearly unfair It's so important because one of the ways they really Are are dishonest in this debate an argument is they play this game of either It doesn't happen that much but that's getting harder and harder for them as this happens more and more and they push it more And more yes sponsors and ad campaigns and everything else for the trans agenda in sports or just in general But but also they say what's the big deal? Who's harmed by this? Well gee if if I had been and you know, I'm I'm far from this elite near olympian level athlete who had been swimming in a pool as a as a young girl since age four And this is my crowning moment and achievement to get a gold medal in the nc double a championships And i'm giving silver This is what happened to riley gains. She gets the silver medal not the gold medal Because a dude wanted to pretend to be a woman for that meet that is what happened So there are people that pay a real cost and people say oh, it's really not Let's let's just destroy all merit all all good things all achievement all beauty Let's just tear it all down because the left is having a tantrum lea thomas won the 500 women's championship And then was nominated by the university of pennsylvania for woman of the year in the nc double a It's crazy. And I just want to emphasize that last question I asked of her for all of you out there listening first of all bucks right When people say well, why do you care? She didn't choose this battle This battle chose her because she went head to head Against a male swimmer in an nc double a championship So she actually experienced how unfair this is And I just want to emphasize that last question that I asked her because I think it goes straight to the essence of this Look at what nike is selling to girls out there Nike is trying to sell to girls Hey Look at this dude wearing a sports bra Look at this dude wearing women's pants He's so brave. This is who we want to put on a pedestal for little girls to look up to and emulate And they wouldn't even consider signing riley games to a contract Who is more courageous? Who would you rather your little girls and granddaughters emulate a fearless women's college swimmer Who sees something wrong and is willing to speak out on it not just on her own behalf but on the behalf of all women athletes Or a dude Who is pretending to be a girl Because nike is telling you They want your daughters and granddaughters looking up to a man with a penis And no boobs Who is trying to sell them women's athletic gear And tell me that that isn't a fundamentally perfect metaphor of how broken our society has become to me Riley gains true courage true bravery speaking out and recognize How few people and women's athletics are willing to speak out on her behalf How few feminists who claim to care about women as you pointed out with an interview buck she got attacked by a man Physically assaulted they kept her locked in a room for three hours Has nancy Pelosi spoken out it's her district has kamala Harris spoken out. She's the vice president Has joe biden said a word about how inappropriate this attack is of course not Think about why they're being silent and what message we are sending to your kids to your daughters and granddaughters Come up here in a couple minutes. We'll talk about how the flagship whole food store and sand friend got shut down when you hear about what was going on there But the mayor of san francisco london breed She wants you to know that this is all kind of being misrepresented san francisco She's doing a great job with the city. Oh, we'll talk about"
