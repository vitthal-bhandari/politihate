    "text": " Today, Kamala Harris claims extremist so-called leaders want to punish women. Tennessee lawmakers move towards banning gender transition surgery for children, and leftists continue to redefine fetal heartbeat. We've got all of that and more coming up, but it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I'm Sarah Gonzalez. Happy Friday. We are finally there. And I'm just going to say we got quite a show for you. I've got Eric July, pleased to be contributor and of course, owner and founder of Ripaverse Comics. We've also got his first time on the program, Gavin McInnes, of course, Vice Media co-founder and censored.tv founder. It's great to have you on, Gavin. Hello. Are you going to? I'm Phil. I've got you, and I've also got place to be contributor Alex Stein. I'm just wondering if this is my last show ever. That's like having Batman and Superman. That's a waste. That is kind of a waste. Or in a more modern version, that's like having Zollothar and Rancorn. There you go. Oh, there you go. Wow. That's just the top two guys. I'm impressed. Yeah. So I don't know. We'll see if I ever have a show again. We'll find out. So I want to talk about everyone's favorite vice president, Kamala Harris, who traveled to Milwaukee to meet with Latino leaders and speak at a Democrat attorney's conference during a speech. She claimed extremist so-called leaders are trying to pass un-American laws to make it more difficult to vote. Watch. And immediately, of course, following Dobbs, extremists, so-called leaders, that's what I call them. Extremists so-called leaders. Across our nation. To pass and enforce laws to criminalize doctors, nurses, health care providers. I mean, think about those folks. Why they entered that profession. Their sense of calling and duty to heal and help. And these so-called extremist leaders are passing laws to criminalize these folks. Passing laws to punish women. All right. So that one was about punishing women. And guys, I want to get your thoughts. But actually, you know what? Let me give you guys a chance to react to that. And then I want to play the one about making it more difficult to vote and how Dropbox bans are somehow un-American. But let me just get you guys. Is Kamala Harris the worst ever? I mean, we're working for- It's a low bar. It's a low bar. I get it. But Joe Biden is 100 million years old, so I feel like he gets a pass for his- Well, yeah. I mean, obviously, if he had half a brain cell, she would look far worse than what she eat to us. But when you compare yourself to that guy, I mean, you tend to look a little better than what you actually are. But no, she's terrible. She's terrible at her job. And to be fair, the press secretary, what was her name? The French G.J.P. What do you call it? K.J.P. K.J.P. Okay. K.J.P. Yeah, she's like, and J.J.A.P.P. It's impossible to remember her name. Yeah, it's impossible to remember her name. That's easy for me, okay? Because that's why I had to ask. Because I always have trouble saying it. But she's terrible. Kamala Harris is terrible. This is the first time I've seen her though in a very long time. Really? I noticed that both people you just said are black. Are you being racist? Yes. These are black white Americans. Yeah. Definitely now days, you start selling million dollars worth of comics and you become- I've taken Larry Elders' spot at the Blackface of white supremacy. whatever that is but no she she is terrible and she's not at all convincing not at all influential not at all inspiring but she feels like she's kind of rambling trying to figure it things out as she's saying these speaks yeah like she's not actually confident anything that it is that she she's saying she's like I have to be as my way through this so that's what I'm gonna do you see the hamster turning yeah you'll go like her head actively like in real time like she's like as she's speaking you get it like not really Kamala but you know you're using your kind of arms and stuff yeah she she has this repeat thing I think it I think my series she really likes that we have nothing to fear but fear itself he's like I want one like that where you say the thing and then you repeat the thing she does so she's always like where are we going we're going where we've always been going and where we're going to be going to and then you can see everyone going now that's not it's that's no fear itself that's that's suboptimal common she keeps repeating it though it's was there was that thing about the trans surgery or was she throwing a portion in there or portion okay yeah well I know all of the buzzwords get kind of you know jumbled together whenever they they don't they're just parroting yeah they tend to to jumble them all together but that one in particular was about limiting abortion because banning abortion no longer is anything to do with women that is restricting birthing people yeah sorry ladies you negotiated your way out of that that's a great point now it's me what's getting chest feeding us men the guys are worried about not being able to get their abortions the beat Buttigieg is really worried now and this is the thing is you know you're saying who's smarter camel or Joe Biden I would actually argue to Joe Biden is smarter but what I can't wait for I can't wait for Joe Biden and Hunter Biden to get caught with their legal business dealings in a breeze my I think it will I think it's a 40 billion for that not to happen this is what I believe is gonna have they played I think it's a 80 billion now but I do believe they will do the humiliation ritual because they want Kamala Harris to be president and that's gonna be like a real-life Tyler Perry movie Medea goes to the White House who wants I do it to be president way better than Kamala should be compared everybody to pick that everybody percent of the population one of us and as a as a leaning liberal liberalist here the house liberal we wanted we wanted Kamala the whole time but we don't want the white patriarchy anymore so we want Joe gone Kamala we love your work we love your bosom's we love your big booty Latina lifestyle we love it we love everything we just have the whole little Tina yeah she's very normal what is she's half black and half Indian right yeah yeah yeah she's sometimes she's either one of them depending on what the conversation is but her culture is zero black she were formative years were in Montreal the black guy wasn't around so she's more Indian Canadian than anything mm-hmm let's go eat some samosas she was listening to M&M and she created the three strikes law that you know put in all these non-violent drug offenders in jail while she's complaining about Brittany grinder being in jail for weed yet she locked up half of California so Biden was big on some people in jail too I know a guy did four and a half years for having three bags of coke four and a half years yeah well it was Biden's it was when he was coming down hard on drugs she is so I want I want to play another component of this speech here because it has been fascinating to watch the Democrats take a particular you know we were in the middle of a pandemic they felt like they needed to add some additional ways that people could vote because of this unprecedented time and now all of a sudden it's un-American if you don't allow your voters to you know vote by Dropbox I guess so here's that while so called leaders claim we should return the issue of reproductive freedom to the voters in the states these same extremist so-called leaders are passing laws to make it intentionally more difficult for people to vote yeah return it to the states let the voters there decide while laws are being passed to ban drop boxes and restrict early voting laws that are making it illegal to give food and water to people who are standing there running for hours yep undemocratic laws un-American laws talking about the Georgia law like they remember when that whole deal it was obviously nonsense but it was like something that they couldn't when you're in a certain half-game how much of yards it was like a hundred yards or something like that then you can't deliver like basically goods to people because it's like the people who are campaigning so you can't go and give corrects yeah exactly so so they try out the word it as if will you just want people to be outside and then die get the profit water right something with that wasn't the case but it's not at all surprising to be honest that they're still running on their law so there's someone dying of thirst there's a politician with some cold water there and they're like can I and then the police go not on my watch yeah yeah yeah okay then they die okay so I like so she said they're intentionally making it harder to vote and Gavin you said yes yeah well this my new thing with the left I take their allegations and go yes that is true like yes we are criminalizing health care if health care means a boarding babies yeah you're gonna get arrested yeah and I'm sorry you chose the calling of nurse and now you're going to jail sucks and with this yeah we're trying to make it harder it's a big deal it's hard to get a tattoo it's hard to drive a car it's hard to vote sorry yeah I mean I do like I wish it actually was harder and I wish there more work qualifications to to voting I'm not yeah I'm not at all like the person who's like I think everyone should have you know make let's make it easier for people to vote no actually I don't want it to be easier I don't want I want it to be one day there's just voting day there's no early voting there's no mail-in there's no nothing if you don't take it seriously enough to come and show up on that day and cast your ballot you don't need to be voting yeah only they say that voter ideas racist but these are the same people that wanted you to use an ID and a vaccine card to buy a hot dog at 7-eleven that's not racist you know somehow somehow showing an ID to vote in an election where you're supposed to be living in that state that's racist you know what it should be penis prints to vote you have to put your penis on ink pad and then put it on the voting card so that that'll work well we'll cut the woman vote down by a good 90% and that's they should have the right to just mind good they vote by big good thing we'll get those weird post-op ones that they have made that look like a burrito but that'll be like 16 people so I want to I would be remiss anyway what's the girl vote what what amendment is that suffrage 1923 it was a 19th amendment 19th yeah you got to watch it or you end up saying the black vote you're like repeal the 19th and they're like that's the black one oh sorry I'm sorry so I would be remiss Gavin if I didn't play this interview with of course vice news where Kamala was talking about which I designed that logo is the is the dehumanization of migrants quote fleeing harm as Republicans pull political stunts by sending them to blue states watch yes yesterday there was a bus of migrants that was dropped off in front of your home also governor to Santa's flew migrants from Texas to Martha's Vineyard can you understand the political point that DeSantis and Abbitt are trying to make your they're playing games these are political stunts with real human beings yeah who are fleeing harm harm I mean do you know what's happening in Venezuela right now socialism there were children people being put on a bus or a plane oh no I don't know where they're going where they were no like you're some sort of human beings real people who have fled harm who came to the United States of America seeking refuge asylum yeah which is I feel like what they're being given by busing them or flying them to sanctuary cities there was a smattering of young people I don't really see any Venezuela just released all their criminals mm-hmm that was and they say they talk about as a political tool Vincent de Fox a long time ago said let's our prisons are overflowing let's get rid of all the criminals send them to America we don't have to deal with them make our problem their problem it's a cheap solution so they've been a political pawn forever we just picked up the chess board and said okay how about pawn to Martha's Vineyard for yep yep well yeah and I mean it's not even just people in other countries like Mexico leaders saying that it's been our own it's been the left who's been using them as the political pawns for forever for decades trying to promise them all these things trying to use them as a bargaining tool trying to act like they give a crap about you know kids in cages at the border when they're trying to make it so that more and more kids come over and have to be put in cages well now they just walk right through but it's like yeah you guys were the ones who started with these political pawns at to Gavin's point like we now all of a sudden we've got some people with balls who go okay you know what we'll play your game and we'll win yeah I mean I said this on Wednesday but I'm kind of on camel hair society because you know they did find them spirit airlines there and that's cruel and unusual you can't at least fight them delta if you're gonna find them the only time there has been a fight on spirit airlines there was it no but that's the thing is we talk about the border and she talks about kids I didn't really see very many kids no I didn't either yeah so I don't know it's usually young men well the kids get taken up into the sex trafficking or drug trafficking or however they can be used if there was kids there than the kids were murderers who had been released from prison probably so yeah murderers they do exist that is a character because I was just by themselves right out of a comment but Eric can you imagine walking making this dangerous journey and then these GOP leaders have the have the audacity to put you on a bus so that you don't have to walk on your journey yeah and you go all the way to this affluent area where they have all of these resources and everything and plus they pay at least lip servers to your cause right they'd be the people that you that would welcome you but sir we're giving them galaxy phones if we give them the iPhones that we need it we need to give them better cell phones I don't like that we're giving them Sam's son galaxies I think we should give them iPhones I would never like I can I will never forget the clip of the Martha's Vineyard community saying by waving bye to them Taehama Taehama just like oh my god you guys don't even understand how stupid you look they just have no self-awareness what's amazing about America it's the red you know remember that red dress gold dress thing yeah people would look at it was it they're looking the same thing they see different colors they don't see this as a victory for us like we're laughing and we go yeah we played your game and you look like fools they're like yeah you thought you could trick us but we took in those migrants and for over 40 hours they had hot food and we were together and then we sent them on their merry way we deported oh well don't get into where we sent them to but they went to somewhere probably wonderful so haha no I'm laughing no I'm laughing that is a great point all right we got to take a quick break we'll be back with more first one to thank our sponsor home title lock so look home title theft is something that if you don't if you're not familiar with it you should consider yourself lucky because that means it hasn't happened to you and there's no like identity theft program no banking program nothing that protects you from this crime which is one of the fastest growing crimes right now because your home's title is camped out online just like everything and cyber criminals can go in they can forge your signature on a quick claim deed stating that you sold it to them and then they can take out all of this equity that you have that you've been building up probably for retirement don't let that happen to you my partners at home title lock have a special free offer for you if you go to home title lock calm you can enter your address for free find out if you already have someone camping on your home's title and they will help you mobilize to shut it down that is home title lock calm use promo code radio home title lock calm the other day we covered Matt Walsh's research into Vanderbilt University's transgender clinic now Vanderbilt doctors this was really gross stuff guys admitted to performing double mastectomies on teenage girls administering irreversible hormone therapy to children as young as 13 and since then Matt Walsh has met with Tennessee lawmakers to discuss potential legislation to ban child gender transition procedures and majority later Jack Johnson said the expose that was released by the Daily Wire uncovered a number of things not just that we have a prominent medical facility here in the Nashville area that's performing these irreversible procedures on minor children it also exposed that they were probably doing so in the interest of profit you know it just seems like common sense that this should be this sort of ban should just be done in literally every single state right now what what why it's it's shocking to me that this went below the radar for so long in a place like Tennessee and I mean I've seen stuff that it's been going on in Texas as well and it's like how is it possible that you have a red state with a with a Republican governor and this stuff still is not being shut down and by the way I am also like this is calling out governor Abbott as well because governor Abbott along with the Texas legislature last time they were in session they had the opportunity to do this and didn't do it they chose not to these are a bunch of Republicans who want to call themselves Republican they want to put the R in front of their name but when it comes time to actually do something conservative they're like oh that feels icky we don't want to do it I mean I'm like no ban it also make it a criminal criminal offense and I think death penalty I think even that like it's not even we don't even have the word it like this I think anybody that claims to value liberty and I say this as obviously a fuck excuse me I didn't actually see it I just you know it could have been fudge yeah exactly you didn't swear exactly thank you it's away from me I didn't swear no on a serious note though even from this that perspective like I don't care what side even on the libertarian spectrum like me where you're full and artists are you not we should be able to conceive that child mutilation is a problem and if all things that are to before we ever get to let's say this anarcho capitalist libertarian social order that that's an act of aggression and therefore if there is to be a thing that is banned or illegal that's it it doesn't there's not gonna be a whole lot of rather than shouldn't be a whole lot of people that are like yeah that's it's just like murder it's like any crime any crime death no matter what like these this is these are things doesn't matter where you're at on spectrum we live in in doesn't matter what's my ideal this is the world that we live in so it is very surprising that even we have to kind of tip to around this kind of conversation of those guys that have been performing this probably should be under the prison like yes for money was that thing Matt Walsh pulls up where they go it's very profitable yeah and you should encourage it and anyone who has a problem with it is gonna be kicked out of the hospital and the great thing about it is there's always complications and you get to yeah try to fix the massive wound that you left that person you couldn't give a 13 year old fake tits so why can you take them away if I'm a doctor and some lesbian 13 year old girls in my office and she goes I feel like a man and I've got these boobs starting and I think they confuse me and I don't feel comfortable I just be like that sucks sucks to be you I guess you're a lesbian who hates her boobs any who like why do they go okay well if you don't like something about yourself 13 year old let's just gahh scissarian scar them off you yeah because I mean if someone went in their office and said you know I just feel like I was born to just not have an arm and I really want my arm cut off they'd be like okay here's a therapist yeah go see them work through this because clearly you were born with two arms and you should have two arms yeah I don't see the difference well their argument too is we have to do it because there's this massive wave of suicide when you don't cut off girls tits but there isn't so there's no change like once that transition does happen and when you look at those numbers it's not like they're significantly no they're really lost yeah exactly times exactly so no exactly so at that point it's like what what is why why on earth are you doing this other than okay this is the world that these kind of dimension that they they've that were living in and unfortunately they've convinced a lot of stupid people that this is okay to the point to where like I said you're the one that a lot of these people will look at as the weirdo when you're like yeah we probably shouldn't be doing that even if I can see that when you were growing adult if you want to do that weird stuff you should I'm still gonna think that it's stupid but at least you should have the freedom to do that but for children like this should be a bare basic thing that that's off limits but even now they've convinced people that well this is somehow about these children and this is when we start getting to these weird areas of consent that if you are going to say that just because some 10 year old said that then you're proving on a whole a whole sleuth of other weird stuff that if they can consent to something like that and we you know maybe that's why there's often this could I won't say conflation but people that do bad things for children have tried to last themselves on to your movement why is that so so I okay so I want to bring that up here which is I could not believe this people who are in the DFW area need to pay attention Lewisville Independent School District here right around the corner very close to my house by the way has queer sex ed resources on their website where students learn how to talk about sex they also have a place called Q chat space where it has a quick escape button so kids can quickly hide the page from their parents so it's an online community where you know LGBTQIA plus apostrophe S teens 13 through 19 can join live chats in support groups that are professionally facilitated and I'm like oh okay I'm sure that's not where all the pedophiles are gonna go and professionally facilitate a bunch of confused kids going to talk about their sexuality yeah well I want I want to make this point so I always talk about it how our world is not being run by human beings is basically being run by multinational corporations and there's a thing called ESG and all these companies have ESG scores it's a emotional excuse me environmental social governance and in order to get a better ESG score and be able to do business with these banks like Baylor Scott and like these huge corporations they have to do philanthropy that donates money to these causes so they get to pick the cause right so whether it be like cancer or whether it be diabetes but now all this ESG money is going to this trans movement and that's why it doesn't matter if you're in Texas it doesn't matter if you're in California because these corporations are so big like notice how it's in Texas because there's so much ESG money so now this indoctrination all this philanthropical money is going to transition kids so it's really insane I don't think we can fight these corporations and we live in my opinion in the United States yeah I would say 99% of Americans are mortified that this is going on it's it's just a handful of freaks who are well-funded and you're right it's it's groomers central like I got kids kids hate sex anything girly if they're watching a movie and I'm talking I'm not talking about eight year olds like 13 year olds if there's a make-out scene the movie you see them going yeah they're not like hey can you tell me how to fist or at least provide a pamphlet it's a lot of lube right is that the main criteria they're not remotely interested and even when you get to be like in your late teens you remember the heavy padding of high school it wasn't like I won't act out the moves but it wasn't any of the moves they're showing there it was like ow your your leg is absolutely hold on that and you're in the back of it there's no like all right let's get started on the chun chun chun we went to different high school yeah it's just grow Alex we need to show up at their school board meeting I know every really do because that's right around the street I mean that's that's it's just insane and I think you've noticed this the indoctrination of all of these events it's it's so rampant Texas I mean every weekend there's one in Katie this weekend literally every weekend there's some sort of drag queen story time children family friendly drag show it's like when is this gonna stop but I don't think it's gonna stop I think it's actually accelerating there's gonna be more well that's until she until she stopped it so you know she's you started the Proud Boys she's starting the proud moms and they're gonna go and expose all this not at all get to beat you up until you can name five breakfast series I had to say this wait I was joking with the others I've been telling Sarah she's like yeah I want to start organizing you know protest at these events and I go you know but I'm talking about like we're disturbing on the inside yes yes but I go well you got to be careful because you're gonna end up like Gavin like a proud boy and then a week later Gavin's on the show it's kind of weird so now it is okay it is a little spooky maybe you guys are but I was as shocked as you guys that when they first saw them first I was freaked out that there's so many in Texas and then I thought just like I think this gender this this child mutilation is gonna be stopped I think so too but I thought the same thing the drag queen story hour yeah and then every time I tune in they're more and they're raunchier like the last one that's going around it looks it's indistinguishable from a strip club that was a stripper that was a stripper and there's a little eight year old and eight year olds do not want to see naked ladies yeah oh yeah you know his mom was like here please tip this lovely that's what you do to mess with him you go oh you're gonna go meet your girlfriend yeah go shut up like that's the worst thing in the world by the way I just would like to issue a correction before we have to take another quick break I don't just want moms I like actually need for dads to show up too so whenever we launch and I'm telling you guys you need to get involved and and you know go to the website and type in your email I'm talking to you dads because I didn't see you show up in Roanoke and shut that crap down and it really pissed me off all right we got to take a quick break first one I think our sponsor sweat block so sweat block is for Alex yes because Alex before the show he we here hold up your towel oh this is I'm sweating guys I'm a sweat is Gavin is making me nervous so I have to sweat so I need to get some of this so disgusting what he was just he was just dripping with sweat don't make fun why are we trolling me I'm just gonna take some sweat block and I'll never sweat again so they have the sweat block wipes you apply them at night and they will protect you from all of that gross sweat for up to like seven days it really does work my husband tried it it worked for him in like the depths of summer when it's a thousand degrees in Texas it can work for you you can get it all today for 20% off at sweatblock.com use promo code news that is sweat block.com promo code news yesterday we discussed Stacy Abrams claim that the sound of fetal heartbeats is actually just it's manufactured sound by men seeking to take control of women it seems that this is I guess becoming a mainstream Democrat talking point in defense of abortion sometime last month Planned Parenthood stealth edited its language about fetal development and now says there is no heartbeat between weeks 5 and 6 of gestation previously stated that between the fifth and sixth weeks of gestation a very basic beating heart and circulatory system develop within the fetus but now they're just saying a part of the embryo starts to show cardiac activity which I love that they keep saying like no it's not a heart it's just cardiac activity. What's the heart? What are right? Cardiacs do it's just feeding the liver nutrients. It's so dumb. Van your heart gets the point where it starts pumping blood but at the beginning it's only sending nutrients to the liver and the toes. I mean I had no idea that you men were powerful enough to manufacture sound and just like infiltrate it into these yeah the ultrasound machines and the Doppler you know radar that you guys are like just with your mind. Is it with your mind? It's like this thing. Do you go in? It's like in the mixer. He's like every ultrasound machine we have to add the heartbeat. But this is the serious now when we talk about oh you know the heart doesn't start beating till the fifth week or six week really we're just like circumcising an ant. I just want them to admit that it's a baby inside there and you just showed on your show NBC was talking about how babies would react to kale or they react to stuff while they're in the womb and in that segment they talk all these are lovely babies. What if that baby was in the womb two months earlier? Oh it's just a clump of cells. So I just want them to admit that is a human being and not a dog or cat growing in there and give it their respect to deserve. Okay but you're saying two months earlier they actually are advocating for that baby that they just saw reacting to the kale and whatever else. To be aborted yeah. Yeah up until the point of birth and then if you're you know Governor Ralph Northam even afterwards maybe you know we'll keep the baby comfortable while the mom decides if she wants to go ahead and abort. Well we bring this up all the time you guys can look this up real quick when they act when they survey pro-choice people people that are pro-abortion they always say there should be a limit you know after the third yeah and that limit used to be normal. It used to be like 23 weeks that's where the abortion debate belongs in that zero to 23 and that it's been that way forever and in the past like few years we're up I don't know what we're doing up here at nine months after it's nine months in New York State it's nine months and you're like okay can you do it how are you gonna do it yeah shoot it in the head yeah I mean it's like I don't know I mean I'm like very staunchly pro-life but I really they're just being so careless about it because I think as you point out Gavin there are a good amount of average Americans who are uncomfortable saying I I think that you should be forced to have a baby that you don't want I obviously am not like I'm very staunchly pro-life but there are a lot of Americans who could jump onto that if it's safely go and rare now that they are so proudly like I had 20 abortions and I love it you should too people are like oh yeah they ruined their cause remember Michelle Wolf yeah comes out on a show and she's like celebrating her abortion in a grant and I was watching they're going thank you Michelle yeah you just brought a bunch of people over our side by celebrating your abortion that's not someone who got raped right that's not someone who who accidentally had the condom break or something that's someone who is using it as birth control that was not the deal which you bring up the rape and incest argument which is totally disingenuous because because you'll go okay we'll give you that what if we give you that all other abortion stops and just rape and incest and it's not like they're gonna agree to that because that's not what they want it's a just their politics are spiked politics so the reason they say nine months is not because they're prepared to snip the spinal cord because they know it drives us crazy so it's it's like an ex-girlfriend dating your best friend she's like yeah I love him he's 450 pounds and he has severe acne I love I love severe acne and you're going well you I'm mad you did it but the drag queen story hour two they're not doing it to prevent gay kids getting bullied or to stop them from killing themselves they know it makes us mad so they're dancing around like brats trying to make us mad and guess what it worked I'm mad yeah well I mean and because all I agree with you but I do also think that that the younger generation is listening and there are a lot of younger girls who are listening to these women like Michelle Wolf going out and being like yeah abortion's great you should get it and they're like I should get an abortion I accidentally got pregnant I don't know what else to do and then they're traumatized for life because they didn't realize that it wasn't a thing to be celebrated right it's right that with the gender stuff if you look at Gen whatever this Gen Z or whatever versus my my generation in the comparison between people that identify as whatever LG yada yada yada it's like not even close in terms of the percentage of increase the exponential growth and obviously they have a lot to do what likes this type of stuff and what we're seeing now with them being as provocative as they are and that's why they do it and they're smart enough to understand that they don't convince other people especially younger people with having the best ideas they don't care about that they want to have the most the thing is most flashy most flamboyant and most attractive which is not silly that we're talking about abortion and that element but that's what they appeal to and that's that emotional appeal which is why it's so difficult to for someone that's been indoctrinated with that or has got all of that information it's very difficult to get them out of it by way of reason it's literally impossible because they didn't get there by way of that so you can sit up there and break it down as much as you want like this you're factually incorrect on your position and they won't even care in fact that's that's when they that are really getting pissed off when you start to explain to them how they're wrong but because it kind of goes against their sensibilities or whatever they believe to be true they're like no no no no no now I'm gonna even wrap it up even more that's a very difficult animal to fight which is why I'm so I know people don't like me for being a little rough around the edges and making fun of these people all the time I'd make that argument that I am more effective in convincing them out of that position than you are by trying to be all polite and reasonable with these irrational people well I just want to make this quick point though it's there's no amount of evidence that can convince an idiot and on top of that it's easier to trick someone than to convince them they have been tricked well they're teenagers this is adolescent rebellion and because your adolescence now goes up to your late 30s these people acting like brat so we used to like get a mohawk to make your dad mad and now they're like I cut my daughter's tits off you know you're like wow the you rebelled that's pretty rebellious I brought our son you know the one you don't have custody of anymore to a strip club and he was giving a strip or money you definitely are rebelling dad's mad but it just like you say what are you gonna do go to a punk teenager and go mohawks are stupid and it's a movement from Britain that was dead in 1980 what they don't care right right right so you just I think mockery is the best way to do it yeah because that works on teens yep yeah I agree by the way just for a quick fact check according to the National Library of Medicine they say at five weeks the baby's brain spinal cord and heart begin to develop and by week six its heart continues to grow and now beats at a regular rhythm this can be seen by vaginal ultrasound so I think maybe I'll just you know just attention to the yeah press the experts pay attention to the science because I think that's what we're supposed to be all about anyway all right we got to take another quick break first when I think our sponsor bank on yourself so you don't actually control your retirement money if you've gotten

financial plan just go to bank on yourself dot com slash matters that is bank on yourself dot com slash matters Gavin Newsom just recently tweeted new just launched billboards in seven of the most restrictive anti-abortion states that explain how women can access care no matter where they live to any woman seeking an abortion in these anti-freedom states CA California will defend your right to make decisions about your own health now where's it stopped before you finish it gets work because I think about what he just said like so he's basically claiming that California is the pro freedom state remember Eric Sam guy who ran all of those ads in Florida trying to convince the Floridians who watch Fox News that California was where they were gonna find freedom same guy aren't they like record numbers like a lot of people know like them leaving like this yes yes well didn't you hear Gavin Newsom earlier this week he said it was because of Trump's visa policies that they have the mass exodus that's why it was Eric okay what are you stupid um so it okay it does get worse because in the Texas Oklahoma and Mississippi versions of the ads there's a quote from mark 1231 where Jesus says love your neighbor as yourself there is no greater commandment than these and the billboard of course cuts out the context of the verse which instructs to love God first and I feel like if your neighbor's neighbor's a fetus that is a great point I gotta make this point there is a conspiracy theorist you know this is the thing that people that are like Luciferians are saying this sort of they love to use the Bible and invert it like you know yeah use it in your face so what's here is me what this is I'm scared that there's a financial incentive here where the hospital went we could really cash in on this abortion stuff we could get up to like we do seven a day that's our rent in one day no they need it for the medical testing they want the heart they want the baby up and all right that's valuable to right of course that's why when they catch Planned Parenthood people they have like eight fetuses in their closet like why do you have so many fetuses because it's like a weed dealer old weed they they forget about I'm just saying these is literally like a drug their commodity these fetuses and that's why these Planned Parenthood people always get coffee these fetuses yeah yeah so we had the genital mutilation at the beginning that was financially incentivized and now we have murdering babies for money well you know the number one face cream for celebrities is made from the foreskin the babies have you guys ever seen this yeah I did know that now yeah oh my I'm gonna send you the link after this yes Ellen DeGeneres had what's a girl from speed the actress Sandra Bullen she was on the show talking about now other celebrities you know they talk about the number one face cream it's really expensive it's like a thousand dollars for one ounce and it's made from the four stop I swear this is not mean that I was if I was to rub my foreskin on your face you would have better looking yeah honestly yes pretty good should we try I'm not going to try I'm the gateway that's friends this is a healthy skin fitness skin test I agree so I've been sitting here thinking that the medical community had just gone super woke but now I'm like no is it like they're like a panic capitalist yes just greed demonic greed it's disturbing it really it started out pretty innocent enough you hear your doctors work at hospitals and they say I think the term is in-house so you go there and your fingers got problems and you need some sort of muscle removed and they go okay we'll go to the third floor just keep it in the hospital we want to keep the way and these doctors get chastised if they recommend someone outside the hospital so we start out with those kind of normal incentives for money and then it's like dude there is so much money in top surgery and bottom surgery it's insane and the infections and stuff mean they come back it's almost as lucrative as abortion yeah which I hate to that they have these cute little names like top and bottom surgery yeah just call it what it is let make people uncomfortable let them know what they're actually the procedure that they're actually that was child sacrifice thing and they get so actually when you call it that we have abortion it is yeah yeah yeah so is Gavin running 100% considering it not really considering it he's gonna win there he's a Trump's running mate got my citizenship recently and it'd be a great way to sort of get the ground running yeah yeah yeah but what about having news some I like I was just saying this during the commercial break I just assumed we were on the same page left and right that he blew it and he's lucky he's not in jail and he should just go out to pasture and we're like you dodged a bullet buddy but president well how would that happen that's not what the left does though they just they keep like they keep running people who clearly other people don't like Stacy Abrams Robert Francis O'Rourke how many people you and you guys can't speak English with the letter in the back of the night better men is literally the most off-putting politician I've ever seen him I he doesn't even own a pair of pants the guy is like I mean he really does you never seen it he's got this lump growing from his neck and he's gonna hospital get that a glitter I had something to do with his stroke but and he's his his orchard skills the guy couldn't speak to save his life so on a few if we were all sitting here and we weren't on a show and you bought me a friend Federman we'd like hey man and then we'd all be really uncomfortable after about five minutes and then we'd sort of be glaring at you going bring a dog yeah well it is really bizarre because you'll someone in the press will actually say hey like should we be concerned because he seems to have problems speaking and they're like he had a stroke you can't say that he has an auditory problem it's like yeah stuff with yeah if he has an auditory processing problem like maybe he shouldn't be the guy I don't know call me crazy they were on people obviously out of spite in a lot of it unfortunately with politics like people support people out of spite as well which is why someone like Gavin Newsom is and I can't imagine living in an area like it will state let's say in California where he's rented into the ground even even more so than maybe the people before him and to still come out of that supporting his guy mainly because you're the people that you are told to despise don't like him and that's really a lot of what we do kind of with this like definitely an era of social media where it's a lot of supporting things out of spite as opposed to even look even if you know that you're advocating for essentially your own destruction yeah hey it makes the people that you're told to dislike mad so why not yeah it's daddy issues their teenagers were the daddy and they're just like I hate you slamming their bedroom door yeah but you know what's spooky about this too is I think it's possible they ran Biden knowing that he has an expiration date and it's gonna be done and it's the same with this union guy and it just happened to Laura Loomer they ran a weekend of Bernie's candidate against her he won and now he's just like worse than Biden and they go well he's got to go and now we can choose someone who know in a more orderly manner and Laura's like I almost won yeah and the weekend of Bernie's guy can't move yeah well and I know the show's over I will give you a little less thing Gavin can raise a lot of money and he's a puppet okay we've got to take a break what a lot I know the show's over but I'm gonna really really all right Gavin you are here cuz you're on tour right yes okay tell us what's going on where can people find the information the cognitive that dissidents to her yes okay we are cognitive dissidents we are thought criminals I just noticed there's a huge hole in comedy no one was being offensive anymore no dirty jokes no sexist racist transphobic homophobic jokes so we went out there and said let's just do all the jokes that no one else is doing and I think we overdid it I think you nailed all of that just on this show well that was this was nothing I see the tapes of these and I'm like I don't like this anymore I don't like me I'm offended by me so don't come it's weight look at that I mean it's it's way too over the top wow yeah it's I don't know how to dial it back now we already started and I can't stop at the tickets are sold but it is is it more controversial than a family friend the drag show well there no children are hurt which I guess is now that's for wimps so those of you who are listening on podcast it's a tiny URL calm slash censored live to get your tickets it's not all ages do not bring you yeah guys
