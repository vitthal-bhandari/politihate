    "text": " I think whether you're willing to acknowledge it or not, we are most definitely facing a crisis of our young men from incarceration and suicide rates to substance abuse issues to failing and lagging societal metrics. It's safe and also extremely tragic to say that our boys are fighting an uphill battle. My guest today is Dr. Warren Farrell, the author of The Boy Crisis and many other books written to explore society from the lens of both women and men. Today we talk about the dangers of lacking structure and purpose, how the quote unquote dad style versus the quote unquote mom style of parenting actually creates awareness and empathy, how dopamine secretion and other physiological responses assist boys and men in doing the right thing, and also the dangers and destructive results of dad deprivation. You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest, embrace your fears, and boldly charge your own path when life knocks you down. You get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated, rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, what is going on today? My name is Ryan Mikler. I'm the host and the founder of the Order of Man podcast and movement. Welcome here. Guys, the conversation I have today with Dr. Warren Farrell is one of my favorite conversations. Anytime I get to talk about boys and young men and men and how we interact with and show up in the world and how we can serve ourselves and our families and communities better, I love it. Because that's what this podcast is all about. It's all about giving you the tools and resources, conversations, etc. to help you become a more effective, capable man. It isn't that what society needs. Isn't that what you want to be? It isn't that what people need of you. So I'm going to get into it with Dr. Warren Farrell here in a minute. Before I do, just want to mention very quickly my friends, my good friends, my Jiu Jitsu training partners, and of course the sponsors of this podcast and just advocates for what we're doing here. It's OriginUSA, originusa.com. Some of you guys know they're coming out with a hunt line. In fact, I've got some of their early prototypes sitting on my desk right now. I've got a bino and rangefinder harness. I'm going to be getting the pants and the jacket and the whatnot that they do, all the hunting stuff that they're going to be doing. I just heard from a little bird that they're also going to be looking at doing some hunting boots. I don't know if I'm supposed to tell you, but they told me and they didn't tell me not to tell you. So I figured it'd be okay. Anyways, it's going to release here, I think, in the next 30 days. So if you're looking for hunting gear and here's the most important part, that's 100% sourced and made in America. Nothing outsourced to India, nothing outsourced or built or made in Bangladesh or China or wherever it is, they make these things. 100% American workers, American manufacturing, American supplies. And this is going to put some major, major hunting companies on their heels. So if you want to know more about what they're doing and get signed up and I talked with the owner, Pete Roberts, they just do not have enough supplies to meet the demand. So if you want to be the first to know about their new hunt line, you got to go to origin USA.com origin USA.com and get signed up for their email list because once this drops, it's going to go very, very quickly. Origin USA.com, check out their hunt line. All right, guys, with that said, let's get to my friend and somebody, man, I just deeply, deeply admire and respect this individual. His name is Dr. Warren Farrell. He is the author of the boy crisis and many other books. His insight is it's enlightening. It's fascinating when it comes to the dangers of not only what our young men are facing, but then how that translates into to put it mildly less than desirable outcomes for society as a whole. He's been featured on CNN, Good Morning America, The New York Times Forbes, Wall Street Journal and has proven to be an incredible, incredible resource for parents and the young men who seem to be struggling so much. Again, in his book, The Boy Crisis, he lays it all out there with regards to how our young men are struggling. And more importantly, what we as men can do about it, guys, I always joy my talks with Dr. Farrell and his incredible insight. I know you will as well. Warren, it's so good to see you again. I was looking at it. We had a conversation, believe it or not, it's almost been four years. I can't believe that it's, I thought it would have been two, but I cannot believe that it's been four years since we had our initial conversation. It's a sign of aging. The older you get the short of the period time periods to be. We were talking about trading some red with some gray. I think we can work something out here, but a little bit still a little bit of gray in there. I don't see it yet, but it's really great. Your beard is admirable. I think it was four years ago, because I knew The Boy Crisis book came out about four years ago. So I think you did one of the early interviews with me. And you were Utah, aren't you? Yeah, I was in Utah. We moved out here to Maine about three years ago. And it just, when we talked, it probably wasn't even on my radar to come out here, but it's just been such a great thing for my wife and my three boys and my daughter. And we just love it. Oh, that's wonderful. How old are your boys now? So I've got a, let me think, it's going to take me a second. I've got a 14 year old, an 11 year old, my daughter is eight, almost nine. And then my youngest son is six. So I got a full house over here. You have a full house, and you will, and has The Boy Crisis book has that been helpful for you and made you your son? Oh, incredibly helpful. I, in fact, your book and some other information that we have access to and books and things that we've read, we decided when we moved out here that we would pull our children out of public school. So we moved here now. So it's been three years, about a year before COVID and the reaction to COVID, we decided that we would homeschool our children for some very deliberate and intentional reasons. And I know you talk a lot about the school system being stacked against our young men and set up for our young ladies. And that coupled with some other thoughts that we had, my wife and I made the decision to pull our kids out of public school and start homeschooling or home-based education. And how has that been? How has that been for the development of the kids? That's been great. I mean, it's been great. The beautiful thing about homeschool, and I talk a lot about this with the guys, is that instead of having 25, 30, 35 kids in the classroom, we have four. We know them obviously intimately. My daughter is dyslexic. I didn't know that until we started homeschooling. My wife would say the same thing. And then we can cater their experience and their learning and education based on some aptitude that they may have for certain things versus others. And so it's a beautiful, I don't have any problem with school teachers. I really have a problem with the system in general that made us make that decision. It's been really good. I'm very glad to hear that. How do you give them good social skill training, meeting other kids, meeting strangers, meeting kids they don't like? How does that work in this homeschooling? That's one of the biggest questions that we get. So they're very involved and active in physical activity. So it's through powerlifting. My two oldest boys do powerlifting with about five to six other young men in the community. My two oldest boys also play football. So they're very active in football with their teams and whatnot. My daughter is very involved in dance. And then we have a very tight knit crossfit community and friends that we spend a lot of time with. We invite them over. We have barbecues and dinners and things together. And then we're actually working. This year will be our first year with a co-op where there's five other families in the community who are all home-based education where they're going to be learning from other parents involved with other kids. Because that was my biggest concern is how do you make sure they get the social interaction? And I really like that you said, kids they don't like. That's one of the things that I think a lot of people overlook because that interpersonal dynamic is huge. And I think a lot of home-based education parents overlook the importance of that. Yes. And it's important, you know, when you're homeschooled somebody, you're almost always going to train your son and your daughters, but especially your sons, not to be bullies. But it's also as important to make sure that they know how to handle bullies and not just handle them by beating them up, but handle them by respecting the bullies need to be respected. And understanding that under almost all anger and abusiveness is vulnerability. And so being able to connect to that vulnerability, I remember in the Boy Crisis book, I think you may remember reading, where I learned that sort of almost intuitively as a kid, it was in about eighth grade. And I had moved over from another school district in other town to the town that we lived in. The town we lived in was much more working class, the new town was much more working class. And I sort of stood out as a student. And one of the boys really, who was a sort of gang leader, he really sort of thought of me as being sort of the goody-choo shoes. And he confronted me one day and hit a brick in his hand. And he was ready to throw that brick right through my head. And he just really basically wanted to get rid of me. And I said to him, you know, that it was really great that he was the leader of this gang, this and because, you know, and what did I think, what did he think that the leadership skills that he had that led to him being selected as a leader and being able to sustain himself as a leader. And he like started to get into that. And he told me what he thought his leadership skills were. And as he did that, his his brick just dropped. And you know, the hand dropped and then the brick just dropped to the ground. And it was like, you know, I was and what I was. And you know, I didn't have, you know, I hadn't read books like The Boy Crisis and you know, that told me here is a good way to approach a bully. But you know, it's sort of like, I guess it was a survival instinct that led me to just reaching for that. And you know, or else I may not have been around here today to talk about it. Well, you know, it's interesting. I think this is where our past might diverge a little bit. Because when I hear you tell that story, my immediate reaction is, I would tell that guy, you have one shot. And if you miss your dead. So it's a very interesting thing when you come at at it from this perspective, which obviously worked clearly worked. And there's so many different ways to to approach the situation. I'm always trying to figure out the balance between toughness and assertiveness with my young men specifically, maybe more so than my daughter. And the balance between that and tenderness and care and empathy, which I think is what you exhibited here in this story you're sharing. Yes. And at the same, first of all, you've put your finger now exactly on the biggest point that is of value, I think, which is the word balance. And it's having the skill sets to both be able to confront. And at the same time, the skill set to be able to understand that bullies and bullies, both the bully and the bullied have in common, oftentimes low self esteem feelings of insecurity. And so it is interesting that the opposite behaviors are manifested with the underlying similar personality characteristics. And so there's sort of two ways of approaching sort of a bully, if you will. One is the way I just shared. And the other way, my father and this worked at a different time in my growing up. My father had always said basically, you have to stand up to a bully, just like you were just talking about, right, that you just can't be pushed around, and that you need to be respected basically. And my father had taught me to box into wrestle, but the in the eighth grade in this school also that I just was talking about moving to. There was another guy there that was a sort of muscle leader, and he had the same type of he was a muscle builder. And he was very respected and absolutely gorgeous. And he was very much known for being a bully. And my father had taught me both to box into wrestle. But I knew I couldn't outbox this guy. So and he kept confronting me and sort of calling me chicken to sort of encounter with him. And I did agree to wrestle with him. And my father taught me well enough that I was able to pin him down in a few seconds. And when I had him pin down, he said, please let me up. I'll always support you. And I let him up. And two things happen there. One is he did follow through. He always supported me after that. And B, what was the deepest sadness for me is even though I was good in my schoolwork, etc. And generally decent in sports, the I got more respect from my classmates from being able to pin him down than I did from anything else I did. And for me, that was very, very sad, you know, that the respect came to me from being able to be somebody who won at a wrestling match rather than made contributions through being good at school or somewhat decent in sports. I was not never a standout, but I was good at sports. And I had started the soccer team in my school, etc. And yet that didn't command as much respect as, you know, as this little wrestling match. And I think so a question on that, because I don't, I don't disagree. I can certainly see why men will respect another man or young boy in this case with some sort of physical aptitude. But as we get older, don't you think the same level of respect would be commanded if you became the CEO of a Fortune 500 company, or you were maybe a more superficial metric would be you drive around a Lamborghini, or you wear, you know, the $10,000 watch, don't you think that the same level of respect would be granted on some other metrics that might be a better metric of aptitude as you get older and more mature? Yes. And I would say even the those metrics are really sad metrics also, because for us to be evaluating for me to evaluate myself on the Lamborghini, which I do not have either do I, or the other equivalent measures, or even, you know, this is Warren Farrell, he wrote X number of books and New York Times best-selling authors. These sort of titles, right? Yes, exactly. And, you know, and I hope that as the more mature I become, that the more I look for respecting people who can listen, who can not be concerned with themselves, who could not be focused on what type of home they have, and, you know, you want to live in a nice home and a nice place, but that that should not be our definition of ourselves, how well you're raising your children, your devotion to them in homeschooling, the way you communicate with your wife, the way you hear you listen to your wife, and the way you give space to each of your kids to speak up and share what's inside of them. As you know, in the Boy Crisis book, I have a whole section on Family Dinner Night, and particularly on how to prevent Family Dinner Nights from becoming Family Dinner Nightmares. And, you know, and one of the important things about Family Dinner Nights is not only teaching the parents how to listen to the kids and be empathetic with the kids' stories and not interrupt the kids' stories, but also making sure that the kids are required to listen to the parents' stories, the parents' virgins, and not interrupt the parents' stories. One of the ways to make sure that children are not empathetic is to always be empathetic toward the children, as opposed to both being empathetic toward the children, and also requiring the children to be able to demonstrate empathy toward the parents and to their brothers and sisters. So you have to allow them the opportunity to be empathetic is what you're saying. And more so than even allow, allow them the opportunity to be would be ideal. Most kids, when they're younger, do not pursue that opportunity. They have to be required to develop the discipline to move from a self-centered space to a balance between self-centered and other-centered space. Interesting. Required versus allowed. That's interesting because I see a lot of this manifest itself in society today. And I think it started with the whole, you know, the phrase we all hear, and this may be more indicative of when you were younger, because you're a bit older than I am, is, you know, kids should be seen and not heard. No, no, no, of course not. Right. And then you graduate to this newer age version of parenting, which is where no kids now can dictate their gender and they can dictate what time they should go to bed and what activities they should be involved in. And I think both are opposite ends of the extremes, the spectrum, and I don't think either are correct. I would have three perspectives on that. Yes, yes, and yes. So totally agree with you. And it really is, you know, we've jumped from one extreme to the other, and both extremes are really very damaging to the children. I'm very curious about this. This way that young boys approach their self esteem issues, you said it manifests itself. And I'm sure again, there's a spectrum, but it manifests itself potentially as the weakling, right? The coward who is timid and passive and lets himself get railroaded. And then you have the bully who asserts himself and attempts to dominate not through capability, but through intimidation. Is that a nature thing that more young men are designed to act one way or the other? Or is that something that's nurtured through their environment, through parenting or lack thereof and exposure to other stimulus that makes them behave one way or the other? The answer to that is yes, meaning it's nature and nurture combined. And if I were to give percentages about 70% nature and about 70% nurture, meaning that it's so inter that as you, you're a veteran. And so, you know, as you trained in the military, even if you went into the military and you were over protected, which you probably weren't, but as you know, many people in the military, boys who have single mothers, they have a higher percentage chance of joining the military than any other single parenting group. And that's actually quite useful because oftentimes the single mothers do not do as much boundary enforcement as the children would have if they had both fathers and mothers and an active father, which usually requires more boundary enforcement. So, both the child, both the boy and the parent and the mother sort of sense that the boy needs structure and is without it. And the military, as you know, creates that structure. So the boy going into the military, and it also creates requirements. So you know, you weren't given the option of, you know, of getting up at a certain time, doing certain things, running certain paths, training in certain ways, you were required to do that. And as you're required to do that, different synapses develop in your brain that begin to change what you would think of as nature. But it's in our nature to be able to adapt to social messages. That's why it's 70% nature and 70% nurture. One of the things along those lines that is fascinating is that many people think of, mothers as being more biologically oriented toward raising children than dads are. But children raised by dads and well, children raised by dads and moms together tend to do the best on average. But children raised by fathers only do better than children raised by mothers only. And what do you mean by do the best? Do you say do the best? What metrics are we managing? We're talking about having postponed gratification, which is the biggest predictor of success or failure, being able to have discipline, being able to have a warm and open and loving personality that other people connect with, being able to listen, being able to have social skills. So for example, to be concrete about it, a typical one, one of the things that I found that when I did the research for the boy crisis that I found was in no parenting magazine and no other parenting book was helping parents understand the difference between what I came to call mom style parenting and dad style parenting. And mom style parenting tends to be more identifying the children's strong points, helping the children feel proud of themselves because they're a good singer or they have a good basketball skills or they're a good scholar or whatever and encouraging them to pursue that. And you know, sweetie, you want to be an Olympic gymnast, like you just saw Simon Simona Biles be. Yes, you can do that, that's fine. But then oftentimes the children will start to do that and they'll get a tutor. But they won't follow through, they'll get distracted by a new video game if they're a male in particular or a social engagement or somebody's birthday party and then not putting in the discipline to go there. Dads are more likely to sort of require say, you listen, you want to be a best an NBA player or you want to be an actor or a writer or whatever, you want to be in the Olympics, you've got to focus on that. And if we're going to take you to practice and if we're going to make our investment in your time, then you've got to return that. We're working overtime to be able to pay for a tutor to make sure that you're or a coach to get you to be better at this, this like you want your dream is. That requires something from you. And moms will often say some version of, well, sweetie, you're being a little tough on Mary or John. It's good for them to go to their part, somebody's birthday party. And he says, I agree. And it's good for them to go to somebody's birthday party. But they're not going to become an Olympic gymnast if they're going to a lot of birthday parties because the people who are Olympic gymnasts are ones that are focused only on that. And they make a trade-off. They give up a lot of the rest of their life for that. And that trade-off is not necessarily healthy. But let's make a decision here. Do we want to go for something? And what level do we want to go for this set? And so it's this type of dialogue or another example that's I think a better example is typically speaking, dads will be far more likely to rough house than moms will be. And the dad will start the rough housing with the kids like you have three boys and a girl. Right. Is that correct? That's correct. Right. And you might throw all three boys and the girl on the couch and say, all right, the game here is to, the four of you, you could try to pin me down before I pin the four of you down. And the kids go, yeah, all right, all right. That's a great dad. And mom was looking on and saying, oh my god, I feel like I have just one more child to monitor, in husband. And we get our home, Dr. Fairland. Literally in our home. And the mom is saying to herself, OK, but the kids seem to be having a lot of fun. I don't want to be controlling. I don't want to interfere too much. On the other hand, I just fear that somebody's going to get hurt sooner or later. And sooner or later, she's about 99% likely to be right. So I'm going to get hurt. Of course. Of course. It's going to happen. And then she says to herself, no, I feel really guilty. I didn't interfere before and prevent this from from somebody getting hurt. On the other hand, at least now Ryan's going to understand that he can't do this because somebody's going to get hurt. But Ryan doesn't understand that. There he doesn't look at it that way. He says, you know, Jimmy or whatever one of your son's name is, you can't stick your elbow and cap your side. Well, you shouldn't have done that. Do better next time. Exactly. And the kids will say, yes, yes, yes, Adam. Sorry. No problem. I'll do better. But the next time they don't do that much better because you've only told them to do better. There was no price to pay if they didn't. So why do they adapt postpone gratification if there's no price to pay by just pushing sister or brother aside? But when most dads the second time after the children are warned, they say, okay, I gave you a warning. Now there's no more rough housing. Now the next time you rough house and then so dad goes ahead and says, okay, well, you know, no rough housing tonight, maybe tomorrow night or the next night, well, rough house. And mom was looking on going, Oh my God, you know, has any learned is less than after twice the kids have gotten hurt. But the but the important difference between dad and mom style parenting happens the third time. And that third time, the children now know that the last time daddy said that there if they if they were too aggressive or too rough, they're going to lose their rough housing. The last time daddy said that we lost our rough housing when we were that way. And it's now that the kids get their beginning their first step in postpone gratification. I want to push my brother or sister aside. But if I do that, I'm going to lose what I really want. So I have to postpone the gratification of winning immediately in a way that is too aggressive or too unsympathetic to the brothers and sisters needs. And I have to focus on doing what I need to do to get that rough housing the rough housing that we all want. And so this is so this is so one of the common phrases I hear a lot and that specifically directed towards the government, I think in general is the scyop, right? This is a scyop against the American people. But but I'm kind of here, you say, correct me if I'm wrong, that there's a scyop with with our children too. And we need to be aware of the game that's being played and what they're being taught outside of just the words that we're using and the behaviors that we're trying to mold. Exactly. And so here's the that exactly what happens with the dynamic. So now, then you have said this new dynamic of you can't be aggressive and you have to think of your brothers and sisters needs. And the kids are are now saying, I'm going to I know I'm going to lose my rough housing if I'm that aggressive. So I'm going to stop and I'm not going to be that aggressive. Or I'm going to think of my brothers and sisters needs. Now, a number of things are happening here. The kids are understanding that they have to have the postpone gratification. They also have to think of their brothers and sisters needs. And what the data shows is a children who do this are now required to think of their brothers and sisters needs in order to get what they want. So empathy becomes a selfish, you know, it's in their self interest to become empathetic. It's in their self interest, not be too aggressive. Though that when so I wrote this question down, and I know I keep interrupting you this because I have a thousand questions. I've got some I have more questions that we have time for. So I wrote down here putting the needs of others above our own. So I'm hearing you say that that's a learned trait. Do you think that there's any sort of inherent nature in putting other people's needs above our own? Or is that entirely learned? It's learned. And it's also once it's learned, there's something in our nature, which is the RCZ, the rostral singlet zone of our brain. That when we do something like think of others, others give us positive feedback and that positive feedback increases the feel good drug dopamine in our brain. And this is why I say everything is nature and nurture it is. We have evolved over millions of years. And if you take it back to, you know, to the evolution at the beginning, we're talking about probably billions of years of evolution to have this enormously sophisticated system of being able to know how to survive and to know how to survive. We had to get along with others, the people that didn't, that they usually were defeated by being too divided. And so can I share a personal story on that? Absolutely. The reason I asked this is because I've been actually thinking about this today. So about three or four hours ago, I was sitting in my office and I was sending out emails. And I heard a crash outside of our home on the corner, the corner that we live on happens to be a pretty dangerous intersection. I heard a crash. I knew the distinct sound. I knew exactly what had happened. So I ran out and I told my kids, stay here, son, you call 911. I got to run out here and do this. And I ran out and I saw this little blue sedan that had probably traveled 40 yards after it had gotten hit. And there was a young woman in the driver's side of the vehicle. And so I ran over there, I was barefoot because I just came out. I ran over there. And she was bleeding from her head. And it's stuck with me for about four or five hours now. It's pretty touching, actually. Just a sweet young woman. She was probably in her late teens, early 20s. I could tell she had a backpack and some other things. So I think she was probably a student at the college here. And she was bleeding from her head and just red blood had just drenched her her top that she was a white striped shirt that she was wearing. And oh, I just had this like, I just felt so I felt so bad. And so I grabbed some napkins, I threw them on her head, I applied pressure, I asked her what her name was, I asked her what she if she was okay. And her biggest concern was, did I break the rules? That's one thing she said. Did I break the rules of driving? I'm like, I don't know, I didn't see it, but we're going to get you taken care of. And she's fine. She had a couple minor lacerations on her head. She's fine. And I thought to myself, well, you know, like, I did that because that's the right thing to do. That's what we do. That's the right thing to do. But now as you're saying this, maybe it's not that I did it because it's the right thing to do. Maybe I did it because I feel really good about my ability to do so. And so maybe it's, and I'm not saying this in a bad way, but maybe there's some selfish reasons behind it. And it's that dopamine hit or whatever it is in our chemical makeup that makes us do what I think we all objectively would agree is the right thing to do. Yeah, no, that's absolutely the case. And if you, especially if you are trained, if you are trained to look at it that way, and you know, there's a the way where if we're always trained to just think of ourselves, then we don't get the dopamine hits from doing things for others. So we don't have that experience of being looking forward to the dopamine hits by doing something for others. And so part of what the military does for for for men is to say that, you know, that it's a training to be to allow yourself to know that even being completely disposable, being completely dead, you are that you have you have served that you've done something for others. And that's that's even worth your life. And it's one of the reasons why, you know, and so that begins to get programmed into you. And also these things lead to other fascinating dynamics between moms and dads. We were talking before about the rough housing and, and you know, you mentioned something about, you know, that when you say something like that, that dad, that the children oftentimes obey, or maybe I suggested that I don't know, and but moms will oftentimes looking at this that situation of, you know, you you say, okay, you can't be too aggressive now. And you're you can't, you know, do this to your brother, your sister. Moms will often look on and say after this has developed, the relationship has developed with your kids. I don't get this. I tell the kids the same thing that Ryan tells the kids, but they respond to me better. I don't know whether it's his deeper voice or he's bigger or what the story is, but it's, but what the findings show is that it's not Ryan's deeper voice or that he's bigger. That is that that that way when you tell kids to behave a certain way, and there's no consequence if they don't behave that way, or you suggest a consequence, but then you give them another chance and another chance, the kids will keep taking that other chance until they exhaust, exhaust the the energy of the mom. And then the mom will oftentimes so that there's no downside in not paying attention to the mom. There is a downside in not paying attention to the dad when dad is a good boundary enforcer. Sometimes this is reversed. The mom is the boundary enforcer the dad isn't and sometimes both are good boundary enforcers and sometimes both are bad boundary enforcers. But as a rule, this is the this is a difference in what I call dad style parenting and mom style parenting. And so what I started talking about in the boy crisis book is all those differences and all the misunderstandings between moms and dads that come from not understanding those differences. And then once you understand those differences, how to do what leads children to having the best upbringing, which is not to do dad style parenting or mom style parenting only, but to do checks and balance parenting and checks and balance parenting requires really good communication and respect from the mom about dad style parenting and its contribution and from the dad about mom style parenting and its respective contribution. And so that is and so that is a core part of the boy crisis book is how to communicate the best intent. But most dads don't know that they can't say to moms, you know, the data shows that when I require the children to think of their brothers and sisters needs and to be assertive but not aggressive, those children grow up more empathetic and they grow up more assertive but not aggressive. And therefore as a result of that, they have more friends at school because they have social skills and the more friends at school they have the more less likely they are to be depressed. And the more motivated they are to be good to go to school and to study well and so on. And all of these things are connected. And when boys and girls don't have these, particularly boys that don't have good social skills, they oftentimes become depressed and withdraw into video games and then become addicted to the video games which only makes them feel more like a player in the video games and less like a player being able to have nuanced social interaction in school. Men, let me pull you away from the conversation very quickly. Obviously, we've been talking a lot about how to serve our young men. And I can't think of a better way to do that than to have an engaged present father in the home. We address that in this conversation. And one of the primary roles of a father is to introduce his son to experiences that are going to last a lifetime and ultimately serve him well as he transitions from boy to man. And that's where the legacy experience comes in. We've taken time tested and proven models throughout the history of mankind and we've emulated and extracted and built the lessons, the experiences and ultimately the results that will unequivocally serve your boys as they become men. Now, I just talked with our event coordinator Chris Gachko yesterday and we only have two spots remaining for our legacy. Well, our only legacy event of the year, which is September 22 through the 25th. So if you have a son between the ages of eight to 15, you need to lock in one of those last two spots September 22 through the 25th 2022. If you want to learn more, you want to watch a video from our last experience and you want to lock that in head to orderman.com slash legacy. Orderman.com slash legacy. Do that now or do that right after the show. For now, let's get back to it with Dr. Farrell. You're telling my you are telling my stuff like you are telling my I feel so selfish because all these questions I have are directed for me, you know, let me just let me just share I so my mother primarily raised me and my sister on my own. I joined the military to your to your sister earlier. She actually forced me to go play football. I wanted to play football and she said no, because she was concerned and two years later, she said, no, you actually have to go play football and I didn't want to, but she forced me to. And just this idea of social intelligence, maybe is the word. I didn't have that my friends when I was younger called me the hermit. I was the hermit because I didn't go out because I didn't feel confident in spending time with other boys. I had a hard time relating with other boys. And I've since learned, you know, I've had to learn and develop those skills and I know that they are learned. And so I have been able to. But oh my goodness, you are telling my story. This is unbelievable. I'm very glad. You know, it's been such a joy to I guess one of the biggest joys happened recently when about six months ago or so along the lines of what we're talking about when somebody wrote to me and said that that he had joined, he had been raised by a single mom and who was very devoted to making him happy. And he ended up becoming addicted to video games and not even knowing himself as a human being. And began to resent his mom because she felt he was she wasn't he wasn't being helped by her. And the tag in is in between him and his mom became so great that he ended up living then with his aunts and his grandmothers and none of them had men in their lives. And so he felt like he didn't really know how to become a man. And he had two things that he pointed out. He said I felt I had no structure and I had no purpose. So he said, I ended up joining eight Chan, which is a fascist ideological group. And he said there I found structure and I found purpose. I felt like I had a could have an ideology that would be that would superior to any other ideology I'd ever heard of. And these people were all, you know, searching for structure like I was. And he said so and they and eight Chan had nurtured two of the major mass shooters that the world has known, unfortunately. And he said, so I drew up a 52 page manifesto to carry out my own mass shooting to show the world that I was somebody that should need to be reckoned with and paid attention to. And he said, then I don't know how I did this, but I ran across the Boy Crisis book. And I read it. And when I was reading it, it wasn't so much the data that was important to me. But it felt like what you just said a minute ago, like I was a spy in his home. He said that you saw everything I was doing and saying and feeling and fearing that I hadn't been able to put words to. And as and when I finished reading that and feeling understood and having compassion toward what I am, I lost the that extra anger that it took to carry out the mass shooting. And so I was able to then go to a couple of psychologists and a psychiatrist, one for medication and one for sort of social help. And I want to write you and say thank you because the Boy Crisis as a result of that, I saved my own life and saved the life and indirectly you saved the life of countless other people. Or spared, right? What? What? So you said with that young, I'm assuming he's a young man, it what you said that he wanted to be paid attention to, he probably wanted to be significant in some way. It's very hard personally for me to wrap my head around this idea, but we see these mass shootings and they're always perpetuated by young men, a lot of them lack father structures, whether it's their biological father or a father figure. Yeah. A lot of them are addicted to some of these drugs that are main-lined in their veins. And we don't quite know all the ramifications of that. Do you find that that's a common theme or thread that they want to be seen? That's hard for me to imagine, but I can't help. I can't deny that that seems to be a common thread. Yes, I do. That's exactly what he said to me, but looking at a bigger picture framework, there has been six mass school shooters in the 21st century that have killed 10 or more people, actually seven. And we know the family backgrounds of six of them. And of those six that we know the family backgrounds for, every single one of them has had been deprived, what I call dad deprived, deprived of a significant involvement of the biological father. Unfortunately, the biological father is more important than the stepfather. The stepfather can be very helpful. We can be happy to dig into how the stepfather can be helpful and what usually prevents the stepfather from being helpful. But it was the absence of the biological father that was the factor in all those cases. The boy lived with the mother and usually had an antagonistic relationship with the mother and then was sometimes passed on to a grandmother or an aunt just like this boy in Uvalde. This is all true of the boy in the last big mass shooter in Uvalde, Texas. And so this is, and what, so the boy doesn't feel like he has a father creating that postponed gratification that gives him the discipline to be able to do the things he really wants to do. So I am now communicating back and forth on Zoom with this potential mass shooter who is fortunately averted. And part of what he had at the very beginning was an enormous amount of anger toward his mom. And so I asked him to role play his mom and what her intent was. And when he role played his mom, he said, he expressed his enormous anger toward his mom for just letting him play these video games all the time and never learning how to be a human being in the world. And so he said to his mom, why did you do this to me? So I asked him to role play his mom, make believe he was his mom. And he said, as his mom, because you seemed so happy then. And when I wanted you to be happy, and I love you, and this is the only thing that seemed to make you happy. So I didn't want to take this away from you. And when he began to really get into that, he began to see that his mom's best intent was his love for him. Even though she didn't do what he would needed to do what he needed would have made him unhappy. And so she didn't want to make him unhappy in that desire to give him immediate gratification. She didn't help him get the structure and the postponed gratification that he needed from being outside of his comfort zone of being just one more figure in the video games. I do want to talk about a couple of things. Stepfathers, I also want to talk about how to help encourage or lead your wife when maybe she doesn't see the importance of your role as a man in it. But when you bring it up as a mother's love, and I think generally speaking, that's probably true, what then is a woman's role in the development? Specifically, let's talk about young men. What is her role? It's just that you come from a very interesting perspective where you spend a lot of time in the feminist movement, you spend a lot of time with women's issues, and then more recently have spent a lot of time with focusing on young men and the crisis of boys and masculinity in general. And so I love this perspective. I'm curious what you believe to be the role of a mother in that dynamic of raising the boys. Yes. Well, the boys definitely benefit from mother involvement and sort of being able to sort of be seen by their moms for their best talents and being nurtured and having those talents pointed out and having moms brag on them and just knowing that in a mom's space, they feel they can say anything to the mom or the mom at least facilitates them saying anything and always has their best interests at heart. And as usually concerned about, you know, is right there to prepare a meal is to make sure that he has the right clothes to wear to school and things like that. Moms contribute so much, including love. But how does that counter though with the 60s version of feminism and the third wave version of feminism? Because you just said to cook him a meal to make sure he has the clothes. I think that's a traditionally held notion of femininity and motherhood. But how does that juxtapose with today's perspective of a mother in her role, either in the home or community or workforce? Yes, if she's, you know, if she's in first of all, it really children that do best do have two highly involved parents. And so men and women have a lot of flexibility and fluidity in their roles. And you can have a father raise the children and do the cooking and so on. But statistically speaking, men and women are very flexible until they have children. And as they have children, the overwhelm of the responsibilities usually leads to the children to moms being more likely to be involved with the children at home and dads being more likely to go to the workplace. Now that's not an advocacy in my part because children that are raised predominantly by dads do extremely well. And one of the reasons why children raised predominantly by dads do extremely well is because when moms raise children predominantly in the traditional sense, dads sometimes try to supply the money. And in the process of supplying the money, they oftentimes don't pay as much attention to the children as we'd be eligible for the children. Whereas when I also imagine, correct me if I'm wrong, that if it's the dad that's primarily raising the children that they are by default of our current societal norms going to be exposed to women, whether it's through the public school system or grandma's around. But if you take dad out of the picture, the likelihood of that child, son or daughter being exposed to a fixture, a masculine manly fixture is significantly less than the default of them being exposed to women in education or women in some sort of nurturing role. That's exactly correct. And also to start that's correct at every level. So the first level is that when the dad is the primary breadwinner, oftentimes in order to be able to support the family, especially you have four children to be able to support them in a loving way. If the dad is the primary breadwinner, the mom is largely at home taking care of the children, the dad often keeps accepting jobs to take more and more responsibility, which taken more and more away from home. And also, like if he's a salesperson locally when they were single, and now they have four children, he will oftentimes accept responsibilities to be that salesperson nationally. And so that will take him away from home for weekends and so on. Whereas the mom is less likely to be willing to take those jobs that take her away nationally. And so she can be there for the children's recital. She can be there for the children's birthday party and so on. And so there's a tendency for when the mother is the primary caretaker for the children not to have as much of dad as they need. Whereas when the dad is the primary caretaker, mom is more likely to still remain involved and not take job responsibilities that lead her to break the glass ceiling, but be away from the children to often. And it's one of the reasons why women who are mothers very rarely break glass ceilings unless they have a full time dad taking care of the children or they have a full time nanny. But the children raised by full time nannies as opposed to full time dads do not tend to do as well or feel as loved and secure as the children raised by a combination of dad and mom. So tough question potentially politically incorrect. What would you then suggest to a man who is looking for a lifelong partner and a female? What do the statistics say about a woman who would like to be in the career and pursue a career versus a woman who would like to pursue being a homemaker and finds value in being at home and raising her children and potentially homeschooling her children and that sort of thing. Does that have the play on who we should look to to partner with? Yes, and it depends on who's rather than it be the traditional way of have a mom be homemaker and dad be breadwinner. One of the things that we really need to work with our daughters on is to understand that if she wants to be a habitable woman, if she wants to break glass ceilings, if she wants to, if she's motivated by her career and those types of challenges and she also wants to have a happy marriage, a happy marriage and also have children that are raised well, then what she needs to look for is a man whose propensities are being more of a nurturer connector rather than a provider protector. But in order for that to work, the woman has to respect the man for being in that role. Marriages in which men are the primary caretaker fall apart if the man does not feel that she respects the man for being the primary caretaker. Does she generally? No, that is not usually not. It is an effort. It is a training. It is a conscious selection process and women are very much more likely to be at work. And then somebody who's really an outstanding person at work, they have respect for that person and they're likely to pull away and feelings of attraction to that person. The father will pick it up, pick up that energy, pick up the, maybe go to a Christmas party or a holiday party, and we'll start seeing the connection between his wife and that man that's more successful and then that will lead to anger and so on. And the woman will feel, well, gee, you're so insecure and then that will go down a sliding slope of negativity, which is one of the reasons why two things are so important is helping women understand that this is the type of, if you have the type of personality that wants to be a have it all woman, you can suggest you can't allow yourself to fall in love with another superstar type of male and raise children. You can do that if you don't want to raise children. But if you want to raise children and you want to have something other than an any take care of the children and you want your children to feel as internally secure as possible and to feel the love of their mother and father, in selecting all of this one has to always remember that a child looks in the mirror and the child when she or he looks in the mirror is half the mother and half the father and they sense that. I have the, you know, that thick beautiful hair of my father. I have my, this quality of my mom and you know, and if you're, and if either one of them are not around to love them, and but the nanny is wonderful. They don't feel the connection from the nanny that is that half of them and this is not because nannies are bad. It's because the children need to feel that that connection to the biological dad and the biological mom, which is why even though step dads can be helpful, it's rare that the stepdad is as when I wrote, you know, the boy crisis book in a book before that on this issue. And I was a stepfather. I sent this to the draft of the book to the biological father. He was impacted by it enough to move back from 500 miles away from the children to to be more with the children because he saw that it wasn't Warren Farrell stepdad that was really needed by the children. Yes, he has all these sort of nurture connector skills, but it makes less difference than than it does to the children to have me, him with, with, with them. So I, I take a little bit of an issue with this phrase that you've used of the have it all woman. Yes. I just, I just don't think that's possible. I think and help, let's talk about this, let's hash this out a little bit to the degree that we can. I just, when we say that, basically what we're telling women is that you can go out and you can pursue this incredible career and you can make partner and you can run this fortune 500 company and you can be the best possible mother. And I just don't think that's the case the same way as a father though, too. I, I, I recognize that although I work at home and I try to be as active as possible, like as I can in my kid's life, there is a sacrifice that I have to make. And I think generally speaking, based on what I've seen, men are more prone to make that sacrifice and women, especially as you get older and, and potentially lose some of their childbearing years, start to hold some regrets and some animosity about some decisions regarding being this quote unquote, have it all type woman. Yes, I actually agree with you. When, if you're a, but, but there's, there's a degree issue here. When women have children and they, they want to have really good careers, they can do that if they are prioritizing their being home for their children and with their children. And so the, but that prioritization of being home with and for their children usually will prevent them from being, from breaking a glass ceiling of being a CEO of a significant right. Right. And if they are a CEO of a significant company, oftentimes that priority of being with their children will begin to get lost in the shuffle. And so you're, you're absolutely right. But have it all in that looser sense of, I want a career and a career is really inspiring to me. As long as you're not as long as you are also prioritizing the, you know, when there's a conflict between the children and the career, there's enough flexibility there to be with the children to a greater degree, even though the children may have to occasionally miss the mom for this reason or that reason and a certain amount of that is not bad. But too much of that goes the other way. But that does usually prevent the woman from being have it all in the sense of being a CEO of a significant corporation or doing a startup that requires usually an enormous amount of time in the early years. So you're absolutely right there. Yeah, I just, I, and I'm not putting this just on, I put this on myself. I think about my business. There's been many times where I've throttled the business. Maybe there was an opportunity to go speak in public that I could have made five or six figures in the pursuit of doing and I've decided, thank you, but no, thank you. Yes. They're just choices and to say that we can have it all is a bit of a misnomer. You can have anything, but you can't have all of it. Yes. If you're taking it, this is a thing of degree. If you're, if you want a career while you're raising children, that and you define have it all that way, that is possible. If you have the father at home helping to raise the children, and particularly if there's less danger as a mom, mom, that you will get carried away because there's less identity in for women, there's less identity and going around saying I'm a CEO because you, and if you have children, there'll also be lots of people questioning your, the amount of involvement you have with your children. Whereas you're, if you're a dad and you're a CEO, there's, there's, there's, people will often stop with the admiration for your being that CEO and not take you to, you know, what's your relationship with your children like. And so we as people, as supporters of healthy children, we need to be able to make sure that we are talking with fathers and mothers about what's your connection to your children. And in that, in that framework, here's an important thing. Once your family has, depending on where in the United States you live, between 50 and 80 thousand dollars worth of income for a family of four. Once your family has that amount of income per year for a family of four, the, the children benefit more from dad's time than dad's time. What was the amount, what amounts of time or time like that? Yes, between 50 and 80 thousand, depending on where in the United States you live, obviously, you know, to live in Maine is a lot less expensive than living, you know, in San Francisco or New York City. Sure, sure. So, but, but the children very rarely go to therapists and say, I wish my father or mother spent more money on me. Yes, I imagine that doesn't get brought up a whole lot. No, no, and, and many people are likely to say, you know, we, we came from a poor background, but I had a lot of love for my mom and dad. And, and that allowed me to be resilient or to, to, to get through a lot of things in life. And it wasn't so bad. And I appreciate this and that as a result of not having so much money. Yeah, that's a good point. Even in my own, again, anecdotally, you know, some, there were stretches months at a time where, you know, I just didn't see my mom a whole lot. And it wasn't because she was out doing her thing. It was because she was working two and three jobs at a time to make sure I never had to question whether it was food on the table or a roof overhead. And looking back on it now, and I think, you know, there's probably a lot of nights where my mom was in her bedroom by herself alone, crying herself to sleep and never making a sound that me or my sister could hear. Yeah, yeah, I would, I would, I would bet you are right. I think there's a big element to what you're talking about about here with, with just knowing yourself, right? Knowing what you want, knowing what you're after and then being willing to make those trades. But I am very interested as we, as we get closer to time here, what you would suggest to a man, maybe it's a, a first time marriage, maybe it's a second or third marriage with stepchildren and stepfather situation so that a man could help get his wife on board with understanding his contribution, although she may not fully understand his contribution to the dynamic of the marriage and the dynamic of raising children. Yes, very good, very important question. The most important single thing I can suggest is go to the chapter in the boy crisis where I talk about the differences between dad style parenting and mom style parenting and, and fill yourself with why your style parenting, your likelihood to tease more, your likelihood to encourage the kids to take risks more, you're likely to, to be okay with the children failing more, you're likely to be willing to rough house more, you're likely to do sports and activities with the children in which you actually participate, you're likely to beat the children at the sport when they're not focusing enough and letting them cry and come out the other side of that and still knowing that you were there for them. Dozens of things like that are differences between dad and mom style parenting on average, again, sometimes it's reversed. And then once you get those under your belt, do not treat them as this makes my style parenting better, but rather that this is a contribution that I offer. And let's talk about your contribution and let's put, let's get the best of both worlds together. So the children want to climb a tree, mom feels is too dangerous, maybe in a few years, dad feels it's not so dangerous. You know, the child should be allowed to climb the tree and mom and dad negotiate, okay, the child can climb the tree, but not be pass a certain point. And dad, you have to be out underneath the tree without your cell phone to get the child falls out of the tree. So you can you can push in the child. And then but dad has to know that climbing that tree increases risks. Risk is riskier and risk taking and knowing what risk to take and what risks not to take actually develops synapses in a child's brain, connects them that increases a child's intelligence IQ, literally IQ. And there's so much evidence to show that dad style parenting has something to offer. But to this day, I've never heard a dad say, you know, sweetie, I'd like to do some rough housing with the kids because I think it'll make the more empathetic. So counterintuitive. Yeah, so counterintuitive. And moms can't hear what dads don't say. And on the other hand, dads need to also listen to what mom's contributions are, you know, what the contribution of making sure that the child has you under the tree when she or he potentially falls, and that you're not focused on your cell phone, your focus on the child falling in your butt. On the other hand, you're not child telling the child everything to do. You know, what to do and what not to do as a mom is more likely to do. No, sweetie, don't go there. The dad is more likely to sit, let the child go there and learn from making a mistake that that was not the place she or he should have gone to. And so all of these things have our balancing acts. So once you understand, let's say, let me spend a moment with a with a mom who's a single mom, like your mom was. And so what to do if you are a single mom and you don't have that dad to balance this. Number one, ask yourself the question, can you get the biological dad involved again? And if the answer is no, ask yourself the second question of no men well enough to know that when men feel needed, wanted and valued, they almost always appear. Think, every generation had its war. When Uncle Sam said, we need you to be willing to die. So others can be saved and live. Every generation of men step forward with so when they were told they were needed, they were willing to die to serve, just like I doubtless you did in the military. And so if you tell a dad, I have learned what the value of your dad style parenting is. I didn't understand that before. The children need this to be part of their life and balance with me. I want to be able to do good communication training with you. So I can hear your contribution and have you hear my contribution. I do couples communication workshops all around the country exactly for this reason. If you don't have good communication, you tend to get a divorce. You don't have you get a divorce. There tends to be less father involvement, less father involvement. They're tends to be a boy crisis. They're all connected. And so the first job is to see if you can get the biological dad involved. If you can't get the biological dad involved, make sure your children are involved with the liberal arts of sports, which is basically team sports, pickup team sports, and individual sports like gymnastics that contribute to a team. But there's a lot of focus on discipline. And then make sure you make contact with the male coaches of your for your sons to make sure that the end for your daughters, to make sure that the female and your daughter and son has somebody in their life who can care for them that's male. But that's particularly important for your son because if you're a female and he's a male, and he has no option of another male role model that leaves him going oftentimes from a home to a school with very few female role models. And there's usually not a diversity of male role models at school, even there's usually a small number. And most of them are nurture a connector type of men rather than provide their protector men or coaches. And if you're not playing sports, you're not going to be introduced to them. Exactly, exactly. And so also make sure you get your children involved with faith based communities. And no matter what your faith is, make sure the person of the priest, the rabbi, the minister or the mom that he organizes your son into small groups with other boys his age, in which the boys learn to express their feelings confidentially to each other. So your boy sees that his insecurities are not the are not abnormal, that they're not not just alone. And so just spend time in the boy crisis book looking at all the things you can do to get your son to have a stepfather involved. Involving a stepfather does not mean your son is going to get the benefits of a stepfather. Learn the difference between the multiple types of involvements of a stepfather. So that allow the stepfather not to be just an advisor that's powerless, but to have an equal balance of power with you, even as a stepfather. I have so many more notes. I think we're going to have to do another one if you're open to it. Because I a couple of things that I want to talk more about with you at a future date is issues like same sex marriage. If there's a boy crisis, is there a girl crisis in the lack of fatherhood? I got so many questions. So if you're open to it, I'd love to have another conversation, but this has just been so valuable. And I've always appreciated our talks and of course your wisdom. And I heard John Jordan Peterson's podcast several, I think several weeks or a month or so ago, I read your book. I haven't read any of your others. Maybe I need to pick up a few of your others. I've only read the boy crisis, but I've been so enlightened and it's really helped me be a better parent, a better father for my children and leader in the community as well. Thank you very much. I really appreciate that. And so, and I, you ask great questions. You are personal. You connect to your real life. I so and then you listen really well. And so it's just a pleasure being interviewed by you and interviewing a little bit interviewing you as well. Yeah, you asked me some good questions as well. Is there any way good, good, good. I'd love to do that. Is there anywhere that you would direct the guys who are listening to be able to connect with you? Obviously pick up a copy of the boy crisis. Any other resources or directions you could give them in? Yes, one thing is I've gotten a lot of positive feedback to the audible version of the boy crisis from a lot of people who are, if you do commuting or you do, you know, you're on a treadmill and stuff doing exercises, often listening to the audible version is very much easier. If you're a reader of the the print version has the value of having all the 800 foot notes in the back and to be able to go over it a little bit more easily in that way. So don't shy away from whatever style allows you to learn the best. The boy crisis Amazon has it on sale now. But if you're if you have enough money, just support your local bookstore and that. Excellent. Well, we'll sync everything up. We'll let the guys know. And Dr. Ferrell, again, I appreciate you. Thank you for what you do. You're you're and I talked about this. Your background is just so diverse and so distinct, but I think it gives you a power that a lot of us may not quite have because we haven't seen it from both sides of the equation. And you certainly have. So really appreciate you taking some time with us today. Thank you. It's been a real pleasure working with you and talking with you. There you go, man.
