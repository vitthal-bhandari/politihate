    "text": " gents to continue our critical work revolving around the most pressing issues of society today. I have invited Mr. Brandon Tatum on the podcast this week and this is quite literally one of the most powerful conversations that we've had to date. Brandon Tatum is a former all American football player, police officer, and now political commentator. He's also the author of the upcoming book Beaten Black and Blue, which chronicles his time as a police officer and the tensions between police officers and the public. Today we talk about why the terms white privilege and toxic masculinity don't paint an accurate picture of what's really going on in society. America's place and position on the world stage, the power and undermining of the nuclear family, the modern males role in society, and the truth behind Marxist movements, including BLM. You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears and boldly charge your own path when life knocks you down. You get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, good to have you back or good to have you here on the Order Man podcast. My name is Ryan Mickler and I am the host and the founder of the movement to reclaim and restore masculinity, which is this what you're listening to right now, Order of Man. I want to thank you for all the support over the past couple of weeks. I mentioned last week that social media, Instagram, Facebook, even Apple podcasts are playing games with my account and with the podcast and with my reach. So for those of you who have shared and supported and and left a review and commented and tagged and all the things that you've done, the outpouring of support is very important to me and a testament to the value of the work that we're doing here. So I'm not going to go down without a fight, but I do ask that you continue to share tag mentioned. And if you would, very important that we, as the order focus heavily this week on reviews. So if you've not yet left a rating and review for the Order Man podcast on iTunes, Spotify, Stitcher, Pandora, wherever you're doing the podcast thing, please just go in, take two minutes, leave a rating review, give us a five star rating interview. It goes a very, very long way. And if thousands and tens of thousands of us go ahead and do that, we're going to be able to overcome some of what is happening with the quote unquote shadow banning, which that's a misnomer. It's not shadow banning, it's blatant banning. So support, lift us up, share, and we'll get through this, we'll keep spreading the good word, we'll keep fighting the good fight. And I appreciate your support on the path. Guys, before we get into this, just a quick mention of my friends over at Origin Main talking about support, these guys have been long term supporters. They believe in what we're doing. And I believe in what they're doing, which is manufacturing 100% made in a sort and sourced in America. So these are boots. This is denim that are working on a new, I think a pair of pants or shorts. I don't have all the details, but a very practical new pattern with pockets and pants that they're working on. They're always engaged in something. These are guys that I train with. These are my neighbors. I spend time with them. We go to barbecues and cookouts together, I believe wholeheartedly in what they're doing. So check it out. If you need a new pair of boots and or denim, check it out at origin main.com origin main.com and use the code order or D E R at checkout. Again, origin main.com use the code order. All right, guys, with that, let me introduce into my guest Brandon Tatum. This guy is so insightful. And in the wake of tremendous backlash after several of his videos have gone viral, I think one of his videos has been viewed over 70 million times. Listen to that. 70 million times. So what the guy talks about obviously resonates, but he's been willing to stand on his own two feet and behind his convictions. He's a former all American athlete. He's a top NFL prospect with the University of Arizona. But after going undrafted in the NFL, and we actually get into why that might be the case, he set a site on becoming a police officer, then gradually making his way into the political commentary arena. And is now featured on some of the top news outlets in the world. He's the CEO of three companies, the co founder of BLEXIT, an incredible voice for conservative values and principles. He also talks openly about his conversion to Christianity. We do get into that today and is never one to shy away from issues important to him and his views regarding culture and society. So there's going to be some things that may rile you up, some things that you may agree with. But ultimately, these are the conversations that need to be had. So please enjoy. Brandon, what's up, man? Great to connect with you. I've been following you for a long time. I appreciate it, Ryan. Thanks for having me on. Tell me about that shirt. I didn't say anything before we hit record because I wanted to ask you about that shirt once we were recording. So talk to me about that shirt you're wearing right now. Well, yeah, I don't know if it appears backwards, but it says Christ privilege. And pretty much what I do is I make these definition shirts that people can wear around and they kind of jogs people's understanding of certain topics. But Christ privilege, I don't believe in white privilege. I believe in Christ privilege. If you're a person that believe in God, then there's no door that a man can close that God is open for you. I can really appreciate that. I know I've got obviously a different perspective, which is interesting. It almost makes me cringe to say it, but I know I've got a different perspective simply because of the color of my skin. Like I said, it makes me cringe to say it a little bit because it comes across weird like that. But I think it's important we actually address these conversations, especially when it comes to terms that are being tossed around like white privilege. Right, I agree. What do you what do you think about that? Well, I know there's a lot of people who talk about it and say that just because of the color of my skin that I may have some advantages that maybe someone like yourself doesn't. Yeah, I mean, I think it's I think it's disingenuous. It's a disingenuous statement, you know, do people who have white skin have a level of privilege? I mean, there's there's there's privilege to go around for everything you can imagine. You know, sometimes white people have privilege. Sometimes black people have privilege over white people, depending on the circumstances. If you are good looking, you have a privilege. If you're a beautiful woman, you have a privilege. If you got money in the bank, and you got great credit, you got privilege. I mean, you can pick any, you know, segment of society or character, or characterization of a person or characteristics of a person, and you can find a level of privilege that they may have over another person. So I mean, just be this living in America, you have more privilege than mostly anybody in the world, even even the poor amongst us are considered to be wealthy in a lot of other countries. So I think that to use and isolate the where white privilege is is used to divide us, use to create division that does not need to be there. Yeah, I think that's a really good point. It is disingenuous, and it's applied so broadly that it doesn't take into consideration other little nuances or the fact that somebody else might have a privilege, so to speak, because they are better looking than somebody else like you had suggested. You know, I actually feel the same way when it comes to the term toxic masculinity. You know, I know, for example, that some men use, for example, physical strength to harm other people, but to apply this broad term of toxic masculinity and then to attempt to lump everybody in this category without considering the exceptions or the nuance to the term is a very dangerous proposition. Well, yeah, if you especially when you try to lump character, you know, I said keeps in characteristics, but when you start to lump in a person's traits or actions to something that's considered to be toxic and that's based on another person's opinion. We have, you know, been every since the bible days, you know, men have been going to war and conquering and developing and all of these different things. So to me, violence and war is not toxic. It is necessary in certain situations in order for us to either remain safe or create a situation like we've done in America where we have a free society or we can openly worship and it's probably the biggest melting pot in the world. So there is, you know, there's a time and a place for violence. Some people think it's toxic. I think it's appropriate within the confines of society that we live in. So I don't really buy into that toxic masculinity stuff. And like, I think, like again, I think people use wording like Black Lives Matter, Planned Parenthood, you know, they use words toxic masculinity. They use certain words to trigger a certain emotion in a person and the creation of that word or the idea behind it, in my opinion, is disingenuous. There's people just creating things because they either hate certain people or certain group of people. They want to hold them down. And then when you hear somebody talk about things like toxic masculinity, they don't have any relevant points. You know, it's not like they actually are pointing out things that are problematic in society on an epidemic level. They're talking about the fact that they don't like that men open a door for women or they don't like that men have more, you know, that stronger than women or maybe, you know, consider themselves to be more dominant in certain areas than women are. They somehow want men to be emasculated. So, you know, I really don't appreciate terms like that because I think they come from a bad spot. Or you know, the other thing I've seen is they'll take an isolated example. Let's say a woman is in a relationship, for example, that is abusive, physically abusive as an example. And then they'll apply that broadly. They'll say, see, masculinity is toxic. No, that that individual's behavior was toxic. Certainly. I think the overwhelming majority of us would agree with that. But I don't think that applies broadly to all men, you, me, anybody else who might be listening to this podcast. Yeah, I mean, people could argue that femininity is toxic. You know what I'm saying? You know, you have this culture of this accusations of rape and different things that are done maliciously to target people. And that's only applied. Women can only do that. Men don't get away with saying that a woman raped them and somehow they get some sympathy, whether true or not. But I think that women have that ability, you know, women control a lot of the, you know, men in sexuality. I mean, just be honest, sex sales and men are dumb enough to buy it. So women have a level of control there, at least in our society, they have a level of control on purchasing power by using their body to an advantage. I think that's toxic. I think some of, you know, but that doesn't describe every woman. My wife is not out there doing that. You know, it sure and that's why I married her. You know, I would marry a woman that's after selling her soul to make some money for somebody else or herself. So people, you know, it's a person, it's a personal opinion. You know, what's toxic? What's not toxic? That's my opinion. Some people make fortune off for doing that and they turn their life around and nobody ever knew they did it. You know, so it's really terms that are created that try to be the norm or try to force that into society as a normative thought. I think those things are problematic. Well, I'm glad you said the phrase you used is men and men are dumb enough to buy it. I'm actually really glad that you use that phrase because that puts a level of responsibility on our shoulders. So you'll hear about guys who complain about all these women on Instagram showing off their bodies and revealing too much and they'll complain about her say, oh, this is not healthy. And yet, you're the one following them. You're the one subscribed. You're the one buying their stuff. You're the one promoting them. That's why they do that. If the attention wasn't there, they wouldn't be so apt to do these things that you say you disapprove of. Right. It's a demand. It's a demand there. For sure. You know, they got this thing called only only fans, only friends or whatever it's called. But I think women, I don't know what people may do other stuff on there, but what it's known for from what I know is that people, I guess, sell six on there. They showed the body parts and do stuff for money and whatever. And you know, women wouldn't be in this mostly women. I'm assuming maybe men do it too. But I'm sure it is. Women wouldn't be able to do it in the proportionality that they do it if there wasn't a demand. Pornography in America is the same thing. You know, sex trafficking in America is the same thing. It wouldn't be prolific if there wasn't a demand. And most of pornography and things like that are associated with the demand coming from males, coming from men that are desiring to watch it, to consume it, to pay, I don't know, pay money for this stuff, strip clubs, all of these things, there is a demand. And so therefore, people end up being to the supply or there are other males that put women in these positions so that they can make money off of them. And somebody who's desperate or somebody who didn't grow up with a dad or who's lost or who has emotional damage may go into these fields and get manipulated. But the oneness is on the demand side. If men want to stop seeing women do certain things, then they need to stop demanding that that's something that's appropriate. That's right. So definitely I agree that there is a demand, but there's also a normalization of it in society, right? That women flaunting their body, for example, is some sort of sexual revolution or that pedophilia is another example, is somehow a sexual preference. And so there's this normalization of the sexualization of women. And then it becomes, I think, taboo initially. And then, okay, I'm curious about this. And so we explore it. And then ultimately it becomes accepted and even embraced as a culture in society, which I think is really destructive. I agree. And just like homosexuality, I think that that doesn't mean that a person is evil or a bad person if they fall into the homosexual lifestyle. But if we want to be honest, if a human being is somehow attracted to the same sex, there's something that's misfired in the brain, because that's not the evolution of humanity. That's not the natural affections of a person. That's not natural, because natural affections of a person is that you are to reproduce after your own likeness and the same thing with animals. If you saw a male lion in a cage or something or at the zoo, and the male lion tried to jump on the back of another male lion, you would be like, what's wrong with that animal? What's wrong with him? And I'm not comparing humans to animals, but what I'm saying is that we have now normalized people who are engulfed in a struggle. Some people are engulfed in struggle because of molestation, sexual perversion, exposure to sexuality, whether they have had negative experiences with the opposite sex. Some people are going through a tremendous struggle in that area. Instead of addressing it, instead of taking away the normalization of it, people are thrusting and celebrating people into a really dark place, where many people probably want to get out, but they can't because they have been thrusting into it. They've been told that you're born this way, it's normal for you to feel this way. And then on the back end of it, we see high rates of suicide and depression and stuff amongst people who are in their lifestyle. And it's not because other people put pressure on them, it's because the own internal battle of waking up one day and saying, man, I'll never have a family because I can't reproduce in the type of sexual environment that I'm in. And so I think that the normalization of a lot of things, transgenderism, somebody that is somehow a physically a man, but they don't see themselves as a man. That something has gone on in their mind, and I wish that we would take the time to offer up a solution for them. We live in America, you don't have to do nothing that you don't want to do pretty much, but I wish that we would have available solutions for people who do find themselves considered to be a struggle, and they want to find another pathway out of this mental state that they've been in. Yeah, I actually just wish we could have a conversation about it because it seems to me increasingly that doctors are coerced and manipulated, even at the risk of losing their license. ConsUG Capacity fragosais means your mechanism-to- Senisonion to more flexible chronic challenges. Revolution to gender determinant, those are right-to- license. That's a very slippery slope to go down. You know, if my son came to me and said, Daddy, I think I'm a girl, I mean, I'm not going to slap him across the head and scream at him and tell him go lift some weights. I'm going to talk to him about it because there's a reason why he feel this way that does not necessarily mean that the reasoning that he's initially feeling is the reasoning that he will once he have a conversation about it in the curiosity can be explained if someone will sit down and talk to him and say, you know, why do you feel like you're a girl or whatever the case may be because you want to be a cheerleader just because you want to cheer it don't mean that you're a girl. That's right. Just because you may not be attracted to women right now don't necessarily make you gay. You know, you know, you may be, you know, I tell people all the time, you know, there's decisions in life that you make and you don't always have to fall for your initial lust or what you, what you feel at the time. You can always say no to things. It's, you know, and I would tell my child is to have the conversation with him and say, look, you may be attracted to me. It doesn't mean that you have to date me and it doesn't mean you have to live a lifestyle like that. You may not have to. That's the same thing with a married man. Like you may see a woman that look real good, but that don't mean you got to go for it. That don't mean you're going to leave your wife or even though you may be more attracted to her. So there are desires that we have that we don't always have to, you know, succumb to. So and I think those conversations need to be had instead of affirming just some of these things are just completely ridiculous, like pronouns. Like, I mean, it's defined in English language in order to suffice a slippery slope of, I mean, it's a never in the cycle of confusion. You know, he, hers and them and them and they and I'm binary, but I'm her. It's like, you know, you're just going to go down and slippery slope of confusion and you're not going to have identity. You're not going to know who you are. You don't even know what to expect from yourself. So those things are important for us to slow down, not beat people over the head, have these, you know, genuine conversations with them. You know, I'm really glad you brought up the concept of language because I think it is being deliberately misinterpreted and redefined in order to push forward an agenda because you need to take men and women, for example, if man means nothing or I should say it this way, if man means everything, it actually means nothing and vice versa for the term woman. And so, you know, somebody, a man, for example, who believes himself to be a woman. Well, if, if woman means nothing, then do you really believe yourself to be a woman or you see what I'm saying? So it's a very interesting thing. And you talked about Black Lives Matter and you talk about these words and these phrases that we use that are, I think Ben Shapiro talks about it as being semantically overloaded. So it's hard to interpret or decipher the actual intent of the organization or movement or message that's being shared because we're using words that, you know, sound right, Black Lives Matter. Yeah, of course. I think everybody would pretty much agree. There's probably a very small percentage of the population who would not agree with that statement in and of itself. But generally, I think most people would say, yeah, that's, that's true. Black Lives, do you matter? Yeah, I mean, I, I, I, unless you're a white supremacist claim member or you a black person that live in the inner city and you gang bang out there and you've been responsible for killing and destroying your own black community. Maybe you don't think Black Lives Matter, but in a general sense, most black people or most people in America do agree with the sentiment. However, the organization has nothing to do with the mattering of Black Lives. Just like Planned Parenthood, Planned Parenthood is not planning a Parenthood. It's actually planning to destroy a Planned Parenthood. I mean, that's the majority of why people go to Planned Parenthood is to terminate a pregnancy. I mean, just, let's be honest, they're not doing full service. How do I know, how do you know, Mr. Tatum, because I was there, you know, my, my son's mom tried to have an abortion and I was in a lobby friend and she didn't do it. And, and, and they didn't give us any services after she made the decision not to have an abortion. They didn't give us any, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't win there again. You know, we went to an actual place where they gave us services and different things of that nature, but they do use linguistics. They use words to trick your emotions and they have another plot in an agenda. It's the same way they use with pronouns, you know, the same people that are saying, you need to acknowledge my pronouns. I'm them and they and I'm non-binary, but these are the same people that are pushing for the gender wage gap to be resolved. Well, well, if there's no gender, if gender is a construct of the mind, then what are you talking about that there's a gender wage gap between male and female? I thought that what about non-binary? Where does their wage gap? It goes into a slippery slope of people really insecure individuals looking for a way to divide or to isolate themselves and make their victimhood a little more prominent. But I think in our society, for the people who are aware, we need to really watch out for these words because they may not necessarily represent what the efforts are being pushed forward. Do you think people are using this linguistic little game they're playing here as a medium to push forward an agenda or are they ignorant to the fact of how things really work? What is the ultimate purpose of using these words to confuse and manipulate and gray out some of these areas that seem to me to be pretty black and white? All right, man, let me just take a quick break. Give us a time out on the conversation very quickly. As I announced last week, my son and I are launching a new podcast called Man in the Making. And when I say we, what I really mean is that he, my son, is launching a new podcast. And this is designed to give you as a father and your son or sons an outlet for conversations and topics and tools that you need to usher your young man into manhood. Very few people are talking about it outside of what we're going to be doing here. This is entirely new. We're testing it out. We're going to see how it works. And I have faith that he's going to do a great job. And I have faith that it's going to be a valuable resource for you. But he's going to be talking about all the uncomfortable topics with me that you dread having, but realize the importance of and speaking directly to your sons about what they can do as young men to become the men they're capable of becoming. So if you want to learn more and you want to be among the first to be notified when we go live, we're going to be doing some giveaways and things like that for reviews and listens and whatnot, please head to orderman.com slash man in the making. Again, that's orderman.com slash man in the making that will be launching in the next two to three weeks. And we are building this empire and continuing along the trend of giving you the information that you need to become a man and to help your sons do the same. Again, orderman.com slash man in the making. You can sign up after the conversation. For now, let's get back to it, Brandon. Yeah, I think the founders of these organizations, the leaders of the organization, they have a totally different plot than what they're presenting to the public. And then people are ignorant and they fall in the cycle of it. You know, Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood was a eugenicist. She hated black people and she wanted to use population control. And now nowadays. How do you know that? Is that something that she said that it's been documented that she's okay? It's on record of her making statements against black babies and literally saying, why would you bring a baby in the world that is pretty much to have a have the perfect life? And that's not the way you should think about life. You know, you can't say just because I'm poor, don't mean I can't have children. I can't love children. I cannot raise children. Because I don't have an optimum situation. Margaret Sanger on record, it's played in the movie Uncle Tom that I'm in. It's a documentary. But we have a clip of her just saying it straight out that why would you bring it's evil to bring a child in the world if you are at a certain level of poverty or whatever the case may be, which I don't think is reasonable. But that she's not God and she's not the one to judge that. However, that is the reasoning behind a lot of her practices. And it was also said that she was racist against black people. And that was her reference point was poor black people in that situation. So you know, you have Planned Parenthood founders who have an agenda. But the people that go there are like, Oh, I just want to, you know, save my career. It's my body, my choice. And they don't even know the initial purpose of it. Black Lives Matter, a Marxist organization, the founders of black lives matter. So proclaimed Marxist organization proclaimed is not even it's not speculative. They self-proclaimed Marxist and you look at their website, they want to destroy the nuclear family. I mean, these are all principles of communism and Marxism and things that are destroying the country. Yet they try to disguise it as black lives. Yet they only care about black lives that can make them money that get killed by a white police officer because in inner city where people are dying just this weekend, a hundred shootings in Chicago, they won't even post condolences. Children are dying. I mean, it's over. I think it's over a hundred kids. Not, I mean, I say that. I think it was 30 the last time I did a video about it. It was over 30 kids. It's probably 50 kids at this point that have been murdered in inner city violence. I mean, kids, I'm talking about month olds. It's my five year old six year olds. We've helped out on my channel. We've supported at least two children that have died. So Carly Turner was one. We donated $300,000 to her family. But you know, she was a little girl. I think she was like six years old and she got murdered in black lives matter wouldn't even post a picture of her. They won't even acknowledge it. So when you look at it, the Marxist, you know, ideology that is stimulating all of these things. And when you see them in action, you say, okay, I know exactly what they're doing. And I think the same thing is for the Democrat party. It's like, they don't care about people coming over our border. They don't care about it. You know, people coming from the southern border need an opportunity. They can care less because if they care, they would really put an end to this illegal migration because what happens? They bring children over here on a company. Coyotes are taking them over here to get paid by the cartel. They rape these kids on the way over here. They rape women on the way over here. I mean, it's not a secret. There's sex trafficking kids over here. It is a money making industry of the cartel and Mexican officials that are, I mean, not Mexican officials, but Mexican police that are involved in this. They are funneling these kids over and making lots of money. And we know it. Our government knows it. We catch the people who are fun or trafficking these children. But we don't want to do anything about it is because the Democrats, by and large, in my opinion, they want a persona of we care about you. Come be a new voting block for us. We'll give you amnesty. We don't care how you get here. We don't care. You know, you're getting people lying dead in the middle of the desert trying to get to Arizona and stuff in the heat of the summer. They don't care about you. And you know, they just need they just need the votes. They just need the power and based on what I see. You know, how do you know? Where does that, where does that conclusion come from? Because, you know, I know that there's a lot of people who actually do care about those individuals. I'm one of them. You know, I feel for a father who has children, for example, or a wife who is in a less than great environment and chooses to look at the American way of life and the American dream and the opportunities that we have here. And if I was a father, I'd be doing the same thing. And so I look at that with a level of empathy. I agree that we need to do this legally and we need to make sure that it's all regulated. But what makes you come to the conclusion that it's a devious intent versus an honorable and noble intent? Because you can see the flip-flop in policy. You can see the flip-flop in language. You know, when, you know, I think it was Hillary Clinton was running against Trump or before that election, when Obama was in office, Obama said it out his mouth, do not come here. It's not safe. The Democrats were saying, do not come here. They were blaming Republicans of using cheap labor and manipulating these people that would come over here. They pay them under the table. So Democrats had a terms perspective and they were blaming Republicans for it. And now the Democrats are saying, please come, please come over here. And our ICE officials and people are arresting sex traffickers all day long. And think about it like this, we have had a Congress for, I don't know how many years whether they are Democrat, Republican, both sides are responsible for this to a certain degree, why haven't they fixed our immigration policies? They are being prejudiced towards certain people that do need help because what about people in Africa? They can't just get on a boat and cruise over here. They're letting people flood in from South America. And think about this, we were just in the COVID crisis, but they let people come in the country that's not even vetted. They're not even, they're not taking vaccines. We don't know if they have COVID or not. They don't care. We let in a whole swath of people flood our southern border with no kind of protection for the American citizens. Then you talk about social distancing and wearing masks. They put them in a facility where they're not social distancing. They're laying on top of each other during the epidemic and during the pandemic. So when you look at it, you say, why haven't y'all fixed the policies? You know, legally coming over into our country, you can accept more people into our country. You can make it easier to file for asylum. And you know, you don't have to separate families at the border if they come seeking asylum at a point of entry. So you know, all of these things as a citizen, observant person, you can see that this is what they're doing. They create these places called sanctuary cities and sanctuary states. And it's like, well, no, there's people, MS-13. Like, are we not talking about MS-13? Are we not addressing the fact that these kids are coming over here and these people, these males and these adults with them are not even their parents. They don't even know where their parents are at. So once they get over here and they're out in America, who's going to take care of them? We can't even take care of our own kids in America, American citizens. You know, so when you look at the totality of circumstances, you say, man, this is a very disingenuous approach. And if any one side wanted to do something about it, they could actually do something about it. How about we go into their country and give them better opportunities? They don't have to come to America if we can help them and build something for them in their own country. But we are not going to take them anywhere. Do you think that's prudent or wise to go into other countries, for example, and offer our help and assistance? I mean, I was in the military and I saw situations where we would, you know, exert our ideals regarding democracy and other environments. And it didn't seem like it went all that well because we don't fully understand different cultures and history and the animosity and contention. And it seems to me that it creates sometimes in cases a greater problem than how we just left things alone. Like where is our obligation in the world seen and where does it end? Yeah, that's a great question. You know, I may sound like a conspiracy theorist, but I never, a lot of times I don't think our government have good intent to start with. You know, they send you over there to do, you know, work in the community and try to help out the people that they're there to conquer, they're there to push and get people elected that our government want to be elected, you know, and that's why a lot of countries hate us because we down there interfering in their elections, you know, with the under the guise of people building tents for people. And it's like, no, we want oil. That's why we came over here to be honest, weapons of mass destruction. We know they know they lied. It was no weapons of mass destruction. And so if we actually made an earnest attempt to do it, maybe we could be effective, but we're not in the business of helping people out unless it benefit us. I mean, I hate to say it, but our country has a reputation of doing that. And like I said, we won't give efforts in some of these places where they may be seeking help. I mean, we've helped destroy a couple of places that will be economic booms. We have propped up a communist or socialist dictators, I mean, Cuba and other places, you know, we've propped them up Venezuela. We prop them up. Some of our government officials are cheering on these guys. And then now that people are starving and money means nothing in some of these countries. And what are we doing now? We just turn a blind eye, you know? So I think if we had earnest attempt of doing that, we can be successful. However, we have to really understand this. And I think that if we apply this to our own family, is that you can't save the world and you can't do good in the world. If you can't even take care of your own home. And so what is the point of bringing in a million people a year when there's a billion people starving? You're not even making a dent in around the country. However, you're putting a strain on your own country and you have people in California that are sleeping in the road. They have mercy. You know, homelessness is out of control in many major cities. Poverty is, you know, something to be concerned about. Education, we're the dumbest, one of the dumbest countries on planet Earth. So it's like, we really need to focus on our own house. Like I do with my child. I focus on my own kids. I can help other people, but I have to be stable here. And then I can reach out to help people. I don't just let people come in my house, you know, unvetted, you know, and if I can't deal with this, I'm not going to be successful out dealing with other people's issues. You know, Brandon, I think one of the biggest challenges with what you're saying here is that again, the overwhelming majority of people, I think, would agree with you that we need to take care of our own. We need to make sure we're taken care of and established and set. And then we can help from there. And not only can we help, we'll be in a better position to help if our stuff is taken care of. It's hard though, because people see it so differently, you know, take parenting, for example, the way that I raise my four kids is probably similar to the way that you raise your children, although there's probably some differences. You know, somebody across the street or somebody on the other side of the country is going to raise their kid differently because they're seeing it differently. We all agree, hey, we want to take care of ours in our own. And yet the way that we go about doing it, there might be some conflict there. And that contention, I think, is what ends up stalemating us in a lot of ways. Yeah. And yeah, you're right. I mean, I have to be open to say that people have a different perspective. You know, I'm more on the absolute truth side of it. You know, there's a reasonable way to raise your children. And then there's a terrible way to raise your children. That's why they grew up and be criminals. And out here, active the fool, you can't control them. You know, if you give your kid everything, everything is free. They don't have to work for anything. No accountability, no responsibility. Oh, they're just kids. They just do whatever they want to do. They become that adult. And I think that, you know, that goes back to the way our country operates too when it comes to law enforcement. You know, some people want to defund the police and create public programs. And it's like, no, there needs to be law enforcement because if you just let people run rampant, what do you know, crime rate is up 800% in Portland, 100%. And it's like, it's like not disciplining your children and then expecting them to somehow figure it out on their own. There needs to be a level of discipline. There is a right and wrong way within reason. You know, like I said, you and I may be similar in parenting. We may have some differences, but we're not way over here in left field, you know, uh, parenting our kids, you know, like their, like their animals, you know what I'm saying? So right. I think to a certain degree, there's relatively a right and the wrong way to do a lot of these things. Yeah, I agree with that. And you know, since we were talking about privilege earlier, there's also another privilege that often gets overlooked. And that's fatherhood privilege. You know, that the fact that a young woman or a young man could grow up without or excuse me with a father in his life is a huge privilege that I realized not every child gets unfortunately. Yeah. And, and, you know, at the end of the day, people have to look in the mirror, you know, and, and say, what am I going to do about it? Either you be the father that needs to be in their child's life, look in the mirror and suck it up and make sure you're there despite the drama and chaos. Or if you're a child or you grew up without a father, you make the best of it. Don't let that be a crutching and excuse. Whatever. When you look at the grand scheme of things, it should be incredibly important for people to make positive decisions when having children. Because a lot of times people look at the father and say, Oh man, the father is a dead beat. Well, the mama was sleeping with the father who was a dead beat. She put him in that situation as well. Or, you know, mom left dad or whatever and broke up with him or mom has multiple kids by different men who for whatever reason, they're not involved. Whether they be bad guys or not. Or you have situation. I'm not just blaming women because men need to take responsibility. But you know, you have a woman who have a child and she feels entitled and the man has no rights and she creates drama for the man and it's hard for him to see his child. They play games and drama and eventually a man says, look, I'm moving on and start my own family and I can't deal with the drama anymore from this person. Therefore, father's not involved in this particular woman would celebrate and say, look, I'm this proud single mom and I did it all by myself. But they don't even acknowledge how the kid feel about it. You know, they had themselves on the back, but the kid is struggling wondering where my daddy's at. So, but I think in the culture where we accept this notion of, you know, fornicating and having children out of wedlock and it's just totally normal, I mean, we put women in the position to be empowered to do these things. Therefore vicariously, we're allowing men to get off the hook, especially with abortions and all these other programs that we have. It's like, I said, the point. Like, if you were a responsible man and you had, you know, you, I call it play video games, you play video games with a woman, y'all have a kid, you know, and you're not responsible and you're deadbeat, you could just walk away. Why? Because her options are government assistance, do about herself or have an abortion. You don't have no responsibility. But if those weren't options, a lot of men will be forced to step up and I think a lot of women will make better decisions about the dudes that they're with. You know, I almost have no, I feel sorry for no woman that wasn't married. If that man didn't love you enough to marry you, you shouldn't be sleeping with him. And so I have no sympathy and I have no sympathy for men who weren't married and even included myself. I wasn't married when I had my first son and I've been through hell for 11 years now. So, but I don't blame nobody but myself. But anyway, that's another story. But fathers being involved is incredibly important and I wish our society would push that more. You know, it's funny because you say, I don't have any sympathy, but I would actually contend with that a little bit because the message that you share and the things I've heard you talk about, even in the past several minutes, maybe it's not sympathy, but you are trying to spread a message of truth and one that's empowering to other people. I think we've as a society and just generally, not everybody, but generally equated, making people feel good about their temporary decisions or their desires is somehow an indicator of our love. But I would suggest that if you're willing to have difficult conversations, if you're willing to challenge unhealthy assertions and assumptions, that that's a greater indicator of I care about you, then let me affirm all the bad choices you're making. Right, right. I think that, you know, maybe me saying that I don't have any sympathy is probably not explained in its totality. I don't have any sympathy for a person playing a victim if they're in that situation. I have sympathy for the person in general because people make mistakes. You know, you're young, you're young. But if a person want to say, oh, look poor me, you know, I'm a single mom and it's like, well, you know, don't make excuses for it. You know, you need to be aware that you had 100% responsibility in making the decision to be with a man that was not committed to you or that he was a nut before you met him. You know what I mean? Like one day he woke up and he was a bad person. He was bad to you when y'all were, you know, up in the bedroom. So when I say sympathy, it means I don't have sympathy for a person playing a victim. I do have sympathy for a person who made a mistake and they want to get on the right path and they need some words of encouragement. You fight through it until you make it make it better. Same thing. I was safe for young men that was in the position and I was in, you keep fighting 11 years later. I keep fighting. I keep fighting. I'm going to make the best of the situation and then we'll be okay. But if a young man come and cry to me and say, man, this messed up. What's happening to me? Were you married? Well, no, I went with it. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Why are you, why are you, why are you sleeping with a person you're not married to? You're not committed to. This is what happens to you. So don't don't cry to me. I'm not going to feel sorry for you, but I will say, let's, let's pick up your boots, put your boot straps up and let's go and let's make it better. Do the best that you can, but it ain't, it's no time for a pity party. Yeah, I appreciate that perspective and I think the world needs more of that, frankly, especially that, that's what I would call fathering. It isn't always nice. It isn't always comfortable, but it's real. It's genuine. It can be in your face and it can be uncomfortable, but it comes from the right place. And that's what it sounds like it is for you. Don't complain to me. Let me tell, teach you how not to be a victim. Let me teach you how to make better choices. That to me is a better indicator of care. Yeah, 100%. I mean, that's how my dad treated me. Is that, is that part of the reason that you became a police officer? Tell me a little bit about your story coming off your, your, your, your careers and athlete and then moving into law enforcement. Yeah. I mean, law enforcement was just rant and was random. You know, for me, it was random. Maybe God had a plan in the first place, but for me, it was random. You know, I was an athlete my whole life. You know, I was an all American football player at a high school of top player in the nation. I had scholarship to every university that I, that I want to go to except Texas, University of Texas. I was, my brother was a longhorn. So I was, that's where you want it. That's where you wanted to go. That's where I wanted to go. And they were the only team. I mean, I was an all American. I was a number one safety. I was, some say I was number one, number two in a nation. Texas didn't offer any defensive backs in my class. They offered like six of them in my brother's year. He was an all American a year before me. Is that right? So, you know, I was devastated like Texas, you know, how do you put me? Come on now. Then back or something. Y'all could do something. I've been the longhorn fans since I was in the seven grade. I just go to the camps every year. Y'all, how dare you? But then I decided to go and play for the University of Arizona because Coach Stu was there, half of the roster was from Texas. I know a lot of people there. So I played there in football, just didn't turn out the way I wanted to. And I was a tremendous athlete. I ran a four, three and a 40. Had a 44 inch vertical leave. You know, I could do the bench 32 times. I was a freak athlete. There was no athlete as far as numbers that was even close to me. And I did that as a freshman. I was a freshman in college. And so as an incredible athlete, I thought I was going to the NFL. My character wasn't good enough. The coaches and I didn't vibe. We were on a, we were a losing team, you know, so all of the factors were in place. I was at a very low point and I got saved in 2008. I went to church. I got baptized in Jesus name filled with God's spirit. And that just revolutionized my life. It really did. I stopped cursing. I stopped listening to rap music. I just had a different perspective on life on race. I mean, God just opened me up to a lot of things. So fast forward, I was in the 2010 NFL draft. So I went to college in 05 in 2010. I was in the NFL draft, had a draft party by agency that I was going to get drafted by the Oakland Raiders. They passed on me in front of my whole family. We were always meeting the draft and they passed and I was devastated man. Tried out for another year, whole year of training, NFL lockout. The very next year I was to try with the coaches, NFL lockout happened. I couldn't even perform in front of the agents. I think I still trained a little bit and tried out for semi-protein, which I got an offer for. It was the Omaha night Hawks at the time they had offered me to come to Minicamp. However, I had met a guy who was an incredibly successful businessman. He mentored me through the process. This is the process when I had my son. He mentored me through the process and told me to put an X on the calendar for football. When it's not yielding results, man, you got to move in a different direction. He gave me this whole speech about how football players are rich. But he said of himself, I'm wealthy. If you're the top of the game, you may make a couple million dollars a year. I make millions of dollars a year for the rest of my life. He's an incredible entrepreneur. He's our own private jet and all these other things. So it really stuck to me. I said, I need to make a decision. I apply for everything in the city of Tucson. Police department was one of them. I never thought about being a cop. Eventually they called me back. At first, I was like, mine in trouble? They like, you're a pop of the job. I'm like, okay. So I said, let me do a ride along because I have no idea what I'm talking. I have no idea what I'm saying. I did a ride along and it just blew me away. Officer Sean Payne, which he's in the book that I wrote about policing in America. He just blew me away. I couldn't believe that this man was doing this stuff every day. I mean, this is this is superhero stuff. You know, I was on the ride along. I only did half a shift and we went from changing the old lady. Yeah, elderly lady. I don't like to say old lady, but the other ladies tire to like saving a guy who was committing suicide. He was actively cutting his wrist when we showed up to the scene. Like really? And Sean wasn't phased. He got back in the car and we were just talking and I'm just like, dude, I'm like, my heart is still racing from us driving over here. Like you didn't done all this and you back in the car acting like nothing happened. Like, bro, are you even human? And I'm like, and I'm so like shook. And then I'm like, it's no way he does this every day. That's just like no way. And so I asked him like, you do this every day. He said, I do this every day. Like this. I do it. I was blown away. Like I had never seen a person that I looked at and I said, and this dude is a real hero. Like these football players are cool. You know, it's some sacrifice and some hard work, but like, right? We're not doing this. And I said, you know, I want to be that guy. So I finished the application. I performed really well. I was at the top of the class and I became a police officer. You talked about your character being off when you were playing football in college. What do you mean by that specifically? Man, I grew up in what I would consider violent environment, man. You know, I had a violent attitude. I actually got kicked out of high school in my senior year after I committed to the University of Arizona. I got kicked out of high school because I threw a chair at a teacher and to be honest, I was going to fight her. If it was if it was, and she was a woman, I was going to beat her up. If she wasn't, if it wasn't for my friend who was holding me back to play football with me, they ended up kicking me out of school. They brought me back after three or six weeks. I can't remember if we appealed it or not, but they, they, I was in alternative school and then they brought me back, which was good because I went to finish running track because, you know, I was an all American football player. I couldn't be at alternative school. So they ended up bringing me back and, and, and, but, but man, my attitude was still very violent, man. I used to listen to rap music. I grew up, you know, my cousin then was all gangster. You know, I got jumped in the gang when I was like 10, you know, my cousin, you used to fight each other all the time, you know, and so I just, I just grew up around that, man. I just felt I was a very violent young man. I had a good heart, but like, if you say the wrong thing to me, I get offended. I was emotional. And so when I got to college and the coaches were yelling at me, man, I was not taking it well, you know, like I went to fight him and stuff. I wasn't, you know, you know, you ain't a military, you know, I, in the military, you go to boot camp, you can't take it personal, you know, it's just like yelling to you. Yeah, it isn't personal. It feels like it is. Yeah. Yeah. It's a game, you know, they, they may, it may make you feel that way. You may feel like they, they hate you and they want to kill you, but, you know, it's, it's just a, it's a thing that they're playing to develop you. But when I was, you know, I didn't know nothing about this. And I got to college and they were calling me names and stuff. I was, my mom was like, no, I'm going to fight these guys. Like, you know, it was never talked disrespect me like that. And so that wasn't a good fit. And that kind of led to my career and I really going into the direction I wanted to go in. Yeah. Do you think that that, that violent upbringing and personality was drawn out by the people you're with? It sounds like your dad was around and it sounds like, I mean, you, you already alluded to some things that he had taught you that I think were healthy. But where did, where did that response to some of these things come from? Yeah, I could say, my mom was pretty, pretty violent. You know, she was a very violent person. You know, she's a great person. She loved me and my brother to death that she'll do anything for us. And I hope she don't get offended, but she was, she was very violent, you know, like, she fight people and, you know, that's the way it was, you know, her and my step. My mom got it to a physical fight. You know, we were in middle school right in the front yard. And, you know, cause my momma grew up around violence, you know, my grandmother actually had my mom at 12 years old and at 12, well, she got raped by my grandfather. And, you know, my grandmother got rid of her grandfather and she had my mom at 12 years old. So she can't read. She still to this day, she can't read. Or back then when you, if you had a child, you couldn't go to school and then we're in on top of that real poor and my family was illiterate. So it's not like anybody taught her to read. So even today in 2021, she can't really read anything. So, and my grandfather is in my, I call him my grandfather because he was, he was with my grandmother since she was 16, but my original real grandfather passed away. But my grandfather, I could really be, he's in a, he retired military. He got out because he had PTSD and, you know, he can read. So that's the only way she could survive is because he knows, he knows how to read. But, you know, growing up around that, and my cousins, a couple of my family was doing life in prison, you know, I just, it wasn't my dad. It was, it was really like peers. And then it was rap music because that's, I just, you know, you listen to Tupac and you have all of that stuff cycling in your system and in your brainwash yourself with all this violent music subconsciously. And so with all of that, it's easier for you to, you know, what I call flash off on people. You know, you get offended, you get emotional and you start living out, the stuff that you've been brainwashing yourself on and the stuff that you're seeing as a young man and, you know, you know, letting nobody punk you. You can't let anybody disrespect you. And that's kind of where it came from. It was less likely my dad, I mean, my dad was pretty, he was respectful, but my dad, you know, we get out of line, he'll tear you up, man. Like we got many weapons and that was violent, you know what I'm saying? So, I think some of that kind of led to the, to the aggressiveness that I had, which made me good at football, you know, so. No doubt. Yeah, if you can control and channel that anger and that aggression, it makes you, yeah, it makes you significantly better athlete. You have that competitive edge, you know, and I, and I, I've trained you, Jitsu and other things with guys who, you know, have it and other guys who don't. Some guys can turn it on and off. Some guys have no control of it whatsoever. Yeah, that mentality certainly makes you good in one aspect of life, but it doesn't necessarily translate over in a healthy manner into other aspects of your life. True. It sounds like you have broken the chain maybe a little bit or, or, or deviated courses in a good way. Do you feel like that? And how do you feel about the direction that you've taken your life? And now of course your family as well. Yeah, I feel like God separated me, you know, like, you know, I was, I didn't want to leave Texas, you know, my whole family lives in Texas. I just was never going to leave Texas, no matter what happened, never. I don't think I ever visited a place outside of Texas. I think we went to the Grand Canyon at some one time, but, you know, I was never going to leave Texas, but I felt like God set me up to go to the University of Arizona so I can get away from the environment I was in and learn something new and see the world from a different perspective. Like I grew up with just everything being about black people, you know, in an Afro-centric perspective. All my family's black, every concern that I thought was realistic was just from, from the perspective of being black, you know, all the other concerns. Yeah, I mean, the, the police hate you. White people hate you. You got to work three times as hard as anybody else to be successful in life. You know, you're never going to make it to the top. They're never going to be a black person in this position because white people always have this cloud over you and people follow you around in the store. And like, like, that's what you were being taught. Did you, so did you experience that or was your experience different than what you were being conditioned to believe? Well, some of it was, so this is how I figured that I'm grown and I see you look back on it is that I created them think those things in my mind because that's what I believe was true. So if I see some white person look at me, I'm like, oh, you just look at me because I'm black, you know, I mean, I have no idea why they look at me. I got put over by cops at least twice when I was in high school. And now I look back as a police officer, they were actually incredibly nice. They didn't even give me a ticket. And the law would have done the same thing. That was a real law, you know, and, and, and, but when at the time, I was like, I mean, that cop just racist, you know, they put me over because I'm black. They don't want to see a black man driving a, I had a Mustang. I didn't want to see a black man driving a Mustang. And I'm like, when I'm a game cop, I'm like, cops make a pretty good money. Like a Mustang is not a significant car to a police officer. And if the guy wanted to be a jerk, you gave me a ticket, you know, like, right, right, go to court and brought me, I had all kinds of problems, but I never got a ticket, even when I got put over, you know, so except me and my brother was weaving on a freeway one time, we were kind of like racing on a freeway and we got put over. And I think one of us got a ticket and they end up being thrown out. But, you know, so it was all created in my mind and it became my reality. I did not have to work five times as hard as anybody else to be successful. No, that wasn't true. And when I got to college is when I realized like, dang, like white people really don't, they are not that concerned about black people like I thought they were like, there's not one person on campus that have ever been racist to me. My teachers love me one reason because I was an athlete, but in general, never had a problem with any of my teachers. I go to the TA or, you know, it was it was never an issue. I had I started to develop white friends that were cooler than my black friends. It was like, man, I'm just I think I've been living under in a real weird place. And it was when I got away from it. And I got saved. I started seeing the world differently. I stopped looking at race when I got saved. I was like, you know, we all guys children, you know, we, what is this race thing? Nobody cares. You know, only it's you the good person or bad person. You know, good people don't care about it. Bad people do. And you know, at the end of the day, we're going to all have to answer the God. So I mean, that that's kind of what really changed my trajectory. It's it's interesting that you're saying nobody cares because I've felt that way. And it's not to say that I don't acknowledge that your skin, for example, is a little darker than mine. Like, obviously, you know, we can see that. But I've always thought, hey, this isn't a this isn't a big deal to me. This isn't something I care deeply about. And yet I've been told by, you know, mainstream media and society that well, that actually is also an indicator that that's your racist. It's like everything is right. You know, whatever, whatever I do, or don't do like everything is is painted in this corner of being a racist. It's very, very interesting and frustrating, quite frankly. Right. Therefore, you could tell how disingenuous these conversations are because, you know, they have this plot of the bookie man, the white racist bookie man. That's, it's not real because when you think about it, they say, okay, racism is real in the matter. Well, you hardly ever see real examples of racism. I mean, you could do one every now and again, some nut job. That's a complete nut. It's not a normal person being raised a nut job. And you see that and they go, Oh, look at racism. And you say, okay, there's not a lot of issues with race. We don't have a lot of examples. Oh, it's systemic. Yes. That means that we don't have to identify any one place. We just say it's in systems. What was system? The court system? Well, what judge? What evidence do you have? So let's get rid of that judge. Oh, no, no, no, it's systemic. It's even behind the judge. And the judge says, I'm not racist. I've never done anything racist. No, you don't, but you don't know it. You're racist, but you don't know it's subconscious. It's implicit. You're like, bro, it is a never ending lie. It's just not true. And like, most people in general don't care about race because it's so insignificant to everyday survival. Like a regular person as white in America, you know, majority of the time, you probably don't most white people are probably not around black people like that because typically even in America, we still like, it's kind of segregated there. Why are you segregated? People, black people, typically live around black people. I grew up around black people. I never saw white people like, other self crack heads that you come in the community and by drugs and police officers, that's about it. That's the only white people that was in our community. So, you know, most people are like, they just want to go to work, man. They go to work. They're trying to feed their family. They're trying to figure out this life. Some people trying to find their way with God. And most of the time, it's not a big issue. However, the manipulation in the mind through black people create this. So if a cop beat up a black man, it's not that the guy's a bad cop, it's that he's racist. It's like, no, the guy's a bad cop. I mean, he'd be white guy up that way. You know, and so it's very weird. When I was a cop, I never saw a racist cop. I saw cops who were racially insensitive, you know, but I never saw racist cop. I never saw anybody overtly racist. We just didn't have time. Like, that's the most miserable life ever as a person to be a racist cop because you got to go save the black people. When they call 911, my husband just beat me up. You can't just say, I'm going to that one because he's black. You got to go. And then if your husband is on his way back to the house with a gun, you can't say, well, I'm not going to I'm not going to intervene in that because I don't like black people. You're going to have to put your life in danger over black people all day long, especially if you live in like the South South Chicago, where it's majority white black community, you are literally risking your life in saving and dying for black people all day long. So the concept is just it's all manipulation to me. Now, there are some racist white people I hear. There's racist, of course, no doubt, there's a racist black. I would argue that there's more racist black people than racist white people. But there's a credible amount of racist people on either side, man, Hispanic people hate black people. I mean, when I was growing up black and Hispanic lived in a similar community, and we hate each other. Black people hate white people. You know what I'm saying? Like, when I was growing up, and they nobody talks about this because they feel like black people can't be racist, when I was growing up, you know, my grandmother, them used to hate white people, you know, and, and, you know, those same stereotypes when I was young, you can't, you can't date a white girl, you a seller, your uncle Tom, you sell out your race. Yeah, I was wondering if you probably get that to this day, I bet more than you can probably imagine or I could anyways. I have never gotten a white person personally. I mean, I think I think my wife may have got a comment from a white person, but I have never gotten a comment from a white person saying anything about me marrying a white woman. My wife is white. I get comments all day from black people. Then I hate my people. I'm selling that. That's why I went and married that white woman. It's like racism in the black community is very prevalent. I mean, just look at BLM. That's a organization of racist racism. But there are racist people in every aspect of life. It's not excluded to, or exclusive to any race. It's just a spirit of evilness that's in people that caused them to lash out in different forms. You've talked about your path with God and Christ as changing the trajectory of your life. Is that the biggest factor? Why you are where you are? What do you attribute to that? A hundred percent. The God changed me. That's what it was. My attitude, everything, you just changed the way I look at things and I see God has a path for me. It's not just me out here along with just trying to figure that out. It's like, no, man, be patient, keep working hard, be a person with accountability, with integrity. The tips are going to follow where God wants them to follow. If they don't follow the way you want them to, just know that there's a plan and that there's something better. In that fail, I'm glad I didn't make it to the NFL. People probably laugh at me. I'm glad I made it to the NFL. I'm far more successful now than I would have been if I made it to the NFL in a general sense. Unless I was Tom Brady, which is even less of a percentage point because I was a defensive back and they come with Domino doesn't. I'm way more successful. I have way more influence. Financially, I'm stable than most of my NFL friends. They still, they trying to figure out their life. I'm in my stride. I've been able to influence people in a way that I would have never been able to influence people and also my own perspective, getting outside of that toxic situation I was in and growing up in a certain community to now being open to conservatism. Every since I realized what conservatism was and that I'm a conservative. I've been free ever since. I've been free. I've been blessed. I make the most money I've ever made. I make the most friends. I feel like I'm a part of the American fabric and I never felt like that until I pretty much realized that I'm a conservative. Dang, the conservatives think just like I think all these people are very inspiring. We believe in capitalism. Make as much money as you can and help as many people as you can. I employ so many different people and I pay them very well. I give them bonuses. I love on them. I care about their families and that's what it's all about. It's not about the government. It's about individuals taking control. I will treat the people that work with me. I like to say they work with me. I'll treat them better than the government, whatever, treat them because the government is nameless and it doesn't care about you. It's only after it's on agenda. But as a person, I love the people that work with me and I support them and I want to build an empire where I could support as many people as I can. That's powerful. Such a powerful perspective. You said that God has a path for you or something along those lines. I don't want to put words in your mouth. If you were to be able to define or articulate what that path is or even what that path is moving forward, what would you say it is? Man, that's a good question. I think that God has put me in a position to be the voice of the people, the people that see things the way I see things and I'm their voice and a voice of encouragement and a voice of authenticity. Somebody like a lot of people inspired. A lot of people have come to me and said that they want to commit suicide. But I gave them hope. A lot of people that happen to be white are saying, man, I was ready to give up and I thought the world was just coming to an end and I felt so pressured and so be down from being white, but you gave me hope that not everybody feels that way and that there's another side to this thing. But also, God has called me to witness and try to be an example of what Jesus was and that's through being successful and also being a servant to the people. With all the success that I've been able to get, I mean, I've given away almost a half a million dollars to people and then when you add blexit, we've given away over a million dollars of people in the last year. That's what God wants me to be, is the light and be a reflection of Christ and be able to speak up for the people and be the voice and also be an example of you can be a Christian and be successful. I mean, you can be a Christian and have a fun life and you can influence the world and you can be reassured that God has a plan and you can follow that plan and that plan will lead to happiness and not necessarily disappointment. Well, from one man's perspective, you're doing a phenomenal job. That's why I want to have this conversation with you. I know you've got a book coming up in the fall and I'd be honored to have you back on as if you want to talk about it, I'd be honored to have you back here. But why don't you tell me a little bit about the book and the premise and that way guys know where to turn when it comes out and I think November, is that right? Yeah, November the 30th and I'll be it'd be an honor for me to come back in. I think you've done incredible job. Some people can't interview. They don't know how to talk, they don't know how to lead questions and I think you've done a tremendous job. Next time I'll have my camera set properly because I feel like it's lagging a little bit. However, the book, Beating Black and Blue was just a dream of mine. I had a dream when I was, I actually had a dream, I had a vision that when I was, you know, when I was a police officer with no influence going check the check, you know, apparently making it, I had to work off duty and overtime just to make my bills. So, you know, I never thought that I either book would be, you know, I just, it was a thought it was a vision in my mind that I was going to write a book called Beating Black and Blue. And then the other book, you know, I won't name it because I don't want to buy it still in my idea, but it was two books. And, you know, lo and behold, you know, the opportunity presented itself. And, you know, I wrote the book called Beating Black and Blue. And it's a book that's, you know, it encompassed a lot of different things. You know, I talk about a little bit about my upbringing, how I became a police officer, you know, racism and prejudice on the police department and police brutality and, and, you know, defund the police. We even talk about George Floyd that, that whole entire case, we talk about other cases of police brutality that were, were cops were right, but the public say that they're wrong. And then we have some where the cops were wrong. And the public say they wrong. You know, so, right, right. You know, put that in there. And in our interview, five officers, one being Sean Payne, which is the officer that really is the reason I became a police officer, interviewed them about, you know, what is it like being a police officer in this environment? And then what are the solutions? You know, what are the solutions to the problems and I finished the book giving solutions, not only from those police officers that give their take on it, but then people get an opportunity to hear my perspective on what I think is the winning solution to kind of curb and fix these things. I think the book gives a police officer's voice and it gives the public a little bit of insight on on kind of what we go through. I think both are valuable. I had notes to talk about that, but just for the sake of time, well, maybe we'll save that for part two and the book comes out. We're going to sync everything up so the guys know where to turn. But man, I appreciate you and I appreciate your work. I'm actually really looking forward to the next time we do this because there are other conversations that need to be had. And I'm honored to be able to have this conversation with you, brother. Thanks for joining me. Well, it's my pleasure and I love to have continued this conversation. There's a lot of things that men need to talk about. And I think a lot of people may not be intentional, but they don't touch on these things and it's touchy subject and people don't want to hurt people's feelings and they don't want to be sound sexist and, you know, all this sort of stuff. And it's like, no, we need to have these conversations. We need real men to have conversations about certain things that men go through, certain things that women go through. Because in my perspective, we are the leaders of the nation. I think that everybody's equal in general, generally speaking, their worth is equal. However, the position is different. Men need to lead. And according to the Bible, the man is the head of the household. And the reason why our country has fallen apart is because men does not take their position. You know, it's not up to women to do it. And although women are taking the lead and to me, it's a shame that men cannot lead. You know, women have to take up the slack. Women have to take care of the kids. Women have to go out and be CEOs and work and be mama. You know, people can do what they want to do as America. However, I think men need to take the responsibility and start stepping up and being solid men with integrity, leading and raising families. And even if you don't have a family, be a man that a woman can marry for the sake of God's sake. All these trashy men I hear, there's a lot of good women that don't have nobody to marry because they still playing video games and want to, and I'm not saying anything wrong, playing video games, but I'm saying, if you don't have a bank account, you don't have good credit, you don't have a job, you probably shouldn't be playing video games all day. But we have men that are just caught up in this environment and are not taking their position in society. And we watch our society crumble on the shoulders of emotionalism. And men need to take a strong stance with a logical perspective and lead. And if we do that in our nation, I really do think we can see a really remarkable recovery, but men have to take their responsibility of the failure of success in this country. What better way to just put a stamp on our conversation, man? That's powerful stuff. Very powerful. I'm very much in alignment with that. All right, brother, I'll let you get going. I know you got a busy schedule, but I appreciate you and your time and your insight. The guys are we're going to enjoy what we've been talking about today. Thanks, man. Thank you, Ryan. I appreciate it, man. All right, guys, there you go. Mr. Brandon Tatum. I hope you enjoyed that one. I know I personally did. We had a great conversation, talked about a lot of topics that are important and obviously pressing in society today. I will tell you that I am striving to really approach all angles and all perspectives. And so I know I've had a lot of people on who agree with what I agree with, but I am trying to round that out. So if you have people that you want me to talk with, people that are interested in having an intelligent discussion, I don't want to get into a pissing match with people. But if there are people you are interested in having an intelligent discussion with that may not fully agree with me, please let me know. Obviously, Brandon, I agree on a lot, but I'm trying to give you a balanced approach to masculinity, manliness, and some of the topics and issues of today. So please connect with Brandon. He's got that book coming out. We're going to do round two closer to when that book comes out in November. But guys, please share. Let us know what you have going on. Share this with the people that need to hear it. Leave the ratings, leave the reviews, comment, mention, etc, etc. You know what you need to do. You have your marching orders. I try to add a lot of value to your lives. Brandon obviously adds a lot of value to people's lives. Connect with him. Connect with me. Leave ratings and reviews. Share. Drop him a message. Let me let him know that you heard him here on the podcast. And let's keep this thing going. We got our marching orders. We've got a lot of work to do. This is an uphill battle, one I'm willing to fight and one I'm willing to plant my flag on. I hope you're with me to some degree. So with that said, we'll be back tomorrow for our Ask Me Anything. Until then, guys, go out there, take action and become the man you are meant to be."
