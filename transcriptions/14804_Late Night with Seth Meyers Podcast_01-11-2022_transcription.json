    "text": " From Wondery and Audible comes Class of 88, a new podcast hosted by Will Smith. Before 1988, a lot of people didn't take hip-hop seriously, but hip-hop today, such as everything, from film to fashion to sports. So what changed? You can binge Class of 88 on the Amazon Music app or Audible. I'm going deep into my wife's family history, digging up the cold case of her murdered great-grandmother. And did I mention that I'm looking into whether the murderer was actually the beloved family patriarch? Binge all episodes of Ghost Story and Free right now on Wondery Plus. After completing the purchase of Twitter on Thursday, Elon Musk sent a tweet directed at the social media company's advertisers. Instead, the platform quote, obviously, cannot become a free-for-all hellscape. No, but it could stay that. MUSIC From 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, please enjoy this podcast edition of Late Night with Seth Meyers. On today's show, Seth chanced with author John Irving. But first, a closer look. MUSIC We are now just over a week away from the most consequential midterm elections in recent memory. And Republicans made their priorities very clear, and continued spreading conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, intimidate people trying to vote in this election, and claim preemptively that the results must be illegitimate if they lose. For more on this, it's time for a closer look. MUSIC These are anxiety-ridden times. So let's start with the good news. Thanks to new relaxed COVID restrictions in the building, our cue card guy, Wally, no longer has to wear a face shield during the show. Now, that's true of everyone here, but Wally's face shield was different. Want to tell him why, Wally? Well, yeah, mine had a tiny wet sponge on it. Wally's had a tiny wet sponge on it. LAUGHTER Wally, you want to tell him why it had a tiny wet sponge? Yeah, well, I couldn't lick my fingers between each cue card, so I needed the sponge for moisture. LAUGHTER He couldn't use his tongue. So we had a tiny wet sponge. He couldn't do this. So we had to do this. If for over two years, I've had to read cue cards while looking at that, thinking to myself, that sponge is a stand-in for a human tongue, and I dare. Anyone here? I dare any person here or watching to see a mass today that's more disgusting than that. Happy ****ing Halloween, everybody. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE My national nightmare is over. Moving on. Wally, I said moving on. Ugh. LAUGHTER Republicans have made it clear, if they win back power, they'll do things like impeach Joe Biden, pass a national abortion ban, and threaten to detonate the economy to force cuts to Social Security and Medicare. But it's not just Congress where pivotal elections are being held. No Trump or public and election deniers across the country are running for key positions that would allow them to supervise elections in swing states and some are poised to win. The Washington Post conducted an exhaustive survey and found that a majority of GOP nominees on the ballot this fall deny or question the 2020 results. And the website 538 found that most of those candidates are likely to win. 60% of Americans are going to have an election denier on the ballot this fall. Of the 552 Republican nominees running for office, 200 have fully denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election. We simply cannot have a functioning democracy where one party denies the legitimacy of any election they don't win. You don't see Jets fans spraying champagne on each other, claiming they beat the Patriots yesterday even though they lost 22-17. Yeah, the Jets jokes are back, baby. APPLAUSE After a red, after a red hot start to the season, the Jets lost to their bitter division rivals at home yesterday. So this morning, first thing I did, I walked right up to a security guard Jim Breyer and I said, how about those Jets yesterday? And he said, stand back or I'll crush your head like a peanut joke man. APPLAUSE And then I said, yes, sir, because I respect Jim, because at no point did he wear a tiny wet sponge on his face. APPLAUSE Take, for example, the GOP's nominee for Secretary of State in Arizona, a guy named Mark Fincham Fincham, was actually at the Capitol on January 6th and has been interviewed by the January 6th Committee. In fact, just a few weeks ago, Fincham, it was currently leading many polls for Secretary of State, which supervised Arizona's elections, tweeted, all I want for Christmas is a few arrests of election fraud criminals, which is the worst Mariah Carey cover I've ever heard. And of course, it will not shock you to learn that these lunatics have absolutely no evidence whatsoever for their lives. In fact, Fincham was asked directly by a reporter, Four Time Magazine, if we would certify Biden as the winner of the 2024 election if Biden gets the most votes. And this is how the exchange went. Fincham told the reporter, I think you're proposing something that quite frankly is a fantasy. Why I asked him, was it so impossible to believe Biden won in Arizona? It streams credibility, Fincham responded, is it interesting that I can't find anyone who will admit that they voted for Joe Biden? Well, where were you looking in the crowd on January 6th? Do you think maybe if someone voted for Joe Biden, they wouldn't want to say that to you? A f***ing looney tune who asked Santa for Christmas arrests? Other than that, solid logic. That's his argument. If you don't personally know anyone who voted for Joe Biden, then by logical extension, don't only vote for Joe Biden. In fact, now that you mention it, if you never met Joe Biden and you don't know anyone who's met Joe Biden, then how do you even know Joe Biden exists? He's probably not even real. That's why he gets stuck on stage sometimes in freezes in place. He's actually just a computer simulation and what we're seeing is a glitch. By the way, if you recently bought a tech company, that whole glitch thing was a joke. Not something for you to post and say food for thought. And sure enough, all these soul and election lies are having very real consequences. In Arizona, for example, self-appointed poll watchers, some with guns and tactical gear, have been loitering near early voting drop boxes to intimidate voters. These people waiting in the dark hours of Arizona Knights What brings you up tonight? In the heart of an effort by conservatives to watch critics say intimidate voters as they drop early ballots into drop boxes. Arizona Secretary of State's office has referred six incidents of potential voter intimidation in these parking lots to the FBI for investigation. Some individuals have been armed and masked. The referencing these people, varying numbers at two different drop boxes in Maricopa County. People sitting in lawn chairs and then some say they are camo-clad. That they are intimidating. That they have a clear intent to intimidate. Alright, first of all, why the f*** are you wearing camouflage in a parking lot? Why do they even sell camouflage in Phoenix? The only thing you can blend in with wearing camouflage in Phoenix is all the other idiots wearing camouflage in Phoenix. The whole point of camouflage is to blend in. If you wanted to hide in a parking lot, you should disguise yourself as a shopping cart. Mangoose, why don't you cheat your post? They rolled me back into the cart corral, sir. It continues to shock me how these guys continue to be both incredibly dangerous menaces and also complete dip f*** at the same time. We are living in an era of lethal dip f***. On the one hand, they are accomplishing their mission of scaring voters away from drop boxes, but on the other hand, they are sitting in lawn chairs wearing camouflage like a dude trying to catch a gopher in his backyard. I don't think you can eat my petunias, you bucked-to son of a bitch, you got another thing coming. I got a cooler full of naddy light and no place to be. Oh, damn it! Honey, can you run to the store and get more naddy light? The gophers ran off with it again. Let's not have any illusions about who's fueling all of this. The Magacult of election deniers led by the GOP statewide candidates in Arizona and of course Donald Trump, who has continued to spread deranged claims about the drop boxes on social media and even reposted the specific address of one of those boxes. Donald Trump himself has now reposted videos and photos on his social media account of new unfounded claims by these drop box watchers and another repost of his included the exact address of one of those Maricopa County drop boxes. Trump is now posting the specific addresses of ballot drop boxes in Arizona. Do you know how out of your mind obsessed you have to be to even know the address of a ballot drop box? You have to know the exact address of my six-year-old school. I just drive around until I find a building with d*** drawings in the window. I mean, not him. He's got a real talent. Got a real, got a real Claude Monet in the house. At this point, Trump's social media accounts are like scavenger hunts for insane people. It's the Da Vinci Code. You have to find a drop box of Susan B. Anthony Dollar and the severed head of a bird. And if you need a hint for where to find a severed head, I would check under a windmill because to a bird, a windmill. The windmill is the Freddy Krueger, Freddy Krueger. We love Freddy Krueger, don't we folks. He was a tough character. He was a tough character. He was a tough character, but he cleaned up Elm Street. No one gives him any credit for that, but he came and he killed all the kids, and now Elm Street is a nice place to live again. No more slumber parties keeping you up on out on Elm Street. I remember Freddy came up to me once tears in his eyes and s*** up face, and he said to me, he said... He said to me, he said, sir, sir, I may be hard to look at, but at least I don't wear a mask with a tiny wet sponge on it. And I respect that. So true. So true. Couldn't lick his fingers either because they're knives. Knife fingers and he still wouldn't do the wet sponge. He toughed it out because he knew a sponge would be gross to look at. And Trump hasn't just been egging on the ballot drop box crazies in his base. He's also been talking directly to the candidates themselves, encouraging them to double down on a stolen election lie. Take Arizona Senate candidate Blake Masters. When Masters was running for the GOP nomination, he said in an ad that he thought Trump won and even had a section on his website claiming the election was stolen. But then when it came time to appeal to voters in a general election, he deleted that passage from his website and admitted in a televised debate that he didn't see any actual evidence of vote tampering, which infuriated Trump. In fact, a film crew following Masters for a Tucker Carlson documentary captured a phone call from Trump in which Trump told Masters to stand firm on the claim that the 2020 election was stolen. Mr. President, how are you, sir? Doing great. I got a lot of people who've wasted about that. I don't know what you did with the debate. But I already did read of the debate, but that bad election answer, you got a lot of support. You got to stay with those people. Absolutely. We stay with those people. If you want to get across the line, you got to go stronger in that one thing. There was a one thing that a lot of complaints about. Look at Karen. Karen's waiting with her little honey. And if they say, how is your family? She says the election was written stolen. You'll lose if you go, so I'll keep it a little bit in the base. I'm not going soft. I didn't think anything could be more grating than Trump talking, but I underestimated Speakerphone Trump. It really accentuates just how much his throat has deteriorated. He sounds like he's been smoking three packs of marbles every day and eating one. And sure enough, the entire GOP and their media apparatus are in lockstep behind Trump. In fact, they're now even claiming preemptively that any Democratic wins in the midterms next week must be illegitimate. Like, say, if John Federman wins the Senate race in Pennsylvania, even though polls have consistently shown him leading Dr. Oz. It's not about the person. It's about the party. It's not about the individual. It's about the group. And to prove it, they can even run mentally defective candidates who can barely speak, and they'll only expect them to win, but expect you to accept the outcome no matter how transparently absurd it is. On November 9th, they'll be telling you that John Federman got 81 million votes in Pennsylvania, and they'll threaten to put you in jail if you don't believe it. Why wouldn't they do that? You work with Joe Biden. Why wouldn't they do that? Why wouldn't they conspire to steal an election in Pennsylvania and throw you in jail if you don't believe it? Why wouldn't they come to your house and ask who you voted for? And if you say Republican, why wouldn't they take your house away? Why wouldn't they take your car and all your money? Why wouldn't they take your dog? Why wouldn't they take your second secret dog? That's an exact replica of your first dog that you keep in your basement because you've been anticipating that the leftist woke regime would come to your house and take your first dog. Why wouldn't they threaten to put you in jail or kick you off social media or ban you from your favorite restaurant, Coraba's Italian Grill? And when you show up to Coraba's in a fake mustache, why wouldn't they point and laugh and say, did you really think that would work? And then why wouldn't they drag you into the parking lot and make you sit next to small bushes you only later realize we're actually camouflage dip in lawn chairs? This is all obviously insane. And to combat it, the Democratic Party has turned to perhaps his most popular figure for the last days of the campaign Barack Obama, who's been out hitting the campaign trail to push back on Republican conspiracy theories like at recent rallies for Wisconsin's Senate candidate Mandela Barnes and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Mandela's opponent has done more than just about anybody in Congress to spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. I mean, he has a gold medal in that event. If that doesn't elicit uniform outrage, what will? What does it take? The other day, a video came out of Governor Whitmer's opponent claiming that Democrats have been working for decades to topple the United States because they're still upset about losing the Civil War. And that COVID restrictions were part of some master plan to do this. Now, first of all, what? What? What? Whatever else you may think of him, you can't help but love stand-up comedy Obama. I mean, clearly working on material for his new Netflix special, Barack the House. It's just nice to see a politician have a normal human reaction to how utterly deranged this all is. I wish we could use that as a reaction clip for everything going forward. On November 9th, they'll be telling you that John Federman got 81 million votes in Pennsylvania and they'll threaten to put you in jail if you don't believe it. What? The stakes of this midterm election couldn't be higher. Republicans have made that clear. They've told us what they plan to do if they win back power, both in Congress and in key states across the country. And priority number one seems to be rigging future elections and laying the groundwork for the next coup attempt. They're already preemptively claiming these elections will be illegitimate if they lose. Most people react to those voter fraud claims in the same way I reacted when I first saw Wally's tiny wet sponge by saying, What? This has been a Closer Look. Alright, I guess it's the best-selling author and Oscar winning screenwriter whose books include a prayer for Owen Meany, the world according to Garb, the hotel in New Hampshire and Sider House rules, his 15th novel, The Last Chairlift is out now. Please welcome to the show John Irving, everybody. Welcome to the show, John. I'm so honored to have you here. Thank you. Thank you. Now, this is your 15th book, your prolific writer. This is 900 pages. This is the longest one. Did you know when you set out? I sincerely hope it's the longest one. And I'm almost certain. Yeah, you're not going to beat this record? No, there's only short trains in the station. Did you, when you had the idea, did you know this is going to be the long one? I knew it would be long. I didn't know it would be my longest or longer. Forgive me, then Bleak House. Almost as long as David Copperfield. I didn't know it would be that long. But when you follow the lives of the main characters' extended family, his cousin, her girlfriend, his mother, her girlfriend, and the stepfather who transitions to female, you have a lot of lives to follow. Yeah. And it's my intention to take each of those characters to an ending. You, I think a lot of writers begin with an idea of how books should start. I've heard you say you like to begin knowing what the ending is going to be. Have you always found that reverse engineering to be the right approach for you creatively? All was yes, but I needed to write four books before I realized it wasn't going to change. I needed to realize that there wasn't something really wrong with me. It's that I see endings first. I don't have the confidence to begin a novel unless I'm writing toward an ending that I have foreseen. That is in my mind predetermined. And that's, it's just always been that way. Well, I certainly as a reader, I appreciate when that moment sometimes of dread when you realize an author might not know where this was going. And so I like when you, the confidence when you're reading, you know, again, an author that you have a relationship with, being in safe hands is a nice feeling. You, you sort of mentioned a lot of the characters and maybe people picked up on it, but you, the protagonist is a straight white male surrounded by LGBTQ characters. Is this, was it a plan of yours to write about his perspective of that world or to make him sort of the outsider amongst that group? It was certainly my intention to make him the odd guy out, to make him the queer member of the family queer in the sense of strange and not up to speed. And he is the slowest member of his extended family. He's learning from all the rest of these people. And I don't think it'll be a surprise to anyone that he's also as the only straight guy, the most badly behaved sexually. You've been, you've been writing about sexual and gender politics for a very long time. I feel like, you know, perhaps the, you know, the take on those topics from your readership has changed. Has it made it easier to write about? Has it made it harder to write about it? More satisfying to write about? It's made it depressing that it hasn't gone away. The issues? Yeah. I remember when I was starting the world according to Garb, that I was even, I even enough to imagine that a novel about these extremes of sexual intolerance, these extremes of sexual hatred, I honestly thought the novel was in danger of being pass\u00e9 or out of date before I published it. You, another book of your reciter house rules, which took place in the 40s and was sort of a book about what would happen if abortion was illegal. Is it also shocking to you that we haven't, or it seems as though maybe we moved past it and now maybe we're moving back? Well, we sure are moving back. I remember at the time, some of my friends thought it was quaint that I was writing an historical novel about that time when abortion was unsafe and illegal. And what they meant was now that we have Roe vs. Wade, now that it's secure. Well, I wrote that novel intentionally as a warning because there were already the voices in the anti-abortion zealots were already there. And this was my way of saying everything that happens in this story can only happen at a time when this procedure is unsafe and illegal. Do you really want to go back there? It doesn't make me feel prescient. I'm not prescient. I'm really bad at guessing the future. But I've also been really bad at underestimating the pushback against everything progressive in women's rights and LGBTQ rights. I underestimate that there's going to be a pushback. Progress is not perfect. And that the pushback doesn't go away. This is really special to have you tonight. I grew up reading your books. My mom is your biggest fan. She came to the show tonight. She went to your dressing room beforehand with me. Overall, how do you think she behaved? I thought her behavior was exemplary. I was very happy to meet her. Well, you have not sacrificed your role as your favorite living author. You clinched it. You clinched her right there. John Irving, everybody. The last year.
