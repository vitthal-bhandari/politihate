    "text": " You're listening to the Tudor Dixon podcast in the Clay and Buck podcast network. Welcome to the Tudor Dixon podcast. I'm Tudor Dixon and we are going to cover what is going on in women's sports today. I know we've been talking about this but it is so critical that we continue to cover this story especially with our guests today. I'm joined by former NCAA and University of Kentucky star swimmer and now vocal advocate to protect women's sports. Riley Gaines, you've had a really crazy few weeks here. Riley, haven't you? I sure have. It's amazing if you would have told me even last year at this time this is what I would be doing. I would have laughed because I was supposed to be in dental school this year and so my life clearly I'm not working on teeth. My life has just changed drastically over this past year. But it's so important what you're doing because I was so drawn to your story when it first came out. Obviously I'm also a University of Kentucky grad so that's part of it but I'm also a woman so that's a bigger part of it because we watched this and it was funny because we're watching from afar as Leah Thomas is taking all of these awards and getting all these accolades and covers of magazines and we're saying how is this possible? Because first of all honestly we don't hear that much about star swimmers. It's not as though it becomes weeks worth of national news but it was suddenly and here we're hearing about a man who's swimming in the women's division dressed in this woman swimsuit but an intact male in the locker room and we're not really you know I think from the perspective of the rest of the world we're watching this and going man that seems awkward and an off but not until you actually came and spoke out did we understand the background of it and I just have to say little girls across the country are saying thank you for doing this. Well that's exactly why I am doing it. I'm clearly done. I graduated last year so I'm clearly done competing so this isn't for me. I'm not fighting for me. It's so much bigger than just one person. Being in that position where I did compete against a male and I shared a locker room with a male and I felt what it felt like to be in those spaces and to have to smile and step aside and giving up our trophies and opportunities. I see what's at stake. I know how we felt. I talked amongst my teammates and other girls that that me and other girls who this continues to happen to because my story is not unique and I my heart breaks What do you think about these men who start off competing in male sports? They don't do very well. They switch over to women's sports but they say that they're turning into a woman and yet my understanding is that Leah Thomas still wants to have relationships with women as well and and not have that bottom surgery. It feels like you're in the twilight zone right? Yeah. Let's say let's just say for purposes let's say Leah Thomas didn't transition solely to win. I don't know Leah's true intent but let's say that he didn't. It's still opening a door for people who would do this. They see this opportunity and that's something they would love to do right. It sounds great for a mediocre man who doesn't win many accolades who now become a national champion and to get in the locker room with women. Look at what's happening in prisons. We have men who are convicted of rape and child pornography and kidnapping and horrible things. They realize if all you have to do is say you're a woman to be in a woman's prison that sounds great to a rapist right? And so can we at least acknowledge how the systems that we have in place are failing us with us as women being the collateral damage in the process. But you're not it's not just that these men are winning awards. That's the really. Absolutely. Disturbing part about it. He's being listed as a woman of the year on magazine covers getting awards and and just getting all of this massive attention. Look at this amazing woman and we're all standing there saying how can this be happening? I mean how can honestly all of these government officials all of these companies how can they buy into this? I mean it's it reminds me of Dylan Mulvaney going out there and telling us how to use a tampon. Like where are you using that tampon Dylan? And that's that's a great question and I would love an answer. I mean I don't know if we want that answer actually. It's disturbing. I think it's a perfect display of what happens when you give an inch. They take a mile clearly. I think when this all really started coming to fruition I know it's been happening a long time. But rampantly you know kind of at a more prominent rate the past two years three years maybe. We all thought I say we I don't include myself but there are many feminists even who thought let's be kind let's be inclusive you know we want to include these people. But now two years in we see how this is harmful but it's gotten to the point where now not only are these trans rights activists they're not fighting for equal rights. They don't want equal rights. That's not what they want. They want to take away our rights. They want to be superior and have more rights. They also want to take away the business component of this. I think that people also forget that when you are a star athlete things come that's your career and you get endorsement deals. Things you become the face of brands and so now suddenly instead of women's brands having a women's face on it you've got a man with makeup on. And really how does a man accurately portray a woman's brand whether it is Nike and it's a sports bra or it's Tampax. I mean these are just outrageous outrageous things that we I think we all feel like we're being made fun of. Well that's what I was going to say it's a mockery. It's degrading. It's offensive. If you watch the video of Dylan Mulvaney in this Nike campaign doing jumping jacks and hopping around portraying what it is to be a woman working out that's not what we look like. That's not how we act. We don't you know we're more than just the hair and the makeup and the high heels and the dress. We're more than a testosterone level and I think an important point to bring up is why is it always trans women or men portraying as women getting the national spotlight? Why aren't we seeing trans men or females and men's for excelling or trans men or females and these corporations getting these big brand deals? Why does it feel like an attack on women? Why is it women's language that's changing? Why are we changing the term mother to to birthing person? Why are we changing breastfeeding to now it's chest feeding? This whole movement is a systemic eradication of women. This is not something that has been seen going both ways and I think that's something people don't realize and it's all an attack and an erasure of women. And you've really inspired a lot of women to come out. I've seen just in the last few days I've seen women telling their stories of what it's like to be a woman and and their heart stories. You know I think that's something that people don't necessarily consider. You know women have all kinds of issues when you go through menstruation when you have endometriosis when people when women have to have hysterectomies at young ages they're sharing stories of hard pregnancies of losing babies. These are things that are not funny. They're things that men can never go through and honestly I remember when I was pregnant and I used to think it's so shocking to think that this is something that you create this baby with another person and I'm the only one that really gets to experience this that really gets to know this. And I felt like it was a really special time that that was I was sharing this incredible experience of creating life with my husband and with this baby but this was all my body doing this and you hear these stories of women talking about this. You hear stories of women staying up all night breastfeeding and this this takes that away from people and I think it really confuses young girls about what it is to have this joy this this incredible magic. I mean this this this life this ability to give life that you are the God has blessed your body in a way that you can actually create another human. It's just so shocking but I love the fact that women are sharing those stories and like I said some of them are hard stories of losing babies of what that was like to go through that and I think this is because you were willing to stand when so few people were but tell me a little bit about the other women around you who were in this swimming arena who were also experiencing this same thing but they were too afraid to stand up because really what can you do they'll destroy you they'll try to destroy you. Absolutely and that's why I mean look what just happened to me in San Francisco that's why girls aren't speaking up that's why people my age are terrified they don't want to get ambushed they don't want to be labeled transphobic or hateful or a bigot but guess what it doesn't make you any of those things to acknowledge the truth and I've talked at great lengths with many of the atomists teammates and it breaks my heart it truly I mean it makes me feel so emotional to hear about what they went through every single day in order to suppress their voices and to scare them into submission when they were concerned about the locker room and they sent an email to their administration along with along with their parents on this thread their administration and I swear I have a screenshot of their response their administration responded with if you feel uncomfortable seeing male genitalia here counseling resources that you should see. That's crazy. They were forced every week to go to mandatory LGBTQ education meetings to educate themselves on how just by being cisgender they were oppressing the atomists they were told that they cannot use their voice because their school has already taken their stance for them they were told that they will never get a job you will lose all your friends you will never get into grad school you'll lose your scholarship if you speak out and so these girls were intimidated and there's there's one of Leah's teammates who I I talk with pretty often and she filled me on her personal backstory and so the other day she she called me crying and I was like oh my gosh are you okay you know what's what's going on and she was like I still have nightmares about sharing the locker room and I said well is there something deeper here is there something else that's gone on and she said when I was in high school I was raped violently raped and when we began to share the locker room I immediately went to my coach and said hey is there an alternate arrangement that can be had because this is really triggering for my anxiety this is hard for me to share the space with someone of the opposite sex and her coach said no you have to be inclusive and you have to be kind and it's something a year later she still struggles with and it it just it hurts it feels like you're being punched in the gut when you have to hear someone else live this go through this every day went through this and no one was willing to stick up for her let's take a quick commercial break we'll continue next on the tutor dixon podcast the other trauma that people don't consider women are so often abused so often used in cast aside and you live with that the rest of your life and then to put a young woman in this situation and to have her have explained the story the situation and the school to continue to say you're the one that is not being nice I mean it is shocking now where are all the feminists who come out and say you know what we're not going to put women in this position what do you say when people say your goal is to ban people you want to ban actual people because I always say look this is not a matter of saying that you want to ban someone but this is not a woman and and we were talking to someone recently that is a d-transitioner and they said you know the thing is that I never thought of myself as a you know going from male to female I went from male to trans I mean that's a reality this is really true and so why should that why should that person then put women in a position where they no longer get to compete fairly or even worse they experience that kind of a trauma I mean what do you say to people who say you're just nasty and you want to ban people this is not about banning anyone I think everyone is entitled to play sports regardless of your race your sex your gender identity your age everyone should be able to play sports and I don't want to take that opportunity away from anyone nor is that ever something I would advocate for because sports have given me so much outside of athletic achievement I'm talking lifelong skills that will translate far beyond athletics that everyone should be entitled to that opportunity that being said this whole movement is about ensuring people compete where is fair and where is safe that's it that's the basis of it and what I've seen traveling to different states testifying on different state bills the left the opposition they always like to say this this is an anti-trans bill that bans trans athletes it does not ban anyone that is a misconception it's a lie quite frankly um there's no one I know who wants to say trans people should not be able to play a sport this is to not this is not to deny that trans individuals exist it's not to deny that people do struggle with gender dysphoria but it's still to ensure there is fairness there is privacy and there is safety because women should not have to give that up why is there safety a bigger issue why isn't that something people talk about more I think it's something people often forget because a lot of times when we're talking about this we're talking about it in individual sports like track and field I say individual you're on a team but you're competing individually so swimming track and field cycling but what about sports where you're colliding into one another like soccer or you're striking a ball at one another like volleyball you do have to worry about injury because we know on average men are stronger they're they're more powerful they're faster um of course they have more muscle mass so when we we need to consider things like injury well and when we've seen injury certainly in the fighting we've seen injury on the soccer field whenever there is the situation where you could be in a contact sport it's just outrageous to think that it's the same type of competition and and it is a safety matter but really it's so hard to get people to to understand that because any time you talk about this they just immediately jump on you and say you're being begoted and that's really it it's really tough to take let's talk about what happened in San Francisco because you went to speak for a turning point event this was an event that the campus had sanctioned it wasn't like you were there and you weren't allowed to be there they knew that you were there they had protection for you and yet still someone was able to come and assault you then you were escorted out of there while they were but they were not kept back they were following you through the hallway and then you were held hostage for three hours on campus tell us a little bit about what it's like to come out of that situation and have the campus president say we're so sorry to the lgbtq community and we've got counselors for you it shows the state that our universities around the country are really in and what they're pushing um the email it basically well it actually word for word it said you know we're so proud of our students for being so brave being put in and being put in an adverse situation this adverse situation being listening to someone who doesn't agree with them were they forced to be there no no it's um and again I was there let me reiterate what I was talking about because this these you would think I'm a domestic terrorist by the way they the emails have sounded I was there talking about exactly what I'm talking about with you how it is unfair for men to compete in women's sports simple as that right common sense right right yeah when someone doesn't agree with you they're willing to silence you through verbal and physical assault holding me hostage for three hours um trying to negotiate my safe passage home they demanded that I pay them if I wanted to leave safely I mean this is extortion and the dean of students was negotiating with them I'm sitting there I'm like why are we negotiating my safety this is not something that's up for negotiation why weren't they just arresting people or forcibly moving them out the person who attacked you was that man arrested no there has been no arrest there has been no repercussions there's been no accountability there has been no one from the university who condemns violence there is no one who has come out and said you know we have to honor free speech no one and truthfully I think these campus police because that's who was um providing the protection which I want to mention I appreciate and respect all law enforcement of course but these campus police did a very poor job I think they were scared to do their job I think they were scared to be assertive because they didn't want to come off as anything other than an ally to this community because they know how it would look for them if you arrest someone within this community they're terrified especially being in San Francisco they know that they would be the ones who were vilified in the situation by simply doing their job and think about this we've got the city of San Francisco where people are giving birth in the streets they're defecating in the streets they're overdosing in the streets right in the districts where people are going to work every day businesses are closing you hear Whole Foods just now leaving they cannot get police to work there because police are demonized if they do I mean exactly what you're saying what police officer wants to be the next guy that's on the news and potentially going to prison for doing their job and so what is the answer I mean at what point do people just say you know what we're done with Seattle we're done with San Francisco we're leaving Portland and those cities fold they're no longer the places that we used to think of I can tell you I live in Nashville and the amount of people who moved from California to Tennessee I mean there was a recent statistic that came out that said on average 200 Californians a day are moving to Nashville I don't know if it's people who are fed up with the policies and are moving over here to get away from that or if it's people who will move here but continue voting that same way in hopes that Nashville doesn't turn to ruins like San Francisco has done because just like you said I got to San Francisco a little early and so I went to this mall a couple hours before the event and I'm walking around this mall and I go to the restroom and inside the restroom there's a homeless woman who walks in her feet she has no shoes on their cover her feet are covered in soot and she shoots up her arm in the bathroom when I'm sitting there watching this like oh my goodness I cannot believe I'm seeing this with my own eyes because you hear it but I saw it people there aren't happy there's no smiling faces there's no holding doors open for one another there's no looking up and smiling at your neighbor as you pass by these people look miserable it's again I just wanted to immediately pray for them I just thought man I can't imagine having this much hatred and this much just really vengeance inside my heart I just felt drawn to feel bad for them it's such an upside-down world when it is kind to allow people to defecate on the streets then try to find a solution to the problem of having so many people on the streets we've closed any type of businesses that could help with mental illness now we're shocked that there's a mental illness issue we have pharmaceutical companies that are prescribing drugs to every kid they can and we're shocked that there's a problem with kids mental health I mean this is outrageous but when you talk about the number of people that are moving to Tennessee let me explain a little bit about why there's that many people moving to Tennessee because a lot of Michiganders are moving to Tennessee and so during the campaign when I was running we had people say we're losing all our business well our businesses we've historically been automotive the automotive industry is moving to Tennessee in big ways many of the I mean four just invested 11 billion dollars between Kentucky and Tennessee and so there's a massive amount of jobs there they're good jobs they are jobs that can keep a family in a very healthy financial position and there's no income tax in the state of Tennessee there are a lot of benefits to moving to a state that is not beholden by that is not beholden to the unions that is also going to take care of you financially and where there are actual jobs in other states in these states like California in Illinois in Michigan the blue states people are leaving because there's no way to have a living there there's no way to make a living there's no you've got outrageous taxes and you have no jobs available and those governors are not coming up with any solutions to get jobs out to to our states and so of course they're going to move to states like Tennessee and you've got so many strong voices in Tennessee right now but we we have people that are still fighting back and saying that they are going to fight back against women's sports what do you think about the women like megan rippino who come out and say actually i'm going to support this now remember she's retired it blows my mind because think of someone like megan rippino or billy jean king we have billy jean king to accredit title 9-2 really this these were women who fought relentlessly to get equal pay equal access equal resources for women in sports but now these same women who fought again so hard to get women's rights and equal opportunities for women in sports are doing i mean they're doing a 180 in the name of progress yet it's not progress they're actively now working to get those those opportunities and those dreams and those rights they once fought for taken away because they're fighting for male inclusion in women's spaces and the the word that comes to mind is of course just irony it's so ironic it's so it makes me wonder when did this flip take place of course the left was once the ones who embraced the feminist movement the original feminist movement who wore the pink hats and who embraced the free the nipple movement that was the left but now it's totally now let's just cut the nipple right off now let's just get rid of nipples all together no one needs nipples it's amazing to me but truthfully this is a winning issue this this whole gender ideology movement because parents don't want their daughters to lose out on opportunities parents don't want their kindergartners to be taught what they're being taught now in kindergarten and so the way it's flipped it's beneficial of course to the republicans which i hate this has all gotten political especially in regards to sports sports should never be political but it's something that the republicans are seizing and they should because what what dad wants his little daughter to lose out what female athlete wants to lose out on opportunities no one right um and say even among the liberal the left this is i think i saw recent poll that said even sixty to seventy percent of democrats agree that men shouldn't be a woman sport so let me ask you this even though you retire i mean a lot of these folks still have endorsement deals so what's gonna happen when megan rippino gets fired for a man i mean is she gonna change her mind then because her big thing was women's pay so when they suddenly replaced her as the face of whatever she's the face of and they say you know what we'd rather have somebody that has a slightly different genitalia but is saying that they're a woman how's she gonna feel about that because essentially she's just gonna be in the same situation with men taking the pay again well if you've ever watched megan rippino play or if you've ever talked to someone who knows her personally i think that she would shiv someone who tried to take her spot um i really do she's of course she's a warrior in her own sense but at the same time i think that comes with the aggressiveness of no one's taking megan rippino's place i think if this if she were still playing or if she had a daughter to defend this would be a totally different scenario but she has nothing to personally lose now and this is all a classic case of virtue signaling and i've i've had i know that she would say well i'm part of this community and so i am going to defend this and stand up for this but i've had a lot of folks who are part of the lgb community community that have said this is different you know i i want to be able to have my life i want to be able to have my family but i still believe that women have a place i don't want to erase women and so i think it's disappointing to so many women because she is such a fighter she is such a tough player and she has been you know someone that little girls have looked up to because she's broken records she's done things that women haven't done before she's been a first in in her field in many ways and we look at women like that and we go man you're a champion for us and we expect you to kind of stay on our team and so switching teams on us is somewhat shocking and i just wonder if at some point she'll say you know maybe i made a mistake but maybe it does take raising your own daughter and seeing this happen because i think she kind of got out of this she she was retiring when this was starting right exactly um and i i want to touch on your point of saying there are so many people within the lgbt community especially the lgb community and i've talked to many trans people who are are very offended by this whole movement because it makes them look bad the lgb group they fought so hard for their rights um five ten years ago even that now this whole movement it's regressing the whole the whole embodiment of lgbtq which is frustrating for these people who just want to live their life as themselves yeah exactly they don't want to infringe on others rights they just want to love who they love you've heard the saying love is love that's what they want um but this this new trans movement they don't want like i mentioned earlier they don't want to fight for their rights they don't want equal rights even they want to take others rights which is where the problem lies yeah i think there's so many people from different backgrounds whether you are in the lgb community or in the straight community that want to see fairness and i'm so glad that you're fighting riley gains thank you so much for being on here today well thank you for having me and i look forward to following
