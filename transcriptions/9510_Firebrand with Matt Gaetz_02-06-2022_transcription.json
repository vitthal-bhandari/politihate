    "text": " Kim Battle Congressman, Matt Gates. Matt Gates was one of the very few members in the entire Congress who bothered to stand up against permanent Washington on behalf of his constituents. Matt Gates right now, he's a problem for the Democratic Party, and he can cause a lot of hiccups in the asking of laws. So we're going to keep running what the story is to get moving in. If you stand for the flag and kneel in prayer, if you want to build America up and not burn it to the ground, then welcome, my fellow patriots. You are in the right place. This is the movement for you. You ever watch this guy on television? Like a machine, Matt Gates. I'm a canceled man in some corners of the Internet. Many days I'm a marked man in Congress, a wanted man by the deep state. They aren't really coming for me. They're coming for you. I'm just in the way. He spoke the rally last time in the cast. He's a dangerous man. Hello, I'm Kevin McCarty, and I'm the Republican leader of the United States House of Representatives. I'm from Bakersfield, California, and many of the challenges we're addressing in our central valley are similar to the most important issues facing you in Wyoming. The people at that all of it is heard the auditions that we have from our book, which does capture the Kevin McCarty, who is actually the real Kevin McCarty. I just got something that I'm going to get out of. Newsman from Matt Gates, and where he's calling people to name out there in anti-Trump, is the type of atmosphere in some of the other places. This is serious stuff people are doing, but have to stop. So I'm calling Gates and explaining to him, I don't know what he's saying, but I'm going to have some other people call him too, but the nature of what, if I'm getting breathing, I'm going to get another one from the FBI tomorrow. This is serious shit to cut this out. Yeah, that's, that's, that's, that's, I mean, it's potentially illegal. What are you doing? Well, he's putting people in jeopardy, and he doesn't need to be doing this. And that was the leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, getting booed in Wyoming. I'll note that when my video played in Wyoming, I think it was a markedly different reaction. But what does it mean when the leader of our movement is in fact unable to stand before some of our most enthusiastic and inspired activists without getting a strong reception? What does it mean when some of the only audiences that would give Kevin McCarty a standing ovation would be audiences in Washington, D.C. with lobbyists, with political action committees. We are going to cover specifically what that means for the House Republican Conference moving forward. Is it tenable to have a speaker of the House for the Republicans or even a leader of the Republican caucus? So unwelcome in some of the audiences that are curated by the true leader of our party, Donald Trump. Will Kevin McCarty continue to get standing ovation from Republicans in Congress when he receives a very different reception throughout the country? The American people are a lot smarter than politicians give them credit for. Those who are paying attention showing up at Trump rallies, seeing who's in the fight, those are the folks who are going to carry us to ultimate success for our legislative agenda because you have to have the inspiration of the American people ignited and enthusiastic. You have to have engagement. You have to have passion behind our agenda for it to be successful. Make sure you are subscribed to our podcast. However you're listening and thank you for everyone in the comments section. I love that we got folks from gosh, North Carolina, Indiana, Georgia, Kuala Lumpur. Welcome from Kuala Lumpur watching and of course plenty of folks from my beloved state of Florida. We'll continue to watch these leadership developments and there's no question that our movement needs leadership but it needs leadership that can inspire and that can activate and that can motivate people in a positive way. Other big news that we got, Michael Sussman, a former partner at the Perkins-Couille law firm which is of course the favorite law firm of the Democratic Party. Their clients include the DNC, the DCCC, the Democrat senatorial committee, a number of other left-leaning aligned groups and Michael Sussman who was a partner there was just found not guilty of concealing his employment with the Clinton campaign when he lied to the FBI and that verdict was rendered by a jury of his peers or maybe I should say fellow travelers. Folks I'd like to say the house always wins but this trial wasn't even a gamble. The jury that acquitted Sussman included multiple Hillary Clinton donors, an AOC donor, a juror whose husband worked for the Clinton campaign, a juror who believed that the legal system is racist and police departments should be defunded and a person whose daughter was on the same rowing team with Michael Sussman. Again, jury of his peers would be the least of it I would suggest. Now in the prosecution's defense they did object to some of these jurors. One Clinton donor suggested that he could strive for impartiality the best he can. The prosecution objected to this juror but the judge Christopher Cooper who's an Obama appointee overruled them. It's also noteworthy that Judge Cooper is married to the lawyer for Lisa Page. Remember the FBI lovebirds Peter Strzok and Lisa Page who were so biased so against Trump. That's right Lisa Page's lawyer married to the judge in the Sussman case. It's almost like this stuff is predetermined before it even happens. Another juror and donor of the far left AOC was told by the Sussman defense lawyer that neither Clinton nor Trump were on trial and then asked if she could be impartial as a consequence. She responded, quote, yes, knowing that. So this response suggests that she would not have been impartial if the campaigns were part of the trial. Hm, lucky her. As George Washington law professor and constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley points out in a recent essay, the treatment of Michael Sussman is a far cry from the treatment of Roger Stone who despite whatever you think about him faced serious juror bias. And look what happened to General Flynn whose judge accused him of treason before any finding of fact. And even when the Department of Justice wanted to abandon the prosecution of Flynn, the judge was so biased he didn't even want to let that happen. It's crazy this is happening in the United States of America. But it shows what I've been saying for quite some time. There are two justice systems in this country. One for the left and one for us. Think about the pain that's been inflicted on a lot of the January 60 tainies for the sake of politics. So what does it mean? For starters, it means that every card carrying liberal and media anchor in the country will arrogantly proclaim that Sussman's acquittal exonerates not only him, but the Clinton campaign, Perkins Cooey, the FBI, the DOJ, the Mueller team. Sussman won his case. So now they'll say there was no collusion and the FBI was doing its job. Should have Sussman had lost? I think he'd have lost this case. Then they would have just said he was a rogue actor who lied to the FBI. So really either way this trial went, the ultimate result wasn't going to be, I think what the American people really deserve to get to the root, the core root of the Russia hoax, which of course had its origins in the Obama White House. But that was all shielded off. That was all protected. Now two weeks ago, I predicted the outcome we got in a discussion with Darren Beatty. Take a listen. I do not believe that the Durham trial of Michael Sussman is about convicting Michael Sussman at all. I think the entire purpose of this trial is to inoculate the FBI and the DOJ against the charge that they were in on it. If you believe Durham and his presentation, the argument goes that the FBI was lied to, the FBI were the victims. You had these evil Democrats and their lawyers scheming and obfuscating and trying to get this political dirt in. But oh my goodness, the FBI was just a victim of this. The reality is the FBI was part of the supply chain of bullshit that ran from Russians and the DNC through the Perkins law firm to the FBI, DOJ, and then out through their distribution system in the mainstream media. They don't want a conviction of Michael Sussman. They want an exoneration of the FBI. And whether Sussman is convicted or not, that's probably what they're going to get. And the game you're watching is not the game being played. It was a crime against the presidency itself, against the American people, certainly President Trump bore the brunt of a lot of that corruption. And in these recent developments, we see what we suspected all along. Now John Durham says he respects the verdict and thanks the jury for their service. This was the statement from John Durham, while we're disappointed in the outcome, we respect the jury's decision, thank them for their service. I also want to recognize and thank the investigators and the prosecution for their dedicated efforts in seeking truth and justice in this case. It's basically everything other than Durham saying tip your waitresses on the way out. And it's this type of attitude that shows why we lose. We can't roll over when we get screwed over. And maybe one day we'll have justice. But until then, we are going to keep fighting. Because at this point, if you want accountability increasingly, we're not seeing it from these trials. Now, just because Durham appears to be giving up based on that statement doesn't mean we will. I make you this commitment. When Republicans retake the majority, Jim Jordan and I will use the Judiciary Committee. We will use the subcommittees of the Judiciary Committee to continue to expose the rotten corruption that still exists today that at one point manifested in the Russia hoax. We cannot let this go because if we do, it absolutely will happen again. We also want to talk about a few issues regarding our military. We have a ton of active duty military who watch our reports. I am so grateful whenever I'm out in Northwest Florida and our active duty military say, hey, we love Firebrand. So know that we make the show in large part for all of you because we're inspired for what you do for the country. And the military should not become this homogenized, monolithic tool of the political left in our country. And increasingly, we are seeing purges that harm our military and the patriots who serve her. Next week, there will be key votes in the House Armed Services Committee to abolish the military tax mandate and restore the rank and pay of those who have been forced out. I will force these votes through amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act. So this would be a great time to look at who's on the Armed Services Committee and to contact them if you're an active duty service member. Let them know that these mandates are hurting our readiness and they are purging our patriots. But the legislative process is painfully slow. That's especially slow to advance liberty in a House of Representatives run by Nancy Pelosi. I think you get that. So my amendments may all fail. They did last year. Even Republicans opposed my anti-vaxx amendments last year. So we need solutions for our troops that have a more immediate impact. And that's with the legal process where federal judges can issue binding injunctions, comes into play, becomes necessary. That's why we have Article III courts. Currently, I'm tracking lawsuits across the nation fighting for the rights of the unvaccinated to keep their jobs. Most recently, I'm excited to hear that the Liberty Council has joined this cadre of brave principled lawyers who are engaging in the battle over our natural liberties. The Epoch Times has a great piece on this entitled US military intentionally purging people of faith. Now, traces of this crackdown can be looked back to all the way to like February of 2021 when Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin directed military leaders to address extremism within our military. And it sounds to me like this was the precursor of things to come, including purging members of the military for dangerous rhetoric or for activity that they don't like, but that isn't necessarily criminal or even now having a religious belief that would normally justify an exemption from a vaccine. You see, these things are connected. The Wokism manifests in the vaccine mandates, manifests in the extremism, snipe hunts. And it is scary to see our patriots punished by totalitarian decree like this from Lloyd Austin. The mandated compliance to big pharma is not something that should append to someone's service to our country in uniform. So this Epoch Times piece, it chronicles the significant lifestyle disruption, harassment, coercion, endured by the brave women and men who have made the decision to stay steadfast in their belief that they should not have to take this vaccine. The one star Brigadier General with more than 20 years experience faces a loss of benefits and a dishonorable discharge, big league cancel culture in military terms if she does not get the jab. Military members who are deployed abroad are locked down. Some in the country are not eligible for deployment. Imagine that having the US taxpayer train you up, get you ready to be in the fight. And then because of your choice on vaccines, you're somehow not eligible to be deployed. This is not a make America stronger. That makes America weaker. It hurts our readiness. And there's even a circumstance where if you are deployed, you're not able to return home to see your family without getting the jab. It's heartbreaking to see these like grown service members unable to visit their newborn children, aging or sick family members all for what? This isn't creating a better military. It's creating a weaker one. Maybe that's the point all along. So Matt Staver, who is an attorney and chairman of the Liberty Council, had a great quote in this epic times piece, quote, at a time when we need the military at its strongest, Biden has weakened it. People who've been around for 18, 20, 25 years, you can't replace those people very easily. Some of them are irreplaceable and they're willing to kick them out. Those quote, worse yet, Biden and the Democrats want to continue to use wokifying our military as they deliberately walk them into another foreign war of drastic proportions with serious consequences. You know, you saw Obama try to destroy our military by defunding it, by subjecting it to sequestration. And you almost think what Biden's doing to it is far worse because it's fundamentally trying to transform the military into this monolithic tool at the left. Another great piece in national file website you should definitely go to, you should definitely check out frequently. They've got a lot of great breaking news and investigative reporting. And in the national file, we learn of news surrounding the effects of Biden's mismanagement of our military. Now at Rumsstein Air Force Base in Germany, they have just decided to cancel drag queen story time, which was scheduled to occur today. I am not kidding about this drag queen story time at a foreign military base. I think Rumsstein by personnel is the largest air force base in the world. The largest air force base in the world by geography, of course, northwest Floridians know is eggland air force base. But in terms of personnel, Rumsstein is massive. So if you were looking forward to the Rumsstein drag queen story time, you will be disappointed, but it was able to be exposed. So that's right. We're going to do this in a military base library. They're planning on hosting this event for young children of service members on your dime, on the taxpayer's dime, to articulate issues that I would suggest belong in the American household between parents and their children. Look, I don't hate anybody. I don't hate the gay, the trans, whatever. Whatever. I can't keep up with how many letters there are now. I am a person who does not use someone's identity as a basis to hate them. I don't think that you should hate people based on immutable traits. But shouldn't we agree that these issues are better discussed among family with church groups rather than having like the drag queen experience curated by the United States military? Last I checked there was a war going on in Europe and at Ramstein Air Force base we're doing drag queen shows for kids. So before the plug was pulled on this ludicrous idea, there was a Facebook advertisement for it that read quote, we're celebrating Pride Month at the Ramstein Library with drag queen story time. Join us with special guest reader Stacey Teade. Be sure to wear your brightest and most colorful outfits. So in less than a generation, the military went from not allowing long hair to having drag queen stories for children funded by taxpayers. It is quite the evolution. I mean, you don't have to go back to the great ones, but I mean, you look at George Washington, Dwight Eisenhower, General Patton, General MacArthur, they didn't train men at bases that would tolerate this. They were too busy preparing their troops to save America, not destroy it. They were winning wars against strong empires, not losing wars to goat herders. I respect and am thankful to all of the men and women serving at Ramstein Air Force base and all military bases anywhere in the world for that matter. But Joe Biden needs to wake up. A true American president would not tolerate this nonsense. Joe Biden is asleep at the wheel and the people driving the action are fundamentally like men and dresses over at the Pentagon. But it's not just in our military where this wokeism seems to be a little bizarre and in our face in kind of the strangest of ways. It's striking again this time in the UK where a woman statue has been unveiled in summer town Oxford. But this is no ordinary statue. This is no ordinary woman. This is supposed to be the quote woman of our times a statue and it has an obvious male appendage. Are we living in a world where now to celebrate women? We have to have male genitalia in the picture. You would think that would offend some feminists, some even some transformative so-called radical feminists. A woman is just a totally specific thing from a biology standpoint and this seems to blur those lines bizarrely and I would suggest probably intentionally. It's another example of liberals trying to shove their wokeism and ideology on society. It's bad enough that they want biological males to use female refs' rooms and play in women's sports. We heard at a hearing in the House Judiciary Committee that they think men can get abortions and now women statues have to have male genitalia. How long until we're walking with our families and our kids in front of these very statues in the United States? Probably not too long. Heck, we might even see one right in front of the Capitol building. Each state sends two statues to Congress to represent some of the best contributions of the citizens of that state. One of them of course from Florida is Dr. Gorey who invented the air conditioning. I mean in Florida air conditioning is probably a big deal. But how long until we would see a statue like this submitted by some woke state where like celebrate women with male genitalia? So weird, so bizarre but you know we see these things abroad and sometimes they tend to come home. Earlier this morning we actually got some commentary on the activities of Congress from former House Speaker Paul Ryan. Let's take a listen. What I think it's changed is in the old days like 10 years ago if you wanted to do really well in Congress, if you wanted to succeed, you climbed a meritocracy. The measurement of success was policy and persuasion. Could you persuade your colleagues, your country, your constituents? This is the right way to go. Here's a solution. That's not necessarily what motivates people anymore. There's a lot of entertainers in Congress on both parties. So we have an entertainment wing of the House, of the Republican Democratic Party. And so the old meritocracy that takes 10, 20 years to climb, of being a good policy maker, you can just leapfrog that whole process. They're a really good entertainer, have an incredible presence digital and forget about policy making and curate a brand for yourself. And so you have entertainers in Congress now. So Paul Ryan tries to juxtapose legislation and entertainment. And I think the viewers right now who are tuning in realize like this is not entertainment. I'm giving you information you need to know that oftentimes is filtered through big tech, through big media, even big government entities that try to control your access to information. But in this world where like you're either an entertainer or a legislator, Paul Ryan was kind of neither. Paul Ryan did not have the ability to ignite and inspire people as a national candidate. He admit Romney lost. I would suggest in large part because they were kind of like milk toast Republicans trying to explain to people that the zombie of Ronald Reagan was somehow going to emerge and save them through a series of like very old, you know, kind of like Republican ink talking points, largely drafted up by lobbyists and special interests. So Paul Ryan wasn't entertaining. And when you look at the legislative side, the principal promise that we made our voters over and over again when Paul Ryan was in the house before he became speaker was that we would repeal Obamacare. But in the weeks leading up to Paul Ryan releasing his Obamacare repeal bill when we got in the majority, he took like so many more than I think it was more than like 14 million dollars from the packs and the HMOs and the lobbyists who wanted to not repeal Obamacare but who wanted to reposition it for their benefit. And the past Paul Ryan is called me an entertainer, not a legislator. Well Paul Ryan was little more than a vessel for the special interests to operate through. And there was nothing sincere about that, nothing entertaining and certainly not nearly enough that was productive for the American people. If Paul Ryan wanted to legislate, if he was this great legislator, why the hell didn't we secure the border when we had the House, the Senate and the President? How can we didn't do asylum reform? How can we didn't deport more people that weren't here legally with authorities in the law that would have permitted that? You know Paul Ryan was just not a fighter, that's his problem. And he was only willing to go to battle for the people that were funding campaigns, not the people who were actually out there winning them, not the activists, not the very people who were just booing Kevin McCarthy and Casper Wyoming. Thanks so much for joining us on Firebrand this week. We hope you stay connected, we hope you stay informed and engaged and you know what, if you're entertained a little bit along the way, we won't begrudge you that either. Roll the credits."
