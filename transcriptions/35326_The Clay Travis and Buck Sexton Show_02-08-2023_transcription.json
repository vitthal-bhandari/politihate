    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast on everybody third hour of the clay Travis and bucksxton show as Promised we are joined by our friend Julie Kelly right now her book is January 6th How they used that it launched a war on terror against the right? I almost got the subheading from the top of my head, but January 6th. Look it up great books He writes for American greatness. Julie. Thank you for being with us. I Forget it all the time don't feel bad. So just January 6th. That's that's good enough. There we go. Thank you So let's start we want to ask you about the pens classified document Non-prosecution thing in a second, but I mean first up my understanding is that there are now more people Who have access to the full January 6 footage? What can you tell us about this? So I was contacted in April by speaker McCarthy's office letting you know that I would be one of three reporters given access to the tons of thousands of hours of surveillance video captured by security cameras and set in outside the Capitol on the fifth six and I believe on the seventh so I Was very pleased to hear that as you can imagine I've been baying the drum on this for two years my first article about the existence of these tapes was May of 2021 So I'm very grateful for speaker McCarthy and especially Marjorie Taylor Greene who's really been pushing this behind the scenes So I did go to DC. You have to go to DC There are types on a few terminals in a house office building where you could access them. It's a very To me, it's a complicated system. I'm not a techie, but it's an overwhelming Trove of of material and So it will be a long process to to get these clips out at least the ones that I want to produce But in the meantime John Solomon It just the news had access to it earlier than I did and he is now starting to release his exclusive clips along with stories and context to what people are seeing so this is going to be I am assuming months long Process at least from the three of us who initially got access. I Know the data is voluminous and I can only imagine how you know mind numbing it can be to watch so many of these security camera footage It takes over and over again with that in mind What would you say if anything Julie that has stood out to you on a larger perspective based on having access to some footage so far? I will say What I would have said all along but this confirmed that the story of January 6th Obviously is not cut and dry, but when transpired that day is multiple things happening at different locations And you had police that were letting people inside the building you had police who were chatting with people You had police who were gassing and beating people inside the building and outside the building So it's really a very complex story that we've not heard from the media We certainly didn't hear from the January 6th select committee But that's the sort of context that needs that the American people want to see and they need to see So I hope that what John is doing tremendous work already I think he's gonna have some really bombshell revelations in the next several days here on key Key controversies of that day and then I will be focusing in on some things that what really how it really went down on the West side Which is where most of the protesters were how police conducted themselves on that West side and Then what was happening in that lower West Terrace tunnel where a lot of the violence took place and of course That's where Roseanne Boyland died as well. So my focus will really be and what it has been is Is police misconduct that day that still remains uninvestigated and uncharged and that just simply should not be the case when when you look at these these videos The one one thing that I feel like we never really got an explanation of it all and I you know you would know I might have missed this There's definitely video of police moving barricades and it seems Doing what I guess you could call crowd control the kind of waving in some of the protesters beyond the barricades What what is the official line on that and what do you think was happening if you believe it differs from the official line? That definitely did happen. I mean we've seen that video, right? So we've seen a couple officers waving people really on the east side towards the building I don't even know who those officers are or if they've been investigated or even questioned by authorities or the January 6th committee But look we just had new footage that came out last week in the oath keepers case a man named Kelly Megs Who has been convicted of seditious conspiracy sentenced to 12 years in prison? New video just came out of him. He's a military gear and he's standing there with Capitol police officers right there by the door He's chatting with them and he is ushering people outside of the building. He's showing people how to leave He's not attacking anyone the police aren't trying to arrest him. They're certainly not trying to arrest the people who are inside the building So how does this guy get convicted? Of course? We know it's a DC jury of a tramp a crime comparable to treason When he's now seen on new video Just helping police chit chatting with them police are talking to him as if they're directing him how to tell people to leave These are the sort of scenes that the American people need to see because of how this event is being weaponized criminalizing political dissent destroying the lives of thousands of people and of course all of this is intended to create public support or legal legitimacy to eventually indict Donald Trump for his related role or probability for January 6th You know Julie this is where you know I kind of put on my lawyer hat because what stood out to me so much about what Tucker showed us from January 6th particularly as it related to QAnon shaman was a lot of his lawyers at least said publicly that they had not seen all the footage That that was shown and for people out there who maybe are not spending a lot of time thinking about this Julie this is hugely important in terms of if there is evidence on that day as you just laid out for for a convicted Felant who was charged on January 6th if there is exculpatory evidence of their behavior that day That further contextualizes what they did a lot of these defense attorneys that feels like to me have not seen this footage Imagine given your coverage of so many of these trials as you're watching this footage on the back of your mind, Julie You're also thinking my goodness. How is it possible that this wouldn't all have been provided to defense attorneys? Because they're trying to defend clients without full access to all the footage that day I mean, I've seen these complaints by defendants and their attorneys for more than two years Even in a few cases judges and this was summer of 2021 We're all ready condemning DOJ for not turning over material and the videos as they said What one judge said is you're arresting people first coming up with evidence later Which is exactly true But then as the deals went down or certainly trials they can't keep continuing to Withhold all of that evidence. So what they would say is well We'll give you the surveillance video, but only case specific So we will show you your defendants movements, but we are not going to show you what happened in context You know how you know that door was opened 20 30 minutes before he entered or you see him shouting at police, but you don't see how police acted before he arrived I mean, I've seen in certain cases where a judge has denied defendants motions for video that show police attacking a Woman for 10 12 minutes before this police officer NYPD by the way who is there as a Trump supporter? Attacked one of the officers and told him to stop assaulting Americans on public property The judge would not allow the jury to see that video This is what's happening in these trials and that is some of the context that the surveillance video anyway We'll be able to show in a much broader view if that makes sense speaking of Julie Kelly her book January 6th We highly recommend you get a copy of it Julie I want to ask you also about this Closing of the because this ties into what you were talking about a moment ago with the possibility of there being federal charges against Donald Trump We've said very clearly and vociferously. This is a a witch hunt This is something that is being driven by politics not being driven by the realities of a true criminal infraction That would under normal circumstances be charged. That's against Trump with Pence. They have already said No charges for the documents does that tie in at all for what we can expect with Trump Do you think that part of this is they're gonna ask him to weigh in on this or what do you make of it? my suspicion now is The classified document was always a root right that was just an excuse for the FBI to conduct that unprecedented rate at Mar-a-Lago Last August where are they stole 13,000 pieces of property out of Donald Trump's home and then later said oh about a hundred of 100 of the records that we took Have classified marking so it was always sketchy from the beginning But what the case related to classified documents with the indictments? I believe will mostly be about is obstruction of justice That he tried to obstruct an investigation that he told the FBI that he had produced all of the records that he believes were Classified but then they found more later But they moved boxes around that they tried to hide the fact that Donald Trump is keeping classified documents at Mar-a-Lago You know, this is why they've interviewed everyone from the Mar-a-Lago maids to his valet I think they subpoenaed his security company. I think they got security video for months and Mar-a-Lago This is how indefinite insane Special counsel Jack Smith is so it won't really be that he had classified documents It will be well, he had and we found them but he tried to Obstruct a federal investigation. That's where I think Jack Smith is gonna go with this I think you're right Julian and we said in the first hour of the show I think this is about just trying to create this narrative of there's good ways and bad ways to handle classified documents Mike Pence and Joe Biden Good way Donald Trump bad way and actually the Mike Pence documents help in that because he's a Republican and they can claim This is not political look at how we're treating Mike Pence, right? I'm just telling you what the argument is gonna be. I think you probably agree with that too What can you tell us we haven't talked about it a lot on the show last question for you? And we certainly appreciate encourage you to go follow Julie Kelly She's been doing incredible work on so many different fronts, but particularly January 6th What can you tell us about this document? That the FBI purportedly has alleging that Joe Biden has been getting paid off And and the refusal to provide that document until I believe now the FBI is saying they will provide it to James Comer For people out there who haven't been paying attention to this. Why does it matter? What do you think the story is there? I? Don't know much more than what's been reported This is just another example of the FBI acting as the Gestapo for the Democratic Party Rounding up the Democratic Party and Biden regime's political opponents while protecting the regime including the Hunter crime family It sounds like this form is an internal document that relates to information gleaned from a confidential human source Or better known as an informant it appears to be related to something happening in 2015 when Joe Biden was vice president And I've seen some reports that it has something to do with a Ukrainian official so This is this seems pretty serious I can't believe that Jim Comer would go out on and certainly Chuck Grassley would not go out on on a ledge like this unless this was a serious substantiated allegation made in this in this document So hopefully they will get it from Christopher Ray. Hopefully it won't be redacted. It doesn't sound like it's a classified document So it should be should be unredacted fully unredacted But let's hope that the Republicans get it And let's hope they do what Democrats do and that is released it to the public and let everyone see it Let's not play any games with it get it out to the public. Let's see it and let's force Maybe hope the media will ask Joe Biden and his family and his lawyers about what what went down then Julie Kelly everybody look for her latest that American greatness Julie always appreciate it.

All right. What exactly they are doing They are not gonna charge Mike Pence now. That's the story of the day That allows them to now have a precedent for why they're not gonna charge Joe Biden with any wrong to it They are going to say oh Mike Pence discovered classified documents immediately notified the right authorities Allowed for the process to play itself out. This is how good classified document Violations should be handled. They're gonna try to create this distinction between Biden and Trump And we've been hitting on this, but I do think it's important for people to understand They may not even charge Trump necessarily with any crime over the classified documents It seems based on the way this evidence is going buck that the obstruction charge is what they're gonna do But they'll also build it as Trump was reckless and he obstructed unlike Pence and Biden who immediately just turned these back over Yeah, it's garbage, but as we all know that's not gonna stop them There's a totally garbage trial that's gonna be started in New York City against Trump about the It's amazing. I've read it so many times, but we all know it's it is that it is doctoring business records in the alleged Furtherance of hiding another crime therefore it's a felony and every document is a different felony So they're hitting them with like 24 felony. It's it's so Blatant and such obvious partisan and politicized targeting of Trump that it's it's almost hard to imagine it's happening But it is happening and I think you're right on the obstruction side of it too But you know there is a part of you that also wants to say clay They may be some of the individuals involved in this whether it's the prosecutor in Atlanta or it's they may be underestimating How as we really get into an election year the anger that people I think are going to feel from the Republican front-runner Being indicted in these ways. I don't know they're crazy enough to do it I don't know if they're smart enough to prepare for the blowback Yeah, and and all this ties in with remember Biden can't even walk across a stage right now So it's not only that they're going after Trump and we talked about this in the first hour quite a bit But I mean we've reached the point where Biden is so physically and mentally deficient That when he finishes a speech at the Air Force Academy and tries to turn and walk and he does this thing where he tries to pretend That he's like in really good shape. You notice how he tries to like fake jog all the time now It's like oh look at how fast I can move my legs like and it felt like he was trying to do that as well He tries to look spry when he's clearly not spry and It's not only that they're going after Trump It's that they've got a mentally and physically deficient candidate that they're trying to prop up I will throw this out there to you. I think the only people who use the term spry are generally not spry That's a real look if you like neither You know, or I has ever said boy you think that I'm having a rough go of it Look how well I walk up and down the stairs because no one would be like Oh, you say a lot of things about us I don't think people are worried about our physical abilities right now if we're fortunate enough to be doing the show together in 20 years You know then claiming to say no buck walk into looking pretty spry So it's true our friends at Hillsdale aren't taking the summer off even though the spring semesters over the college campus is Pussing with activity their newest way of teaching those of us that don't regularly get to their campus is by way of their podcast network You can listen to hundreds of episodes on the network from the Hillsdale dialogues to the radio free Hillsdale hour to the Larry Arn show these podcasts feature interesting and informative conversations with Hillsdale college faculty They've all fellow staff members friends and alums of the college and many others learn from Hillsdale by listening while driving Walking cooking or doing chores and if that sounds good the Hillsdale college podcast network is for you Get important and entertain that clay and buck or Hillsdale Dot-com that's clay and buck or Hillsdale Play Travis and bucks section on the front lines of truth the coach of a woman's basketball team I would have the greatest team I'd say LeBron would you like to become a woman? and And I go to another four or five big guys and I say how about we will be undefeated for many many years There will never be anything like it. I'll have the great I'll be I'll go down as the greatest coach in history. They'll say I was the greatest ever no It's so crazy and that's all woke, you know, that's all I guess they define that as well But that's all well we have to bring common sense back into the country, you know people so you're concerned I said young conservatives, but more important is I'm a person with common sense You can't match in the political sphere. No one can Trump's Entertainment and connection ability. I think especially with it with a live audience and that's always been an X-factor secret weapon that he has but putting putting that aside just for a moment here clay the idea of Trump coaching a W NBA team This would be the most amazing television series I mean you could do it as a reality show would be amazing as scripted television it would be amazing So I'm just having all these visions of Trump as WNBA coach and I'm thinking this would be this would be gold content gold mine I've argued for a while that the best way to get WNBA attention would actually be to have a team of regular Decent players that are actually in the league right like so they and I get it people are like oh the WNBA You know it's what the WNBA is like 27 years old now You know for a long time they kept saying well the reason the WNBA really hasn't hit their stride is because The league's so new I mean it's like a quarter century old now You know and nobody cares and by and large nobody cares about the WNBA because it's not a great product But what Trump pointed out here is one you're right. I watched I actually flipped back and forth last night I was watching some of the NBA finals between the nuggets in the heat and then Hannity's town hall with Trump Oh sitting down in the couch flipping back and forth watching it Trump is at his best in a live audience and this is why we said for a while. I think it's been sort of a curiously halting presidential campaign by Trump because he spent most of his time at Mar-a-Lago But last night with Hannity And many of you are gonna be listening to Hannity in what about 30 minutes? I'm sure Hannity will talk about it more But I thought it was a really good performance for Trump and it built on the new Hampshire performance Which was on CNN and obviously Caitlin Collins and Sean Hannity are gonna question Trump more and interestingly I actually think Trump is more Interesting Certainly when you just let him talk then when you're trying to cut him off all the time like Caitlin Collins was but that Iowa audience was all in on all in on Trump and I think he's doing a really good job when he gets out for the Retail politicking because he gets to the essence of the absurdity of much than what's going on I mean the idea that LeBron James could decide tomorrow Hey, I'm 38. I think he's 38. I'm 38 years old I've been the best player in the NBA for basically 20 years and Now I decided that the best way for me to fulfill my career is by becoming a woman and Trying to go after Michael Jordan's championship record in a way that he never will be able to reach I'm gonna be because I think LeBron could be the best women's basketball player for the next 20 years Yeah, like he could easily play till 58 or 60 and be dominant in that league He here's the other part of it though clay if that were to happen I mean if that absurdity and as you pointed out there was wasn't there there was a a movie Juwan a man. Yes. Thank you. You want a man a movie about a guy who plays that women's basketball But if that were to happen just so everyone understands the real mentality and what we're dealing with here with these Democrat leftists, okay They would be there would the same people that you see saying as LeBron James turned to you know Whatever changing his name. So it was a woman's name calls himself, you know Sarah LeBron James big big name change. Yeah, whatever. You know what I mean So if he calls himself a woman's name and he plays in In a woman's league scores a hundred points a game the people who are telling you there is no advantage Would keep telling you there is no advantage Because they're in I know it's crazy, but everyone knows I'm right Everyone knows I'm it is a cult. They are in a Gender ideology cult outside Reality does not enter into it. So you would have the same people saying, you know Well, it wasn't you know the line would be it wasn't fair that LeBron was so much better than all of the men that he was playing You know, we're already saying that yeah, they've already this what I mean So they're saying well, there's you know, there's advantages that people have anyway None of us are really equal. So why does it matter if a man in ability? So why does it matter if a man to just beat all the women so badly? I mean they're crazy like What I'm trying to say is the whole thing is crazy. So even if you expose their craziness to them They're not gonna change. I think what it would do and this is why I think it's so difficult and Trump is hitting at it And I don't know if you saw last night Riley gains endorsed Ron DeSantis I think why it is so difficult. There's that photo of Riley gains standing on the stand next to Lee at Thomas and I love Riley. We've had her on this show several times, but that image of her just looking a Scans right like just looking over at this six foot three or four whatever the heck Lee at Thomas is Dude with a penis who has decided to identify as a woman and you can see the physical nature of the difference It would be buck if LeBron James ever or it by the way doesn't mean to be LeBron James doesn't even be the greatest current men's basketball player Right it could be someone who's just a pretty good College basketball One basketball player a good D1 basketball player would completely dominate any WME 18 that he was on any of And that's going to happen Like this is inevitable right there is going to be a dude Who decides that he's a girl either for money nobody talks about this right? There's a lot of money to be pet to be made for a man to pretend to be a woman if it let's just say you're a college Men's player fuck and you average 12 13 points a game in a college men's league You probably have no chance to play in the NBA. It's really hard only 60 players get drafted every year And it's really hard to make a team only 450 NBA players and they're from all over the world right this huge international population now But you could remember Lee at Thomas was the 400th best men swimmer and He became a women's champion within a year You didn't have to do any surgeries right like it's not like you have to chop your penis off Why couldn't you pretend people put on weight all the time for television roles right? Britain Fraser just won the Oscar for the whale for you know playing like a 500 pound dude why couldn't you just pivot and be the star of the WHBA and it sounds laughable But when you got Bud Light and target tuck bathing suits the amount of money that you would make millions of dollars and You could even do it as a force as long as you didn't let on to the farce publicly Do a behind-the-scenes documentary for a year where you point out how absurd this is and You would make millions of dollars. I Mean when they're talking about woman of the year when it's a man We've crossed the Rubicon's already. Oh, yeah This is their their positioning is they all have to go along with this and so this is also why you can see there their argument requires full suspension of your critical faculties because if One part of it starts to fall apart and all falls apart. Yeah, cuz it is all rooted in falsehood So this is why they require and and every little aspect of it. They're so The left and the the trans activists are are so honestly kind of vicious about I mean if you don't use the right pronoun you're a bad person think about this There was a policy and this came up even with the daily wire and they were concerned with the what is a woman video There was a policy of misgendering somebody Could get you banned from Twitter. Yes dead naming somebody which a lot of you maybe Forget or don't even know dead naming somebody is using someone's old name before they transitioned That they really wanted to treat this like a crime the whole point though is to erase everyone's Previous identity and reality and to make everybody this is what I said members They make you complicit in these things when it's covid they make you complicit by masking you up like an imbecile between bites on a plane And have you stand seven feet apart from people outside in the grocery store to go into the grocery store where there's no rules about standing apart like They they make us all they taint us all with the idiocy and there's the same thing with the trans agenda They make us all go along with this we play along with these rules Just because we want to be nice or we don't want to close problems Then we realize so I'm a part of this now Like I'm actually going around lying to right and that makes it harder for everybody to see through and to stand up and to say what's right And I just come back all the time. I had a friend talk about this with me recently If you are let's say seven or eight years old now But I'm sure when you were seven or eight years old you go to the playground There are a lot of girls who are tomboys, right? This is a super common thing What in many parts of the country now we're doing is telling those girls. Hey You're actually a boy Think about how destructive that is to identity instead of you know like a young kid who? Let's be honest when they're really young kids. There's not that much necessarily Difference between the genders like you have a lot of seven eight year old girls who play on boys baseball teams or basketball teams This is this is very destructive to their sense of identity to your point also If you were to have a trans you know somebody who takes this position MSNBC host morning Joe They they all have to go along with this or else they get this so they all play along They all play along with the lie and if they don't they get they get pilloried good word And I shouldn't I shouldn't good word myself, but I like that. I don't pull that you we should good word each other Anyway, um they get in a lot of trouble and what's interesting to me is they will They wouldn't be able to tell you an eight-year-old who who is you know trans a boy who is a actually a girl They're telling them what is the difference between that boy and a girl or rat? You know saying well one Yeah, if you're a girl What are the differences between a girl and that individual because they're obviously not a girl So they can't they always want to tell you about how that how the switch exists Well, what do you tell a girl about why she's not the same as that boy? The whole thing is incoherent. It makes no sense. Yes and that's to your point of merely by accepting any of it and look my acceptance is if you're an adult Make a choice that I can adult But this idea and I cannot encourage you to watch the doc we were talking about that's now for free up on social media What is the woman because it completely destroys the entire ideology of this era the problem clay with waiting until adulthood the problem with the trans movement waiting until adulthood and this is core this is central to all of it is They want this to be a civil rights matter and If a civil rights matter only kicks in when someone is 19 It's not an immutable characteristic or 18. It's not an immutable characteristic So this is the sea again. You have to go along with all of the lies or else all of the lies start to collapse on each other We'll get back to this wall to tell you about what we're doing on our weekends Come back to you in just a second here But you know small business owners listen up Please a lot of you are already getting the benefit of the brain trust over innovation refunds If you haven't yet you need to check these guys out They're lawyers and accountants at innovation refunds are experts on the little known IRS tax refund Call the employee retention credit or the erc if you're a business owner You owe it to yourself and your business to see if you qualify start online at their website Get refunds calm the erc tax credit is a refund on your already paid taxes.

I own the DVD in college remember we had DVDs I saw many times for me. It's brave heart. I just oh, I just love that movie I don't know what you know, I just love it.

I don't care Carrie has never seen it Braveheart never seen braveheart and so I said honey if we're gonna have a movie night We are gonna do it is a fabulous movie. It's so good. I mean this is that's like peak late 90s early 2000s Movie cinema. I think is as good as it gets and braveheart right up there with me gladiator I know a mrs. Travis loves gladiator is my wife's love movie We also see that's a solid choice and she hasn't ready to go. You don't have a favorite movie I just feel like that's such a you're such an opinionated guy I it's a great question and there's so many movies that we you know that I'll flip around and catch on But I don't have one where you know it might be I'll give you I'll give you my answer I Think Indiana Jones the last crusade Is maybe the best movie that has ever been made see I like movies that Will stand up so if you like them when you're eight you also would like them when you're 80 and Getting to watch the 80s movies with my kids that's up there and then back to the future is also pretty impossible to top I think I Love back the future Mike.
