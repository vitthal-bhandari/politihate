Welcome in Wednesday edition Clay Travis Buck Sexton Show. We hope wherever you may be across the world around the country that you are having a fantastic midpoint of your week. And that you are ready to hang out with us for the next three hours and hopefully have some fun while also being entertained. We've got a ton of different topics to dive into with you. The latest on the Nashville school shooting and the continued fallout surrounding that. The Santas versus Trump polling data continues to come out. Maybe the dumbest opinion in sunny Hostin's career on the view. We've got Dr. Fauci being rewarded with a multi million dollar book advance. And also when you consider all of the cities in America right now, it's possible the Washington DC district attorney is prosecuting the fewest of all of the crimes that are occurring in the nation's Capitol. I was there yesterday back home in Nashville today. And how does that compare to Jan 6 also is the Trump indictment in New York City falling apart. They are not hearing anymore reportedly on the Trump indictment this week. Maybe not also next week. We'll break all that down for you. But Buck, we wait now in Nashville for the release of the trans shooters manifesto. I am told that it is going to be released when exactly it will be released remains unclear. I think it should happen today. The Nashville police did a phenomenal job responding to the shooting at the school. We played and talked about the videos from inside of that school, how heroic so many of those officers were. The Nashville police have been very forthcoming with all the details of this investigation on a fairly rapid fashion. Now is the time to share that manifesto because in the absence of that manifesto coming out, many people are trying to fill this void, so to speak, and argue, I'm sure you're seeing all the same headlines that I am, Buck, where, for instance, NBC NBC News put up a headline yesterday that said, fear pervades Tennessee's trans community amid focus on Nashville shooter's gender identity. We were already fearing for our lives. Now it's even worse. That's a quote. No, it's worse for the kids that were killed by the trans woman or by the woman who was a trans man, whatever you want to say. It's definitely worse for them, yet their suffering is not being covered. And I wanted to play this for you, Buck. They're now arguing, Oh, the victims would be alive if they hadn't passed the trans bills in Tennessee. This is a tick tocker, red a hern that is sharing an opinion that has been widely discussed in the trans community in the wake of this shooting. Listen to cut one. I wonder if the parents of the victims of the Nashville shooting today would still have their children. If these trans bills in Tennessee, we're never a thing. I'm not a parent. But if I were, I'd be real real mad at the government. I'd be real real mad at the government. Let's be very clear, Clay, that here you have people on the left. We just played audio. That was from the lives of TikTok account, who are explicitly saying that if there are more of these bills to prevent the mutilation, the gender mutilation of children, that there will be more school shootings, that there'll be more people killed, there'll be more violence, essentially. It's it's an implicit threat. This is what terrorists do. This is what terrorists do. It's, you know, nice, nice society you have there be a shame if something happened to it, it would be a shame if something crumbled the civilization that you think you live in. And the media, I have to say, it is remarkable to me that I expect that in the aftermath of something like this, when the perpetrator is someone that is, first of all, always elevated generally by the left, right? The trans community in general is constantly elevated. So this is they're telling us all the time the trans community is marginalized and victimized. And we hear all these stats about the the murder of the people within the trans community. They try to call the new status. They try to say this Saturday, they're having an event about the trans genocide. When you actually look at the stats, there are very few trans people who are murdered, in part because they're very few trans people and the trans people who are killed are overwhelmingly killed as either they're involved in the sex trade, there's some situation that there are not hate crimes where trans people are being murdered all over the country. That's just not true. It doesn't happen. It doesn't happen. So this notion that there is this great fear, and by the way, of course, everybody should live in safety, security, and decency. We are. That's being told on this show. We're very anti murder. We're very anti murder on the show. But there's a lie that is being told that there's this constant threat, this constant fear that the trans community lives under for their safety. When this is very similar with the left does on other arguments to this is not about safety. This is about policy. This is about whether or not people will be forced by government power to celebrate what many more people are starting to see now is a severe mental illness is actually not something that should be elevated and treated as an affirmation of identity and all the rest of it, all the stuff that we hear and use the different pronouns and all of this. What they're doing is what the left always does. If you don't agree with me, you are literally committing violence against me. That's what they say. If you don't agree with me on go down any range of issues. This is why they shout down speakers in schools. This is why they don't allow conservatives to even have a voice that they will hear from whether it's a fifth circuit judge as we saw recently at Stanford University Law School. So they're doing this purposefully so that people won't have an honest conversation about it. And the media, by the way, is going. I thought they would be horrible, but they find new levels of horribleness. I mean, there is something ghoulish and demonic in the soul of the Democrat aligned media. This was from Reuters. I'm not even picking the crazy far left stuff. I mean, that's what we just had lives of TikTok clay. Former Christian student kills three children, three staff in Nashville student. Did you see that headline? That is the road. Former Christian student kills three. Oh, gee, I wonder, are we all supposed to be so stupid that we don't see the politics? The victims here, Christian children, Christian adults, a Christian school, but because the trans left wing lunatic perpetrator attended the school 20 years ago, that's what they lead with clay. Gee. And we played for you, I believe it was yesterday, CNN saying, look, the fact that the shooter was trans is a major distraction from the real story here, which is guns. Yesterday, MSNBC also climbing on that argument, focusing on the transgender identity. MSNBC. This is Ali Velshi. They're saying here in this conversation, it's actually uniquely dangerous to the trans community to point out that someone in the trans community committed cold blooded murder of six innocent people. Listen, we have no idea if the shooter was undergoing hormone therapy, but in the words of Congressman Green, quote, everyone can stop blaming guns now, which is really code for focusing on the shooter's identity, something conservatives don't seem overly concerned about when the shooter is a white man, which is often trans people are already more likely to experience violence simply because they are trans people. So the right focusing on that is uniquely dangerous. And we have to respond to that, but it is also a distraction because there are plenty of trans people in plenty of countries all over the world. But once again, America is the only nation where shootings like this happen over and over again. So maybe it's not mental health or video games or hormones. Maybe it's the guns. Okay, the guns, the guns, the guns, the guns, the guns are not going anywhere. I wish somebody would just follow down the rabbit hole. Randy Winegard and Zed and Imbecil Buck. But she at least came out and said we need to go collect everybody's guns. Did you see that clip of her basically saying at least whether you agree or disagree with her? And certainly, I think almost everyone listening to us right now disagrees with her. At least she's not pretending away what she wants to do, which is a goal here period. I think you're making it. I think this is an important point that that you're making here, which is that the only honest argument on the left, the honest argument would be we're taking all of your guns. We're sending agents of the state with guns to take your guns. Yes. And they will shoot you if you don't give your guns up. That is it. Right. That is the only honest argument about gun control taken to its extreme, taken to where it would actually I mean, yes, that's what they want. That's where there be fewer shootings. Right. Yes, this is there was the reality of the nobody had a gun. And if the government took all your guns away, that's Randy Winegard and his argument. Because the other side of this is when they say, okay, we're going to ban AR 15s, I say, well, this this individual went into a went into a grammar school with three guns. A pistol would have been just as deadly under the circumstances, multiple and anyone who wants to argue with this, first of all, they sound like any it's because you just go and look at Fort Hood to pistols, Virginia Tech shooting pistols. So this notion that some kind of restriction on the cosmetics or the magazine or any of that stuff would stop a shooting is just ignorance. That's why the art that this is why people in the Second Amendment community get so frustrated. It's let's have the real talk. You want no Second Amendment lives. You want no guns in civilian hands, period. And you know, what's amazing is they talk about Australia and they'll see, well, look at the Australian buyback program. Look at what a huge success it was. Australia has more guns in private hands now than it did before the buyback program. Just putting that out there too. People have no idea what they are talking about, but they never actually go to the extreme in the argument because Clay, when Joe Biden comes out and says, you know, we're going to ban the salt, right? You know, after he talks about the ice cream flavors, the whole point is to give emotional validation to Democrat voters who think people who own guns are bad and stupid and wrong. That's it. It's it's sticking a finger in the eye of the people on the other side of politics that you don't like. No serious person who knows the data, who knows history and who knows reality thinks that making a change like this, you know, the salt rifle ban, well, it's going to at best you might, if you could eliminate every single rifle shooting in the country, you might bring down the violence rate by 1%. And of course, that's not going to happen because people are going to have illegal guns because that's who kills people. Buck, are you when this happened, we were talking off air. And I said, based on these details, before we didn't say it publicly on the air, but I was like, this feels like it's probably going to be a trans shooter to me. That was my prediction. And you just you all know, Clay said this to me. And I will confirm this because you just said it on air. Yeah. Right when this happened, Basin was going on in Tennessee and I looked at them and, you know, we just, of course, we would never say anything in the air. We couldn't, you know, provide factual basis for and don't want to speculate speculate. But the two of us talking about where this was going privately, Clay thought this was what was going to happen. And then I said, and if it, if I'm right, this story will vanish because the CNNs and the MSNBCs will not want to talk about a trans shooter. If this were a Trump supporting right winger, Joe Biden would already be on the ground in Nashville. Just like Joe Biden didn't go to East Palestine, Ohio. Buck, why is the president not here? President traveled to Buffalo. President traveled to basically anywhere where he can sell the narrative of right-wing extremism, try to tie it into January 6th, everything else. I don't think he's going to come to Nashville at all over the shooting. And look, I understand there are a lot of people out there listening to me in Nashville who say, yeah, we don't want him here. We don't want him in the state of Tennessee. I understand. But where the president travels sends a message about what the president thinks is important. And Joe Biden said, I'm here to restore the soul of the nation. Wouldn't that include pointing out when crazy trans people are, it appears, attacking religious people that seems like a direct threat to the soul of the nation? What could be a more obvious and ghoulish and and horrific evil than an adult walking into a school like this and seeing a nine year old girl and shooting that nine year old girl and then doing it again and again, there is nothing, there is nothing more evil than this. And every person, certainly every parent in the country knows that why Joe Biden has not already flown to this part of Nashville and is not hugging the parents and telling them, we'll do everything we can for you. We are so sorry as a nation. I would I would like to hear some Democrat try to explain why that has not happened yet. He's too busy. Has to go has to go, you know, go for day number 400 out at the beach house. Really too busy for this? Unacceptable. Unacceptable. And if it were a Trump individual, Trump supporter, he would have already been here. I really do believe that three years ago at this time, we were all grappling with the shutdowns put in place by our government over COVID. You might remember, run at the grocery store when you couldn't find things empty shelves. A lot of people then decided, you know what, I need to take care of the food security in my household.

This coming from zero hedge citing Politico reporting that the Trump grand jury. You got it? Yep. Yeah, I'll read. I'll read this story. Just broke eight minutes ago, Buck. And the headline is Manhattan Trump grand jury set to break for a month. A previously planned, this says hiatus, would push back a potential indictment. And here's the opening paragraph. The Manhattan grand jury examining Donald Trump's alleged role in a hush money payment will not, was, isn't expected to hear evidence in the case for the next month due to a previously scheduled hiatus. The break would push any indictment to late April at the earliest. Again, look, it doesn't sound like something's coming based on that. I think I think this is all going to collapse like every other just maniacal effort to get Trump on some. Trumped up charge. There's nothing flimsier of all of the investigations and all the all the theoretical criminal prosecutions of Trump. I mean, this is honestly the most absurd and the weakest. So it looks like they won't be able to just push it through. I think that the month long delay here, they'll just use this to let this fade out. You know, then Bragg will tell his people, you know, Bragg will tell his office and the narrative will be that he took it to the brink. But in the, in the interest of not, not of justice, but in the interest of, you know, of national reconciliation and not having Trump supporters get violent, he decided not to. They'll come up with some story. I really don't think they're going to do it now. Just because think about this, right? I mean, they're going to come back. It's so much easier to dismiss this and walk away when no one's talked about it for a month. But in the meantime, it creates this. Oh, no, we haven't, we haven't bailed out. We're, this was planned. We're just doing this. If it was planned, why did everybody think that this was going to come down a few days ago? Right. I think you're right. And again, if they're not going to hear this case until late April, you run basically into summer very quickly. And then it gets hard to justify when you're only a few months out from Iowa voting. Many small business owners are getting a refund of their taxes from the IRS part of a program Congress passed to help small businesses get through the pandemic. It's called the Employee Retention Credit or ERC. And this is completely different than the PPP, a company that really understands this is get refunds.com. And they've helped businesses get $3 billion in refunds to date. In less than eight minutes, you can see if your business qualifies for ERC assistance. Your business may be eligible for a payroll tax refund of up to $26,000 per employee kept on payroll during COVID-19. There's no upfront charge either. They don't get paid unless your business gets its refund. Many businesses believe they won't qualify based off incomplete or outdated information. So don't let this opportunity pass you by, because this payroll tax refund is only available for a limited time. Go to get refunds.com. That's get refunds.com. We thought maybe invite invite the two of us on the Clay and Buck extra special. Maybe that maybe the view isn't the dumbest show in America that airs on a daily basis. Now they've continued. Joy Bayhars falling apart, but Sonny Hostin sometimes escapes our ridicule as also a uniquely dumb individual. It's like Joy Bayhars, Joe Biden, and Sonny Hostin might be her Kamala Harris that the duo is so awful. Sometimes it's hard to know which is worse. Sonny Hostin said she doesn't care at all about China imprisoning Muslims, because black people are put in jail in America. This is really what she said. Listen. And so as a woman of color with a six foot two black kid in college and a five foot seven, five foot eight black kid in high school, I don't see that part of American exceptionalism. I'm sorry. I think this country has a lot of problems that could be solved. Yes. Maybe they're putting Muslims in jail in Afghanistan. I think you mentioned and China, they're putting a lot of black more black people in jail here. Okay. Okay. What do we think are the chances that any of the ladies of the view, first of all, know what a weager is or would be able to spell it? I don't know that to be fair. I'm not sure that I could spell weir. So it is tough to be fair. That is that is a really hard one to spell. So but that is a group that she is what she's saying. Muslim. She's talking about the Turkic weigures of Western China in Xinjiang province who are in literal. And I use that word appropriately because people overuse it all the time. Yes. Literal concentration camps. Yes. Because they are the wrong ethnicity and religious group for the Chinese Communist Party. She is comparing that to people going to prison for rape, murder, drugs, every serious felony, every serious crime in the country. And like there's a similar. Yes. This is important. Because she would probably get fired on its face if she said something like that about the Holocaust, right? Oh, I don't really care about the Holocaust because we put a lot of black men in jail in America today. And why don't why does the height of her kids matter? This is really weird. Like just you said, I've got a six foot two black son in college and then I've got a five seven or five eight black son in high school. It's like, why does that? Why does anybody care what height your kids are? It doesn't make any sense at all. But it's weird that she would I think she has a law degree. Look up Sonny Hostin. Yes. She does. She was so fun. Fun fact. I was I was on a pilot for a CNN show where they ran a bunch of different people. And if I remember correctly, she was one of the people on the panel and she was supposed to be the legal expert. I mean, that's funny. It's self. Yeah. How could you be so unaware? And that's what I'm saying about the Holocaust idea when you're in a concentration camp, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. There. This is important because I swear to God, Clay, I'm I didn't interrupt you. I'm sorry. I swear that I was going to say, I better son that she's so worried about goes to Harvard. Where do you think her son goes to school, Clay? Give you one guess. Oh, Harvard. I'm guessing that Harvard student. And I am sure that it is light. You know, it's very hard to go to the number one university on the planet because your mom is a famous person. Amazing. Right. Dad is their dad. She's married to an orthopedic surgeon. So if you want to talk about privileged offspring in America today, mom who is on a daily television show, dad who is an orthopedic surgeon. And the mom is going to sit on television and say, I don't care about what goes on in China because there are black people in jail in America. Well, concentration camps, you get put there because of your identity, not because of something that you did, right? And for her to not be smart enough to understand the difference. And she also said Afghanistan, the this is this is, you got so much wrong far far away place, you know, all the same door with Muslims like who cares. This is this is to me evidence of the cover that elites, elites in America often give to China because they try to falsely equivocate for errors that may not be like our small imperfections. They use this is what the MBA does. This is what so many people, this is what MSNBC, what, what, what CNN do, they cover for China by pointing out that America is imperfect. And they point out our imperfections as a way to justify not caring about the blatant human rights violations of China. I think also this comparison with China is particularly interesting because here is a multi millionaire, Sonny Hostin, who is essentially saying, I don't, I don't care about what's going on in the forced labor camps with the forced sterilization of women with over a million people confirmed and the numbers probably much higher than that going through this, who are also subject to extreme brutality, execution, and torture for speaking out against the state. I can't focus on that because I have a son who's at Harvard and it's really hard and dangerous to be at Harvard. He's six to buck. I mean, her six foot two son. I mean, the the races and that her son must be experiencing at Harvard compared to the racism that is going on in communist China in the concentration camps. I can imagine why she really, you know, she can't focus on number two. Can only think about number one. How often is our stupid thing set on the view? I mean, can I tell you a lot of the problem? They couldn't have us on the view because if we actually went there and got to, they would try to shout us down. But the people on that set are so stupid and so ignorant. I know people don't like name calling here. Sorry. They're so lacking in knowledge, wisdom, context. I don't mind the name calling, by the way, I think they are stupid and ignorant. Well, I'm just saying no, it would be impossible to have a conversation with them where, and that's also why, by the way, they have like Joy Behar there so they can always revert back to they want to speak about serious issues. This has been described and it was actually John Stewart that I initially think was written about this way. Clown nose on clown nose off like sometimes Joy Behar wants to be serious. Sometimes Joy Behar when she gets it's not, it's not that she can make jokes and do political analysis. It's when her political analysis shows she has no idea what she's talking about, has never read anything nor has any knowledge of the subject matter, then it's just overall just making jokes as this constant excuses as a scape valve as a cover. And also, you know this, and I know this, but I think a lot of our listeners may not. There's a behind the scenes staff, probably of 30 people or more working on the view. So it's not only that people like Sonny Hostin are really woefully misinformed and ignorant about many of the topics upon which they're speaking, it's that they're willfully doing that in many respects because if you were on that show and you wanted to be surrounded by super smart people who could inform you to make sure that you get facts right and don't sound like such an imbecile, they would be able to have that staff, right? Like this isn't some situation where it's a YouTube show and they don't make much money and sometimes people are going to screw up. This is a highly produced, incredibly lucrative daytime television show, which has all the resources it needs to make its hosts as intelligent as they can be. And they still look like idiots every day. I will say I actually think that they their service to the Democrat party is to make Democrat voters feel more comfortable in their ignorance. It's it's like hanging out with the dumb kids in the class, but they're the cool kids in the class. And so you feel okay not doing your homework too, because the cool kids aren't doing their homework. So I'm going to go, you know, smoke cigarettes after class with them and fail. That's that's the purpose of the view to make people who don't want to do the work to learn anything feel okay with that. And by the way, if you think these shows don't matter, these are overwhelmingly consumed by women that air during the day suburban moms and grandmas. And those are the people that are going to be deciding this election. That's the reality. Men overwhelmingly vote for Republican candidates. That's the truth. Can we increase the number of men who vote for Republican candidates? Probably. But women are the true swing voters by and large in the suburbs. And they're listening to these imbeciles for families with high school seniors graduating this spring topic at the dinner table. All too often is what college you're going to go to. It's one of the great privileges in this nation, the availability and access we all have to education. Few people appreciate the process as much as the faculty and administration at Hillsdale College. They won't say it, but I will the college provides their students with the best classical liberal arts education in America. When these students graduate, they've studied the great books, the history of Western civilization in America, the meaning and history of the Constitution. Hillsdale was founded in 1844 to offer the kind of education needed to preserve civil and religious liberty. 180 years later, it holds true to that mission today while refusing to accept one penny of taxpayer funding. And that includes not even indirectly in the form of student grants and loans. Even if you've never stepped foot on the campus in Michigan, you can learn from Hillsdale for free through in primus, their monthly newsletter, and by taking online courses on American history, the Constitution and other subjects. See for yourself. Learn more about Hillsdale at clayinbuck4hillsdale.com. That's clayinbuck4hillsdale.com. Have you ever felt like the wealthiest in America play by a different rule book?

And by the way, that is how you pronounce it. If you're going to be a Fauciite a memoir. How many people want to buy? I mean, I have a theory about a little bit. What do you think's going on here? I have a theory about this. Anthony Fauci could just put his little face on a book and have whatever title he wants. And he will sell at least hundreds of thousands of copies. And he would sell it even if every single page was blank. Because the purpose of the Fauci book is like the purpose of still masking, which is to show everybody how smart and sciencey and liberal you are. So this is a this is the ultimate hobby. Copy table social justice. 100 book per cent. Can I tell you something? I've I've looked at looked at houses with with Carrie, you know, just a little house shopping, looking around and seeing things. And she always laughs because I'm always just curious. I always want to take a look at the books. Oh, yeah. Because I know right away, I always could tell right away. What we know who not that I mean, I live in a house that lives at sold. It doesn't really matter. But I just think it's kind of funny. I can tell who the person is. And then with Instagram, you could figure it out right away too. And I'm never wrong. But I can look at the books in someone's home. And I basically know who I'm dealing with. Even with that. And I do think you're right. I think that the Fauci book probably will be right up there with like Michelle Obama's becoming or whatever the name of that book was that sold like three million copies. How many people actually ever opened that book? I think less than five percent of the people that that bought Michelle Obama's book, I would bet less than five percent of them read the whole book. That's my I don't think I don't think that's a crazy perspective. Right. They just you can never check these numbers. But if you actually if you got if you got a hundred Michelle Obama book purchasers in a room and gave them the most basic reading comprehension test on that book, five of the hundred would pass. That would be such a good that would be such a point. It would be amazing. But you know, it is. That would be a great television quiz. You know, I think you're probably right. I would bet Michelle Obama's book is the single most purchased. So you can look good for purchasing it book of the 21st century. That would be my guess. Now there are other ones, Hillary Clinton's memoir, Barack Obama. I tend to think that left wingers would be way more impressed by the idea that you read a book, which is why I'm citing those in particular. But I just even with that in context, I don't think that Fauci is enough of an icon that even that many people will buy his book. This reminds me book years and years ago. And I can't even remember the guy's name as the first athlete to come out as gay. Basketball player, one of our staff can look it up ESPN, I believe published the book. They turned it into like, it was the biggest reveal that you could ever imagine. Oh my goodness, this former NBA player is gay. And now he's written a memoir about it. And they you couldn't have given more publicity to this book. It sold like 7,000 copies. And it was probably the most promoted sports book of the year because most people didn't care about the guy. And they all said he didn't care about it being gay. Right? Like, so what? Okay, so you're gay and you played basketball. That doesn't really, most people don't care unless you're really good at the sport too. And then you might be like, okay, this sounds like an interesting book to read. Totally fell flat on its face. I feel like this Fauci book is going to be the same way. Because I think everybody on the planet, he'll come out and do his usual interviews everywhere. But I don't think it's like, I don't think he's as beloved as Michelle Obama. I think it's even faker that people claim that they like him. Well, I mean, Michelle Obama probably got like 15 or 20 million for her book all in, right? I mean, it was more than five than five million. But to Michelle Obama's credit, the number of copies of her book that sold, the publisher made money. This fellas, if you're a Democrat, yeah, if you're a Democrat, you bought the Michelle Obama book pretty much. I mean, that's, that's the way I think that a lot of people would view that book. I think they're going to lose millions of dollars on. Oh, I don't think they're being interested. I don't think so. I think that there. When does the book come out? Do we know? I don't even think it's been, I mean, it's going to be ghost written, obviously. I don't even know when it's supposed to come out. But the Fauci book is I think it's this one. We'll table this one. I think it's going to sell pretty well because Clay, there are, I'm telling you, when I came back from honeymoon, whatever that was six weeks ago, now a month ago, I can't even remember the number of people in the LAX airport that were, you know, I'm going to be in New York this week coming up next week, the number of people in the LAX airport with masks on. I'm not saying it was a super high percentage, but they were all over the place. It was like five to 10% of everybody in that airport at this stage of the game. All of those people will buy the Fauci book because it's like the, you know, it'll be the security bible of Fauciism. I don't know what else to say. It'll be their religious text. I just, you know, I flew back from DC early this morning. And this is where I just can't get past every time I'm flying now. Young kids in masks. What are their parents doing? If you got a four year old and you're in an airport in 2023 and your kid is still wearing a mask, that is to me so clearly child abuse. I just feel bad for the kid because I can only imagine how hellish the last three years of that kid's life has to pass to have been if they're still a parent demanding they wear a mask after three years of COVID. Imagine what restrictions were put on those kids, how few of them got to go outside and live normal lives. And unfortunately, I think their immune systems are going to bear the brunt of that over protectiveness for years and years to come. Totally agree. Come up here in a few moments. We're going to talk about you, Democrats really have an idea of how to bring down crime. If you look in DC and what's going on there, go blow your mind how lawless it's becoming. It's Ryan Seacrest here. If you're a musician and you have dreams of opening for some of the biggest names in the industry now is your chance.
