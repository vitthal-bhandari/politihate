    "text": " Hello you sick twisted freak. Welcome to the program. On today's show we talk about the border and the mess and we talk to one of the Attorney Generals who filed suit. It was heard in the Supreme Court yesterday. I don't know if it went real well, but trying to get the stay in Mexico doctrine reinstated. Also, we talk a little bit about Russia and, you know, does it feel like maybe we're giving too much information to the press on how we're helping Ukraine blow things up? Seems like we're begging Russia to start a war directly with us. It's what it seems like at this time. It kind of does course more news on Elon Musk and Riaz Patel, an old friend of the program, one of the more honest people I know, starting something to connect with people that I think you're going to really enjoy hearing. All this and more on today's podcast, which by the way is sponsored by relief factor. If you're one of the millions that have pain day to day, stew, name your pain. What is it? You. You're entirely completely in and every way. It's all you. Here's the thing, relief factor attacks your pain as long as it's inflammation. Four different directions where ibuprofen only does it from one, so it can give you ibuprofen 8000 and for me it doesn't work. But this does relief factor. Try it. 70% of the people who try it go on to order more. Just try it for three weeks. If you're not working for you in three weeks, you're probably not going to see any change. But I have and so have thousands of Americans and listeners. You want to drug free and natural way to get your life back, go to relieffactor.com. That's relieffactor.com or 1-800-4-Relief. You're listening too. The best of the Glenn Beck program. This is the Glenn Beck program. Welcome tonight on my Wednesday night special, a detailed look at the War on Gender and the Dark Money Network that's driving it. What we're witnessing is something that was the seeds were planted a long time ago, gender ideology. This is not spreading because of natural colonization. There are bees giving pollen to everywhere they possibly can to make these things grow. Those bees have been very, very busy. It's dangerous ideology combined with super wealthy progressives. Corporations are involved, international organizations and an army of nonprofits that form the poison that is currently making its way through the body of America. Dark Money Network, the funding of the War on Gender. Tonight only on Blaze TV. It's my special at 9pm. We'll see you there, 9pmblazeTV.com, Blaze TV, YouTube and Pluto. Now, I have been talking to you about a parallel economy. I want to bring to you different things that people are doing to help. We are playing a nasty game of catch-up. I talked about the Tides Foundation what, 15 years ago? The Tides Foundation, this network of money is astounding, as you will see tonight, on what the left is doing. It's all shady. I don't want to be involved in anything shady, but I do want to stop giving my money to places that are not helping. There is a new credit card that is coming out tonight. I want to make sure I understand it. The credit card, it's a credit card for conservatives. It's called Coin, C-O-I-G-N. Rob Collins is the guy who's launching this. He's the founder. Rob, how are you, sir? I'm good. Thanks for having me on. This is a real honor. A long-time listener. I really appreciate the show. So, people know who you are. You founded the American Action Network. You ran the National Republican Senatorial Campaign in 2014, which was a good year. You also were the confirmation Sherpa for Neil Gorsuch with Donald Trump. You've been around. You know the game that everybody is playing. Tell me what's happening here with Coin. As you just described, I spent a lot of time of my 20s, 30s in politics. I invested a lot of that energy I had to help win elections. I loved it. It was great. I just started to see that while politics is critical and that's how we make our policies, we got to start innovating in the private sector. We got to start disrupting the model because it is so skewed against 40-50 million Americans that if we don't innovate in the private sector, we're never going to be able to catch up. The Tide Foundation, as you said, the top 10 credit cards have given it over a million and a half dollars. Let me assure you, there is no analogous contribution for things differently than the Tide Center. Our voices, sometimes they rise up and we've seen that in the last week, but generally it's just a dull murmur because we're spread throughout the credit system. We talk about it. We complain to one another. But for the largest ideological group in America, we're out of the public square. We have to whisper even amongst ourselves about things that we don't like. This is just a way for folks who like to talk about it or folks who are just quiet but want to give back to know two things. With coin, you're going to get a great credit card. You may 1% cash back, all the protections, all the stuff you expect from every other credit card you're at. Every time you swipe, coin, our company will take a piece of the merchant fee and contribute it to conservative charities. We're going to have a system where folks will be able to vote and feel like, hey, they asked me to do something. I got my card, I used it, and then once a quarter, we're going to have four or five charities will put up for a vote. I voted for a charity and they got $40,000, $50,000 to do good things that I really support. Next time, we'll have some different charities. Our biggest thing is trying to help people find that voice again and find that collective action that says, hey, listen to us and also feel good that their commerce is investing in things that they believe in. I think that's really important. I'm very concerned about the ESG standards and the banking community, and this is still tied to the banking community. You're using MasterCard and Visa as your backbone. You can't see 50 years of control to the left. We like it back, please. I can tell you, we have true patriots who as investors, because we went to the respectable places, we went to the venture fund, and they say, you would start by saying, hey, we have a, 40% of the American public that's looking for something, we have the market research, and they say, great, and we say conservative, and they say, not interested. We want to grow. These are conservatives longer tenure in their job, own their own home, own their own car, married. They are the cream of the credit crop, and yet we would get the door slammed in our face because we'd say the C-word. We had to go to people who understand the movement and are willing to invest in parallel economy startups, and if it wasn't for them, I wouldn't be on your show today. That's just the reality of where we are. What is the main goal? You see this in five years. What is your hope that this turns into? A, we can donate tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars to conservative charities. Now, hang on just a second. When you say conservative charities, what kind of charities are you for? I know it's going to be up for a vote, but are you thinking, for instance, like first liberty, ones that are defending things in the court? Or something that is going to rescue people? I think there's two ways to look at it, which is we'd love to have people suggest charities on our... We launched yesterday, and we've already had probably 30 or 40 emails of people saying, hey, consider this one. So we'd like to have a rotation, and we'd like to have broad categories. Like I heard earlier, you were talking about tunnels to towers. We'd love to partner with great veterans charities that aren't afraid of conservatives. Education, religious freedom, smaller, smarter government, conservation, kind of offer folks. We want to have a broad spectrum, but we want to rotate out the charities. We'd love to find smaller charities that are starting up and give them a little boost, but also support bigger ones. The biggest thing for us is we want to make sure conservatives, and we want to make sure that if our folks, you know, if coin money is going, our customers, that they deliver. They're transparent. You know, that the charity rating firm said these are good charities, and that they really... That the ROI for our folks is tangible. That's really important to us. So how do people get involved with coin? You can go to our website, coign.com, coin.com, and like us on whatever social media, you know, Facebook, we're all over the place, and then just tell your friends. I mean, instead of saying, you know, buying clothes doors isn't so terrible, like tell your friends, join this. Let's start. Let's have an open conversation. Let's get back kind of where we've always been in the country, which is, you can speak your mind, but also you don't have, you know, the corporations funding causes that. It's not enough that they push their own worldview. They don't like us, and they're trying to push us out. Yeah. And indoctrinate our kids and tell us what to think and how to act when it should be, you know what, like you're a customer of ours, and we respect you. You should respect us. I know that we have, you know, we have a sponsor, Patriot Mobile, and they've done the same thing. They're on the same cell towers, so they're renting space from these big guys, so they could provide the coverage. But I know I'm a member because I don't want to give the big cell companies any of my money. I know I have to, you know, Patriot Mobile is paying them a little bit for the space on the tower, but at this point, that's the best option we have. I want to stop giving these people money. And this is just like Patriot Mobile. This is another way to do it with your credit card. So if you have Visa, MasterCard, or anything, you might want to consider today going to coin.com. That's C-O-I-G-N. Any reason why you spelled it that way other than because you couldn't get coin.com? You nailed it. Yeah. We wanted a short clean website. We wanted a short clean name, and we know we'll have a little name building to do. But just, you know, we like the alliteration to coin card for conservatives. CoinC-O-I-G-N.com, coin.com. Rob, thank you very much. Let us know how it's going. We love it. Thank you. I appreciate it. You bet, bye-bye. This is the best of the Glenn Beck program, and we really want to thank you for listening. I know what you're thinking. Glenn, you seem more confident today. Yes, well, my friends, that started last night. I applied my new secret weapon for confidence. I call it sweat block. Guess what it does. The sweat block wipes are applied at night and protect you from embarrassing or uncomfortable sweat for days. Here's the best part. It really works. Sweat block was developed by a Harvard doctor who was tired of, you know, getting up front of people with, you know, sweat tacos under his arms. His problem is now our solution. If you're like me, and you might not suffer from excessive sweating, but when the lights are on and I'm on stage, the underarm faucets kind of turn on once in a while. It's a lifesaver for your pitch giving, hard working, date going, average people. A godsend for you, Jeffy-like sweaty beast. I mean, I don't know how you... Anyway, if you have an awkward teenager, do them a favor. Armum was sweat block. Also try the deodorant stick. Best I've ever tried. Get it all today, 20% off, sweatblock.com promo code BEC or at Amazon. Stu, this is going to come as a surprise to you. But, um, diamond blount. Uh, diamond blount is somebody that was convicted of, uh, rape. Uh, and, uh, diamond is like, okay, well, you know, that's... that was before I became diamond. You know, that's when I was Ramell blount. Okay. Now I'm diamond. And so a judge in New York. So your entire criminal record should be wiped out, right? Well, maybe. Well, maybe. Mm-hmm. Maybe. I mean, she did go to prison for rape. Oh. But because he was now identifying as a woman, he was housed in the women's facility. Oh! Good. This, I, you know, this is one of those things we've always used as an example of the absurd possibilities if this were to continue. No! It's good to know that it is actually happening in real life. No. Yeah. It was a resident. I love that. A resident of the Rosem Singer Center, the section of the prison. Not a prisoner, but a resident. A resident. Okay. It was a section of the prison. Uh, maybe it had drapes and everything else and maybe sewing machines for the women. You know, the women folk, they like pigeons. Like diamonds. You know? Like diamonds, sure. Um, but apparently, uh, diamond also likes to violently rape women in a bathroom. Diamond does? Diamond does? Are you talking about remell? No, diamond. No. No. No. But you're not saying diamond did it as well. No. Diamond did it as well. Wow. What are the odds? No, I can't. They're both related. I mean, they're both named blunt. I think they're, I think they're both related. Um, but, uh, what's the odds that both of them violently raped women? I don't think the percentage chances of this occurring would be anything over a hundred percent. Well, well, I have to tell you. I, uh, I would like to, I'd like to side with you, but I don't know the lesbian experience. Right. You're not well versed in that. No, because you are not because that's not a lesbian. Well, I actually am a lesbian. I am only attracted to women. So I think maybe that now. So that was rape. Okay. Next story, uh, that just doesn't seem to make sense to me. CNN executives, when they started their streaming platform that lasted a full four weeks, I'd like to spend the time counting, but it's just two, one, two, three. It's just too high of a number to spend that kind of time counting the weeks. Um, they, um, the CNN executives thought that they could attract, uh, the, the, the, the thought that they could attract 30 million global subscriptions because they, they broke this down. Apparently there's a memo with this. Mm hmm. Uh, 29 million CNN super fans. There, they believe there are 29. They believed, believe, believe, hard D. That's a hard C. That's a hard C. Stop on that one. Yeah. Uh, they believed that 20, there were 29 million super fans. Now, mm hmm. I don't know where they come up with that number. Uh, but most of those super fans feel trapped at the airport. Uh, just saying. Right. They are in a very long delay to go to Albuquerque. Yes. And CNN happens to be out of the television. That does not make a super fan. No, it doesn't even make a person who wants to watch super Mac, right? Yeah. It isn't even in people who would what would be enticed to watch it for free. No. They're certainly not going to pay for it. No, no, no. And I, if you had to make an honest guest, a guest of the number legitimately, the number of CNN super fans, and you were in that meeting and they were saying this, no joking around. What would you place that number at? 8,300. Yeah, I would say, I would say super fans globally. I would say less than a hundred thousand. Much less than a hundred thousand. You have to include the insane. You have to weigh more people than the insane people. I'm not saying trash about them. No, I'm not saying all insane. I'm saying there's a subset of insane people. There may be the insane people of the world may be more likely to delve into the world of CNN plus, but they are not exclusively right. Well, the problem is all of those people subscribed. They just they just did it in their imaginary world. Right. So, super fans are still enjoying CNN plus. The fact that they had a legitimate estimate, not a legitimate estimate, but an estimate that someone provided them that they would have 30 million subscribers is crime. I think they're blaming McKinsey for this, the consulting outfit, which is one of the most, you know, well-renowned, you know, were they the ones that came up with? That is a million. I've heard them blamed for it. I don't know for sure if it was them, but that is who is at least getting the shade from inside sources. Sure. I can't blame any of the people working at CNN. They're above, you know, they're above approach. Well, as you know, Glenn, we at this time do not have enough information to judge whether this was a success or failure. I heard that from the potato. I heard that. You heard a potato saying? Yeah, I think it was a potato. It was a potato in a suit, an ill-fitting suit. Really? Yeah. And he was like, we can't really judge, you know, if this is a success or not. How could one know? What information has been provided to make a determination? $300 million spent. No real subscribers. Mm-hmm. And other than this, though, and the fact that it's been shut down already, what information do we have as to judge whether it was a success or failure? Other than those things, we don't have any. We don't have any. So it's too early to know. I think my thought is by the year 2318, we will have a beginning of the understanding as to whether CNN Plus was a success or failure. Sure. It's not that much time. Yeah. This is just too important to pride. It's the most important thing. It's at least CNN has done since it's launched. It's at least 75 years before we can get to that. I mean, they've got as much information as the CDC and the FDA. Right. We got away. Never going to. So, a Hiko Kondo from Japan has just married Hatsum Miku, which is lovely. He's a fictional computer synthesized pop singer. He was very disappointed because he said no one in his family showed up for the wedding. You're kidding me. Wow. I would just like to say that's one of the first things that's come out of Japan that has made sense to me in quite a long time. I think that's the way we should be. We should, in America, I'm not so sure that would happen. I think a lot of people would go, you don't want to hurt his feelings. You don't deny that that is a fictional character and just on his computer. That's his love. We got to bet. Love wins always. Love wins. See, I think I would get, if that invitation came in the mail, my wife would say, we're not going to that. And I would say, are you kidding me? I got to see this. I've got to be a part of this situation. Yeah, I would go with you under that hat. Yes. I'd be like, yeah. Oh, geez. There's material for weeks. Where are you guys going on your honeymoon? And they should have invited us. We would have come. I would have flown to Japan to watch that thing happen. That would have been a fun ceremony. Well, here's one. A man with nine wives, nine wives, nine wives. He has just been married crazily in a church in Brazil. And he says that he just has a sexual appetite that just can't be satiated with just one wife. He sounds like a dream come true, really. And so he tried to have sex by appointment, but he said that was just too difficult because there were times that he was thinking about the other girl and then he wanted to be her. It would be easier. You could just kind of pick on demand, right? You do walk in. That's what it is. It's like what he's done. When he's done. You know, 7-Eleven, they have a bunch of different flavors of monster energy drinks. You don't want to have just one that you would schedule in advance. I don't always have cool ranch Doritos. Right. You might want spicy nacho. You might want that spicy chili, which is spicy sweet chili, which is delicious. Yeah, it's really good. Sometimes I, you know, I just want a candy bar, you know, so you should be able to have whatever you want, whenever you want, whenever you want. When ever, when ever. With it. Asterisk within the bounds of holy matrimony. That is a really important thing. I don't want it would be really a bad thing if people decided they could just have sex outside of marriage when this is going on. Instead, marry as many people as you can and then just rotate through. That's the godly way of doing it apparently. I think it's going to last. Well, now I should say he married. He married eight. He's already lost one. No. Yes. He lost one. Yeah. She on second thought, you know, when she sobered up, she thought I might have had too much communion wine here. Oh, really? Yeah. I thought they were my bridesmaids. And apparently no, they were all his wife. This is why you marry fictional characters. Yeah. They always stick around. Yeah. And they don't see you could delete them. Right. I mean, they're gone. The best of the Glenbeck program. I want to welcome back a very good friend of the program, somebody. If you're a longtime listener of this program, you might remember Rias Petal. He is now the founder of Connect Effect. He is a TV producer, a two time Emmy nominee. Couldn't get it done. I love this story both times. And she wasn't even there. She wasn't there. But he's also a guy that I think we met in 2015 or 2016. And there was shooting. You're a Muslim. You're a gay man. And there was a shooting. And you were, you know, the media was telling you this is really, this is what's happened. And then Trump came along and you're like, okay, I got to know what's really going on. Yeah. And you went up to Alaska and said, I just want to meet these people because I can't live in a world if that's really what I'm surrounded by. Yes. And you found out that's not. Not remotely. Not remotely. That 50% of the population are not the cliche that I was led to believe. They're actually real human beings. And we had such a great time getting together. I still follow you on Instagram. We we chat from time to time. But the thing that always struck me was how honest you always were, you were really looking for information. You weren't trying to prove anything. You just wanted to know what the truth was and how different our understanding of the news was because you lived in your world. Yes. And I lived in my world. And I remember putting things up on the chalkboard and you said, none of those things happened. None of those things I knew about. Yeah. Not all big stories to conservatives. It was weird. Never. And it used to be the strangest thing when I would come here and visit you that I'd get on the plane and leave the L.A. feeds and arrive here completely different news, completely different stories. And I'm like, this is insane. They're two different worlds. So you've been trying to bridge the gap for a long time. And we talked about shows where you could actually talk. Things have only gotten worse. Yes. Absolutely. And I think that was the big problem was the screen world. And I call it the screen world. All the edits that magically appear for us on our phone is the screen world. Is not the real world. It's a very particular point of view and very highly edited. And so to me for seven years, what is the truth? And every time I would bring people together, seven people, ten people, 50 people in Alaska or Dallas or New York, they were never the cliches that I was led to believe. And I constantly was wondering how do they connect and why wouldn't they connect? And really, it came down to the power of the screen world is now the way we see the world. Not people can be standing in front of us and we cannot see them or their humanity because we see them through the edits that we think we know about. It is really terrifying because that's, you know, we were talking off the air. Children's suicide and depression is off the charts. I unbelievable. Unbelievable. And I think it's because of this. There's nothing real. You don't really know people. And COVID only made it worse. No real connections going on. And that's the thing. It's so funny. Everyone seems to be lacking true authentic connection. And the thing that I realized over seven years is that true connection is not remotely information based, even if we're all living in an information age, that the words we exchange are 7% of communication. It's the body language, it's the tone. It's all of those things that create humanity. None of those you get from a screen. You just get the words, which is why sequentially posting it each other gets us absolutely nowhere fast. And so I kept trying to think, what is the way to do this to hard reset, actually physical people in a room so that they can see each other and not see the edits that they think they know about each other? And that took seven years of testing and testing and testing. So how are you going to do this? So it's called Connect Effect. And what it is, it's an in-person. It's an entertainment experience. And it's designed that way because I reached out to a policy institute and they said everything we're doing about bridging and facilitated conversations, not working. People just show up with more information and they just keep exchanging it and no one actually listens and no one actually learns or is impacted. So it was, how can I get people in a physical room and we do 50 to 100 people at a time to really see each other, the people in the room, the real world and not the screen world, not seeing each other through the screen world? And it takes, it's a hard reset of their humanity. So how do you do that? Because I would think that you would, depending on where you are, you would have a lot of conservative show up in some very timid liberals or a lot of liberals show up in some very timid conservatives and you would fight an agenda. Yes. You know what I mean? So how do you, how are you getting that? The thing is the actual Connect Effect, what it is, is this, is that when you connect with someone in a meaningful in person way, in person, human to human, you'll talk openly and honestly. It's how we met. When we sat down opposite each other in 2016 and I came with my information, we just looked at each other and we're like, oh, you're just a human being wants to know. Once you have that connection, you'll talk openly and honestly. When you talk openly and honestly, you will understand and that understanding deepens the connection. That's the Connect Effect. Right. Now people are talking without the connection and it's just this exchanging of information. So they don't talk first. They sit back and from the moment the doors open, there's music, there's images on the screen, two sides of stories that people have never seen, whether it's edits they've seen in the news. Oh yeah, that's what CNN ran. That's what Fox side by side. And it constantly says, which edit do you see? Which edit do you not see? And we're constantly running through history. Here's an edit you do know and edit. So before we even start the program, they're seeing your only, that they're only seeing one edit. And so it would, I would imagine it's very important to let the audience know that you're not trying to change them politically. Not at all. You're just trying to say, you don't know the whole story. You don't know the whole story. And the whole story doesn't necessarily even matter when you are trying to fix things in your world. You and I did a podcast special a while ago where we brought seven Americans together to talk about guns. And it was so great. And they just spiraled and spiraled until the NRA firearms instructor and the mom's demand action woman spent time together, made a joke. And suddenly all the defenses were gone because they had connected and then they talked openly they understood and they realized that we're 90% there. But when they were all in a room guarded with their information. Now, before we started it, we were both concerned. This could be a nightmare. Absolutely. And by the end, I think the Marxist professor was like, this was great. Yeah. Yeah. Because they stop seeing each other through the screens and the screens come at you all day every day. And the way the screens work is for attention extraction is what they call it a Google. That's all they're doing. And so whatever you like, they'll send you more of it. If you're angry about this, they'll send you more because the real facts are that anger makes money. The easiest shift to create in a human being is anger. What travels faster than any virus? Fear. And so if the screens are constantly making you feel the world is burning constantly, then you're never going to be able to connect. But they make chaching, chaching, chaching more money the more you're watching. And so we hard reset the shared humanity of people in the room. And it's very interesting because at some point they start realizing, wait, I was going to say that. But I only know that from a screen. So we sell data people, talk about what you know. Did you work on the front line of COVID? Great. Tell us about that. If you didn't, it's your time to sit back and listen because you received a screen at it that was designed to make you upset and angry, to look at more, to look at more, to look at more ads. And so I'm trying to get people, amazing things when people meet in the real world. They're constantly engaging each other with what they know from the screen, which has little to no relevance to the person that they're talking to. The first one is happening where? In Orange County. Orange County this Saturday, April 30th. I'm working with an organization called Civic Genius. And I really was relentless when I was finding a partner that they did not have a political affiliation because I could not tell someone what the way they should think. I don't live their life. I haven't lived their lives thousands and thousands of days as them. That's not, it's actually not the, I shouldn't say that. The problem is people who are trying to tell people what to think, not how to think, what to think. You will believe this. I don't care what side it's on. You believe this and there's no compromise. You must believe this or you are bad. Bad. That's what's killing us. Yeah. That's what's killing us. And when you and I met years ago, I came in with this perception of what I thought you were. And when we sat, the humanity clicked in and we were able to talk. And all I want, the whole point of this is I just want people to stop fighting in their families and stop fighting in their communities. Because if you can't sit down with the people in your community to solve your problems, no one wins. So what age group? This is mostly 18 and over, but 18 to 80, it can be anyone. And when you go, do you have to participate or can you just watch? You can. So everyone sits and it's everything to design the way the seats are set up, the way the screen works. It's all highly, highly, highly produced. So everyone sits in this very large U. So there's no hiding in the back. But how people... Like an AA meeting. It's like you can't go anywhere. You must stay. But not everyone speaks. And who speaks is random. It's actually done through a way inside their pouches. Some people have a chip and some people don't. And the people of blue chips have to stand up and then they have a conversation. It's a way. So you're not speaking to... I mean, you are speaking in front of the whole group, but you're not speaking and having interaction with the whole group. No. The whole group is kind of channeling it through different conversations between... Correct. Correct. And a lot of them... We say it's one story told between two worlds. One is the real world, all of us in the room. And the other is all the media we have on the screen. And so the screen plays a large part in it with edits and media coming at the audience, showing them, well, what is true? Because if this is true on the screen, it can't be true in the real world. And we're constantly juxtaposing the two. And it really ends up being this mind-blowing, hard reset. So do you have... Are you going to have video there? Okay. Can you return maybe and show me some video and give me the results of what this happened? We can. We actually have two tests on the website, connectaffect.us under testimonials. Oh, okay. One, we took women and we said if women once connected, could they solve each other's most deep challenging question? So we took these total strangers, didn't know each other, connected them, and they're reading these unbelievable, vulnerable questions like, why am I single my whole life? Why do I draw men that would abuse me? And the audience helps them find the answer. That's unbelievable. It's incredible. Because all that happens is we have a problem, we go to an expert, we have a problem, we go to an expert, diagnosed, medicated. Sometimes we just need opinions of other people and social buffering, and that doesn't exist anymore. So that was one test. The other was at a university, because we had students at this university afraid of each other, not just physically, but ideologically. Oh, yeah. And so we thought, could we take students once connected after 60 minutes? Would they be open to the other side's ideology? And you look at the video, they were. They saw the whole thing differently. And they realized that all these people in the real world in the room are not the enemies that they perceive coming through the edit. So how do you get people to, I mean, are you just traveling the country? Are you asking for places to host you? We are. We're looking for organizations. We're churches, synagogues, anywhere where people have stopped talking, which is pretty much everywhere. Everywhere. We're looking. And it's not just led by me. It's a system that's replicated and designed to be done by many people. The system is called Epic. Forbes described it was a game changer a few years ago. It's a different way of approaching people that you have to engage through equalization. That's the E. If I don't look at you as an equal, what are the point are we talking about? Like, why am I talking to you? I don't think you're an equal. And then beyond that, the P is personalization. I don't care what you read. Because whatever you read, I've got stats. You've got stats. I've got stats. You've got article. I've got articles. Now we go nowhere. What do you know? What have you experienced of racism? What have you experienced of suffering? That's what I need to know. But if you keep bringing, I kept bridging these conversations and I have seven people in the room and 480 opinions. And suddenly Nancy Pelosi was there and Mitch McCallen, I'm like, why are they in the room? They're certainly not going to be helping you fix your problem in your school. And so it's personalization. Then information gathering. The thing I tell people is stop talking about what you know. We know what you know. What do you know about those people? What do I not know? That is the, I think that is one of the real keys to, if people say, I can't talk to them or I want to just, I need to change their mind. If you're approaching the conversation that way, you are saying to yourself, they don't have anything of value to teach me. Yes. And when you both exchange that, just the basic thing, and I don't mean stats. I mean, you as a person. Yes. How did you get there? As soon as you get there, things change. I always ask people, why are we not cyclopsies? Why do we have two eyes that do the exact same thing, not even an inch and a half apart? Because that's the only way to see depth and perspective. So I tell people, look at the world with your view. You need the other view to see the world in more than two dimensions. You have to know what you don't know. Constantly, I would come to the blaze and you and I would sit down whether we were traveling on a project. And I would learn so much about the world that I never knew and vice versa. And it was the only way that I saw things with depth. It was no longer a two dimensional edit in the screen world. It was three dimensional in the real world. I've been thinking about this a lot lately. We had to wrap up. I've been thinking about this a lot lately. The scripture, there must be opposition in all things. All of it must be. We don't want to argue and you've got to agree to one side. No, there must be opposition in all things. Solutions, yes. Yes. And to see depth. Yes. So, Rias, thank you so much.
