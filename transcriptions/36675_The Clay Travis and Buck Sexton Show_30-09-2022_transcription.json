    "text": " You're listening to the Fox Sexton Show podcast. Make sure you subscribe to the podcast on the iHeartRadio app or wherever you get your podcasts. Team welcome to the Freedom Hut Friday, September 30th edition of the program. We have the continuing rescue and recovery efforts underway in Florida and also Hurricane Ian just making landfall in South Carolina. A major storm surge risk there is happening right now. We'll talk to you about what's going on with all of this disaster in the Southeastern United States and the efforts to try to mitigate the loss of life and damage. We'll also discuss how Gavin Newsom is turning California into a sanctuary state for minors to have gender transition surgery. And then on Russia, there's a number of places inside of Ukraine that have had a sham referendum to join the Russian Federation. Putin is making a lot of noise about how the US better back off. But Biden's saying, we're going to back Ukraine to the hilt. We'll get into how we get out of all of that situation. Where does this go? How does it end in just a moment? But if family or friends ever had arguments over politics, it was about one politician over another or which policy is best for our country. No one debated whether the country was actually great or not. That was naturally assumed, at least used to be. Too often today, we find ourselves arguing about whether our country is great or not, about whether we should love America or be ashamed of it. One reason for this is simple. For too many years, too many of our schools have been neglecting to teach young Americans about America's great heritage of liberty. What they're often teaching up is a dishonest narrative of America as fundamentally unjust and racist. Hillsdale College is weighing in for America by offering free online courses such as the great American story, A Land of Hope and Constitution 101, the meaning and history of the Constitution. Watch one, watch them both. Enroll in one of these free courses from Hillsdale and even better, encourage your friends and family to sign up to. Begin your free Hillsdale College course today at clayandbuckforhillsdale.com. That's clayandbuckforhillsdale.com. So, the situation in Florida is very challenging right now. Obviously, the devastation that has already occurred in Florida, particularly in the Fort Myers area, is extreme. Governor Ron DeSantis gave an update this morning where he said this is what we're dealing with and this is how they're trying to do the best they can under these very difficult circumstances to get Florida back. Pine Island, Sanibel, those are going to be rebuild efforts. The Sanibel Bridge had breaks in multiple parts of it. It was not where the water and the pylons were. Those held up very well. It was where you had it on some of the sandbar and that basically just got washed out from underneath. In the meantime, they're going to be running barges to be able to bring more heavy equipment onto the island to be able to help with the response. The first responders that have been there by and large coming in via air, they do have some equipment, but they're traveling lighter just to be able to go and get to people as quickly as possible. So the primary goal right now, the most important thing is the preservation of human life because there are people who are still very much in harm's way, who are trapped in flooded areas and there are still a lot of dangers out there as a result of all the destruction, the down power lines. There are reports of people citing alligators in the flood waters. Now, generally speaking, that's not going to result in anything necessarily happening, but it's just really disconcerting for people, obviously. They've already been through a tremendous trauma and to see the destruction from all these, of all these homes and the drone footage that are circulating of Fort Myers, it's heartbreaking. There's no way around that. For a lot of people, it's going to be a long process to try to repair a sense of being okay once again after, even if they just lost possessions after losing their home in this situation. The Fort Myers police, I'm sorry, fire chief, Tracy McMillian said that the damage is breathtaking in the Fort Myers area and it really is when you see the video. We had our opportunity this morning to get out there to go take a look at our city. The city of Fort Myers and see what kind of damage we have and obviously it's breathtaking. It's gapping to see what happened. For us, I started very early and lasted all the way almost to midnight as far as storm surge and winds and things like that. So, to seeing the fact that we're trying to see at night and singing in a daylight, wow, it is different. Seeing palm trees bow to it, boats on roads that should not be there and houses and brush down. It was really upsetting for everybody to see these photos and videos, particularly of these barrier islands and the beach front areas, the waterfront areas of Fort Myers. It's just gone. There are communities that have been literally swept away by these tidal surges, these hurricane based floods. And so, it's going to be a long, difficult process of rebuilding. There's no way around that, unfortunately. I've been telling you to get ready for the political attacks because this is occurring in Florida where Rhonda Santis is the governor. And also, anytime there is a natural disaster, the Democrats in this country, there are some Democrats who will find it as an opportunity to say that this is, first off, about climate change. Here is a meteorologist named Michelle Grossman right away. As the rapid intensification of Hurricane Ian is directly tied to climate change. With this storm, I think, well, it started out as a weak storm and then just rapidly intensified. We don't see that that often. And that is a connection with climate change. So we're looking at the waters being warmer, the waters being warmer a little bit further north. So that's what we're seeing. It holds a lot of water. The atmosphere, when it is warming, we can hold a lot more water. That's why we're seeing this story being about the water. And that's how most people die when it comes to hurricanes. It's all about the sea rise and it's all about that fresh water falling. So that is the problem and it's becoming more and more normal. Climate change. Connection to climate change. This is a religious belief for people, even people in the science. One thing that we have seen from COVID, one reality, I think, that has hit home for everybody who is being honest and who has paid attention here, is scientists are every bit as subject to politicization, ideological bias, intransigence of their beliefs as anybody else. There's no special school of objective ethics that scientists go to. Their profession is supposed to be objective, but it's not. Journalism is supposed to be objective, but it's not. And this idea that because someone studies a thing, they have a better handle on all the implications, the ways to deal with something, the policies around it, it's just not true. And with climatologists and meteorologists, they know that if they don't go along with this climate change rhetoric, they will be attacked. And so it just becomes easier for them. It becomes the path of least resistance. And then there's just the more explicitly political attacks that are going to come against Ron DeSantis. And I'll just bring up now because it seems like everything that DeSantis could have done, he did do in the early stages of this. It seems as though Ron DeSantis got ahead of this with thousands and thousands of brave and skilled first responders of all kinds, everything from medical personnel, linemen to get the electricity back on. They were in place and they were ready to go and they're already deployed in large numbers. There will be people though who take this as an opportunity to score the cheapest and most grotesque of political points. And so that's where Joy Reid comes in here. She's saying that when Ron DeSantis was in the Tea Party, he didn't believe in aid and now he does play so. When Ron DeSantis was in Congress, when he was a Tea Party freshman, when New York and New Jersey faced the exact same tragedy. I mean literally the subways in New York were flooded. People could have drowned in the subway. When Ron DeSantis had the opportunity to make that decision and say, well should the people of New York and New Jersey who were hit by a catastrophic hurricane, they weren't even used to. They're not even in Florida, they're used to again. He said no, that shouldn't happen. He, Marker Rubio and other Tea Party members said it in house, said they shouldn't have that money. It's too expensive. He's now got to go hat in hand to Joe Biden for aid. It's something he didn't even believe in as a Tea Party. Now does anyone think that Joy Reid is creating an analogy here that is an actual representation of exactly what happened? I would ask that. I mean is it really just that Ron DeSantis doesn't believe or didn't believe when he was in Congress in any aid? Really, that's interesting. But more than that, you're just going to see everything possible, mobilized by the left to attack Ron DeSantis. They're terrified of him because of his competency and also his confidence in his ability to do his job. They think that he's a political target that needs to be destroyed and a mass tragedy that has destroyed who knows how many people's homes at this point in Florida and perhaps in South Carolina too. We're still seeing that the early stages of that storm as I speak to you now, they won't put aside their political grievances and allow for any moment of unity. It has to be exploited right away. It has to be exploited immediately by the left, by the Democrats. They will not miss that opportunity. Now we'll talk about the California sanctuary bill that Gavin Newsom is signing here that will create a sanctuary for transgender minors in the state of California. We'll get there in just a second. There's an organization I do want you to know about has to do with babies and it is called pre-born. They do amazing work. They provide free ultrasounds to expectant mothers so that the mother can have that initial divine connection with her baby. The whole idea here is that when a mother is shown what is growing in her womb, the life in her womb, she's so much more likely. She's having any doubts to take that pregnancy to term to give life to that baby, full life, to allow that baby to come into being on its own entirely outside the womb. The pre-born pregnancy clinics have saved thousands and thousands of babies lives, perhaps hundreds of thousands at this point. The abortion industry is horrific and it's still going on full speed ahead in many Democrat states. This is why pre-born places their pre-born pregnancy clinics in states where a lot of abortions occur so that women have an alternative, a place to go where they can get a free ultrasound and they can have people talk to them and be supportive and caring and nurturing about this process and about the decision they'll make. I know so many people who say they're pro-life and that's fantastic and I am pro-life and I support them but what are all of us doing to help those out there who are making this decision to act on our pro-life values? You can save lives right now today with pre-born. If you are able to donate $10, $100, $1,000, whatever it may be on your phone right now, you can dial pound 250 and say the keyword baby that's pound 250 and say the keyword baby or you can go to this website pre-born.com slash buck. Any size donation helps $10, $1,000, $100, whatever you can do. You can take a $5, anything pre-born.com slash buck or dial pound 250 from your cell phone and say the keyword baby. So Gavin Newsom, this is remarkable. Gavin Newsom in California has passed this bill that's going to make it so that it is a sanctuary state for transgender youth to come to get transgender surgery and that California will not honor any, I mean there's all this legalese in it but essentially if you are a minor who gets to California they're going to do everything they can to have your transgender surgery. So you're 15, you get to California, you're going to have your transgender surgery. The state of California is encouraging of this process and will even protect from say parents who want to track down that child if they don't agree with the transgender surgery. You're noticing something here and it is that the left on the one hand will tell us why do you focus on this so much conservatives? Why do you make such a big deal of this? On the other it's, well they keep passing laws about it. They keep making more and more extreme decisions around these issues and it's just, it's just remarkable honestly how grotesquely dishonest the left has become on all of this. I mean on the one hand they don't want to talk about it on the other hand they're passing these laws and doing all these things. So we have to focus in on this. I mean I don't know why this state of, well I know I do know why the state of California is doing this but I don't know why more Republican politicians aren't giving voice to the fact that there is an exploitation of children that is going on here to advance the trans agenda in a way that is deeply troubling. I mean Vox which is far left lunacy just published this piece. Stop worrying about what happens if we let kids transition. Worry about what happens if we don't. As if now there's some horrible life destroying future for somebody who is able to go through a normal puberty without these surgeries that are doing irreversible damage to children. They are switching this around now so that remember they changed the words to make it gender affirmation surgery and it used to be gender transition and now they're saying well if we don't do those surgeries think about all the downside. Think about what's going to be lost in this process. It's really awful honestly and Gavin Newsom is making this a state level issue in California and it's creating sanctuary state for minors. They're really pushing this ideology. There's something sick and wrong in the minds in the hearts of Democrats who push this stuff right now. We need to be very honest about that. And on the Russia issue by the way we just had Russia had a referendum. We're all being told the whole thing is a sham and the Russians do fight dirty play dirty and that's not a surprise at all. But what is the end state here for this? When does the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and Biden just said that we'll back Ukraine all the way? We're going to give them another I think $16 billion until Ukraine is victorious. What does that look like? How long are we willing to go on with this? Where is the Biden administration effort to have a negotiated settlement and bring an end to this fighting? You have Putin who's giving speeches where he's talking about the US setting a precedent by using nuclear weapons in an offensive capacity in Japan. This is somebody who has thousands of nuclear weapons. I think we should pay pretty close attention to this. We just had the pipeline sabotage of Nord Stream in the Baltic Sea and we have countries, including countries with nukes like Russia and us and EU countries who are pointing the finger saying you did it, you did it. And look who we have in charge Joe Biden. This is this is a perilous situation for us in ways that I think a lot of people here at home have not yet grasped. So we have to keep focusing in on what the next steps are, what's the end goal and what are the people in charge actually trying to accomplish here. Thanks for hanging with me team. Had a engaging party here in New York yesterday. So had to push through today was quite a fun, quite a fun event, but you know, you always pay the price the next day. Stay a little late. So to anybody who is going to be affected by this storm or has been affected by it in the southeastern US, Florida, the Carolinas, South Carolina specifically, thinking about you this weekend and we'll be talking to all of you on Monday. Shields high."
