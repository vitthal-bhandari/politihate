    "text": " Politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative true the conservative review with Daniel Burns and welcome back fellow American Patriots and Minutemen standing at the ready to guard our liberties at a minutes notice to the one and only CR podcast here at Blaze Media this is your host Daniel Horowitz back in the house for another exciting week of broadcast here on Monday March 22nd and folks this is actually the anniversary of the Stem fact that one act of tyranny that really pushed the colonists over the edge catalyzed their formation of these committees of correspondence between the state legislatures they crafted a declaration of rights and grievances they knew their rights they knew what needed to be done and they fought a revolution when are we going to have enough I keep asking that question what is it gonna take says a lot going on that I want to talk about through the prism of what went on in South Dakota with Governor Christie Noem in the transgender bill because to me that perfectly embodies the fight that we have on our hands in these super majority red states it perfectly illustrates why we need these Liberty Strike Force teams again you could sign up at con action.network we have like 1500 people signed up across the country I know I am getting to your state we are slowly forming teams I got to find the right team leader in each state and we're usually gonna have a few teams in a lot of the bigger states divide by region but but we need it we need it because people are asleep we need it because the Republican politicians only pay attention to the special interests we need it because our voice needs to be heard we need our agitators to threaten pressure could you'll get active on our issues so we're gonna have that it's a lot of other stuff going on that I am seeing on COVID mask news we could get into we have the Pentagon lecturing soldiers on Y BLM and Antifa are not a problem but right wingers are and then of course yet we have the transgender fight in in South Dakota I want to get to a little bit later the first a word from today's sponsor what if I told you I could get you a 60 $70,000 HR manager for just 99 bucks a month Bambi has you covered as you well know HR issues can literally kill you wrongful termination suits minimum wage requirements labor regs all this stuff that by the way they should be relaxing in a real stimulus bill for small businesses of course they don't Bambi has a tailor made HR system just for your small business basically for 99 bucks a month flat rate Bambi gives you an HR manager not some random person you call up you get a different person every time the same person they could always you know correspond with phone email real-time chat they deal with onboarding terminations they customize your policies to fit your business and again they help you manage your day-to-day employee interactions for 99 bucks a month it's month to month you could cancel anytime no hidden fees and they actually start with a free HR audit so doesn't cost you anything if you go to Bambi.com slash conservative right now to schedule your free HR audit that's Bambi.com slash conservative you did not open your business because you wanted to spend time in HR compliance again that is a BAM to the BAM BE.com slash conservative now folks you know I was thinking today ultimately as we saw with the Stamp Act the Supreme power is in our hands as Noah Webster said the Supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be on any pretense raised in the United States now where things have changed is obviously the weaponry but at least at a political level without dealing with arms that is true we just need to say no when are we gonna start saying no to our masters I'm getting emails from people even in places like Northwest Arkansas where they took off the mass mandate statewide but the school boards are saying look three quarters of the people who contact us say they want the mask mandate now they could be lying but I think I mean we see it's true a good chunk of the 75 million people who voted for Trump on this issue are somewhat bought into it now I do also think that 99% of the Karens will contact their school boards and a much smaller percentage of our people do that so that's really what we need are our teams for I also want to discuss at some point today or tomorrow lawsuits how we could use the legal system to our benefit and folks this is something that I think we've realized as consensus with all the team leaders I've spoken to so far this is really the top issue the masking of our children truly unbelievable I've always said in my mind it's worse for schools to be open with masking than to be remote I know in the minority on that but I think I'm right my sister was over at her friends her house you know middle age in her 40s and all of a sudden this woman's 12 year old daughter comes barreling down the stairs and starts yelling at my sister I mean in a very disrespectful way that you would never talk to an adult that way you can't be or you're you're spreading the virus you're gonna contaminate us or whatever my sisters said well actually I was vaccinated you know it's stupid but my sisters a speech therapist and even though she's only in her 40s she's considered you know top priority here in Maryland unlike in Florida where were they focused on seniors because you know of course kids are very at risk now it's her business she decided to get it I wouldn't have frankly but she got the vaccine she said it look I'm a vaccine and the girl said I don't care in my school they told me that doesn't work we can't be in a home with other people here and her friend was mortified that her kid was acting this way but I thought two things number one once again you see that what we've taught people is that covid is able to violate everything so just straight up respect for adults you would never see this in any other context but we could say your existence is killing me and we're brainwashing our kids to that effect so therefore therefore everything goes you could talk back to an adult like that but number two we're seeing they're brainwashing them in the schools and she's in private school because the public schools were closed and this is what they're teaching them if the only purpose to having school is to teach them this thing it's worse than ever you know I saw this is unbelievable just came out from trying to see who put this out Matthew Reese food and health facts based on a recent survey of 3,000 American adults by the American psychological association it turns out that 61 or sorry 42% of those surveyed had gained weight over the past year the average weight gain was 29 pounds 29 pounds okay and the thing is it was most pronounced among younger people of course 52% of generation Z adults whatever that means 40 what is it 8% of millennials 41% of Gen Xers 37% of boomers 25% of older adults so it's actually the younger you get because we lock people down we gave them anxiety so less exercise less being outside more eating more anxiety and this is the sick irony not only is weight gain the anti-cedent almost every health concern but it's also unbelievably unbelievably the biggest risk factor in this virus itself so we've come full circle every last thing that our government has done on this was counterproductive and achieved the exact opposite result of what they said this harks back to what I said from day one with DA Henderson the great epidemiologist from Hopkins he died about 12 years ago and he um he wrote or a little less than that probably more like seven eight years ago he wrote a paper gaming out the idea of a lockdown and he said that communities deal with viruses the best when they're intact when they're healthy when they're not panicking so much for don't panic remember that this time of year 12 months ago how much longer are we gonna go on with things that themselves demonstrate their lack of efficacy by the fact that we're yelling about it 12 months later you know it reminds me of um I was reading over the Sabbath Isaiah 44 and I think it really speaks to where we are now in this country Isaiah 44 9 those who form idols all of them are vanity and their treasures are of no avail and they are their witnesses meaning their lack of efficacy bears witness on the fools who serve them they need neither see nor hear nor do they know so that they be ashamed who formed a god or molded in image being of no avail behold all his colleagues shall be ashamed they're smiths of a man let all of them gather let them stand they shall fear they shall be ashamed together the ironsmith makes an axe and he works with coal and with sledgehammer's he fashions it and he made it with his strong arm yet he is hungry and he has no strength he did not drink water and he becomes faint the carpenter stretched out a line he beautifies it with us all he fixes it with planes and with the compass he rounds it and he made it in the likeness of a man like the beauty of a man to sit in the house to to you for himself cedars and he took an oak tree and he reinforced it with forest trees he planted a sapling and rain makes it grow and it was for man to ignite and he took from them and warned himself he even heated the oven and baked bread he even made a god and prostrated himself he made a graven image and bow to them half of it he burnt with fire on half of it he ate meat he roasted a roast and became satiated he even warmed himself and said aha I am warm and I see fire and what is left over from it he made for a god for his graven image he kneels to it and prostrates himself and prays to it and he says save me for you are my god neither do they know nor do they understand for their eyes are covered from seeing their hearts from understanding and he does not give a thought he has neither knowledge nor understanding to say half of it I burn with fire and I even baked bread on its coals I roasted meat and ate and what was left from it shall I make for an abomination shall bow to rotten wood to provide her made of ashes at the seaved heart has per perverted him and he shall not save his soul and he shall not say is there not falsehood in my right hand and it literally that verse reminds me of this business how they could literally champion a mask is the greatest savior of all time to the point that they are willing to shame beat into submission destroy human beings kick a two-year-old off a plane destroy a child for the remainder of his life masking them seven hours a day but at the same time if you don't wear yours my thing is worthless they recognize this worthless just like they cooked on the idolatry they used it it was a it was an image and then they bow down to it the other half of the time well knowing it doesn't work the lack of efficacy these masks give testimony on themselves and and embarrass their worshipers they wore them for a year with almost no spread in LA and when it came it came as quick and as deep as anywhere in the world check republic the same thing doesn't matter they keep bowing down to it an answer is it's not going to end until we rip the band-aid off and we in in all these states where republicans supposedly have control we get on their case and we say we are not doing it and done we don't debate we don't question we don't equivocate we do that's what the left does that's how the mask became so powerful we need to use the levers of power to reverse everything they do stop being conservative on strategy and be more conservative on ideology as we've been talking about so many days which leads me to South Dakota now a lot of people have been shocked to hear that Kristi gnome I mean she's holding a press conference soon so I'm not gonna get up get the latest before I get this out but um everyone was surprised like what she's for the tranny agenda folks those of you who listened to me before covid no I used to treasure all the time now I stopped because look you know she was good on the lockdown and we badly needed people and I'll take anyone I mean I'll take a democrat that joins with us to fight the lockdown and the masking so you know that was the issue of our time I'm not gonna hold it against her but I mean I've known her for years when she was in Congress in Congress she was a regular establishment Republican when she became governor she was obsessive about refugee resettlement Trump actually said there's no refugee resettlement unless you opt in and she actively opted her state into it then again and this is why I'm not surprised the biggest thing people are forgetting is that last January the South Dakota House passed a bill blocking or prohibiting castration for you know the the tranny agenda castrating minors it died in the Senate and the media reported at the time in South Dakota that the governor had concerns about it so I already knew she was bought into it now what's worse than the reason why um no I'm in the rhinos in the South Dakota Senate are against the bill this one is on collegiate sports or high school and collegiate sports getting men at a female sports the reason why she is opposing it is even more concerning than the opposition to it so let's start from the beginning South Dakota this is a classic example of why we need Liberty Strike Force teams because you have Amazon and you have the Chamber of Commerce running every red state believe it or not if we don't have our voices heard you'll have the same left-wing voices heard in blue states heard in red states Republicans have a 62 to 8 majority 62 to 8 majority in the Senate in the house and a 32 to 3 majority in the Senate Democrats lost two Senate seats there the this last time around they're down to their lowest number ever and what do they do with it we can't even affirm that a man's a man and a woman's a woman now I want to just say off the bat that even this whole business of of sports is kind of in my view somewhat of a distraction if that's gonna be the galvanizer to fight the licentiousness I'll take it and I do but I'll just tell you you know I've said this before they're totally throwing away the bathroom issue which in my mind is much bigger female private spaces and just you know forcing tranny stuff on Catholic hospitals and just the entire premise of it like oh it's not fair for women to compete I mean to me that's almost like a side point I mean I agree with it of course but off the bat most Republicans have completely fought that battle they'll indulge the talking point of this that women shouldn't be you know mentioned being female sports just like they'll indulge the talking point of the life issue and by the way I think now you're seeing what I mean when I say that I'm sick of hearing about the life issue because Kristi Noem promoted that issue left and right at the expense of everything else that's frankly much more important at the time we live in so on February 24th South Dakota House passed as HP 1217 it would prevent men from playing in female sports and you know a lot of red states are passing this now some easier than others and I didn't pay much attention to this because I thought it was a foregone conclusion like this at least was a consensus issue well not really the house passed it by a super majority 50 to 17 but again noticed it looks like they lost about nine Republicans and then and again this is why we need these Liberty Strike Forest teams to name names and then in the Senate they held a hearing on it and they actually voted it down they or they left it in committee conservatives had to use what's called a smoke out which is the equivalent of what you have in Congress at a national level a discharge petition if you get a majority of the members to support it on the floor you could get out of committee to got the vote it passed 2015 now remember there's 32 Republicans so they lost I mean almost half the Republicans so that was ready to sign a trouble but nonetheless on the day of past the Senate March 8th it happened to be International Women's Day and Christie Nome tweaked the left by tweeting out that we're gonna celebrate women's sports and bar men from them and then she was gonna sign the bill and everyone was really like oh man look at that bad ass you know Christie Nome you know she's being awesome but then the next week suddenly there were reportedly meetings with Chamber of Commerce the Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce Amazon and then there were reports she was equivocating and then on Friday she announces that she has concerns with the bill now we're gonna go through her excuses and show what a joke they are but as you well know when we talked about last week with the New Hampshire governor veto or threatening to veto the critical race theory bill it's not the intellectual sophistry that they're into they don't even believe in it it's they don't want to do it because they're too scared they're scared of the special interests and we're gonna get to that because I think that's really important today so first the details she tweets out that she is she's planning to issue what's called recommend recommendations as to style and form now this is a term of art in the South Dakota Constitution that it's not just oh I don't like style of the bill it's a term of art that means it's basically a de facto conditional veto and it allows the governor to issue a recommendation as to style and form and basically say look here are my recommendations if you make them the bill automatically becomes law it's almost like it's like a middle ground it's almost like it's on hold but that written recommendation they send to the Senate that letter has almost the power of a potential signature or potential veto so if they make it those recommendations it automatically becomes law if they fail to it it doesn't because the recommendation almost works is a de facto veto and she basically you know it has a long Twitter thread and says look you know because she was getting a lot of hate from her newfound conservative fans and she's like look no I certainly don't want men in female sports I support that I'm gonna sign this bill eventually I just have some technical issues with but then when she goes on to explain it it's not so technical she's gutting the entire bill so first off just procedurally I mean I'll leave it to people who know the South Dakota Constitution better than I do but to me this is not style and form style and form means like you have literally have typos so rather than going through a whole process she just issues a recommendation so therefore they could just fix the typos and then it automatically becomes law right they wouldn't have given the governor this sort of power to manipulate the legislative process when she doesn't like entire sections of the bill right it's so clearly it bivalites the state constitution what she's doing in my mind but but that's besides the point so she's like look there's just unintended consequences now look you know certainly it could be true that sometimes conservatives will push things that have unintended consequences now before I even get to the fact that it's substantive it's not style I just want to note like this general attitude of everything we want to do to evacuate all Daniel it's too much it's too much of a burden you're putting burdens on private thing no no that mentality in itself I almost always reject transgenderism illegal immigration covid fascism these are civilization killers and they need to be uprooted in any way possible so I don't like this like oh I don't like you know you're putting burdens on people no it doesn't work that way but she gives the farm away in one of her tweets one of her tweets in the thread she basically says that competing on the national stage means compliance with the national governing bodies that oversee collegiate athletics so it's like one of these deals where she's like no wrong I'm all with you I just don't like some technical things like unintended consequence and then she basically gives the farm away and says that oh well I'm worried about the NCA standards again forgetting about the fact whether this bill even violates the NCA standards a lot of people are saying it doesn't but she's saying blatantly it's not a matter of you know some technical things she supports the bill it just has some gratuitous stuff in it it's that she's scared of what the NCA has to say about it so right off the bat we know she doesn't support it on substance so that's why she's t hit suggesting to take out the entire portion of the bill that applies to college sports so the entire section one you know the section one the main part that bands you know men in biological men in in female sports she only applies to K through 12 not college college is the main in cholata really so she completely takes that out of the bill that's not a technical change the entire it's not part of the bill the entirety of the application of the bill as it relates to collegiate sports gone takes out then she guts the entire section two of the bill which requires athletes to verify their age biological sex and attest to not taking anabolic steroids every year and she's like no that is an unworkable administrative burden on the schools now anyone who knows even if you're not in a collegiate athletic program or high school athletic program everyone knows that any student has to provide this information there's no extra burden they have this information what they have to do is verify against it to make sure there aren't really males plan games with this stuff so she's right it is a burden in the sense that the ones who are really males will wind up getting caught that I mean that's the enforce ability otherwise it's not enforceable so even on the high school on she makes it unenforceable then she takes out section four which gives the girls and the women to avenues of redress if there's a men in their program or whatever men in their thing they can number one have a cause of action in court to sue and number two it prohibits the college or high school from retaliating against the the whistleblowers those who complain about men being placed on their teams or being forced to compete against them or whatever and then also the original language said that a team or sport designated as being female is available only to participants who are female based on their biological sex she artfully changed the language to saying it's only available to participate this is who are female I'm sorry based on their biological sex she has that but then she adds a clause in a recommendation based on their biological sex is reflected on the birth certificate or affidavit provided upon initial or enrollment why would you add that line I mean biology is biology so what she's in fact clearly doing is agreeing to their premise that you could change your biology on a birth certificate because otherwise why would you put that in there so again that guts the whole bill because a tranny what do you think they do they say they're females so you could I mean you could get a birth certificate was and they'll change it they'll say they're female that's that's the point unless you say somehow the word biological would would prohibit that but then it's a contradiction then what are you doing I mean I would argue biology does contradict it but I mean you know you had a line that that that that's very disturbing so I think we've established to anyone with a brain these are not technical changes she doesn't want it enforceable and I think I think Kristi noam is being honest she doesn't support men and female sports but she doesn't support the bill because she doesn't want it enforceable and I think the reason is not because Kristi noam is a flaming pro-tranny whatever I don't think she's a cultural Marxist personally I think she is like a typical chamber of commerce Republican that she's terrified of them they met with her they yelled at her and that's it she's terrified but this is what I meant when I said that the rationale is actually worse I would feel more comfortable if I knew she was pro-tranny what this tells us is that every policy that Kristi noam or all these Republicans do it's all based on big business and as you know big business they are worse cultural Marxists than Hollywood and the media and academia they are the worst they're destroying our country what what what these red state Republicans keep doing I heard this in Missouri they're pushing this transgender real estate stuff they're like we need to attract them to our state no it's not just like oh you know I want to uphold conservative values even if I'm willing to forgo revenue or business or certain people willing to say no that's part of it the reason they're giving is worse than opposition we don't want these people in the state this is exactly how you turn red states into blue states you make them so obsessively low tax to a fault where this imbalanced low tax cultural Marxism and and fiscal socialism do so we have individual welfare we have Obamacare we have Medicaid expansion we have the health care cartel we have tranny stuff we have them with sexual agenda we have everything going on refugee resettlement but it's low taxes so what that allows them to do is you know these self the selfish businesses are like hey they have a couple of us regular fewer regulations they have lower taxes but then they have all our stuff there so they go and move into the states and then guess what now they own you now they're big stakeholders in the workforce in your state and now they get to look at you and say look hey Christy no them you know those jobs you want here well now you're gonna become like a blue state this is the crux of why we have 19 super majority legislatures and 23 24 chart trifectos yet we don't have a single red state in America it's because see in some ways it would be better if they're high tax at least they wouldn't be more attracted to move from the blue states but they do and that's how they bring the culture down this is more important than the tax issue it's worth it to be independent from this stuff if we're if we're gonna have some place to go this what we have to do make the business climate as pro-business as you can be but make the culture as pro American is can be too and that will force them to pick sides they only do this they only lobby because they know they can they know how to pick their lock but if we made it clear no we'll give you the lower tax and regulatory burden right to work status but buddy this stuff's not gonna fly now I speaking with my friend Barbara Ehart so she's the one in the Idaho House who passed Idaho's bill that was signed into law that was similar to this she went to South Dakota and testified in the Senate on behalf of the bill and she made this point that the big mistake there was um Christie gnome didn't sign it right away she let it lay over this is the biggest lesson we think we have to do things incrementally and slowly my goal is to have strike force teams in place in these states that by next legislative session 2022 we could hit the ground running and just blitzkrieg them boom boom boom 10 bills just completely change the culture of the state to what it should have been all along and these guys don't even know what to do when you go and you equivocate the other side mobilizes against you if you have super majorities you should just do it do it lightning speed like the left does they didn't debate over dude our mass really effective what about all the harm to kids no we're just doing this and it became normal we need to do the same thing and it becomes normal that is the lesson from South Dakota but again it's very important to understand broadly this problem of this low tax socialism and it also ties into the federal level where the Democrats are considering upping the corporate tax we'd be stupid to get in their way not that I think it's a good economic model to have higher taxes not that I think we're not gonna wind up paying for it we will but I want people to feel the pain and I certainly want the corporations to feel the pain we can't allow them to promote cultural Marxism on the cheap America is worth worse than Europe you know I forgot to start with this but I meant to start the show with this we have you know remember the Arab Spring in 2014 when he had the Muslim Brotherhood like rebelling against all the leaders in Arab world and overthrowing them in Europe it almost looks like a Liberty Spring all over Europe people are demonstrating against lockdowns against the mass mandates in Austria the police took off their helmets in solidarity with the people in Vienna and everyone's asking the question where the hell is this in America why is Europe leading on Liberty and I'll tell you why Europe is socialist America is worse than socialist it's venture socialist and it's low tax socialist meaning we have just enough conservatism in America to make it the worst of all worlds it's a package deal if you wanted to work because what it does is people in Europe they don't have the printing press the dollar currency like we do where we can manipulate it and mail people ten thousand dollars in their bank accounts again and again they have high taxes they don't have these subsidies so people feel the pain more here we shield them from the pain we shield all the businesses from the pain no I'm gonna sick the Democrats on them you want the Democrats cultural Marxism well you're gonna get their fiscal Marxism to I know don't start yelling on me I know it's not a good economic bottle but what we have now is in anyway we don't have free markets so the worst thing we can do is low taxes but fiscal and social Marxism and everything else no no split the baby it's one package deal that needs to be the message of red states otherwise you have the worst thing of all what's worse than a boycott of red states is for blue people to move into red states and corporations to take over the political culture of the red states so they're no longer read at all we've painfully learned this lesson in many parts of the country we better start doing in places like Idaho and South Dakota before it's too late no more low tax socialism that's the lesson here Kristi no more than others is not inherently in my mind a social liberal she's scared of the Chamber of Commerce she's scared of Amazon that's the problem we need them to be more scared of us than they are of the bad guys this is gonna be our challenge but again remember there were 12 Republicans in the Senate eight or nine in the house that voted against this bill who are they they need to be marked I don't have a South Dakota leader yet but if any of you feel you you want to be one you could email me deharowitz at blazemedia.com sign up for our team at con action.net work I'm working on Florida Ohio now so again it takes takes time we already have a North Dakota team North Dakota is looking a lot better than South Dakota now but this is what it takes we need teams to combat this you're gonna hear a lot of noise I don't want to focus on Kristi nooms personality is she a hero or a zero to me that's not even that important it's what this represents this is what happens in every red state we're talking about a 32 to 3 majority and we can't even get trendy stuff passed because it ultimately did pass with the end run around the committee which voted it down but they don't have a super majority if you notice the house does but not the Senate to override her veto and that's why they have to indulge her request so this is really really important now one other thing I do want to mention here about the South Dakota saga here is that for once this is actually a big national civilization issue being dealt with in a state legislature that my colleagues are focusing on I mean notice conservative national media you have obviously the Alliance defending freedom and you have people really weighing in and again as we're talking the governor is holding a press conference so you know by the time you hear this you'll know the outcome of that and what direction she goes in but the point is she clearly is feeling the heat and I've said this all the time if we if we applied this much pressure and focused on legislation that matters this is what we've been doing the last couple months you could get better outcomes in almost every state I would welcome my colleagues to do this more often this is where it's at focusing on the tranny issues and illegal immigration and election law and obviously the COVID fascism and the mask stuff at a local state level in red states is where national voices have a huge influence unless you're a total rhino dirt bag that is just totally don't care and then in that case you should easily be able to primary the guy you know most these governors do care if you have you know the blaze and the federalist and and even national review is going I believe is is is harping on it this time so I mean you have all these people and and Fox News and Newsmax and everyone bang away at a Republican governor believe me they're gonna be in crisis mode so it makes a big difference look I'm just seeing a headline the Republican Mesa mayor John Giles from Mesa Arizona I've been impressed so far with administration kids are Republican mayor Mesa Arizona and I know he also pushed some sort of tranny thing there these people don't usually get pressure you know Christie gnome got pressure from the bad guys so she did her thing now she's getting pressure from the good guys and it's having its influence imagine if we had standing committees to do this in every every state so I think this is this is a huge huge issue huge issue I'm wanting to end off today with and I know I didn't get to some of the other news of the day you know there's a lot of stuff with attacks on Asian Americans those of you who listened to the show know there's nothing new it's almost all black supremacism it's BLM types doing it the Farrakhan types the same people who basically attacked the Jews in New York on subways are attacking Asians it's the same thing and of course they're making it about whites because when blacks attack people it's really whites doing it you know whatever so might cover some of those stories like I said we have the military that said this from a Clatchy DC during military training sessions to address extremism in the ranks some service members have challenged why the Pentagon is not treating the violence during racial injustice protests last summer as equal to the to the deadly riot at the used capital it's funny the way you and Clatchy says it the racial injustice protests and the deadly riot ironically turns out that when we say deadly it was deadly only in the sense that Trump supporters were killed now that we know the truth on that whereas the other ones were deadly they you know the the rioters killed people but anyway they say that the two events are viewed as equivalent by some troops has caught the Pentagon's attention and its effort to educate service members and extremists that extremist views and activity on either side of the political spectrum go against the oath they took when they joined the military the top enlisted leader told reporters on Thursday so there we have that in the military where they don't know what to do when troops are asking them in these bull sessions they have now hey how come we're never hearing about the more ubiquitous violence on other side so they're not sure what to do with those those challenging questions very vexing in our transgender military but anyway I just want to end off with an idea that I'm going to work on more in the future but a friend of mine who's also a neighbor he's an attorney he was pushing me on this for a while and I think it's a great idea you know he he was telling his experience at low levels of government school boards even homeowners associations you yell at them it doesn't seem to help now again I would argue that you do it in large numbers you recruit candidates it's definitely going to work but he he felt that a better idea starting with the mask mandate in these schools is to have a bunch of pro se lawsuits so individual personal lawsuits without a lawyer without a lawyer because sometimes there's benefits to doing it alone you know the courts allow you to amend your complaints more if you don't have an attorney and in all of our groups we were putting out on our forums are you a lawyer in bard in your state so a lot of part of the problem is no one wants to put their name on these lawsuits very few people do so what we could do is we could have lawyers help draft and and the only have to be one or two page complaints here's how it violates OSHA standards ADA my child is coming home with headaches he's having trouble breathing he's having trouble concentrating I mean there's no issue of standing this is direct standing if you have a child in that school district you can bring a lawsuit especially in these states where the governor took it off and now you're battling your your local school board flood them with a bunch of pro se lawsuits again the goal here is not class action it's the opposite you don't want one lawsuit because frankly you know what we've seen the judges are awful anyway they're not gonna give us a good constitutional ruling flood them with a bunch of statutory violations the point is not to win this what the left does have don't just say hey let's get together and have one person needs to district have many people file it and and I'm gonna work on just some samples you the first count is just count one here are the facts I'm John Smith you know John and Emily Smith our daughter Kayla is in fifth grade and she's coming home every day with headaches there is no reason she needs to wear one the government is not showing us the evidence here is the evidence of the harm to my child yet there is no evidence that this is effective for children that it's needed for children whereas the statutory authority even if you're gonna do it it violates OSHA's standards on PPE the courts have to respond to that now local governments usually either have insurance or they have trust funds to deal with this so you have one person like they might settle but if you have a bunch of people flooding them they get scared so you know I'm gonna try to work out with people to write up a little bit of a guide how to how to file them how to draft them you could do it alone it's not that hard and this is gonna force discovery they're gonna have to bring down their so-called experts and things like that just start thinking of this idea in your school districts when we have our people together with these state teams and divide them by region we could do this in every county and I'd have multiple people as many people as you can in this case redundancy is actually our friend each person have a little little different thing especially if a person is a child that's more you know special needs whether they're they're hearing speech or language issues or the autism or whatever it is that will be one thing another person gets migraine headaches from it and you just throw the kitchen sink at them it's it's pretty cheap to file in most places I would file it in federal court because we'll cite federal statutes as well as Constitution and boom here we are this is what needs to be done so if you want to help on our steering committee we'll set up a team to craft the legal talking points the process for people and we'll send it out through our team leaders when we get them up or heck I might even write an article on this I'll just have to be careful how I write it and you could take that as a guide anyone could do this some people are scared for retaliation but others of you are not scared so work with people who aren't this is the only way we're gonna get rid of that we need to start thinking about this on other issues as well this is part of my point we need to stop being conservative in tactics we need to be liberal in our tactics we need to be liberal all encompassing all the above in our commitment to fighting for liberty folks thanks for listening send this out to 50 hundred of your of your friends and relatives make the show famous let's get the word out sign up for con action network our teams will have a better URL in the coming days till tomorrow same time same place thank you for listening"
