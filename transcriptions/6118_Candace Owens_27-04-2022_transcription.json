    "text": " Hello again and welcome. So the transgender debate is being waged all around the country and the world. Left versus right, conservative versus liberal, school systems versus the parents. The fog of this ideological war has never been thicker. But occasionally, occasionally, a ray of sunshine breaks through. A moment of inexorable truth that acts as a disinfectant to the pollution of lies. A moment that we can't unsee, or in this case, unread. That happened when a mother in her desperation posted to strangers on Reddit seeking help. Her post recently went viral. For those of you that don't know, Reddit is an anonymous online forum that people often turn to to seek advice from strangers regarding topics that may be too embarrassing to consult their friends and families regarding. And so a mother posted regarding her son, who she believes is her daughter because he has begun transitioning. I'm going to read that post verbatim because I think it's really important. Ready? Post reads, We had to hold off on the body surgery because of costs, but now finally had enough and went and got several consults. All have said the same thing. The puberty blockers have left her with the micro penis. She has to get part of her vagina made with her colon. Well, one of her friends had that surgery, and even years later, it smells fairly colon-like. Obviously, my daughter is now distraught. She's in counseling, but is becoming worse and worse in her mental state, and I am frantic. On top of this, she has never had any sexual function, no urges, no erections, even when she tried masturbation to see if she could simulate herself, nothing. The doctors say this may not change even after the surgery. Her dating life is dismal as well. We knew it would be hard, but it's impossible. The one man who was with her for a while soon just became frustrated by her lack of sexual anything and broke it off. I don't know what to do. A friend suggested I post here for advice. Please help me help my child. Okay. I mean, that is very, very, very sad to read. And typically, we wait until the end of the show to answer questions from back at home, but today I'm going to answer this question, this woman's plea, in front of the entire world. So, dear, anonymous mother, there is no other way for me to respond to you other than honestly and openly, in the hopes that other children and other mothers will be spared the tragedy that is happening in your household. The truth is that you have mutilated your once perfectly healthy growing son over a feeling that he had. Ultimately, it is you alone that is responsible for this mutilation because you prioritize acquiescing to an insane cultural narrative rather than recognizing basic immutable biological facts. Once upon a time, your son, now an adult man, used to be an imaginative little boy. Children believe in all sorts of things that aren't imaginative when they're growing up. Sometimes those things are harmless, like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, and so we as adults play into their magical minds. Harmless, make-believe ideas are what childhoods are all about, but knowing the difference between what is harmless and what is harmful is our responsibility. For example, it's okay for a child to believe he is Superman, but it is not okay for him to believe truly that he can fly because human beings cannot fly. A child looking to Donna Cape and leap from a bedroom window can seriously harm themselves, or worse, kill themselves. They may not understand this as we pull them away from the window. They may even scream and kick and cry because it's who they believe they are, who they want to be, but our primary responsibility as parents is to at first keep them alive with truth, showing them right from wrong. It's why there are parental cliches like you'll understand when you're older, because they will. So your child came to you and he said, I want to be a girl, mommy, and rather than explaining to him why ultimately that is not a biological possibility, no more than flying like a bird is, you went along with the delusion. You essentially allowed your child to jump from the figurative bedroom window, and now, your once upon a time child is now a man who is crashing into the earth's surface all at once. The worst possible manner of learning that gravity exists. He's already harmed himself, and now you're wondering if he's going to take it a step further and kill himself, because there's no way to undo what's been done. Reality has caught up with fiction. Truth has caught up with the lie. His depression is stemming from the fact that he realizes he will never be a woman. Sure, they can use parts of his colon to give him something that maybe resembles a vagina and smells like a rectum, but he will never be a woman and he knows that. Deep down, so do you, mom. And his suicidal thoughts are stemming from the realization that he can never really have the opportunity to be a man now either because his mother allowed his sexual parts to be mutilated, because he can't feel anything. He'll never know what physical desire for the rest of his life. He'll never know what that means. He'll never have a normal relationship, and that was a decision that was made for him in his childhood. Yes, alongside a host of predatory doctors and therapists, who should all be imprisoned, by the way, you agree to the bodily mutilation of your son. And so my heart aches for him because he is a true victim. He was a child victim, a young man whose life was stolen from him. How does it get better? Well, it starts with your own reckoning, mom. You're mentally unstable and you have harmed your son irrevocably, and yet you are still holding on to the belief that you have a daughter and that you have done, as you said, quote, you're not. You have done, as you said, quote, everything right. But in fact, the exact opposite is true. You have a son and you have done everything wrong. You both need help separately. And it begins with acknowledging the truth. The truth is that transitioning, despite its cultural popularity, is not a solution to anything. That's why suicide and depression rates go up for individuals after they complete the process. Not before, not during, but after the death of the death of the people. But after because they meet gravity and the way to realizing that they can never truly and fully go back is paralyzing. Fortunately, there are groups dedicated to helping these individuals, groups like Sex Change Regret, an established charity run by formerly trans individuals helping people like your son. So it's not hopeless. Your son needs to hear that and he needs to know that. It is not hopeless. There are people out there who are similarly victimized just like him and who are ready and willing to help. Your son needs to know that while there is no way back, there is fortunately a way forward. And it begins with recognizing truth. Let's talk about your internet security. Using the internet without ExpressVPN is like leaving your laptop exposed at a coffee shop table while you run to the counter to buy another drink. Most of the time you'll probably be okay, but what if one day you come back and your laptop is gone? A lot, Hunter Biden. Every time you connect to an unencrypted network, think Cafe, Airport or Hotel Wi-Fi, your online data is not secured. Any hacker on the same network can gain access to and steal your personal data and it doesn't take an advanced techy knowledge to hack someone. A 12 year old could do it. That's why I recommend that you use ExpressVPN. ExpressVPN creates a secure and cricted tunnel between your device and the internet so that hackers can't steal your sensitive data. But like most about ExpressVPN is how easy it is to use. Simply download the app on your phone or computer, tap one button and that's it. You're protected. Secure your online data today with the VPN that I trust by visiting ExpressVPN.com slash Candice. That's eXPRESVPN.com slash Candice and you can get an extra three months free.
