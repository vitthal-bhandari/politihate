    "text": " Ladies and gentlemen, the following segment of the podcast is presented exclusively by Hillsdale College. Now, in its 175th year, Hillsdale is a truly independent institution. We're learning as prized and intellectual enthusiasm is valued. Thank you for listening and my sincere appreciation to Hillsdale for their sponsorship. He's here. He's here. Now broadcasting from the underground command post deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building, we've once again made contact with our leader, Mark Lovend. Hello America, Mark Lovend, our number is 877-381-3811-8773-811. Officer William Evans was murdered today doing his job outside the Capitol building on Capitol grounds. And another officer is in a dire condition apparently, an individual in their vehicle drove into these two men as they were standing in front of a barricade. I assume he crushed them. Afterwards, he got out of the vehicle with a large knife and started charging other officers who shot him dead. And we want to wish Officer Evans family all the best, little good it'll do, but now we're very proud to support law enforcement on this program unequivocally. And it's terrible to see something like this. And I wanted to know who is this suspect? Who would do this? You know on January 6th, no officer was murdered despite the allegations that it was an insurrection and despite the fact that nobody was armed. There was an officer who died, Officer Sitnik, his family says he had a stroke a day or two later. For some reason our government won't tell us exactly what took place. Be it as it may. But as I sit here today, right now, at 6-10 p.m. Eastern time, and the breaking news was the officer was attacked and died sometime earlier this afternoon. We're only getting a little bit of information about this suspect, aka the killer. And there's a website called thepostmillennial.com. It is a superb website. And I check it from time to time. As best as I can tell, they were the first to inform us. And I see the New York Post about an hour later has done the same thing. And I watched all three cable channels, and I didn't see any reference to the killer. And I haven't even seen a photo of the killer. Then I thought to myself immediately, well, if the killer was white, we would know all about him. We would know what he looks like. There'd be a photo on there, so something's going on here. This is what we know now. The headline at the New York Post is by Craig McCarthy, suspect who smashed into barrier at US Capitol identified as Noah Green. The driver who killed a US Capitol cop before he was gunned down by police is a nation of Islam devotee from Indiana, according to reports in his social media. Noah Green, 25, who may have been living in Virginia, described himself as, quote, a follower of Farrakhan, unquote, on his Facebook page in reference to nation of Islam leader, Louis Farrakhan. Green appeared to have come on hard times from his Facebook page reviewed by the Post before his account was taken down. Quote, I was on the right track and everything I had planned was coming into existence. It required long hours, lots of studying and exercise to keep me balanced while experiencing an array of concerning symptoms. Along the path, I believe to be side effects of drugs I was in taking unknowingly. He wrote on March 17, signing the message, Brother Noah X. With a path has been thwarted, he wrote, as Allah has chosen me for other things. Throughout life, I've set goals, attained them, set higher ones, and then been required to sacrifice those things he continued. His Facebook posts were first reported by MSNBC, which read them on air. Actually, I think they were first found by the Post Millennial. Green allegedly slammed into a fence outside the US Capitol just after 1 p.m. Friday, struck two officers before crashing into a barricade. A barricade, allegedly got out of the car with a knife and lunged at an officer before being fatally shot, reports say. And as I said, 18 year veteran William Evans died at the hospital. The Post Millennial website. Breaking police officer suspect died of injuries after US Capitol attacked suspect identified as nation of Islam member Noah Green. Angie No, excuse me, Andy No, exclusive, the man who rammed a car into Capitol Police killing one has been identified as Noah Green. Green was armed with a large blade. When he was shot, he identified as a follower of the black nationalist nation of Islam movement, and it goes on. So for some of you, this may be the first time you're hearing this, MSNBC's Jesse Rodriguez tweeted the suspect in the Capitol Police incident as a 25 year old Indiana native who lived in Virginia on his Facebook. He notes he's a fellow nation of Islam's. Farrakhan. So we do want to salute the MSNBC Jesse Rodriguez for reporting. Now, this is the thing. We had a mass murder in Atlanta. Eight individuals, horribly killed, six of whom were Asian, and the president and the vice president who were down there exploited it as much as they possibly could. Called America Systemically Racist Systemically Xenophobic. And it turns out it had nothing to do with race corner of the FBI direct himself. Then we had another mass murder, 10 people murdered in Boulder, Colorado, and a grocery store. I believe every one of them was white and the killer. His ancestry is Syrian Muslim. And I don't think to this day, most of the media have pointed that out. And then we have this attack today on two Capitol police officers, one of whom is now dead. And the individual who attacked them is a young African American gentleman who follows Farrakhan in the nation of Islam. President Biden put out a statement, he never said a word about that. Never said a word about Farrakhan and his insightful speeches. I N C, not I N S. Did I do that right? No, it is I N S. Insiting. Insiting. Never word. And so you have to ask yourself a question here. What are these politicians doing to this country? The things that they say and when they say them and the exploitation is really shocking. Absolutely shocking. This poor officer is dead. I keep hearing one reporter say, you know, if the fence has been up and it had been pushed out, it wouldn't have happened today. Is that the story? We talked about incitement to have an insurrection. Incitement to an insurrection. I N C I T E M A N, incitement E N T. For an insurrection. They were unarmed and they didn't kill any police officers. And by the way, I'm making no excuses just for the liberal media out there. No, I've condemned this over and over and over again. I'm making no excuses, but I'm making a point. But none of this is discussed when the shoe is on the other foot, whether it's hand tee for Black Lives Matter or what happened in Boulder or what's happened today. It really is grotesque. If the media were honest, they would report the way they always report. No matter who the people are, no matter their faith, no matter their backgrounds or ancestry, but they don't do that. Because they're corrupt. When we come back, I want to talk about Major League Baseball. Major League, it turns out, ladies and gentlemen, that the NBA, that the NFL, that the MLB, probably the others, have decided that the only fans they really care about and the only fans they really want are Democrats. They don't want Republicans. Because you see, Republicans are racist. The Georgia State Legislature is racist. Donald Trump's no good. The Republicans are repressing, suppressing, oppressing, and they're preventing people from voting. So the Major League Baseball League has made a decision that they're throwing in with the most reckless, radical Democrats. And you Republicans, you suckers who are fans, you suckers who pay for their jerseys, you suckers who buy players jerseys and go online. You're going to be suckers forever more. And so Major League Baseball decides we're moving out of Georgia and moving out of Georgia for the All-Star game. They're moving out of Atlanta, which is a overwhelmingly majority Black city. And all the jobs that they're going to affect, because they want to be seen, you see. White liberals want to be seen as really down for the revolution. But don't wear LeBron James agrees with them. LeBron James, who lives in white neighborhoods, has multi-million dollar homes, multiple cars and everything. LeBron James agrees with them. He's glad this took place, Atlanta. All you folks in Atlanta who are going to work in that stadium, who are going to work on the All-Star game, Major League Baseball just screwed you. And LeBron James is pleased about it. I'll be right back. Much love in. Hillsdale College serves four purposes, learning, character, faith and freedom.

You need to understand folks, particularly if you're a minority and a Democrat. That the Democrat Party doesn't stand with you. Democrats lobbied Major League Baseball, not all of them, but a lot of them. To boycott your city of Atlanta. And what they used as a reason is the Republican state legislature, the Republican governor, passing new voting reform laws. And they've had to lie about this law. This law extends voting days to include Sundays. This vote ensures that people can vote from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at night, which is the case in most precincts, but the state legislature wanted to make sure it was the case in all pre-sings. When they say that it outlaws bringing water or food to the line, it doesn't outlaw bringing water or food to the line. It outlaws strangers from bringing water or food to the line because there have been issues, and not just in Atlanta, but throughout the state, where candidates have surrogates or so-called non-profit groups have surrogates where they're working the line and making promises to people and giving them stuff. And so they said, no, you're not to do any of that. In other words, leave people alone when they're in line. Do not work them over in line. Don't even campaign when they're in line for the most part. In my state, that's the rule. So it's pretty much the rule in most states. So it's not aimed at preventing people from having water. Of course, you can have water if you're in line. Also, they require voter ID. If you can't afford voter ID, they will give you voter ID. Also, they require a few file and absentee ballot that you do it with a signature that can be matched. Now, these are the great big changes they've made in Georgia. And so now we're told this is Jim Crow. And they keep bringing up the water in line, and they keep bringing up 5 p.m. Even the Washington Post today, the Washington Post, which is a lousy left-wing newspaper, said that Biden and his spokes idiot, Pissaki, are now recidivists. That is, they keep lying about the time change. So now Major League Baseball jumps in and they say, you know what? We don't support limiting the vote. We can't abide this. And these other corporate board, we can't abide this. We can't abide what? They even have some drop boxes in this legislation. There were no drop boxes before the virus. Most of you never heard of drop boxes. There weren't any. The reason there were drop boxes is because they didn't want people to catch the virus, one from the other. One from the other. It had nothing to do with race, nothing to do with making it easier to vote for all time. Mailing out ballots on mail and voting. That's not a part of the law. You had people in these states, including Georgia, that just made the decision. So the legislature saying, no, we're not going to do these things, all these temporary things that were done due to the virus. We're going to make changes, bring it back to where it was before the virus. But we're even going to liberalize some aspects of it. But the Democrats don't want that. And they control the narrative, they control the media, they control the sportscasters and the athletes. They control them all. And so now we're all down for the revolution. Because we're fighting Jim Crow. Yes, we're fighting Jim Crow. What the hell are they talking about? Nobody's fighting Jim Crow. Anybody who wants to vote, who legally can vote, will vote. Will vote. So this is all manufactured by the Democrats. And so you've Coca-Cola going along with it, you have Apple going along with it, you've Delta going along with it. Now you've Major League Baseball, you're Morons on ESPN going along with it. I want to address this further when I return. The great humanitarians in sports. The great humanitarians in these corporations. You're not going to want to miss it. I'll be right back. Hillsdale College serves four purposes, learning character, faith and freedom.

Mark Levind. Call him now. Eddy 77381. 381-1. I'm just tired of these phony civil rights movements here. This has nothing to do with civil rights. It has nothing to erase or discrimination, nothing. And yet here we are. People like feeling self-righteous. They like pushing a narrative, even though they don't have any idea what the hell they're talking about. But let's start here. Major League Baseball. Major League Baseball being... Applauded by LeBron James. By Magic Johnson. By Michael Jordan. All down for the revolution. Well, kinda, sorta, maybe. This is from December 22, 2017, about three years ago. Major League Baseball unveils partnership to help bro game in China. And you don't need to be reminded, they do. China has millions of people in concentration in death camps. Particularly Muslims. Who are minorities in China? A minority in China. You have people coming out of there talking about how there's murder. There's rape. There are abortions. There's sterilization. There's forced sale of body organs. There's some kinda holocaust going on there in communist China. And on December 22, 2017, three days before Christmas, Major League Baseball. And the commissioner, Rob Manfred, they knew for well what's going on in communist China. Because we all read the same stuff. So he didn't put out a statement and say, we're not gonna do any business with communist China. They're expanding their business with communist China. Just like that, knucklehead LeBron James with Nike. These aren't serious people. These are self-promoters. We're taking pseudo events in order to proclaim their own righteousness. League teams up with Baragal to develop new facilities. China's interest in baseball is at unprecedented levels and growing fast. This is from MLB.com. Baseball has now played in more than 80 colleges and universities in China. Double the number from six years ago. And more than 40 new baseball facilities have been built in the past year by local governments and individuals. Nearly a billion viewers can now watch Major League Baseball Games broadcast. And related TV shows on National Network China Education Television. The agreement was announced at a news conference in Beijing. Attended by members of the Chinese government, Baragal, Major League Baseball, China. Oh, they have actually a subsidiary and some of the top baseball players in the country. But they're not gonna set a foot in Georgia. No, or Atlanta. No. Because we don't like the Republicans in their voting bill. The Communists and the genocidal hit larians in China will have press conferences with them. That's okay. That's cool. We are thrilled to have a strategic alliance with Major League Baseball that seeks to enhance the playing level of professional baseball teams in China. Said Baragal, Chairman Keoho. This relationship with Baragal will seek to accelerate our growth and to provide first rate facilities and coaching for the increasing number of Chinese baseball players. Said Jim Small, Major League Baseball Vice President, Asia Pacific. And it goes on. That's December 22, 2017. But I'm not done. Four months later. Major League Baseball. This is money.cnn. Signs deal with China's largest tech company. Major League Baseball is tapping into the Chinese market in a big way. On Tuesday, they announced a deal with China's biggest tech company, Tencent. Just reading 125 games this season. Tencent posts more than one billion active users on its social media networks. You know, if I'm a citizen of Atlanta right now, I am fuming. I am so pissed off. It's not even funny. But let me continue. And I would be really pissed off at the Democrat Party in Atlanta, too. And LeBron James. And who else, Mr. Bedouse? Michael Jordan. And others. Tencent will stream regular season games on Wednesday, Thursday, Saturdays, and Sundays. Their social network will also stream the All-Star game, although I guess not from Atlanta. Post-season games, the World Series, and a weekly highlight show. So massively expand their presence in China, massively expand television in China. Massive new money flowing into Major League Baseball. From a Hitlerian regime. That's involved in Holocaust-type activities. That's April 3, 2018. One more. Two days ago. Two days ago. As they were plotting to screw the people of Atlanta. Two days ago. Major League Baseball and Tencent expand Chinese streaming deal to cover multiple Asian markets. This is from sportspromedia.com. I'm sure this will be covered relentlessly on ESPN. Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand reportedly covered in the new agreement. Major League Baseball has expanded its rights agreement with Tencent, which is the biggest Chinese tech company. It's a giant media broadcast company from the North American Baseball League in several Asian markets. The three-year contract, which runs until the end of 2023 season. We'll see Tencent continue to live live stream in Major League Baseball games in China. For the first time in more than half a dozen Asian territories on its international over-the-top platform, we TV. So they need the communist Chinese to do this. Two days ago. But they're concerned about what the Republicans did in Georgia, you see. Now I looked and I looked and I looked for a statement by LeBron James criticizing Major League Baseball for expanding its operations at communist China. I couldn't find any. And he did tweet out today that, quote, proud to call myself a part of the Major League Baseball family today. Well, you're not you, idiot. You're playing basketball. All right, Magic Johnson, partial owner of the Dodgers tweeted, I want to applaud, extend a thank you to Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred for moving the all-star game out of Georgia, following the governor signing the new restrictive voting law. Way to be a leader and take a strong stance, okay? By the way, LeBron James now owns a part of the Red Sox. Poor LeBron James, Mr. Purdue. He's really put upon by this society, isn't he? So Magic Johnson, LeBron James, who else do we have here? Let's see. I'm looking. Who else did we have here? Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan's also proud of Major League Baseball. And I'm sure there are many others too. Now, you know, Hank Aaron died last year. I believe it was last year, early this year. One of the greatest baseball players ever. And this game was to be in Atlanta. It was to honor Hank Aaron. It's not going to be in Atlanta anymore. And notice Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, don't say a damn thing about the hundreds of millions of dollars that are going to be lost to this community, this overwhelmingly African-American community. And people who could use the money, notice they don't say a damn thing. Though I, because politics and the Democrat party are more important to these three guys, and not just them. More important to Joe Biden. More important to every Democrat who opens his or her big mouth and lies about this law. And I want you Republicans out there to understand something. American professional sports hates your guts. And I want the people of Atlanta to understand something. You were just screwed out of hundreds of millions of dollars by millionaires and billionaires with their phony self-righteousness. Go ahead and look at the bill yourself. Compare to Jim Crow. Compare to what the Democrats did in the South for a decade after decade after decade. Compare the record of the Republican legislature to the early record of Joe Biden, who threw in with segregationists, who opposed busing, which is understandable, and a lot of people did. Black and white. But that said, one of the reasons he gave was he didn't want to create quote unquote, a jungle, a jungle. And this guy is president of the United States. Then there's Coca-Cola. Here's a piece from November 29, 2020. Business groups in major companies like Apple, Coca-Cola, and Nike have been pressing Congress to alter legislation cracking down on imports of goods made with forced labor from persecuted Muslim minorities in China. Nike and Coca-Cola, this is New York Times, are among the major companies in business groups lobbing Congress to weaken a bill that would ban imported goods made with forced labor in China's Xi Xiang region, according to congressional staff members and other people familiar with the matter, as well as lobbing records that show vast spending on the legislation. Where was Major League Baseball on this? How about the NBA? How about the NFL? How about the NHL? Where was LeBron? Biden? Magic? Where were these people? Nowhere. And here's a bill, a bill that's trying to prevent companies from using forced labor in China and to take those goods and then sell them in the United States. The bill which would prohibit broad categories of certain goods made by persecuted Muslim minorities in an effort to crack down on human rights abuses has gained bipartisan support. Passing the House in September by a margin of 406 to 3. Congressional aid say that as to backing to pass the Senate could be signed into law by other Trump or Biden. Where's Biden on this? Nowhere. Biden has a lockdown. At 3 o'clock he went home. He said, that's enough. I'm going to Camp David. I've worked all afternoon. I want my lunch and I'm leaving. It's what he did. But the legislation called the Uighur Forced Labor Prevention Act has become the target of multinational companies including Apple, including Nike, including Coca-Cola, Adidas, Calvin Klein, Campbell Soup, Costco, H&M, Patagonia, Tommy Hilfiger and so forth. And a statement Coca-Cola said that it strictly prohibits any type of forced labor in our supply chain, and that it's a bunch of morons, and used third party auditors to closely monitor its suppliers. Then why are they lobbing against the law? Why are they lobbing against the law? Greg Rosature, the Director of Global Communications at Nike, said the company did not lobby against the Act but instead had constructive discussions. Asked about allegations of forced labor, Nike referred the statement of March, and said that it did not source products from Xi Jinping, and that it had confirmed that its suppliers were not using textiles. But there they are, lobbing against the law. What a bunch of frauds. So now we know where their moral line is. Thank God. In Georgia, it's to attack Republicans to make sure hundreds of millions of dollars aren't spent in majority Black Atlanta. But when it comes to genocide in China, they turn the other cheek. There's too much at stake. LeBron James basically said that a few years back. There's too much at stake. Keep your mouth shut. You have free speech here, but not there. But LeBron is now a self-appointed member of Major League Baseball. I despise these millionaires and billionaires and the way they play with the American people. And again, I want Republicans to know that professional sports is at war with you. I want the people of Atlanta to know that professional sports just screwed you out of hundreds of millions of dollars based on a lie, an absolute lie. And that the president of the United States who's already gotten as many Pinocchio's as can be given by a newspaper has been told again that he's been lying about this law. Now the commissioner baseball is lying. They're lying at Coca-Cola. They're lying at Delta. They're lying at Apple. They're lying through their teeth. Because they fear the little white people who are in college or just graduate. They're going to get on. You see Twitter and they're going to tweet. Oh, look at this. Look at this. Look at this. They fear them. It's time that they fear you. You shouldn't do business with any of these companies, particularly the people in Atlanta and the state of Georgia. None of them. None of them. They just screwed you. Big time for no damn reason whatsoever, except their own self-righteous promotion. They can go to hell. I'll be right back.

Remember how proud Major League Baseball was when they had a game in Havana, Cuba? And even Obama attended? How's voting going in Havana, Cuba? Do they have mail-in voting? Do they have drop boxes? I'm just curious. Can you get water in line when you vote? Are the voting polls open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.? Major League Baseball is a fraud just like all the other professional sports leagues. And they hate Republicans. They hate Trump supporters. They hate. They're all almost reached a point of being racist, quite frankly. Reverse racism. And I don't need lectures from LeBron, James, or anybody else on civil rights and human rights. Not when these jerks are making tens of millions of dollars from a hit larian regime. And not only don't they speak up against it, they defend it. They defend it. What a bunch of hypocrites. And these clowns that run these leagues. This latest one with Major League Baseball. Hundreds of millions of dollars to the people of Atlanta, the vast majority of whom are minority, black, will now go somewhere else. And this is a threat. This is a threat to every legislature in this country, particularly Republican legislatures, that if you dare to take steps to fix what took place in the last election, if you dare to take steps to bring back the status quo before the virus, that Major League Baseball is going to punish you. I have a better idea. You punish them. Stop buying their crap. Don't go to their damn games. Professional sports is already down 30%. You did fine without them last year. Watch the MMA. Watch boxing. Do something else. But apparently it's too tough for team sports. And wait till next hour. I get to the Olympics. I thought these Olympic athletes are supposed to represent you and me, the United States of America. Now they're going to communist China. They're going to genocide central. They're going to genocide central, where many of them are going to protest against the United States. We'll be right back. The 11 non-district building. We've once again made contact with our leader, Mike Lovend. Hello America. Mark Lovend here, our number 877-381-3811-873813-1381-3811. We're joined by the great senator from Utah. No, not that guy. They good guy. Mike Lee, how are you, senator? I'm doing great. Thank you very much, Mark. Good to be with you as always. Well, senator, likewise, and you know, this major league baseball thing is really quite repulsive. What they've done to the people of Atlanta, the vast majority of whom are African American. What they've done to the state of Georgia, where they're basically threatening that state legislature and other state legislatures, that want to take the voting system back from the pandemic period. And they're not denying people water. They're not truncating the amount of time to vote. As a matter of fact, they've extended it in so many. Even the Washington Post has called out the president of the United States. And Major League Baseball now does this. And you know, they have all kinds of deals with communist China. They didn't have a problem with baseball in Cuba. What do you make of all this, senator? Their actions bespeak lawlessness, and I find them repugnant in every way, shape, and form. Look, these guys have been skating on thin ice for a long time. And they've had the benefit since 1922 in the Supreme Court, the side of the case called federal baseball club versus National League that Major League Baseball would be exempt from all antitrust laws. They created this thing out of whole cloth. There's not one syllable in federal statute that gives them that exemption. And this is exactly how someone behaves when they are a monopolist. And when they want utter impunity under the law, it's time to take that away. Now, I suspect that the Democrats will be thrilled with this because Biden wanted the people of Atlanta to suffer, which denies them hundreds of millions of dollars related to the all-star game. But that said, senator, I'm glad you brought this up. Isn't this something that we need to press in the Senate, press in the House, even though we don't have the numbers today, we may have the numbers tomorrow and laid a foundation for taking their antitrust status away? Absolutely. And look, this is a statutory decision. It should never have been made by the Supreme Court in the first place. It belongs to Congress. And yes, the votes might not be there right now to get rid of their exemption. But mark my words, Mark, it's coming. The days of their exemption are numbered, and they have caused them to be so through their own erratic behavior. There's no reason why we should exempt any corporation, specifically, simply because of its preferred status socially or otherwise. But there certainly is no legitimate reason why we should give an exemption to a preferred corporation when it behaves in this kind of dastardly behavior, when it deliberately punishes its own political enemies. That's really wrong. And this really shouldn't be a democratic or a republican issue. Every American ought to be bothered by this. But they won't be, and it will be a Republican Democrat issue, I'm afraid, because it looks like professional sports and ESPN are at war with Republicans. Looks like Republicans are racist, Republicans don't want people to vote, Republicans are systemically this, systemically that. That's who they're talking about. The Democrat Party supports all this. Joe Biden encouraged this. I just want the people of Georgia to know Senator, and specifically the people of Atlanta, which is a heavy Democrat city, that the Democrat Party, the Democrat president, and mostly Democrat sports leagues with these, with these league commissioners and so forth, just cost you hundreds of millions of dollars for no reason at all. They're lying about their statute, Senator. Hundreds of millions of dollars for nothing. And that begs the question, why? Why would they take such a risky step? Why would they take such a punitive step when really they're doing this entirely in response to a law that was passed by a state legislature requiring people to prove who they are when they vote? What is wrong with that? No American. No American who loves the rule of law should find that unsettling at all, let alone pause for canceling a major contract with the city of Atlanta. And it's really voter ID. What it is, it's an identification of some sort. Every state, including Georgia, says if he can't afford it, we'll pay for it. If he can't come in and get it, we'll send it to you. So this is all bogus. Everybody needs an ID for a thousand things, including probably to get sporting tickets or go into certain events to get on an airplane. LeBron James has to show his ID. Why is this racist? Why is it racist for people to prove who they are? It applies to whites, boys, and girls. And blacks, Hispanics, Asians, everybody? Well, it's not and deep down to folks at Major League Baseball know that it's not. This is a rather thinly failed effort at promoting the Democratic Party and attacking the Republican Party. Now, look, that's fine for any private organization to do. It's fine for any private citizen to do. If they want to do that, they're lying. But it's still their right to get constitutional protection to do that. What they do not have the right to do is to maintain that. To maintain that while having an anti-dressed exemption and thinking that they're going to get away with that very law because they will not. And I will make sure they don't. So will you and some of the other Patriot senators introduce legislation to prevent this? And even if it's defeated or they don't come up for a vote because they don't control the floor anymore? Just keep pressing the case. Yes, and that legislation is being prepared even as we speak. Outstanding. So you're preparing legislation to take the antitrust status away from Major League Baseball. And you know what, Senator? More of this needs to be done. Silicon Valley has thrown in with the Democrat Party. Professional sports have thrown in with the Democrat Party. If this is where they want to align themselves, that's fine. But our government should not be handing out subsidies to these multi-billion dollar corporations, and many of them are global corporations. You know, professional basketball, they hope to make most of their money in genocidal communist China. I mean, seems to be whatever tax breaks they have of any kind should be denied them as a result of that alone. I agree completely. And look at the other corporations that have lined up engaging in the same bad business. Look at the airline industry. Some prominent actors there have engaged in similar behavior immediately after receiving literally tens of billions of dollars as an industry, just over the last few months, a handful of companies. It's shameful to turn that around and use that as an open act of warfare against the Republican Party. And I would add against the rule of law is unacceptable. So just to be clear, you've instructed your staff to go ahead and begin to draw up legislation to take the antitrust status away from Major League Baseball, correct? Yes, I have. And it's being prepared even as we speak. And I look forward to introducing that and making the case. Look, all of our original homes. Supreme Court Justice, all of our Wendell Holmes was was certainly a brilliant man. He had great attributes, many of them as a jurist and as a writer. But he often got things very, very wrong and certainly got them wrong in this case in 1922. And the Supreme Court just created this antitrust exemption out of thin air. It's been a nice long run, nearly a century long. It's time to bring that to a close. It's time that the league, it's time that the owners live in the real world with the rest of us. It's the same with the multi-billionaires in Big Tech. It's time that they live in the real world with the rest of us. There's no reason Big Tech should be protected from defamation suits. That's number one. That's ridiculous. Other corporations are not. And there's no. Go ahead. And get these up. When you compound the protection that many of these entities get for the subsidies that I mentioned, for example, in the context of the airlines. And the add to that, the protection that publishers get under New York Times versus Sullivan itself created at a poll clock, basically serving as a function of helping the liberal press today get away with stating things that are not true, for at least acting negligently in going after primarily Republican politicians today. We've got our work cut out for us with the Supreme Court that's overtook created a lot of problems. Yeah. But for a few of the members of the court today, we have a problem with the court, quite frankly. I think the Supreme Court of the United States, it's just not doing its job. Sitting on the sidelines when it should be standing up and it's interfering when it should be sitting on the sidelines. Well, it's good to hear from you, Senator Lee, and I'm glad you're going to be taking point on this and anything we can do to help. I hope you'll let me know. Thanks so much for going to be with you. All right, you too. God bless. And we'll be right back. What? Love in. Over 2000 of you. My listeners made the switch from overpriced wireless carriers to pure talk over the past few months. We want the rest of you to join us and to see what we're talking about. If you're with AT&T and Verizon or T-Mobile, your family could save over $800 a year just by switching to pure talk.

Well, let me tell you some of the cities that based on what the Commissioner of Baseball had to say are off the list for the All-Star game. In addition to Atlanta, these are all minority majority cities. Phoenix, Arizona, because their legislature is looking at cleaning up their voting laws. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Detroit, Michigan, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Houston, Texas, Dallas, Fort Worth, Miami, Florida, and others. These are just off the top of my head. So all these cities are out. All these cities are out. So you watch where Major League Baseball goes. They're probably either going to go to California or New York. Maybe to Illinois, but they're going to go to the darkest of dark blue states. That's what they're going to do. So Major League Baseball, like professional basketball, like professional football, are at war with Republicans, and they are prepared to damage minority communities, which will lose hundreds of millions of dollars if they're located in red states. It is outrageous. And you know what it is? It's the false self-righteousness. You've got to be forced some kind of resistance and rebellion and revolution, even if you don't know what the hell you're doing. So now you're for a cause that doesn't even exist. There is no Jim Crow. There is no inhibition to vote if you're an American citizen who's supposed to vote. And you don't have a right to make your own rules. I want to vote any way I want to vote. You know, I'm going to put it in little paper airplanes and throw it at the courthouse and that should count a thousand different ways to vote. Now that's not the way it works. There's certain ways you can vote, and everyone has to follow the process. If you're incapacitated or if you're handicapped, there are ways for you to vote. If you're out of town, there's ways for you to vote. Asking people for the ID. Now if you consider that racist, then you're a liar. You're a fraud, just like all these fools who are on the social media today. You're a liar and you're a fraud. I think of the people who suffered under Jim Crow. I think of the people who suffered under segregation. It was horrific. Think of all the lynchings that took place. All the whippings that took place. All the horrific treatment of black people that took place. It's horrific. And to bring that up, Jim Crow, the segregated South, to try and create emotions, to try and create division, to try and justify the existence of the Democrat party, who did all these things to black people, is grotesque. And to watch professional athletes who live in the lap of luxury, like no other human beings before them, to participate in this is disgusting. And to watch these frauds on TV, stop watching them. Mouthpieces who lie about what's taking place, is also disgusting. Because it's a relative small percentage of the population, a relative handful, of Democrat party operatives and others, most of whom are white, who are driving this agenda. Have you noticed folks that it's always anti-Republican? Have you noticed that? It's always anti-Republican. They back Joe Biden, they'll back anybody. It doesn't matter. They don't support voting rights. They support Democrat victories. That's what they want. That's what they want on the left. That's all. And now they have networks like ESPN, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, who backed them? You heard Lester Holt the other night that I played him, backs them. Virtually every cable channel, but one backs them. Virtually every newspaper, but a handful, back them. Every college classroom. Now the NEA and government schools are involved in it. But professional sports is a war with you. I don't care what your color is, I don't care what your background is. If you're a red-blooded American, they're a war with you. They are pushing this neo-Marxist agenda. They are pushing the Democrat Party agenda. They like AOC. They like Bernie Sanders. It's true. They talk about systemic this and systemic that. It is they on the left who are systemic bigots. It is they. A professional baseball did today should cause you to never ever want to watch their game on cable. Never ever to purchase any player jerseys, sign balls, nothing. And you should contact the ownership office of the baseball team you follow and ask them how that owner voted. Because according to the league, they did a survey of the owners. And I feel bad for the Atlanta Braves and I feel bad for the people of Atlanta. The Atlanta Braves were absolutely furious about what took place and very upset. But they had no saying it. They couldn't stop it. And I feel terrible for the people of Atlanta who've been misled by the Democrat Party. And you need to understand Joe Biden wanted your vote, Joe Biden got your vote, and Joe Biden just screwed you at hundreds of millions of dollars. That's what Democrats do. So all these cities I just mentioned in states that are looking seriously at reforming their voting laws. Phoenix, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Milwaukee, Houston, Dallas Fort Worth, Miami, and others. Tampa. All of you are off the list. Now you're off the list today or you're off the list forever. You're now on a hit list by professional baseball. And LeBron James thinks it's great. He's now announced that he's part of the Major League Baseball family. Okay, I'll announce I'm part of the NBA family. Okay, Mark Levin. I'm part of the NBA family. Here I am. What an arrogant guy. Just unbelievable. Now Michael Jordan's talking. He has to because all these years he didn't. Now he's down for the revolution. And of course, Magic Johnson. Systemically bigoted America has been so horrible to Magic Johnson. So horrible to so many people that we can't keep people out of the country. They're calling over the border. We're living a lie here. This is not reality what's taking place. But if we do not push back, this is going to get worse and worse and worse. Push back. No Coke products. No Nike products. There's alternatives. No doubt the airlines. No Major League Baseball. There's so many other things to do with your life. I'll be right back. The Mark Levin Show live and national at 877-381-3811. I would say this to every Republican legislature in the country and every Republican state attorney general in the country. You need to review your statutes as applies to professional sports. And determine if there's any preferences given to these professional sports corporations or the leagues. And they're at war with us and you need to be a war with them. Any privileges that they receive must be revoked. They must be challenged now. They've lied about what took place in Georgia. They got involved in the presidential election. It's time to push back. Right now. It's time to push back. We don't need to be victims of this. We don't need to be punching bags anymore. So I'm calling on Republican state legislatures and I'm calling on Republican state attorneys general. Look at your books. If there's any privileges. Any privileges that are provided to professional sports, you need to remove them. Look at your own state antitrust laws and your own state consumer laws. Look at your tax laws. If professional sports or professional athletes are benefited, well stop it. Put an end to it. I'm sick and tired of people who don't put their hand over their heart when the American flags up there knowing how many people have died. I'm sick and tired of people disrespecting the national anthem, pushing their neo-Marxist agenda and the clowns of the fools that follow behind and only know what they're following. I'm sick and tired of being called names for things I never did and never would dream of doing. I'm sick and tired about the lies and the propaganda. Watching multi-millionaires, whether they're owners or players, put down working class Americans, I'm fed up with it. So the Republicans need to understand now what they're up against. Major professional sports are interfering with our elections. Big tech is interfering with our elections. Hollywood's interfering with our elections and they should be treated appropriately. Defend yourselves Republican legislatures. Rally around the Georgia legislature. Nothing they did is Jim Crow. Nothing they did is wrong. Joe Biden has a long history of racism against black people. He does. His party does. So every Republican legislature in this country, every Republican state attorney general, you need to defend your state, defend your cities and defend your country. I'm tired of these millionaires and billionaires and sports and in Hollywood and communications and wherever the hell they are. Lying to the American people as the brink trucks goes up to the fan base and they make hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and some case billions of dollars. I'm sick of them trashing half of the American people while doing business with a genocidal regime in China, a genocidal regime in Cuba or wherever else where they can get a sheckle or two. They're frauds. The commissioner major league baseball, I actually want to thank you. You finally awakened half the country. You dumb bastard. That's right. I said it. And the people of Atlanta should be furious with what's been done to them for no damn reason. And metropolitan areas all over this country should be very concerned about what just took place. And they're being saluted by Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson and LeBron James. They're being saluted at ESPN. What's been done to the people of Atlanta? There's a big, you know, just like all white people aren't the same and all Latino people are the same or Catholic people aren't the same or Jewish people aren't the same. All black people aren't the same either. I mean to tell you, despite the impression that some people want to create, individual human beings think for themselves. And professional sports and professional broadcasting and professional ESPN, professional columnists and all the rest, professional politicians, they just ganged up against you. They want you to actually follow them into your own demise. You're the plaything of the left. That's what you are. And if the left has its way, we all will be. And I want to get to the Olympics in a moment too. The Olympic athletes, who do they think they represent? They represent the United States of America. No if they're embarrassed by that or if they hate our country, then don't go to the Olympics. The Olympics aren't for you. I don't care what you've been told your whole life. I don't care how much you've worked out. You wear that American flag. If you want to be Colin Kaepernick, then don't go. You're going to be in communist China where they're slaughtering people as you're running races and throwing things and jumping and doing all the rest. You are going to be in communist China. It's like Berlin, 1934. You're going to be there. And you're going to protest against the United States of America while you're in communist China. And the US Olympic Committee is giving you the authority to do it. It's pushback time. It's not enough to complain anymore. It's not enough to shake your head anymore. It's pushback time. And you can have an effect. There are tens of millions of you. There are millions of you in this audience. Oh, I know. I'll get the John Boehner in the last hour. This is the sort of thing John Boehner hated because I told you I'm not only a broadcaster, I'm an activist. And I called out that dumb fool. The first one to call out that dumb fool. I've seen him twice in my life. Both times he has a cigarette in one hand and a drink in the other. He always looked slosh to me. I'm not saying he was, but he always looked at me. His eyes were always, you know, hazy and gazzy and all the rest of it. So I don't know what's going on with that guy. But he never, whatever. He always looked a little off to me. Let's go to the Olympics. The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee has announced that it will not sanction athletes who kneel for the national anthem at the Olympic trials in support of social or racial justice movements. All I can tell you is this. What do you think the World War II generation thinks about this stuff? Those who are still with us. What do you think they think about this? What do you think the men and women in this country watch these shows, wounded warriors, tunnel to towers? You see the men on the screen? Some of them lost both legs and an arm, a leg and an arm and a hand. Some of them had brain injuries. You see those men? Are they celebrated? Are they celebrated? How about the cop that ran into a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado and was killed, murdered? Because he wanted to save the people. They're 51 with a wife and seven children. Is he celebrated? They're going to take a knee or do something else stupid to show their protest against the United States of America and communist China. And that's okay with this Olympic Committee? What kind of BS is this? Destroying every aspect of this culture and society. That is just wrong. It is evil. It is repulsive. Athletes may also advocate vocally for their causes. Sarah Hirschland, CEO and US OPC, commented the work of the group's Council on Racial and Social Justice. I have a better idea on racial and social justice. While you're in China, why don't you march on Beijing and let them know what you think about racial and social justice? You're going to the center of a communist regime where several million people are currently in concentration camps. Where they're destroying the freedom in Hong Kong where they have their sights on Taiwan. That's the perfect opportunity. Let's see if these brave Olympians. Let's see if these brave Olympians are going to protest real racial and social injustice when they're in communist China. Will they be using Nike gear? Gee, I wonder. You're going to join me, LeBron? How about Michael? How about magic? You're going to join me? And the Olympians should rise up and protest racial and social injustice in communist China. They should use their voices. They're clothing, hand signals, whatever they want. To protest what communist China is doing to innocent human beings, harvesting their organs. The Council on Racial and Social Justice also made it clear there's a deep desire for team USA athletes to speak on these issues and to lead as a positive force in our community. The guidance also underlined actions that are not permitted such as defacing an American flag or engaging in racist or hate speech. But if you trash your country, that's okay. Just don't burn the flag. Just otherwise the doors wide open. Hurchelon said the committee will evaluate its guidance ahead of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. What is one of the Chinese hold on a second here? Got my Olympics missed up. When is the one are the Olympics in communist China? You want to look that up, Mr. Producer? 2022. Oh. Wait, the communist Chinese Olympics are in 2022. And the Japanese Olympics are in 2021. Is that what you're telling me? Oh, no wonder they're so brave. I apologize. I have to fix this. No wonder they're so great. It's in Japan. Oh. Sure, you can hate American Japan. That won't be a problem. But what do you think of this, ladies and gentlemen? Remember representing the United States, skull met. No, no, representing Ernie Grabatsky and Ernie Grabatsky doesn't like America. So he can put up his fist. He can cover his face. He can give it the finger. He can do whatever he wants. Because of racial and social injustice in America. They're going to humiliate our country on the international scene. Humiliate our country on the international scene. What has happened here? I'll tell you what's happened here. The left is in charge. You're getting a taste of tyranny. And you can see in the not so distant future totalitarianism. That's what it is. Cancel culture indoctrinating your children about gender indoctrinating your children about racial hatred. Trashing your country at the earliest age. You're getting a taste of what it's going to be like one day. If you don't fight back. Fight back against these corporations. Fight back against these school systems. Fight back against Hollywood. You have the power, you know. Stop supporting them. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. Mud, love in. Over 2000 of you.

Still, major metropolitan schools are closed. Joe Biden's at Camp David. He left around three p.m. today. Just wanted you to know. Annie, Boston, Massachusetts, XM, satellite. How are you, Annie? I'm great, Mark. How are you? I'm okay. Thank you. You're pretty fired up. I listen to you every night when I'm cooking supper. I put the serious on the phone and I listen to you. And I just want to say. Thank you. God bless you. I'm going home and I'm filling all my red socks crap out. And I'm the mother of a U.S. Marine who's currently deployed and can't be home with his grandfather, who has cancer and is dying. And these, Jack, Jack, you know what? Yes. I think they can just, you know, disrespect that country constantly. I'm so fed up with them. You know, why they bow down a China, like you said, is killing people and the biggest human rights, and they sit here like they're in the worst country in the world. Well, family members are on the front line for them. I mean, my son's in Japan, but not so dangerous right now, but you never know. You never know what China crossed the road, the water there. No, you don't. So I really appreciate your passion. We're pretty fed up. My whole family's concerned with stuck in Massachusetts and it's just disgusting. I'm so sick of it. You know, I literally am going home and putting every red sock item in the barrel right now. I don't blame you. I stopped watching and listening to Phillies for about a year now and I haven't lost a step. It doesn't bother me in the least. And I'm from Philadelphia. My husband's probably home watching the Bruins. I think the Bruins are on the hockey. That's the only, that's pretty much the only thing you can put on right now that is an old wokey wokey, you know. Yeah, I agree with you. Thank you and thank your son for his service, Annie. We appreciate it. We have a lot of great calls here. So I'm going to do something I don't normally do when we come back after the top of the hour. I'm going to get to these callers because America is furious. I'll be right back. Ladies and gentlemen, this final hour of the podcast is sponsored exclusively by AMAC, the Association of Mature American. And citizens now over 2 million conservative members strong. AMAC believes in and stands up for the values that we care about faith, family and freedom. Thank you for listening and please support AMAC and you can become a member at amac.us slash join. He's here. He's here. Now broadcasting from the underground command post deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building. We've once again made contact with our leader. My love and. Hello America. Mark Lebann here our number 877 3813 81773 813 813 813 811. Four things I want to do in the last hour of the week here. Number one. I want to tell you something that's gone on with the International Criminal Court. Number two. We have a great guest. Number three. I want to get to the callers. And number four. I want to address Politico and their great hero John Boehner. Let's see if I can get them all done. Ladies and gentlemen, the International Criminal Court was set up to deal with matters. For instance, Nazis and Nazi Germany or other genocidal types and so forth to protect. The civilized world. From the uncivilized world. But like so many of these institutions, particularly these international institutions, they've been taken over by people who hate America and can commonately hate Israel. Donald Trump. Warn the ICC. Not to threaten our troops as a perfect example our troops in Afghanistan. The ICC wants to be able to prosecute them. They want to be able to prosecute the IEF in Israel. When they defend their country from Palestinian terrorists as a perfect example. Now there's a couple of great articles on this, but I fella by the name of David Milstein. He worked for the United States and the U.S. Embassy during part of the Trump administration. It happens to be my stepson. And we will link to those a little bit later on parlor. And he brought this to my attention. We have a New York Post article here. It's not being discussed at all unfortunately. Biden ends sanctions against international criminal court. In terms of them pursuing U.S. troops. President Biden on Friday lifted sanctions. You know he's on the way to Camp David. He's going to be very busy there. He lifted sanctions against two prosecutors at the international criminal court who are investigating U.S. troops for possible war crimes in Afghanistan. Trump administration enacted the sanctions since September also citing an investigation of possible Israeli misconduct. So they focus on the United States and Israel. I told you the American hating left is also the Jew hating left. Secretary of State Tony Blinken, member of the guy, who had his ass kicked by the communist Chinese, said in a statement today President Biden revoked executive order 13928 ending the threat and imposition of economic sanctions and visa restrictions in connection with the court. As a result, the sanctions imposed by the previous administration against ICC prosecutor. Yeah, but that would do. And the head of the jurisdiction, complementary and cooperation division of the office of the prosecutor have been lifted. The top U.S. diplomatic echo the Trump administration stance against what the ICC is doing. But Blinken didn't say if the sanctions were lifted in exchange for assurances. Here's the bottom line. The world is walking all over us. Here is an institution that is preparing to prosecute American soldiers who serve their country in Afghanistan. It's an institution that is obsessively focused on us and obsessively focused on the Israelis. President Trump said, you know what? I've had enough of this crap and put these tough sanctions on these two prosecutors. And Biden just lifted them and then flew off the camp David. This is very frightening. It is utterly corrupt the ICC. It's corrupt. It has no authority. Listen to me, has no legal authority of any kind to be coming after American soldiers or the Israeli IDF. None. And so Trump said, we're not subjected to your jurisdiction. No Americans are. And by the way, our friends, the Israelis neither are they. So what has the ICC done last month? The open investigation against the Israelis. And what's Biden's answer? Lift the sanctions. So Biden is destroying America from within and from without. From within and from without. He's a walking wrecking ball, absolute disaster. So I wanted to point that out to you. Let's see. I don't want to get to the political article yet. Let me get to some collards here because dealing with John Boehner is not at the top of the list. Doesn't he represent like the hashish industry or something, Mr. Producer? Isn't he like a lobbyist for potheads? Something like that. He is, right? Well, that and he should be lobbying on behalf of booze so he can get some freebies from them. All right. Let's take some calls, shall we? Yes, we can. Peggy Carlton, Georgia, XM satellite Peggy. How are you? I am awesome. And it is such an honor and God bless Annie who called in before and our son for serving. Amen. You know, I'm in Georgia and this I am so sick and tired of this woke crap. You know, Delta Major League Baseball, Coca Cola, Apple, Leftist, Stars, celebrities and, you know, I mean, it's all a bunch of crap. And, you know, I really wish that the GOP would get together. You know, when you were talking about like the state legislators, you know, the conservative people need to get off their butts and get involved. Call all of their representatives and senators. Call these companies. You know, you would be amazed at the small number of calls that make an impact because nobody does it. So people are basically being complacent and sitting on their hands. All right. I'm with you there, kid. You take care of yourself. James Fairfax, Virginia, the great WMAL. Go right ahead, James. Hello, Mark. Thank you for taking my call tonight. I want to make two quick points and get your reaction regarding all this garbage with Major League Baseball at the Georgia legislature wants to make an impact here. There's something called a jock tax where, you know, a team will come into a city and they get taxed for playing there. Right. They could really stick it to Major League Baseball doing it this way, increasing their taxes, which I'm usually against. They could just say we want to redistribute wealth. You guys have a lot of the money. You got Trump tax cuts. So you guys need to lead the charge. I agree. Use their language against them. At this point, I've had enough. It's time for the brass knuckles. And while I was on hold, I wanted to research. I know the Braves had moved into a new stadium in 2017. And I would not shed a single tear for the Braves losing this all start. When you hear how they totally screwed the taxpayers in Cobb County, Georgia, they made it. And I'm reading off of reason.com. They made a secret deal with the Cobb County Commissioner, Tim Lee, back in 2013 for the stadium with a promise of 400 million in public cash. And the Braves president admitted, you know, of course we weren't going to tell the public about this because, you know, they wouldn't like it. So they got this brand new stadium in 2017. There was no public referendum on it. So the taxpayers couldn't even vote if they wanted this stadium north of. So much the Braves, I didn't even mention them. It is the people of Atlanta. The people of Atlanta, you're saying they were just abused here. And they're being abused again. They're being abused again by very, very wealthy athletes, by very, very wealthy sports owners, by the overpaid commissioner, the Major League Baseball, because these people are pushing the Democrat Party left-wing agenda. When you look at the law, like I said, you know, that Republican law that came out of Georgia, they actually expanded voting days to include Sundays. They expanded early voting. They made permanent some drop boxes that didn't even exist prior to the pandemic in the last election. Some mail-in voting as well. I mean, they expanded voting in areas and in ways that hadn't existed before, but they weren't prepared to do what the hard left wanted to do in the course of the pandemic. So that means they support Jim Crow. You know, Jim Crow means they support literacy tests. They support poll taxes. They support brutality. They support segregation. This jackass president that we have, the things that he is saying, and then the people who follow him, his spokes that he had no self-respect. And then they hear LeBron James, who hasn't even read the law, or Magic Johnson, or Michael Jordan, and they're not alone. Even the commissioner of the Major League Baseball. Did they read the law? Did they know what the hell they're even talking about? Thank you for your call, sir. We'll be right back. Much love in. That's A-M-A-C-DOT-U-S. Stop supporting the liberal agenda that the other 50-plus organization has been pushing for. Join A-M-A-C-DOT-U-S. Well, we have a fantastic guest and a friend, Steve Dase. He's written a fantastic book, and I do not want every author in America to come on. Just certain individuals I know, and I know what they've done here. The Fauci and bargain, the most powerful and dangerous bureaucrat in American history by Steve Dase and Todd Erzen. Steve, how are you? Mark, I was doing great until I saw a guy here in Des Moines, Iowa eating outdoors at a restaurant by himself with a mask. And now I'm depressed, brother, on a Friday night. How are you? Well, this I got to see. If he's eating with a mask, I mean, that is... I hope you got some video of that. I'm doing great. Now, Steve Dase, your book is the Fauci and bargain, Mr. Boudous. So let's make sure we put it up at parlor, if you would, and link it to Amazon.com. You can get it to Amazon.com. This is a fabulous book because the timing couldn't be better. I've been watching Fauci going TV and taking credit for the vaccines. He's taking credit for something he had nothing to do with Steve. This has been an exercise in gaslighting for many a month now, Mark. And if you go back to very early in the pandemic in January and February, in January, he cited what we know from scientific precedent that respiratory viruses, outbreaks of respiratory viruses are not driven by asymptomatic spread. And yet we have done these crazy mitigation efforts for a year now on the basis of asymptomatic spread. He's been on February 28th of last year, wrote in the esteemed New England Journal of Medicine that has analyzed COVID and compared it to its predecessor SARS-1. And what we know about respiratory viruses, he guessed that the fatality ratio for COVID would end up being somewhere around a pandemic level of flu. And, you know, if you look at right now in the United States, Mark, the CFR, the case fatality rate is 1.8%. And since we're estimating there's about 10% or 10 times more infections than we've tested, that would put the IFR, the infection fatality rate, which is more important from a policy perspective at 0.18%, which would be right around a pandemic flu. And yet 11 days after he wrote that, and maybe the most esteemed medical journal in the country, he went to Congress on March 11th, told us this was going to be captain trips. It was going to shut down the country, went full, dentistry and more of the rains run for your lives. The NBA shut down that night, college basketball did, concerts did. By the end of the week, we were shut down as a country. We're still recovering from that. And we need to know what changed and what new data point, what new information did Anthony Fauci-Gleen and those 11 days that made him do such an Linda Blair about face. And Mark, he's done this on virtually every issue. He's been there and back again on every issue, on every side of every issue of this virus from the very beginning. And yet we have vested all this power in one individual, Mark, this is one of the largest audiences in the radio audience in the world. There is no one in this audience whose life, whose church, whose school, whose family, whose business has not been impacted by a man named Anthony Fauci that they didn't cast a single vote for. What do we do about this? I mean, this guy's been around half a century. He makes an enormous amount of money, 417,000. God knows about his bonuses. He's got massive pension building up, medical care. I've never seen it where a Buerkraken have the same job, 50 years in Washington, 37 years in the same slot. We need a 9-11 style tribunal about what's transpired here in the last year. And, you know, if you get the book, Fauci and Bargain are going to know there are several members of Congress, like Senator Ted Cruz, Congressmanship Roy and others who have endorsed this book. And I'm already leaning on those people. I mean, I know them personally, they're friends of mine. We need to know what transpired here. We need to know, you know, one of the things that shocked me right away, Mark, when I began expressing some scrutiny about this last year, is I really thought this would be like a proxy fight for global warming, and it would be basically the right-wingers up against academia like we see on that fight. What shocked me is right away Oxford University had experts that pushed back on the Imperial College model. What shocked me was right away Stanford University, one of the top five med schools in the country, pushed back on the IH and E model at the University of Washington. Out there out west, the University of Washington is where you go when you can't get into Stanford. And yet we listen to the UW experts at IHME and sort of Stanford. What really shocked me all along is one slate of experts that promoted one particular narrative have been the only ones that have been listened to. And yet we have experts from Carnegie Mellon, Rockefeller University, Stanford, Oxford, Harvard, like Martin Coldorf. You look at Harvey Rich at Yale University. These are some of the most esteemed elite academic sectors in the country, and they don't even agree with what we have done here with Fauciism, lockdownism, the mass social distancing, the mandatory mass. And I think we need a 9-11 style tribunal to get the answer to the question you did. They kept telling the smart, trust the experts. And yet we were only to trust experts that had a certain narrative like Anthony Fauci. If we face another contagion in the future, that really is far more serious than this one turns out to be. We've conditioned a lot of people not to believe it because they've been lied to and gaslighted for so long. We need to actually get to the truth of what happened here and why other experts were never ever listened to that had counter-opinions. The book is Fauci and Bargain. You can get an Amazon.com right now and strongly encourage you to get it before they ban it. That's Fauci and Bargain, the most powerful and dangerous bureaucrat in American history. I saw Fauci being interviewed today, Steve, and he looked like he was in a foul mood. I think he figured out that you have this book out right now, and that it's about him because he had that sort of Jake Tapper constipated look on his face today. Let me go on here very quickly before we come to the end of this. Your book is very, very compelling. Let me ask you a question. Do you think Fauci actually, because of his ego and so forth, slowed progress in dealing with this virus as opposed to helping us along? We quote from one of the books that the Founding Fathers used in the textbook at the dawn of the country that talked about what want and power does to the man, does to fall in an imperfect human nature. The reality is that when you have no check in balance, that's why our founders gave us checks and balances, Mark. Nobody knows this better than you. I mean, you've written more about this than anybody has. This is why they gave us checks and balances against their own human nature. They didn't even trust their own human nature, let alone that of that much vested power in one unelected individual who had no accountability whatsoever. And so when you set up a system where you just feed somebody's ego, they're never wrong. They can never be challenged. Look how defensive he has received gotten when challenged, even modestly by Rand Paul a couple of times in the seven. I mean, they start to you can see that he starts sweating. There was the comedian from Mexico that challenged him just even politely on some of his own vaccination rhetoric. Hey, we're not to get the vaccines, but still be treated as a referee. Like doesn't make any sense. You see how instantly defensive he gets. You know, you and people like you and I have done a lot of debates in our careers and typically when one side gets defensive and pushed back on, that's usually the side that has the weaker argument. Now that's quite right. Again, I want to strongly encourage you folks. This is really a fascinating book. You know, learn a lot more than you that we currently know. The Faucien bargain, the most powerful and dangerous bureaucrat in American history. You can see the link where we linked up there on parlor, Mr. Producer. We've linked to it on parlor. There's five and a half million of you there. I want to encourage it or go directly to Amazon.com. Good luck, Steve. Great book. And God bless you, my friend. We'll be right back.

Because of the tea party movement. You. One almost 70 seats. It's a massive landslide. You had enough with Obama. So the tea party movement grew and grew and grew with spontaneous movement. I'd written liberty life, excuse me, liberty and tyranny. And we expected we sent conservatives to the house of representatives. John Boehner became speaker in the banner. Spent time trying to convert the tea party types to one of the rhino types and he's very angry about it. He has excerpts here in Politico. Another reason there's excerpts in Politico is obvious because he used to leak the political. He used to say that he was a left wing site. This is where he goes a Maconnell go where they want to attack conservatives. And that's exactly what he does in here. And I want to read your part of this and I certainly do not recommend this book. It's barely literate. I'm sure he didn't even write it. We taking control of the house put me in line to be the next speaker of the house of the largest freshman Republican class in history. 87, I was misspoke. 87 newly elected members of the GOP. Since I was presiding over a large group of people who never sat in Congress, I felt I owed them a little tutorial on governing. This is where he's trying to, you know, lie like he does or schmooze. He wanted to basically take them over. I had to explain how to actually get things done. A lot of that went straight through the ears of most of them. Look how he's putting these people down. Specialty the ones who didn't have brains. They got in the way. Now you know why he wasn't a leader. He was a buffoon. Incrementalism, compromise. That wasn't their thing. A lot of them wanted to blow up Washington. That's why they thought they were elected. No, they wanted a leader. They wanted to advance principles. And you didn't want to do it. You were compromising left and right and cutting their legs out from other than you damn fool. Some of them, well, you could tell they weren't paying attention because they were just thinking of how to fundraise off of outrage or how they could get on Hannity that night. It's amazing to hear these long-in-a-toothed old Washington hands who all they do is fundraise, now attacking the Tea Party. The members of the Tea Party that were elected in 2010 for fundraising. Ronald Reagan used to say something to the effect that if I can get 80 or 90 percent of what I want, that's a win. These guys wanted 100 percent every time. Again, a lie. I don't know if he was writing this with a glass of scotch in his hand or not. In fact, I don't think that would satisfy them because they really didn't want legislative victories. They wanted wedge issues and conspiracies and crusades. Now you know why political ran this because it sounds like one of the writers for political. To them, my talk of trying to get anything done made me a sellout, a dupe, of the Democrats and a traitor. No. What made you a sellout, a dupe, and a traitor to the Democrats was the fact that you were a sellout, a traitor to the Democrats. Some of them had me in their sights from day one. They saw me as much of an enemy as the guy in the White House. Me, a guy who'd come to the top of the leadership by exposing corruption and pushing conservative ideas. Now I was a liberal collaborator. So that took some getting used to, but I also had not anticipated was the extent to which this new crowd hated it. And I mean hated Barack Obama. Here we get into it now. By 2011, the right-wing propaganda nuts had managed to turn Obama into a toxic brand for conservatives. He was a toxic brand, not because of the right-wing propaganda crowd, you idiot. When I was a first, and remember, he became buddies with Obama. When I first, he's trashing Tea Party people but was buddies with Obama. That just tells you how his mind doesn't work. When I was first elected to Congress, we didn't have any propaganda organization for conservatives, except maybe a magazine or two like National Review. The only people who used the internet were some geeks at Palo Alto. Listen to how this city talks. There was no judge report, no Breitbart, no cukes on YouTube spreading dangerous nonsense like they did every day about Obama. He says, secret Muslim, he hates America, he's a communist. Well, he does hate America. Now why do you didn't know what the hell you were doing? Fundamental transformation genius, what do you think that means? This is what I mean, folks. The left, they know what they're doing, the Democrat part, then we have putzes like this guy. And of course, the truly nutty business about his birth certificate, and I never bought into the birth certificate stuff. And I took a lot of help for this. Matter of fact, I posted, stop with the birth certificate stuff. Even now, people get mad at me. People really had been brainwashed into believing Barack Obama was some uncharing candidate, planning to betray America. Here we go. Mark Levin was the first to go on radio and spout off this crazy nonsense. I never said a word about him being born in Kenya or mentioned his birth certificate other than the criticized those who were. Maybe you were heavily drinking that day. You watch yourself, Mark. It got him ratings. Let me tell you about ratings in radio since Mr. Pothead here doesn't understand. We have no idea what gets us ratings, do we, Mr. Producer? Radio is so behind in ratings, it's not even funny. We get our ratings two weeks into the next month. We get ratings for the whole month. We have no idea if one show rated, if one hour rated, if one subject rate, we have no way of knowing that TV they do. Television, you get the ratings the next day, it's broken down by quarter hour. You can actually purchase and sometimes they do minute by minute to see what issues work. Radio doesn't work that way. So you have no idea what quote unquote works and get your ratings. Boehner is no idea. He's an idiot. So he puts it in here. In terms of the birth certificate, I wasn't any part of that, you damn fool. I am a constitutional conservative, and that's what Boehner hated. And when it became clear that he betrayed the Tea Party, he betrayed the people who are elected, in my view, he needed to be removed. And I plead guilty to being absolutely the first one, yes I was, to try and get this man removed. That's why he's angry. You're damn right I did, and I got on the radio and I speak my mind and I explain myself, three hours a day, five days a week. And it's all there on the public record. He was a disaster. And at some point I got a call from Mark Meadows, who would become Chief of Staff to President Trump, as you know, who had the guts. Who had the wisdom to try and figure out how to do it. And he put a proposal in front of his house colleagues. I gave him some input on that proposal. And Boehner quit because he couldn't beat them. Now you know why he hates Mark Libby? Oh yeah, they go to the crazies out there. Meanwhile, he's a lobbyist for potheads. It ought to be a lobbyist for booze because, you know, the guy, I think he has an empty leg. Mark Levin was the first to go on the radio and spout off this crazy nonsense. He got him raiding, so eventually he dragged Hannity and Rush to Looneyville along with him. My longtime friend Roger Ailes, the head of Fox News, was not immune to this. He got swept into the conspiracies and the paranoia. There were no conspiracies and paranoia, you idiot. And he came and almost unrecognizable figures. So this guy's having psychological issues because let me tell you, he turned on conservatives. He turned on the Tea Party. He was a lapdog for Obama. He was cutting deals with Obama behind the backs of his own caucus. And so everyone who had the intelligence and the strength to call him out now, you see, they're the conspiracy theorists. They're the nuts. And so here he is with a book that won't sell on a site that is left wing spewing his usual crap, John Banner. We don't miss you, not in the least. I'll be right back. What?

Join AMAC instead, AMAC.us. Let's go to Steve on Long Island, the great W.A.B.C. Steve. You're online. Go right ahead, sir. Hi, I'm African American. And if I wanted to complain about the racist procedure requiring ID to vote, I couldn't go to a law firm, a court, a DA's office, or a U.S. attorney's office to make that complaint unless I provided an ID to get into the building. Interesting. And if I was disappointed about that, I couldn't go to a baseball game unless I went and stood on the line and paid cash. The notion that they have that ID requirement in this day and age is ridiculous. If not racist, anybody can get a free ID from some government or state agency that they can use for identification if they provide their appropriate documents. And Georgia has in their law that they will provide it for free, and every state that I'm aware of that requires ID provides that. So this is a red herring. This is the Democrat Party using African Americans, using Latinos, using other people, using people with all kinds of, you know, maybe handicaps and so forth. This is what the Democrat Party does. This is a big brew, really, over nothing. Nothing. And yet they create this race issue, and sports jumps in, and broadcasters jump in, and all the rest jump in. Steve, I want to thank you for your call. Take care of yourself, my friend. And we all know it's a lie. Anybody can get an ID. Anybody. Everybody. Every Friday in your honor. Come hell or high water. Here we go. The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The"
