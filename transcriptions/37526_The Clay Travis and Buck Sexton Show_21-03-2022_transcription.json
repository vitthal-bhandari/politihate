    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast Welcome in our number three play Travis Buck Sexton show We are rolling through the biggest stories of the day encouraging to download the podcast make sure you don't miss a single moment And one of the big stories of the day and the week and the months potentially to come still is Hunter Biden's laptop and we bring in now Miranda divine New York Post writer author of Laptop from hell hunter Biden big tech and the dirty secrets the president tried to hide Miranda our audience already had seen enough to believe that the laptop was authentic Did you take any thanks for joining us by the way? Did you take any validation in the New York Times after 17 or 18 months finally acknowledging that the laptop was real Buried down in their article about Hunter Biden paying off his one million dollar tax bill or Were you just still angry that we're even in the position where the New York Times is allowed to validate anything? Well, look it's no vindication. I have to say for anyone at the New York Post for your listeners for my readers Everybody knew that this was a legitimate laptop We would never have published those emails back through weeks before the 2020 election if we hadn't done our due diligence so This is only news to the readers of the New York Times And I guess see an end-view is an MSNBC viewers in that half of the population that chooses to read and and view left-wing organs, but You know, I feel sorry for New York Times readers that they are Were kept in the dark for all this time. I guess it's a bit of a shock now for them and You know, I guess it's scrambling to try and figure out what's going on They were told that the laptop was rushing this information Joe Biden told them that Joe Biden told them during told all of us during The election campaign that he knew nothing about Hunter Biden's business dealings He had never met any of his overseas business partners and that was all a lie Renee, it's buck. I want to know as we now we it's important that everyone understand It's not that there's some new reporting that's come to light from the New York Times and others They were just telling us what you and others had known for a long time Which is that this was true and real what do you think though? There was such a concerted suppression Campaign here from the very heights of Democrat aligned journalism What was the the part of the story when it comes to Hunter Biden that was the most damaging or that they were the most worried about because there's the There's the personal stuff, you know, Hunter in the photos and the drug addict and being a mess then there's all that Ukraine and Burisma and China raising funds and 10% for the big guy. What was the part of it that they were the most worried about? Well, look they don't care about the Hunter Biden personal depravity and picadillos at all in fact They're encouraging people to talk about that Hunter wrote his memoir beautiful things all about his crack habit So and Joe Biden talked about his son's drug addiction. That's what they want you to focus on and then they can say he's a private individual We didn't vote for Hunter Biden to be president That is just a distraction mechanism because the laptop and Tony Bob Linsky's corroborating material and testimony is not about Hunter Biden It is essentially about Joe Biden Joe Biden was orchestrating abusing his power as Vice President for eight years to enrich his family and himself to get tens of millions of dollars from countries alike China and Russia and Ukraine just to name a few that are in the news at the moment for obvious reasons and that are You know our most serious adversaries and this puts the president of the United States in a compromising position and the fact that he has not told the truth about it the fact that people like Adam Schiff Democrats and And and their media allies and big tech allies have gone to such lengths to cover up the story to reduce the reporting to call us Agents of the Kremlin anybody who tries to talk about this truth this very important issue of national security is just dismissed as a right-wing nut job peddling Russian disinformation and Chief among those critics were the 51 I call them the dirty 51 These are the former high ranking intelligence officials such as former CIA director under Barrico Barmer John Brennan James clapper Leon Panetta Michael Hayden you name them they all came out with that later before the 2020 election to five days after our story ran Claiming that it was all Russian disinformation of course add weasel words in there which they're trying to use now to say Oh, no, that's not really what they said. No, that is exactly what they wanted everybody to get the impression to take away And it is exactly what Joe Biden did when he stood up at the debate against Donald Trump a couple of days after that letter came out and and declared that that it was a Russian plant that Blacktop was a Russian plant that our story was a bunch of garbage. So said these really esteemed intelligence people Miranda we had an interesting discussion to start the show about why now Why is the New York Times after basically buying into the lie that this was Russian disinformation and not covering it? Why are they now even though they buried it? I'm still old school Miranda and read the actual physical new paper They buried it like 20 pages back into the physical front section of the newspaper Why do you think the story came out now? Well two reasons one is you know, there still are some legitimate journalists and New York Times believe it or not And they were people there who knew who had talked to Tony Bob Alinsky last year They knew the laptop was real and I think there must have been some sort of internal friction But the reason for this particular story Was not to to you know backtrack on their previous rejection of the laptop The their admission that the laptop was real came in paragraph 24 the real story is was basically Rehearsing a defense for Hunter Biden of these upcoming Expected indictments from the US attorney in Delaware and he's been investigated Well since at least 2018 and the New York Times says it was previous to that But we know since 2018 he's been investigated for alleged tax evasion money laundering and violation of the Foreign Agents registration act These are serious criminal charges if they were to be brought and I mean Trump world was Was fully destroyed really by the farra allegations Paul Manafort spent time in jail And there are you know others in the Trump orbit who've who've had these issues So that was a never used or very little used Law before now it's become a big deal since the Trump era and it would be just very ironic if it were ended up being used against Hunter Biden, so they're obviously sweating. We haven't seen much of Hunter Biden in recent weeks and They the the grand jury there in Delaware has been You know subpoenaing his bank records. They've had his baby mama went and testified to them for several hours last week London Roberts the Arkansas former stripper who was the mother of his Now four-year-old daughter that she had to go to court to prove paternity off And her lawyer has handed over a whole case of documents financial documents to the grand jury so and Reading between the lines of the New York Times It seems that the grand jury has actually been using at least some emails that were on the laptop If not the entire laptop and we know the FBI has had the laptop Hunter Biden's laptop since December 2019 when John Paul Mac I's act the owner of that Mac book repair shop Handed it over to them. So and that's only one of three laptops that we know of that Hunter's lost Miranda Buck and I were discussing in the first hour and I'm glad you went through that that issue We also have the Durham probe going on. I Think that Hunter is going to get indicted for some charges buck took the other side We have a stake bet on it if you had to project Do you like my argument that he will be indicted for some charges or bucks argument that he will not which side do you think is more likely? I think he probably will be for two reasons one is that London Roberts lawyer is certain that he will be and another is because In this sort of rehearsal of his defense through the New York Times I've talked to Season tax lawyers about this and they say these are not excuses I mean saying that you you paid a million dollars worth of overdue tax after an investigation started does not You know get you out of the trouble and similarly You know retroactively applying for foreign registration I don't know why he would be allowed to do that and others wouldn't be allowed to do that So and you know there's ample evidence on the laptop also the Chuck John at Chuck Bradley von Johnson Senate investigation where they Have the money trail. I mean documents So I wouldn't have been able to access but this is from the Treasury Department These suspicious activity reports that banks packed a file There were a lot of those to do with all the money that was coming in tens of millions of dollars coming in to bank accounts Associated with Hunter Biden his uncle Jim Biden Joe's younger brother and their partners and I mean the crucial thing to remember also is that Joe Biden can't pretend that he knows nothing about his family this influence peddling scheme because he Lied about meeting contest business partners. He met several of them. He met Chinese business partners He met Russians. He met Kazakhstan. He's in that Mexicans. He met them in Beijing He met them in Washington DC. He invited them to his own home He brought them on to air force too So he is intimately involved and not only that there is evidence on the laptop Not a lot, but there is some evidence on the laptop that he financially benefited from Hunters business dealings overseas and that is both, you know combingled bank finances shared debit cards shared bank accounts and also Hunter was paying some of Joe's household bills for you know maintenance and upkeep on one of his Delaware mansions an AT&T phone bill every month So, you know that that shows that Hunter Biden Also when he complained Beasley to family members that he had to then you know give so much money to support the rest of the family and at once what he said You know I have to give half my salary to pop which is Joe Biden So there's a lot of evidence there and you know you wonder if Joe Biden paid tax on that money that he received Renjevine author of laptop from hell and editorialist over at the New York Post Miranda. Thanks so much Pleasure great to talk to you both Blocker you get nervous not at all man. I don't know my son I know but she is looking at it in my in my opinion from the perspective of What should happen based on the evidence in a country where the evidence makes prosecutorial decisions? I'm looking at this through the prism of he is the sitting president's son the Democrats run the legal apparatus like they do the media in many ways and David Weiss the US attorney for Delaware does he does he want to see his life destroyed? Does he want to see that's how the Democrats play? They're like a mafia family. That's how they play they play rough and I just think that'll end up clay Will he pay a fine and maybe an admission but no criminal indictment? That's it I mean if that's that's the real it's a is he criminally indicted with something that would seek to send him to prison No way no way that no one will do is gonna They won't do it my tongue like butter Man just be nervous. We'll see buddy. I'm telling you Do we have to put an end date on this one to like when do we end of this year? We have to like a statute of limitations on the bed here I think we well I think it's only one year because my my thought is that they will not Necessarily want to bring the charges right before the midterm because then it seems politically motivated even though Biden's not on the ticket himself And so I think they'll either have to do it soon Meaning you know in the next month or two or they'll do it next year after the midterms have already happened It would be a bold move to indict the sitting president son and but let me ask you this We don't have to bet on this does Joe Biden pardon him right away Well, he'll pardon him if he's not running for reelection I don't think he would do it right away because I think that positive would be if you're Biden Hunter Biden these kind of things take years and I don't think Joe Biden's going to run increasingly in 2024 so I think on his way out the door. Yes, he could pardon his son It would be amazing almost everybody would have gotten away with Russia collusion and all the lies and all those Makedations and then the guy that gets caught would be not for that But for something else from the from the Democrat camp would be hunter Biden Hmm. Well, I mean the wild thing is everything that the Democrats have been alleging against Trump and their fever dreams Biden's family did it That's that's the crazy thing and they're and they're not even willing to cover it even though it's happening right in front of their faces They're doing a fine would be a push is that what you call it by the way? If he just pays a fine I'd charge it. He doesn't have to be convicted if the charges come down I don't think he would criminal charges not civil charges. Yeah, all right criminal charges. Yeah It's gonna be great. It's gonna melt like butter He's gonna get charged car shield makes it easy and affordable to protect your car from expensive repairs Millions of Americans rely on them for just that much more car shield offers protection plans for around a hundred bucks a month The plans cover the cost of more parts your car will need and your mechanic will call for than ever before It doesn't matter whether your car's brand new right off the showroom floor If it's a hundred and fifty thousand miles on it car shield has a plan for you and your car when you need to repair You choose the mechanic car shields administrators handled the rest no paperwork no headaches plans with car shield also include a emergency roadside assistance rental car options and Trippery embarrassment you get coverage lock in your price now never goes up great promise and commitment from car shield That's why you need to go to car shield comm slash clay and buck or call 800 39 180 888 to save 10% on your plan and lock in your pricing forever That's car shield comm slash clay and buck or call 800 39 1 8 8 8 8 to save 10% a deductible may apply If we do see a significant surge particularly one that might result in increased hospitalizations We have to be prepared to pivot and perhaps reinstitute some of those restrictions That was dr. Fauci almost two years ago to the day Just kidding two days ago actually because he says the same crap all the time like nothing has changed And he's never ever going to let us out of the grip of his Cold little tiny tyrannical fingers. We may need to pivot again if there's another surge He says we're not he's not going anywhere to clay. He's promising us. He stayed around six You said you're gonna stay in this job until we get out of the pandemic phase Of course you've been serving your country now for decades Are we approaching the point where we are past the pandemic phase and you'll like go get some rest? I'm not so sure judge. I want to make sure we're really out of this before I really seriously considered doing anything different We're still in this we have a way to go. I think we got clearly going in the right direction I hope we stay that way this guy has been so awful so wrong and Such an impediment to the truth clay for such a long time now But there'll be a part of me. That's like without Fauci. I don't know It just won't be the same to talk about the madness of the of the COVID lunes I will be ecstatic when Fauci is gone for any reason because they're just gonna keep trotting out And this is where it's important on Fauci. I Really believe that Democrats will try to bring back masks as soon as the midterms are over This mask taking it off your kids not having to wear it. You don't have to wear it around the cities Look at the seasonal data every fall the number of COVID cases are gonna go up Just like with the flu and they're gonna be able to hit the panic button and And a seed to the wishes of all of their left-wing lunatics and that's what Fauci's basically letting him know That's why they let him out of the basement to go do this interview is hey I've got your back. We're gonna bring all of these restrictions back as soon as we possibly can We're gonna talk by the way with Seth Dylan he runs Babylon B He's next but in the meantime relief factor provides a solution to people contending with everyday pain that refuses to go away Created by doctors perfected over 15 years of scientific research Relief factor 100% drug free product made for you goes to the source of your pain Which is very often inflammation our friends at relief factor in fact, I've got a three-week quick start pack You take relief factor three times a day breakfast lunch and dinner for three weeks You'll know if it works for you or not Jeff living in Irving, Texas gave it a try now free of knee pain And he is back feeling great He's a car detailer working on his feet and he has joined the more than half million people and ordered the three-week quick start for Only 1995 go to relief factor calm call 804 relief 1995 three-week quick start just for you relief factor calm 800 the number four relief relief factor feel the different You Welcome back in clay Travis bucks extant show Appreciate all of you hanging out with us encourage you to go dr. Grab the podcast make sure you don't miss a moment Great conversation we have with Miranda divine of the New York Post at the top of this hour talking about the laptop of Hunter Biden and the final Acknowledgement 17 or 18 months after the reporting from the New York Post that came from the New York Times were joined now By Seth Dylan who is with the Babylon B He does fantastic work there and right now the Babylon B is locked out of its Twitter account over a I believe it was a joke surrounding the HHS commissioner of some level at in the Biden administration that may have also involved Lee at times I'm not sure exactly let's bring in Seth and find out what the latest is there Seth What was the joke? What was the headline you guys do fantastic work and what is Twitter doing kind of fill in our audience? Great question. First of all. Thanks for having me on. I appreciate it Thanks for being with us. So yeah, Rachel Levine was named one of the women of the year by USA today and we did like a satirical take on that where we actually selected Rachel Levine as our pick for man of the year And Twitter didn't like that very much. So that ran afoul of their hateful conduct policy Where we misgendered somebody targeted an individual from misgendering so They flagged that post and told us that we can only unlock our account if we delete that post and and basically what they're saying Is you know we have to we go we go through this form You have to tell this form and acknowledge that we did in fact Violate the hateful conduct policy and take down the tweet Otherwise our account remained blocked and Seth what is your position on this right now? I mean a lot of people I know in the past have just said oh Fine, I'll I'll I'll delete the I'll delete the offending tweet are are you taking a hard line one way or the other on this? Well, we feel we feel kind of obligated to I mean there's a situation here where we have to make it choice, you know we have to choose between like keeping this platform and the audience that we're connected to through this platform or Standing by our principles and this is a situation where they want us to basically affirm something that we don't affirm Or deny something that we want to affirm that a man is a man And so you know in order to do that to delete the tweet ourselves, you know Twitter This is the thing Twitter could delete this tweet if they want to because they don't want it on their platform Why are they making us do it? This is about submission. It's about ideological conformity It's about it's about forcing us compelling us to go along with their definitions and their understanding of reality And we disagree with that and so, you know, there's kind of like this. How could we in good conscience? Delete this thing We had an internal discussion inside of we couldn't Seth I'm also curious does a human being from Twitter Engage with you underneath this is there like a rep you can call or someone you can talk to to try to appeal this or is it all just Kind of form email and messages saying this is the deal Well initially when they notify you of these things It's an automated email that goes out whether whether a human actually reviewed this before that email was triggered or not I have no idea We haven't been contacted by Twitter yet up to this point. There's now a lot of media attention on this Is you're aware so we were trending throughout most of the day this morning on Twitter? So we may yet get contacted by them We're seeking out contacts over there to talk to somebody over there But they do have an appeal process that we can try to go through which will pursue We just you know We don't hold out high hopes for that to work out in our favor Seth I ran a media company as you know an out kick for a while and I know how valuable referral traffic can be from Social media accounts so whenever these companies whether it's Twitter Facebook Instagram whoever it might be Takes action against individual content providers like the Babylon be your out kick that has a significant impact in terms of the revenue and Site traffic that can be generated. What does Twitter shutting down effectively the Babylon bees account due to your ability to monetize your content? Man it's huge I mean it's hard to overstate it. You know Twitter is not it's not our top traffic refer, but it's one of them Yet we've long since been We've driven more traffic through Facebook than we do through Twitter It's just more geared towards now people tend to stay on Twitter more and retweet things and then link and then click through to the The links that you've posted there But but you know if you're you're part of the conversation when you're on Twitter This is where public discourse happens This is where all the people who will never migrate to parlor and getter and these alternative platforms Gabb and the like There you know they're staying on on Twitter. That's where the conversation is It's where a lot of the government officials are probably all the government officials at this point are on Twitter And so you know it's public discourse is taking place there when you when you when you are removed from that You're ostracized and you're removed from the discussions that matter So it is very costly even beyond just traffic. It's costly in terms of you know Like we have for example Elon Musk is a fan of ours and he engages with our content regularly He's not on the alternative platforms. He's on Twitter and so if we're not on Twitter anymore, you know we we we are no longer being engaged with and in front of prominent people with large following so the damage that it does just not just to our traffic itself, but just you know our Brand and being relevant It's huge big cost So how I'm first of all admire you for standing on principle because I think you're right here and Twitter does need to be held accountable for It's arbitrary and capricious rules as it applies to them. Um, yeah, how long are you prepared to continue this battle? We talk with Alex Behrenson all the time Twitter kicked him off Uh, you aren't officially kicked off certainly, but if you don't uh, if you don't delete this tweet It's a de facto kicking off right of your of your brand How long could this go on from your perspective? Well, that's a good question. I mean we I'm where you know, we feel pretty committed to not deleting the tweet So we're at uh, we're kind of at this impasse. We're just staring each other down right now Um, let's see what let's see how twitter responds. We'll see how the appeal goes Uh, of course, you know, we're bringing a lot of media spotlight to this. I'll be on tucker carlson later tonight talking about it Um, you know what what the thing that's important to us is that we generate enough support from our readers We have lots of loyal readers. We have a large email list. We're appealing to them to subscribe and support us Um because this could be a long fight. This could draw out for years Uh, I don't know when we'll be you know, there may come a time where the law changes or where the supreme court weighs in on this And twitter's compelled to allow us back on the platform. I don't know Um, but you know, I'm not I'm not calling for any kind of government regulatory scheme or anything I'm just saying it could it could go on for a long time.

I like mister That's probably the first time kid rocks ever been referred to as mister kid rock Yes mister kid rock is an exceptional rocker and and also uh Just all around great american for what I understand And he is very clear about the fact that while we're sitting here talking about the babylon bee having its twitter account log This is I've been hit with fact checks from uh, political fact and all this and it's they're always wrong when they do this by the way it's like they never actually are on the side of Nevermind the angels on the side of free speech truth. You name it I mean they're just always in the wrong when they do this stuff They pick these fights big tech and it's because if the big tech people making the decisions Don't go along with this. They will have insane 25 to 35 year olds who are protesting outside their offices and like you're literally killing me by like not doing what I want They lose their minds. They're a bunch of you know, they watch too much msmbc and comedy central and all the rest of it Um, here is kid rock just letting everybody know well sometimes you can't cancel people like him Why haven't you been canceled like people aren't allowed to say what they think you are I am uncancelable. Why's that? And i'm not dead with any big corporate things at the end of the day. There's nobody i'm beholden to no record companies so corporate interest no nothing and you can't cancel me I love it when they try. I I love hearing this clay. This is what we need people even irrespective of their Specific politics those look not ever people listening this will write in they'll say oh, but you know if I speak out I'll lose my job. I'm like look if you're the junior accountant at xyz corporation I don't want you getting fired from your job and not able to pay your bills and you know Have your wife or your husband all stressed out because you want to post something political Okay, there are you know, you got it. You got to have I always say have a plan to charge the machine gun nest Don't just run up the hill if your kid rock You're in this analogy effectively bulletproof. There are people like that they need to leave the charge of I'm not going to play this game anymore. Yeah, that's what's always been so frustrating to me about cancel culture in general is the people who already have enough resources and I put myself in this category now I if I first of all, I don't think that I could be easily canceled, right? Uh, but I have the resources to be able to say Exactly what I think all day every day and there are so many people out there in business Politics Entertainment that also have the resources to say exactly what they believe and they're still afraid to do so and I've said this before buck, but Uh, if you Don't say f you every now and then what's the point of having f you money? Uh, it's it is a conversation that I've had with a lot of people who agree with much of what you or I might say But they're like, oh, I'm afraid of what might happen to me So you got 50 million dollars in the bank. Why do you care like your family's gonna be fine You don't even have to say anything Crit You just have to say a man as a man I mean there's things that you could say that would get you in trouble No one's asking somebody you know, you don't have to be some uh, some free speech radical who is out there on the Our our most basic that the fundamental right you have as a human being never mind is an american to say what is observable fact and true Without reprisal against you from a society around you is something that is under assault right now Yes, they are attacking fundamental obvious truth and telling people to bend the knee over it That's what I know. We're not I wish we could sit here and say oh, why can't we all just say whatever and say that you know, no That's not say whatever is now a man as a man Well, it's crazy as buck even saying women should not compete against men Most sport riders are afraid to say it because they're afraid they might lose their jobs I mean, that's the world that we're in right now And I understand that if you make 50 000 dollars a year And you've got a couple of kids in school and you're 58 years old and you're trying to close out the rest of your career I understand why you could be incredibly nervous about that But I mean the people who actually have real ability like why does steven a smith who is the most powerful person at espn? Why won't he go on his show and say hey, you know what? I'm fine with people choosing their gender if they want to but dude shouldn't be swimming against girls Because of how woke espn is he's got enough money to live on for the rest of his life He's being a coward. He won't say people who are used to being celebrated by the elites And are used to making 20 million dollars a year Want that to continue even though they don't really need it It doesn't make much difference to the one way or the other at a certain point But it's all ego at that level You know, you want to be the guy or the gal who's invited to the fancy cocktail parties where the people who are important and powerful and rich all get to sit around and Determine that we're not allowed to Separate women from men in sports anymore. It's crazy. You want to take some calls? Let's do it Edward in Watoma, Wisconsin. What's up? Edward? Hey guys, um, I just have to say real quick you guys are doing a great job. Um, I should be proud. Thank you so much. We appreciate that Anyway, um Clay you're about a thousand times as intelligent as I am And I just think way way way over your skis on this hunter-biting indictment thing. Um, I have a theory why The new york times is, you know, what's your theory? Oh, I I think that they know Joe Biden can't make another three years. Um, I I think they're plugging their noses and I think they're getting ready to try to push him out and she'll come all in there. I It's an interesting theory Buck here's my theory. You can grab this audio and we can play and I'll sound like an idiot. I think hunter is going to be charged Uh, I think that when hunter gets charged they will try and stretch out the Uh the cases and Joe Biden in not going to run again He'll announce early in 2023 And at some point he will pardon his son for all the misgivings and misdoings and right off into the sunset I think i'm going to be eating a wagyu prefecture Steak at 16 or 32 dollars an ounce. I think it is and looking at you and saying oragato Mr. Travis or the very expensive Kobe beef I might invite meringue to divine because she agrees with me I might go ahead and bring her out for a steak. Oh, it's who it will take her out to steaks too But we're not done on this one folks. We're not done on any of this. We got so much more for you tomorrow Thanks for rolling with us play and buck over now play Travis and bucks extern on the front lines of truth You"
