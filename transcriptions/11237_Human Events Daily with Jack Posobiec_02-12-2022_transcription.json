    "text": " Elon Musk dropping the receipts on the Hunter Biden laptop ban folks. This is the story you need to hear. Plus, Kristen Beck, former US Navy SEAL coming out as D transitioning, and then since we're talking about gender transitions, Indiana Jones is Indiana Jones becoming female in the new movie. You need to hear about this. But in terms of everything else that's going on, folks, you need to join us as well. At America Fest later this year, December 17th to 20th, amfest.com promo code PoSO is the way you secure your tickets. Make sure you go. Your presence is requested. Posobic, Bannon, Tucker Carlson, Charlie Kirk, Tim Poole, Mike Lindell will all be there. Darren Beatty, the plan for America will be unveiled. Amfest.com promo code PoSO. Let's get into it. The morning of the Hunter Biden story in the New York Post happens, and it was weird, right? With distance and with what we know now, we forget some of the weirdness. But do you remember the laptop repair guy? Do you remember the uncertainty of the whole story? We didn't know what to believe. We didn't know what was true. There was smoke. And ultimately, for me, it didn't reach a place where I was comfortable removing this content from Twitter. But it set off every single one of my finely tuned APT28 Hack and Leak campaign alarm bells. So it looked possibly probably. Everything about it looked like a hack and leak and smelled like a hack and leak. But it didn't get there for me. And this is, you know, the work of content moderation is write a policy, create a system of governance, and then evaluate some new crazy situation against those standards. Why the need to do it? It didn't quite get there for me. It smelled like a hack and leak. We always knew that the Hunter Biden laptop, I always knew that the Hunter Biden laptop was real. You know how I knew? Because I'll tell you why. And I commend Elon Musk for what he's doing. I commend him for his commitment to transparency. All right. Now he also, right at the same time, has permanently banned Kanye West, yay West. Now I don't want to get into the content of it, but I will say this. I'm not for permanent bands. I'm just not. I don't think it's something that we should be doing on Twitter. And I don't think it benefits freedom of speech. It actually feels like something that was done at a personal reasons similar, by the way, to the Alex Jones decision. Now I can understand that and I appreciate the transparency. And I also think that what's going on with this Hunter Biden situation is also a commitment to transparency. So Elon Musk wanted everybody to wait. Wanted everyone to say, Hey, it's coming out. It's coming out. We're checking it in 40 minutes, became 60 minutes, et cetera, et cetera. But here's the point, folks. This laptop, this story, what is wrong with the election? It would have. And as a country, we need to deal with the effect of what that meant. Two years ago, over two years ago now, I was on war and pandemic. Every day, every morning, with Steve Bannon, going through the laptop, telling you what was in it, going through the dirty deals, charisma, Ukraine. There's a story. Think about it. Would the Ukraine invasion have actually happened if the election had gone differently because the laptop? No, seriously, seriously. I know. I know. Let's go down the road a little bit here. Because you've heard people admit this. You've actually heard people admit this from the administration that there was a strategic deterrence element with the previous administration that did not exist with Biden. Why? Because Biden wants to escalate, escalate, escalate, escalate, all the way forward. But instead, the laptop was censored. The election goes the other way. And we're not even going to get into all of the other issues that happened. But the polls came out. The polls came out and said that if just enough people knew about this in key states, that they would have voted the other way. And so the question before us, right? Who are you? Jack Dorsey, you'll Roth, Vijaya Gadeh. Do you realize that there is a scenario whereby in all the people that have died in Ukraine would not have died if you had not made these decisions as you did? Do you understand that? Can you live with that? Because you have to. And that's something that you've got to look deep into your soul, deep into your heart and deal with. Because you were the people who made this decision. And by the way, I'm even going to come out and say this, right? I was skeptical of the laptop when I first got it. When I got my copy of it, and I've always said, anybody wants a copy. I'd be more than happy to make it for them. I offered it to Jake Taper, offered it to CNN, offered it to the New York Times, offered it to Elon Musk. I offered it to anyone, literally anyone I could think of, Mark Cuban at one point, almost took it, almost took it. And then Ben Collins talked him out of it. Yeah, that's right. That's what he Ben Collins from NBC. And so do people even realize the level of what's in there? And by the way, when I hear conservatives talking about this, then in the new Congress, it's going to be investigated. We need to understand that the laptop itself is not the only thing we're investigating. The laptop is a starting point. The laptop is a starting point into charisma. It's a starting point into CESC in China, which is the CCP, the CCP backed entities. We are going to dig into all of this. And I want every single piece of it investigated. And if and when we find that it ties back to the Biden family and we find out how much money is moving hands, then we will know that those of us who were there in October of 2020, those of us who were there when it mattered in October of 2020, every day, going through file by file, phone call by phone call, voicemail by voicemail, text message by text message. That's what we did. We released everything. And what do they do? They suppressed us. See, I'm in Joe Morris with the great story of the New York Post. We had War Room and the whole posse sharing this stuff out like crazy and they banned us for it. So understand, this is our history and we do have to deal with this. And there needs to be punishments. There needs to be punishments for the people who made these decisions. They shouldn't just be allowed to continue to operate number one in Silicon Valley. I hope that everyone fires them. I hope we get rid of them. And then number two, we actually, if we have it a real department of justice that we're looking at actual civil rights violations, the question is, okay, you violated the civil rights of millions of Americans. Is there going to be an investigation into this? There should be. Is there going to be law enforcement involved in this? There should be. Because what they did, and this is why even look, I'm going to say it again, we shouldn't put all our chips into the basket of a multi billionaire. These platforms are public utilities. We shouldn't just blindly trust Elon Musk. We shouldn't finally trust anybody. We should trust the American people. And we should take control of our own freedom of speech. Does that make it perfect? No, obviously not. But this is a fight that's not going to stop ever in our lives. Because that's our system, right? We have freedoms because we fight for them. It's going to go to the courts. It's going to go everywhere. Never stop fighting for your freedom. That's your job. For 20 years, Chris Beck was a senior chief with the Elite Unit and took part in countless life or death secret missions. But look at Chris Beck today. Chris is now Kristen. The gender kind of disappears. The color of your skin, the race, everything else disappears and all you are, you're a soldier, you're a Marine, you're an airman, or you know, it's your job. It's how you perform. She retired from the steals in 2011 with a purple heart and a medal of valor. This one's a bronze star with a V for valor and a purple heart and a military defense meritorious service medal. I just wear a few of them just to kind of show who I am as a person and some of my service. I am 90% disabled at this time. So I have quite a few injuries built up over the years from being overseas and in combat. So it was kind of my time. I mean, I didn't want to be a detriment to the guys or out in the field. And it was my time to go. So in a huge new interview with my friend Robbie Starbuck, Kristen Beck has announced that he will be detransitioning back to Chris Beck. I got to bring on Libby Emmons to discuss all of this. So Libby, this person, this individual, Chris Beck, the former Navy SEAL, when they came out in with, I guess it was 2013 with Anderson Cooper, this was like the biggest news. I mean, this, they were everywhere. And what's crazy to me now is since he's done this interview with Robbie Starbuck, I can only find reports on it in conservative press or like Daily Mail. You go into, I just literally, before we started the show today, I went and typed Kristen back into Google News, zero results, zero results, which gets into a totally separate situation, by the way, of if only conservative news are reporting something, or like post blennial, for example, or humanevents.com, but Google News refuses to allow them to be listed, then how do you actually find out what's happening in the world? Because you just literally would not be able to find this information. Of course, I then went on Twitter because I actually prefer Twitter as a search engine, then Google. Yeah, I know you too. And I typed in Kristen back and it came right up. Yeah. So don't comment on that, but let's get into the actual interview. It's what did Kristen back say and announced the D transition and why? It looks to me like Beck was talking about how he was essentially indoctrinated into this trans cult and was brought into it, says that it was a cult. And now on the way out. He said that it was a cult. Yeah. You're not saying that's not you saying that. No, he said that. Yeah. He said that he was like brought into a cult. Yeah. Wow. Sorry, go ahead. Yeah. And was getting concerned about it when he was asked to write a book with somebody else tried to back out of that book project. This is of course, according to the blaze, which was the article I was reading about it, tried to back out of that book project. The book went ahead without his okay on the book. And this is actually a story, a kind of story that we do hear from a lot of D transitioners, people who go into gender transition, believing it's going to solve all of their problems. They are guided through it. Their hands are held. They get big love on them for going through this process. And it feels amazing. And then as soon as they start to have doubts, yeah, love bombing. That's what he said. He was love bombed. What was the point for the audience? So they understand what that means. I mean, I don't think I've really experienced it. That's when what happens is you become fully embraced by a community. You are fully affirmed in that community, boosted up, loved on lots of hugs and kisses and affirmation and you look beautiful and all of this kind of stuff. So yeah, that's what happened. And you feel great and then you just keep going with it. Well, and Dilly Colerin points out that in the interview, and everyone should go and listen to this Robbie Starbuck interview, that Beck says that a VA doctor convinced him that he was trans in a one hour session. The VA doctor then planned. Hach to deal to release a book together was able to put together the CNN interview where Beck comes out with CNN and Anderson Cooper. And basically it just got sucked into the whirlwind of the whole thing. And so it's essentially coming out against the entire psychiatric community and saying these psychologists convinced me of this and they told me that it would make me better. They told me it would make me whole. And now you're taking somebody who obviously, I know, was going to see therapy for trauma, but you know, I did VA related. So it's a military service related, but now we're putting children in children and has said he has now been off hormones for seven years, for seven years. And the media hasn't broken the story. It was Robbie Starbuck. Yeah, well, Robbie is terrific. And he does really, he does really strong work. But as I was saying, like this is something we've seen from a lot of people who have gone through the transition process and come out the other side, they say unequivocally that they received hardly any therapy beforehand, that they were loved, bombed by the LGBT, et cetera, et cetera community, that they felt great going into it, that they were affirmed and rejoiced on and all of this kind of stuff. And then as soon as they offered out, they are cast aside, like they don't matter at all. And the reason they're cast aside is because their narrative goes against the whole, you know, affirmation narrative. And so they're just pushed off and nobody wants to hear their stories. But this is what happens. There's a lot of women who've gone through this process who are furious at the mental health industry for having pushed them into this as they say, it'll be like an hour, you know, and then suddenly they're on testosterone. I've also heard from people who said that their psychiatrists or the therapist have told them outright to tell their doctors that they are suicidal so that they get the hormones and stuff faster. Completely insane. Go watch the Robbie Starbucks interview immediately. Everyone needs to see this. But folks, it is Christmas time.

Who is this man? I'm a god. I'm a godfather. Now, Libby, look, the new Indiana Jones trailer is out and I got to say, the buzz around this movie, I don't like it. I don't like what I'm hearing because it's another Kathleen Kennedy special, Kathleen Kennedy, who was the mastermind or the criminal mastermind, you could say, behind Disney Star Wars, the force is female, her famous t-shirt, you know, photoshoot that she took, and this idea that you're going to go and take all of everyone's beloved favorite characters from the past and make them female now. This is what was done with Luke Skywalker. Luke Skywalker was made into a female Mary Sue, this perfect character that nobody had ever heard of, no one ever had an opportunity to build a relationship with, did not go on any hero's journey whatsoever, immediately had superpowers, immediately was able to defeat whatever nemesis. And we're hearing, Libby, not only is that what's going on with this new Indiana Jones, the exact same situation that there's a new female character in Indiana Jones who's going to get the whip, who's going to get the hat at the end. There is a spoiler. Now Libby, I don't know, do you want to hear the spoiler because it's a rumored spoiler, so it should be get into it or not? What do you think? Yeah, I totally want to hear it. Let's go. So here's the rumored spoiler of the plot. Here we go, folks. And turn it off right now if you want to hear it. The ruined spoiler is this. So the show is called Dial of Destiny, that's the name of the new movie. It's just horrible. But apparently, according to spoiler, the dial is a time dial that the Nazis get a holder to go back. Oh, no, no, no, it gets better to go back in time to take Indiana Jones out of the timeline so that they are able to get the Ark of the Covenant, they get the Holy Grail, etc., etc., and they go on to win World War II. And because Indiana Jones, no, there is a potential filmed version of this where Indiana Jones dies, and then she has to go back in time and relive all of those moments, which, by the way, this is very similar to what they did in Avengers, that I don't know if you saw that one, but that's exactly what they did. It was a time- heist deal where they went back in time to correct things, but with new characters. So this is what they were doing, but instead of Indiana Jones going and getting the Ark of the Covenant, then she goes and gets it instead of Indiana Jones and his father in just one of the greatest films going in to receive the Ark of the Covenant, which, again, one of the most, or excuse me, the Holy Grail, one of the most famous Christian artifacts and, you know, I guess you could say rumored artifacts in all of existence, because, you know, at one point, we used to be a largely Christian nation, and now that's, oh, that's totally, you know, that's Gosh, apparently now, it's Gosh to be Christian. It's just a great movie. It's a father-son movie, really. It's a father-son movie, the United Round Faith. Well, it has Sean Connery in it. Sean Connery is a great individual movie. Who doesn't remember the line? Who doesn't remember the line, the penitent man kneels before God, right? It's like the line of the film, the penitent man lies before God. So apparently now it's her, and she goes in, and I guess he had a daughter or something in the new timeline. Libby, if this is true. It really sounds like a cross between Philip Roth and Dr. Who, like a really bad matchup of that. Why do they do this? Why do they have to go? So we had Lara Croft. Great. I love Lara Croft. They're really loves Lara Croft. She's great. Why do they have to make Indiana Jones a lot? They're not interested in actual storytelling. They're not interested in honest, truthful storytelling with characters that have meaning and weight that we can relate to. This is not the kind of female character that most women are out there relating to and really wanting to be part of. And it's a manufactured hero's journey for this woman. And we forget that- Well, it is hero's journey. Yeah, and we have hero's journey. We have feminine hero's journey narratives, just as we have hero's journeys for men. And we're talking biblically, we can go right back to the New Testament and take a look. We have Christ's hero's journey where he grows up and discovers what his purpose in life is and finds meaning through sacrificing himself for the world, right? Literally to think the world. That's his story. And if we look at the feminine hero's journey from the New Testament as well, we find Christ mother who very similarly, she grows up, she has a child, and she realizes that just as much as she sacrifices for that child with everything she has with her full heart and soul, she then has to watch him grow up and sacrifice himself to the world. They are different kinds of stories. There are similarities between the two. Every life has a little bit of both in them, but we degrade the feminine hero's journey when we say that it's not good enough for women to experience it and they need to embark upon this male hero's journey. The female hero's journey is spectacularly beautiful. It is compelling. It is a deeply entrenched narrative in our culture, in humanity, and in our bodies. And it is worth telling with new characters. And it's not, and we're totally out of time, we should do a longer episode on this, Libby. But it's not just a narrative. It's natural. It is the natural state of things. And that's why the, you know, the, and I view the New Testament is historical. That's why it's timeless. That's why, and other than the fact that it's completely real. But that's also why this is timeless. It's what, by the way, I just realized something as I was talking, that do you know when he kind of pauses when they ask who the girl is? And he says, she's my, uh, a god daughter. And they say, I don't know. I just realized something. What if she's actually him from another timeline where there was a female? Now we're going to call Dr. Who. This is full. And that right, right. And then so that's why they don't have a clearly defined relationship for them to explain to the people in the scene. So maybe the spoiler is awful a little bit. It's that they have to go to a different timeline where there was a female and they bring it. You can see it, right? You can actually see them in the little writers. Yeah, because this is what passes for story. What instead of doing story, let's do something so complicated and confusing. And then we'll just make it. Yeah, absolutely horrific. The CGI looks like crap. By the way, I'm just going to say it like, like I wasn't even a fan of Avatar, but at least Avatar look good. It was lush. It was professional. This looks like garbage. This looks like something that you'd see on like one of those old, where do they come to Gateway PCs, ridiculous Libby Evans, Post Millennial. God bless you. Thank you for being with us today. Thank you for spending the week with us. And for all of you folks back home, please remember once again, that ladies and gentlemen, you have my permission to lay ashore."
