    "text": " Hey, this is Dorei and welcome to Pause the People. In this episode it's me, Miles, D'Arin, Kaya, as usual, talking about the news that you didn't know from the past week, the underreported news of the week. Then I sit down with theologian and author Candace Bembal about her new book, Red Lift Theology, for church girls who've considered tithing through the beauty supply store when Sunday morning isn't enough. I learned so much. We chatted about heartache, loss, forgiveness, identity, and the empowerment of women who may struggle with feeling loved and nurtured by church culture. Now, my advice for this week is always to be open to learn. In this episode with Candace, she, you'll hear it, but there is a part where she really challenges the way that I thought about something. I'm like, oh my goodness, you did it. Thank you. Yes, yes. I thought I knew I thought I was doing the thing that was progressive and I didn't even realize it wasn't there. She really pushed me to be open to being pushed. Here we go. Y'all, my name is this week is from the LA Times. It was serendipitous how this news came to me. I was on the phone this week with some of my Maestro team members and Naima Keith. Naima is VP of education and programming at LACMA among other things. She's a brilliant curator and has been in the art space, Jammin' for a very long time. We were very honored to have the opportunity to speak with her. What she brought to our attention among many other things, brilliant things, is destination Crenshaw, which we actually had not heard of. As the LA Times article points out, destination Crenshaw is a little over a mile of Crenshaw Boulevard, which is essentially going to be transformed into a arts corridor. It's super exciting. I really wanted to dig in more about how this all came to be, which the article doesn't necessarily highlight, but I encourage you all to go to destinationcrenshaw.la to learn more information because I just think this is such an incredible project that really came out of a crisis in Crenshaw and then folk black folks getting together to organize and then having an answer that is just going to be so compelling and I think impact so many people of all ages, all hues, actually not just black folks for such a long time to come. But for y'all that don't know Crenshaw Boulevard is really the spine of the Los Angeles black community and some of this I'm reading from destinationcrenshaw.la so I want to give them give them their glory on this. So Crenshaw has always been a place of dynamic expression, black culture, black economic development, black economic legacy and ultimately the corridor and destination Crenshaw came to be because at one point the city was planning to put a train on Crenshaw Boulevard. And so it was planned for this train to go through Crenshaw really to LAX to the airport in Los Angeles really slicing through the heart of this black main thoroughfare and we've seen this done time and time again through eminent domain in so many cities and this has been happening over decades. And what would happen is that if this train was put there on Crenshaw it would have uprooted 300 business parking spaces, 400 trees, obviously impacting business, impacting culture in that thoroughfare. And there's also an argument too about cultural erasure that would have happened too with this train going through Crenshaw. But as the website points out for destination Crenshaw, black Los Angeles had a plan and really a creative collaborative and community led response to this injustice really brought this whole idea around destination Crenshaw. So it's exciting to see that all these folks came together with the goal of one continuing to preserve and really breathe the creativity and the resilience and the potential of this community but also drive economic and cultural revitalization to the Crenshaw corridor. So it's just exciting to see how this has all come together. I'm so excited to see when it comes to be it's not planned to debut until fall of 2022. Some of the artists that are participating are just top artists, top black artists, folks like Yanday Wiley and they're going to be these huge sculptures. And all of the art pieces really having meaning and contextualization in terms of black identity, black power, the legacy of black folks in this country. So all that to say, check out the LA Times article. There are more details there obviously but also go directly to the source destination Crenshaw.LA. Shout out to Naomi Keith again for putting us on and we're so super excited to continue to follow this program and to be there at its debut. Today my news is truly disappointing. Texas Governor Greg Abba is calling on licensed professionals and members of the general public to report the parents of transgender minors to state authorities. If it appears the minors are receiving gender affirming medical care. This is another case of people using legislation, power in order to perpetuate transphobia and to also control the destinies of other people's lives. And I have been very open on this podcast and everywhere else about being non-binary, being a part of the trans community and also just having different expressions of friends in my life who have all engaged with some type of gender affirming medical procedures or medical attention. And what I've noticed is when you let trans people have access to that care, you really help people activate their lives. People, excuse me, trans people do not feel activated if they cannot express what is happening on the inside and all of that does not include medical care. Does that always mean that's what will happen? But oftentimes it does for a lot, a lot, a lot of trans people. And if you can get that care earlier, if you can activate and express yourself on a particular yourself earlier on in life because you know your gender identity, your supporters, parents who are willing to do that, there should not be legislation that is stopping that from happening. It's truly disgusting. I think this is a huge pushback to the world changing and expanding around gender conversations. And it's a really disgusting attempt at control and hatred. And I hope people resist this. I hope this brings in more attention to why nonprofits like for the girls that helps black trans people get gender affirming surgeries who may not have it cost efficient. I hope people understand why that's necessary. Hope people see how fundamental helping trans folks is and how protecting trans kids really, to me it's kind of one of the big works of our generation because these moments are evil and they're going to keep what happening. And we have to be just as awake around just essentially civil rights being trampled over. That's my news. It is not usually the more lighter pop culture fun news that I like to bring to the podcast because it's podcast already be heavy because of all the things we talk about. But it is the news that really just gut-wrenched me this week and I really wanted to talk about it and I really wanted to spot nonprofits like for the girls as well as let people know that everywhere is changing and resisting at different places and together through education and understanding things around gender we can all help trans people live safer and fuller lives. Don't go anywhere. More positive people's coming. My news is about ambulance rides and it's actually two articles. The first is by Boston University BU.edu and it is your race may factor in which ER and ambulance takes you to. And then the other one is an Axios called ambulance rides are getting a lot more expensive. So I'm talking about these in relationship to each other because I was fascinated first by ambulance rides because of a conversation that started online that was actually about Uber because there is a program in Uber health that actually helps to transfer people that are not in emergencies that just need to go to and from a hospital and I thought that was interesting but there's another conversation that was sparking on Twitter probably out of six or seven months ago that was people that were using Uber and Lyft to go to urgent care to go to emergency rooms because it was much cheaper than an ambulance but also in some ways risk you right because when you go to ambulance or medical professionals that take you when you go on an Uber if you're bleeding internally externally if you are having a real health issue like a heart attack in the back of an Uber you know the Uber driver has no clue what to do with you. So that's what got me interested in this and as you can imagine there are racial disparities that show up and what was really wild is that in a first of its kind study researchers at BU School of Medicine showed the difference between EMS transport destinations of black and Hispanic patients with regard to white counterparts. So some interesting things that came out of the BU study. The first is that they showed that 40% of patients regardless of race were actually were not taken to the nearest hospital so that is you know my assumption was always that you'd be taken to like the closest hospital but they find that that is not the case. The other thing they did is that they used Medicare claims data to divide patients based on zip code they live in and in other identifiers and what they show is that there were sizable differences by race and ethnicity in which medical centers patients were brought to by the EMS and they showed and I quote the widest disparities were seen in larger urban areas with multiple hospitals and emergency departments within the vicinity. The study also found that black and Hispanic patients were more likely to be transported to a quote safety net hospital a type of medical center that by legal obligation or mission provides health care for individuals regardless of their insurance status compared to their white counterparts living in the same zip code. It was really interesting me to see the way that race shows up with things like where does the ambulance take you and again with no real indication of whether your health insurance at that moment or not because it's the ambulance and it's an emergency. So that was interesting but the other part of my news comes from a report that shows that ambulance rides are getting more expensive and it's a report that was put out by FAIR Health Fair Health and I'm interested in this because we often talk about the importance of having health insurance but health insurance just having health insurance is not often enough. So remember that you don't get to choose your ambulance provider like when you call 911 you get whoever comes or that's the fire department or private vendor like you don't it's rare that you get to choose especially in an emergency and here's the thing is that the report shows that private insurers average payment for those rides jumped by 56% between 2017 and 2020 from $486 to $758 and that's for what's called the advanced life support that ensures there's a charge for advanced life support and the other thing is that it shows that ambulance operators sticker prices before accounting for discounts negotiated with insurers have risen 22% over the same period and are now over $1200. And here's the thing Medicare the average reimbursement for advanced life support ambulance rides only increased by 5% so not at the rate of the increases of the cost and I say this because like hey there's a lot that I didn't know about ambulance costs but for people you know incomes are not increasing inflation is increasing if anything that like you know people are not having more money to spend and the money they're spending is not going as far as it was going before but you think about things like the cost of ambulances that people need in emergencies and literally like it is just going much higher what I didn't know is that some states have protections against surprise ground ambulance billing and those states are Colorado Deloera Florida Illinois main Maryland New York Ohio over Martin West Virginia but then there are states like California Florida Colorado Texas Illinois Washington and Wisconsin where more than two thirds of emergency ambulance rides include an out of network charge for ambulance related services which essentially is like a surprise surprise bill and blew my mind I wanted to keep talking about the disparities and just like the cost of health care because I when I was new to this conversation I thought that having access to health insurance was the big thing but health insurance that doesn't cover the cost of the things you need is actually not necessarily the big win and things like ambulance rides are huge because if you don't know what the cost is going to be some people just don't go get care which is actually worse or they're using something like Uber or Lyft and if they have an actual emergency in the back of it the person driving is not equipped at all to deal with it so I wanted to bring it here because it blew my mind and I wanted to share. My news this week is about an exhibition at the Baltimore Museum of the Arts which is running from the end of March through the end of July called guarding the art. The thing about this exhibition is that it has been curated by the museum's security guards. Now most of you know that when a museum is curating a new exhibit they bring an amazing talented artist and curators from you know either on the museum staff or from all around the country or in some cases all around the world to pick the things that will be in the exhibit to bring continuity to whatever is being put up for the exhibit but this is actually a very different exhibit because the curators as I said are the museums security guards. A trustee of the museum, Amy Elias came up with the idea in conversation with other trustees about ways to fulfill the museum's commitment to be more inclusive and more representative of the community. I think that there are a lot of companies that and organizations that are talking to talk about co-creating with the community or being in partnership with the community or being more reflective of the community and this one is actually doing it in a very interesting way and a way to put them anywhere their mouth is frankly. Each of the security guards shows pieces from the museum's collection for the exhibit and of the 45 guards on staff 17 applied to be curators on this project. These guards come from a variety of walks of life they're not just security guards some of them are artists or chefs some are musicians and scholars some are writers some are dog walkers some are veterans some are grandmothers and more and they've been able to collaborate with the museum's curators they've been able to conduct research they are being mentored and professionally developed by renowned art historian and curator dr. Lowry Stokes Sims and most importantly they are being paid for this additional time and responsibilities. These guards have the experience of being in the room with these pieces all the time and many of them have perspectives on the pieces many of them have are the first line of communication with museum goers who oftentimes especially in our communities are afraid or feel intimidated about going into museums and interacting with art in this way but the security guard is the person who you can always connect with at the museum and these folks some of whom have been working at the museum for 10 or 12 or 13 years these folks have now had the opportunity to bring the pieces that resonate with them that speak to them or that they want the community to see to life. I brought this article to the pod because I think that is an amazing I think number one it it it comes from an asset based way of thinking our communities have tremendous assets in them and just because they look like security guards or whoever else we don't always invest in and give opportunity to the assets that are in our community and this is this is something very very different the guards have had a tremendous time in enjoying themselves having fun curating this exhibit some of them are working their way through school and so the additional pay is actually helpful. I think another reason why I brought this to the pod is because it sort of closes the gap between the highbrow world of modern art and regular regular people in the community it shows that our community members through the security guards have an appreciation for our want to interact with our want to engage our community in the world of art and I just thought that it would be I brought it also to the pod because I thought that it would be a great example of ways of a model I guess that shows that when institutions trust community members co-create with community members bring community members in as equal partners magical things happen I am lucky that I live in Washington DC and I can you know take the 45 minute drive up to Baltimore this exhibition guarding the arts is running from March 22nd through the end of July and I would encourage us all to go and see it moreover I encourage you in your organization in your corporation and wherever you work to think about ways that you might bring the community members who work with you in your organization into the real work that you're doing every day I think the payoff is huge onward with Black History year as Kai would say and March is Women History's mom this week we have Candice Vimbal want to talk about discovering freedom and a progressive Christian faith that incorporates activism feminism and radical authenticity in red lip theology she writes powerfully about experiences at the heart of her Black womanhood and honoring her single mothers love and triumphs and mourning her and accept it passing she finds herself forced to share restrictions she's been taught to place in the practice of her faith and by embracing alternative spirituality in woman is theology and confronting conventional attitudes on body positivity and LGBTQ rights Candice helps to challenge religious institutions faith leaders and communities to reimagine how faith can be a tool of liberation and transformation for women and girls and all of us here we go don't go anywhere more positive people's coming Candice thanks so much for joining us today on POD Save the People thank you for having me I'm so excited to be so you know I've known you forever it seems like on Twitter but we haven't really had any like real discussions like this and it's it's great because your book just came out red lip theology and I've seen the tweets but now I got to read the text before we start talking about the book though can you talk about your journey what was the journey to becoming an author like how did you and as somebody who's written a book who um writing a book almost killed me it was such a wild process but what was your journey to this and why theology like why god so part of it is because one um we don't have many opportunities for black women especially black millennial women to have conversations about faith and what spirituality needs and best for them and as somebody who attended seminary went on to um congratulations from Duke and I just wanted to have deeper conversations about faith that one since but didn't center fifth hit black men I wanted I wanted black women to know that it was possible to have conversations about faith that allowed them to lean into the creativity and the uniqueness they are and really theology gave me the opportunity to do that and it almost killed me too like people I think people don't realize just how isolating and I didn't so many people do know how isolating writing a book actually can be and what it means to construct this argument that goes beyond tweets into something that everybody can can take a part of and so but I am grateful that I got the opportunity to do it and that people have been able to resonate with it in the way that they have there's so many gyms in here and let me just start with some of the things that really struck me that I was like oh I gotta get Candice to talk about this and then we'll zoom out to some of the big things but I was like let me just start with the meat so you write on you right early in the book something that I had not even like I literally had never I didn't have the language for this you wrote as a theological discourse creation care is just what its name suggests it's the idea we should actually care about creation god took such great time and attention to bring creation to being humanity should do more to honor and protect it and I literally had never heard of like this idea of creation care like that was I just hadn't heard of that and then you go on to talk about its important importance in blackness and I which is how did you I don't know like can you can you help us understand this like is this is it like is this something I should have known and just didn't know is this like has always been a big thing is this new and so that's the problem with with theological education right I mean I think that's a problem with writ larger education is that we have these conversations and institutions and in my ivory towers that impact so many people but everyone doesn't get to take part of and part of them right and so create before I got to do before I went to seminary I didn't know that there was an entire discourse and theological conversation around creation care like I didn't know that there were people who were really studying and advocating for us to think much more interdependently about the work that we about the work that we do and the ways that we interact with the rest of creation and for me like I mean I knew that I had friends who are vegan I knew that I have family members who were trying to minimize their carbon footprint I was trying to do the same thing I'm trying to do the same thing and I knew that a lot of it stems from ethical reasons because they share those reasons and at the same time there was a lot of theological grounding and footy with it that sometimes they could not circulate because they didn't necessarily have the language for it but again that's the that is always the downfall of the ways that education can be it's on a leader's project it's on a leader's project and so getting with in the conversation of of creation care and you might say naphso it was also because at the time I went to and I talked about this in the book at the time I went to seminary like that that 2012 to 2015 moment so much was happening in the world there was so I mean if your book might I talk about a Trevon's death and that the kind of birth of what what we know to be the BLM movement and with your boy Michael Brown and so you have all of these deaths and murders in this moment and you have black people arguing and fighting and participating for folks that really hear us as it relates to what it means to honor black life and at the same time I'm in these classes that are talking about creation and what it means for us to care for creation and it's like okay so if we're going to have a conversation about humanity as part of creation here then we also need to have a fuller conversation about what it looks like for for us to to take up the the work of protecting black life as an ethic of creation care and so it what is so it became for me like how do we use this discourse that already exists as a as a larger to push a larger and broader conversation that directly impacts what we are saying about who we think that is and who we think the world should be in relationship to that one of the things that I remember from writing my book is is how much writing it and writing so much made me sort of really come to terms and think through a host of things how did you grow in the process of writing the book like what was that like especially a book about God and it's so personal you know I'm gonna ask you about about your father and your mother and that relationship in a minute but before we get there I would love to know how you grew in writing. Part of it was you know I am I'm writing my way out of a a difficult time right like I am the loss of my mother and the ways that so many other things happened to me that were really totalizing and I am writing about that time in a way that pushes for me to to not only get beyond it but write myself free in a way right and so it it part of it required that I go back to those moments and and think about reflecting on what I was thinking reflecting on what I was feeling reflecting on who I understood God to be to me in that moment and how how God has evolved that relationship is evolved how I've grown from it I mean I wrote I wrote this book in a year and the entire time I was I was working with the same therapist that I had been working with and still am. That's my mom passed and so we've been working together since January of 2016 and so she was able to be there as part of that process for me so whenever I'm moments where I was like I need I need to talk through different views because I'm writing this and this is coming up one it was important for me to do that but two it was actually important for me to hear her say things like I am really proud of the work that you've done like let's sit here and just honor how far you come let's sit here and just celebrate the ways that even this moment you've been healed from and so like I think I think the truth for me is that when you allow yourself to be open to that process of not only just book writing but telling your story and what that journey will do for you when you allow yourself to be open to however that will transform you you can't help but be changed right so it has been the joy really of this last month just the book has been out to have conversations with people who've read it who have been an aunt when similar journeys and they mark a passage to me they really resonated and I'm like yeah that's exactly how so when I was writing it and so yeah I think when you allow yourself to just be open to the transformation you can't help but be changed and for me that was what I wanted this book to do I wanted this book to be something that the vulnerability and even the kind of gracious accountability that I give that I mirror in myself that I want to ask a mirror and hold to institutions I wanted people to be able to do that for themselves so that they could be home or that they could be free and it's been incredible to watch that actual life and people that I may never ever meet but they shared that with me. That resonates so much with me now I want to talk about the you know this chapter made me tear up partly because my mother left when I was three and it's still alive in the realm but just it was not a part of my life for a host of reasons and in the chapter where you read about your dad I like I was reading it and you know the scene where you know the parking lot all this I was like okay I was like I got it and and I was like okay what is what does God have to do with this I got it like I get the story and then Candace it was I'm reading I'm just ready to preach I'm like you better go ahead and write this chapter let me read the um let me read the part I can't read the whole chapter to everybody because you don't need to buy a book but let me start here and then let's see if we can mark through this together which is really code for it can you help us but you said I could no longer unsee the danger in assigning gender to God beyond just saying God is a man assigning the male gender to God potentially shapes how we especially black Christians see all men and I was with you and I was like okay cool and then boom boom it kept I was like okay let me boy I think I highlighted the next one okay and then you said in part ungendering God also freed me from the idea God has favorites and my dad was one of them and I was like okay ungendering God and then let me just the last thing I got to see because you wrote this chapter so I won't I won't quote this but then you you talked about both the tension between wearing a God as a black woman shirt and in the freedom that ungendering God has given you and you wrote for me God's love makes a difference what do I lose when I ungender God I abandon the notion that there are some who are outside of God's identity and therefore God's love y'all she is preaching and I look like you did that Candice this chapter I mean all the chapter but like act as a reader reading it I was like okay dad got it got it and I was like okay not God is a man and I was like okay you took me there can you talk about how you got to this as like an understanding yeah I had to be very I again this is this is like the earth he saved lives having a having a conversation with my therapist um about what about the level of resentment that I had with my father and how I felt like he was thriving like in my mind I don't I don't understand how you have a child in the world um a seed in the world that you don't care how it's growing like that just that and here's the thing I do understand that for some people there are extenuating circumstances they keep them from being parents whatever what have you and but at the same token I'm somebody who's like I like how could you not clear what's happening to me and because I I had some level of access and proximity to him I was still able to see how he was thriving in the world and how he was moving in the world and that really just made me mad and so I was like every time I heard God as he and God as this like loving father who I was just like yeah that's that's not how I understand my own father I'm tired of he pronouns because you only use that for men um and then when I looked up and saw that the majority of the leadership is not all of the book of the leadership and my churches are men it wasn't difficult for me to make those connections and I was like oh God and my daddy are homeboys like that's why his life is not um that's why he's not suffering because he's not being an astrophobicist to me and so therapy really helped me to come to times with the resentment I had around that and and a conversation that I had with my therapist but also the steps that I wanted a much more when I think about God I think about a majestic holy powerful intimate close connected caring the empathetic being and I wanted words I wanted phrases I wanted descriptive that I didn't use for anybody else when I was talking about God right and so what was beautiful was that one in a theology and where my I met God she's black shirt and referring to God as her felt very normal to me because I think it's I think it's I think if we were to do an exercise what we asked people to describe God in um using the descriptive of the person who's been the most affirming the most closest the the most God like in our lives I think they will all get different um different descriptions but they're going to be the people who have loved and nurtured us and I think that God is supposed to be that intimate and then personally also and so seeing God as and referring to God as her wasn't that difficult because of the mother that I had and that if I was to describe God in that way God would be reflected in my mind but at the same time I knew that I wanted I wanted a way I needed to articulate God in a way that was not common and I mean that restored some of the majesty and the holiness and as even I was being held accountable in and moving out of ways that saw people and gender and identity in these binary ways like I wanted I wanted how I talking spoke about God to be reflected there as well that like we're not that that this binary this binary doesn't hold true for humanity then it definitely doesn't hold true for God and so it was it was all of those factors converging in this moment that was like yeah like I get to I get to think differently about who God is because I need to and why do you call in the same vein in a later part of the book you call God the ultimate parent instead of like a father or mother why what can you explain to us why you do that yeah I mean for for that reason in and of itself is that like I think that we one I think that the more that we kind of abandon the idea that we all stuck in the heat in this in the binary it gives us more room to recognize the extent how expansive creation how expansive humanity is and just how deeply expansive God is right that like that is the capacity that God has to be all that we need is is not compass and conscious in a wonder like it's not in compass and in these words or these descriptors that already fail to fully articulate what we need to say anyway like for as expansive as language is languages always selling us because it can never fully give us what we need to talk about to talk about God or talk about anything like I mean think about how many times in conversation we said something like collective a little word or I'm trying to find a word here I'm trying because even without ignoring all of the words that language still does not give us the full breadth and weight of what we're trying to articulate and I think that if that is true anywhere it's true in in what and how we describe the holy thing the sacred things there were always trying to grow towards better language and so in our growth towards that it matters to join me towards the more expansive language boom there are two questions that we ask everybody on the pod the first is what do you say to people who have done everything they were supposed to do the people called emailed they stood in the street they read your book they read my book they did all the things in the world hasn't changed in the way they wanted it to what do you say to those people yeah I first say that I hear them and I stand with them and whatever space they need to hold that accountable to to the fact that it should be different I think that too often we try to rush to we try to rest the answers and we try to justify especially in church spaces and in religious spaces we try to justify with you know we'll just hold on or you know if if it hasn't do not need to explain these and my chances are something to speak you know what I'm saying and some things can and and and there are other structures and systems that are at work that are just not fair and what does what does it mean to be in community with you and not help to hold space for that I believe that somebody who is a community and know what it's like for for something to no matter how much I've tried to never be able to be different to never be able to be right it was me it just matters to hold the space to grieve back and to also say that even when in a truly believe this that even when things are not right that things can still be good and that I will hold space with you until the good things that are already present can't find a way to shine even brighter so that you can you can see them and hold close and the whole price of them until more until more good things can come and the last question is what's the piece of advice that you got over the years that stuck with you oh so this is my grandma and I was going to give a book and it is actually without hold close to is especially as a black woman like my my grandmother told me white people put on it they underwear she said draw just like I do one leg at a time and she said now if you find a white person that could put their jars on top they hate it and somehow they end up wearing them the same way you do now that's a white person worth listening to but I said you meet that white person don't ever feel intimidated at all by them because they're just like you she never wanted me to feel inferior she never wanted me to believe that there was something that I could not do simply because of the circumstances of my life right and I have although she meant that I'm like one specific context as I get older I'm able to know the broader weight and breath of what she was trying to say to me and I've held on to that like there have been moments where because we talked and you know it and all of our cycles and even in our professional other professional spaces we talked about the impossible same job we talked about the feeling of believing that who we are is not enough at the places that we are being invited into and for the situations that we're showing up in and I feel that myself at times and so I have to remember even if it is just as like one as my grandma did like handing everybody in his room if they draw them one leg in a time just like you did today. Believe know that you have done whatever you needed to do to earn to earn the space and the right to be in this room be grateful for the opportunity show up with that confidence and show up with that gratitude and I have had to hold on to that by myself I've had to pass that and I hope to pass that on as much as I can my only two to my colleagues and my peers but to younger folks who come behind me especially those of us who come from from family structures and from communities that would lead us to believe that we don't deserve to be in the spaces that we're in. I can't let any structure I can let any physicality in me or use turkey language I can't let anything cause me to believe that I am any less deserving of opportunities that I've worked for or opportunities that I've been graced with simply because my daddy ain't here. Boom can you tell us the book one more time and where people can get in? So Red L'Etheology is everywhere that books are sold. The subtitle is for church girls who consider titling to the beauty supply store when Sunday morning isn't enough you can get it wherever you get your books definitely what I encourage you to get it at an independent bookstore because that is where we need a lot of our dollars to go towards especially as COVID has impacted a lot of our independent small and small businesses but yeah it is it's out in the world is now in the world of mine I am so so grateful for for everyone's support. Cool we consider your friend of the pot and can't wait to have you pack. Thank you friend I had a I had a ball I really appreciated this I like I can't check this off of like my list because I told all of my friends I was gonna be out past like people so I am I'm kind of I'm kind of a big deal right now I'm a good chef.
