You can always catch up later on on demand on the iHeartRadio app. Now we've discussed a bit of crime stories today. We had a mass shooting that was averted from being a mass casualty event would have been a much bigger mass casualty event than it was. I believe three people were killed in that shooting in Indiana. We've got more of the you've all day after action report to look at and it's just it was a total breakdown. I've been saying it for weeks. Clay's been saying it for weeks. This is just the reality. And we still have I think as one of the top three issues in the country driving sentiment for voters and pushing people to consider not just the Biden administration, but the Democrat approach, the Democrat platform to have been disastrously wrongheaded. That might be far too kind way of putting it is on the issue of crime and on what has been done to this country, not just about defunding the police. Defund police was one of many symptoms of the anti law enforcement anti law on order left. There are progressive prosecutors. There's the ending of mass incarceration, incarceration, legislation, no cash bail, all of these things in the state of California and attorney, a district attorney who hopefully will lose his job soon. Clay, yes, go who decided that he could override the three strikes law that his own state legislator passed because he felt like it. All of this, this attitude of legalizing criminality, of being a friend to the criminals and ignoring the victims in our society. This has led to deterioration all across the country. And I bring you now the story out of Minneapolis over the weekend where you had an individual named Techley Sundberg, who was standing outside an apartment building over the weekend on Saturday. And he was shoot. He shot multiple rounds, multiple rounds into a woman's apartment. She was home. Her name is Arabella Fos Yarborough. She was home with her two children when bullets are going right through her window from someone standing right there. It's not like it was an errant bullet for a bullet from a mile away. He's shooting into her apartment. This is her and her children. There's then a multi hour standoff with law enforcement. Techley Sundberg refuses despite the entreaties of law enforcement and his own father to come down from a ledge and to stop being a threat, a lethal threat to the people around him. Law enforcement finally says we cannot risk this anymore. They shoot him a sharpshooter on the law enforcement at the law enforcement scene shot him and clay all of a sudden we have BLM protests about how this was racist because Techley Sundberg is a 20 year old black man. So they're saying this is racist. It doesn't appear to be racist to the woman who confronted the BLM protesters. However, here she is as she's telling everybody that she almost had her life taken away. That man was George Floyd was not art. Brianna Taylor was not art. This man is actually trying to kill us. Not so that came and helped him when he was alive. My kids have to see you guys celebrate a man's life that tried to kill us. It's kind of amazing that all of the BLM protesters were protesting on behalf of a guy who almost killed a mom and her kids. And not only did that happen, she then went out into the street and confronted them to say, Hey, y'all are protesting on behalf of a guy who tried to kill me. I'm not sure that we have ever seen a more unjust protest directly confronted by a witness to how unjust the protest was to the victims. To the victim, the woman who was huddling with her children, the bullets were going. The actual victim in this case went out to her credit. It would have been easy for her to hide and actually confronted all these protesters. And this is where we are, Buck. This is where we are. There is such a desperate demand for victims that the number of victims is not supplying the need for the anger and the angst on behalf of the protesters. This happened in New York City. Last was it last summer, Buck? And do you remember the there was a big fight outside of a restaurant in New York City because that was when New York City was requiring vaccine proof. And then they tried to accuse the Asian woman working the front counter at the restaurant in New York City of being racist and BLM started to protest outside of the restaurant. And they said, Wait a minute, you can see it on the video. Well, she was doing is having to ask for proof of vaccination, which was stupid. We all know, but that was her job at the front desk. She did nothing wrong and BLM was like, we're going to shut this place down if we have to. And then it fizzled out when the video came out and they said, Well, you know, I mean, this girl, first of all, she's a 22 year old Asian girl or whatever she was. Not exactly somebody in a position of great power working the front counter of a restaurant. And it's similar here. The desire, the demand for victimization is far greater than the supply. So you end up with situations such as these. And what we didn't play in that audio, because mostly because it would turn into a lot of bleeps because we couldn't air it was that the protesters. So so let's just as at the scene again, apartment building, crazy guy shooting a gun into his neighbor's apartment, stand off with police. He is shot because he is a clear and present danger to those around sniper while he's armed after he has tried to shoot into this apartment. And then the BLM, you know, Hey, what are we going to do this weekend? Let's all get together and pull and protest police violence because we're really cool and and moral. They get together and have a vigil and a march at this apartment building for the crazy guy who was shooting at people. Okay, look, it's a sad situation. And so far as the guy clearly has, you know, mental illness, but what are you going to do? You're going to let him kill people. I mean, they're crazy people running around with an accident firing his weapon. What do you expect for police to do and what should they do? They should take him out and and the mother here of the two children who had to huddle with her own children in her apartment as her neighbors shooting at her confronts these protesters. And you know what they do? They heap verbal abuse on her. That was the other you know, you're you're still alive. You should, you know, shut the bleep up. I mean, you know, they they start, I tell your story. They start attacking her. The woman who is just trying to live her life with her, with her babies or children, she's getting shot at. And the so so moral and self-righteous BLM protesters are attacking her because she throws a little problem into their narrative. But see, this is always true. BLM likes to elevate people as martyrs who are often criminals and who are even engaged in violent criminal acts at the point of violence with law enforcement or others. And they don't care about actual victims of crime. Yeah. And Minneapolis, which is where this is taking place, Buck, of all cities in America. I'm not sure there is a city right now that is under more duress because of BLM protests than Minneapolis. They can't hire people to actually be cops in Minneapolis. The number of actual police on the streets in Minneapolis has collapsed. They have off the charts level crime, murder, violent acts. If you're listening to us right now in Minneapolis, you know exactly what I'm talking about because people left as soon as this is the truth. This is one of the things that rush nailed. The drive by media shows up to cover the protests. They don't stay in any way to cover the consequences of the protest because the media is not there anymore. And they don't see how unsafe Minneapolis is. They don't see all the police deciding to resign and retire rather than continue to work. And they don't cover the victims of the massive increase in violence who are overwhelmingly. Guess what? Black and inner city residents who no longer have the police to help protect them and the media doesn't care about their story anymore. And the same thing for these BLM protesters who show up protesting this guy who was trying to kill people that the police took out, making tensions even greater inside the community. I believe the video we showed Buck we talked about of the little kid who was throwing punches. Uh, remember the like toddler? That was Minneapolis too. The culture of rot that has taken root in many of our cities, but particularly places like Minneapolis is so bad that you're creating the situations for more interactions of violence between police and the people they're trying to protect in the years ahead. Local police come from the communities that they police. They're actually people's neighbors who happen to have a gun and a badge and a job to do. But this treatment of law enforcement as the enemy, particularly in high crime neighborhoods as part of this ethos of the, of the far left, this idea that the cops are the problem. This is the inversion of reality. This results in a 30% increase in homicides nationwide in a lot more people going to funerals for teenagers and little kids and people in their twenties, uh, who are being murdered at completely, uh, horrific rates in cities like Chicago and Minneapolis and many others now. And one of the things that hold this holds this all back is that the Democrat apparatus does not want the public to see that they admit they were wrong about all of this. So they'd rather just keep this moving along as it is than say, wow, we, wow, all that bending the knee and BLM is so important for society that was done in June and July and August of 2020 by corporate America, by everybody on the left and all the Democrats. It was atrocious for everybody. BLM made everything worse for everyone. Millions of people are dead today that would have been alive if police were able to do their jobs and the only time violence gets covered by and large, I think that Chicago, a Highland Park as awful as it was Buck. That happens every single weekend in Chicago, except it's inner city victims and nobody cares. No media covers it every weekend, virtually all year round in Chicago. They have a Highland Park total crime victim tally like that and almost no one even blinks. It barely even makes the news.

One big story that popped over the weekend that continues to define the craziness of the modern Democrat party. You'll remember Leah Thomas, Penn's transgender swimmer who won the 500. The University of Pennsylvania nominated her for Woman of the Year. This is a top award given out by the NCAA for the top women's athletes. We are going to have, I give credit to her for speaking out, one of the women who swam directly against Leah Thomas, Riley Gaines from the University of Kentucky. Buck, I don't know if you saw her tweet, but she responded to me when I put out this story about Leah Thomas. Most women's athletes have been afraid to say something. Even the parents have been afraid to say what they really think. And I just want to hit you with these tweets that she sent. And I read them and I was like, thank you. Thank you that someone is finally actually speaking out and saying what virtually anyone with a functional brain believes, which is a biological man shouldn't get the opportunity to compete against women. Here's what Riley Gaines said, Buck. There's a picture up of Leah Thomas standing next to Riley Gaines after their race. And she said as follows, being the real girl in that photo and also the University of Kentucky's nominee for NCAA Woman of the Year. This is yet another slap in the face to women. First, a female national title, which was won by Leah Thomas and now nominated for the Pinnacle Award in Collegiate Athletics. The NCAA has made this award worthless. She continued, this award combines athletic performance with academic service and character. What character has Thomas shown other than sheer selfishness and entitlement? The disrespect and disregard for the other female athletes in Thomas's interviews is eye opening. Wow. Well said Riley Gaines University of Kentucky should be proud because that's also well written and well delivered. She is well educated and she is not afraid and she's going to be on with us now Buck Wednesday of this week to discuss this story. Dropping cannon balls of truth into the deep end of the pool there. How great is that? Yeah, it was phenomenal. I mean, it's just fantastic. But there is a broader point here as well and it is that the libs, the media, same thing, so passive aggressive on this issue all the time. They'll say, what's the big deal? Just use someone's preferred print. What's the big deal? Just be accepting. It's not that many people. Why do you care so much? And then you go, oh, they try to exhaust the general public on these topics. And then it's, oh, look at this. We're giving the woman of the year award to a man. And then you, what, you sit there, you say, well, hold on a second. What do you, I thought you said this wasn't a big woman of the year. And what a slap in the face to women, right? But this is what they always do. Why is it such a big deal? Why can't you be nicer? Why can't you be more accommodating? And they exhaust you with that. And then the moment that, you know, you think, all right, well, you know, maybe I guess where they're going, oh, woman of the year is actually a man. This is the way they play the game all the time, particularly on this issue. Because the general public is not with them on this. Yeah. And to Riley Gaines's point, this is the unmatched award for excellence delivered by the NCAA. And all of these women have worked their entire lives to be the nominees of their respective schools. So I think the University of Pennsylvania deserves a great deal of criticism here. But the fact that 99% of women's athletes agree with Riley Gaines, but are afraid to say what they really think because they're worried about whether they'll get a job at an investment bank buck. They're worried about whether they'll get into a grad school. And so as a result, we have this stultifying culture of silence. My friends can use the bill. If you own a business, the road has been bumpy. A lot of potholes from the pandemic to inflation. It's been one thing after another. If your business has five or more employees and managed to survive COVID, you could be eligible to receive a payroll tax rebate of up to $26,000 per employee. This isn't alone. There's no payback. It's a refund of your taxes. The challenge is getting your business the refund money. Go to getrefunds.com. Their tax attorneys are specialists in this little known payroll tax refund program. They do all the work with no charge up front and simply share a percentage of the cash they get for you. I met with a CEO of getrefunds.com and it's an amazing business, amazing company they're running to get you back the money you deserve. Go to getrefunds.com.

We have Stephen Miller with us now, former senior advisor to President Trump and president of America First Legal. Stephen, great to have you back on the program. It's great to be back. Thank you. So you're on the front lines of the legal fight in so many ways, but I wanted you to tell everybody about what America First Legal is doing when it comes to places like Dick's Sporting Goods offering benefits to employees who abort their children but not offering equivalent benefits to mothers who actually give birth. Tell us about this. Yes. So America First Legal recently launched a new effort to go after well corporations for violating the civil rights of their employees and the American people in general. And tragically, Dick's Sporting Goods is at the leading edge of the world corruption of corporate America. And they have announced a policy which provides a $4,000 subsidy to pregnant mothers who abort terminate the child living inside their womb, but no equivalent such benefit to pregnant mothers who choose to allow that child to continue living and ultimately be born, which violates federal civil rights law, specifically Title VII of the US Civil Rights Act as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which forbids discrimination against pregnant moms. And obviously by financially incentivizing pregnant moms to terminate the baby, they are discriminating in an illegal way against those mothers. Dick's Sporting Goods also has adopted a formal published system of racial quotas in making decisions about hiring and promotion, which again, facially violates US federal civil rights law. And so Dick's CEOs or Dick's executives and CEO and corporate leaders are all engaged in this scheme to break the law and violate the rights of their employees. And we filed a formal federal civil rights complaint following the process outlined in federal civil rights law to hopefully initiate action against the exporting goods for violating all of these various federal laws. And I would also say to everyone listening today, if you are an employee of Dick's Sporting Goods, if you know someone who is an employee, please contact us at AFlegal.org. So that we can potentially represent you if facts warn. Steve, this is amazing. The work that you're doing because on the one hand, if you take a step back, this is one of the most craven business moves I've ever seen because if you have a baby, you are pregnant and you have to, which is why we have protection for pregnant moms, you are, you're working through your pregnancy, you typically are taking time off after you have a baby. When they are paying people to have abortions, they're basically ensuring that they almost have no lost workdays, right? I mean, on the one hand, if you go back and actually look at this, it's like, wow, this is incredibly craven. And so that angle. It's the most self. It's the most self-interested, cold-blooded bottom line calculation. You can imagine, which is basically you're not going to miss time for your OB-GLAN appointments. You're not going to miss time for labor and delivery. You're not going to miss time for bonding with a new kid. You're just going to keep showing up. You're going to grind it out in our stores or in the corporate ladder and you're not going to miss a day. And so we're basically going to save money by paying you to have an abortion. It's really sick stuff. Yeah. So that part, I think of this lawsuit is utterly wild, but also I'm curious what you expect. Buck and I have talked some on this show about the Supreme Court finally taking back up affirmative action. And you mentioned civil rights violations predicated on hiring or firing based on race or not permitted under United States law. What do you think is going to happen when the affirmative action case, which has been taken by the Supreme Court and will be heard this fall, presumably based on just looking at the past writings and also the Supreme Court makeup right now is going to be struck down. What is that going to do to your opportunity to also pursue lawsuits like these? Oh, it's going to be revolutionary. The Supreme Court ruling in the affirmative action case, which is really just a racial quotas case disguised as affirmative action has the potential to be earth shattering. I believe that we have five judges who will vote to uphold equal justice and equal rights in America. And that's what this comes down to. You have, in this case, Harvard University, but you have universities all over the country that are engaging in wantonly, virulently discriminatory behavior. They solely on skin color or ethnic background in a way that is so plainly in violation of federal law, not to mention the equal protection clause of the Constitution. It is just so completely, transparently lawless. I pray to God, look at those five votes. And that will open up, hopefully, the floodgates to much needed litigation to begin shutting down these practices all across the private and public sector. We're speaking to Stephen Miller, former senior advisor to President Trump and the current president of the America First Legal Foundation. Stephen, you also may have seen that a federal judge just a couple of days ago blocked the Biden education department's expansion effectively of Title IX through guidance, which would have prohibited discrimination based on gender identity. So this now brings the trans issue into, you know, into Title IX and federal civil rights law. The judge put a temporary hold on this one. But essentially, you've got 20 Republican attorneys general led by Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slattery in Clay's home state saying, well, what are we supposed to do about gender segregated sports under Title IX saying that trans individuals can't be discriminated against? What is this playing out? Well, that's an incredibly important ruling. And you know, one of the reasons why I got into litigation after leaving the administration is because so many, I'm not frankly most of our cultural battles that are going to decide the future of this country are going to be decided in our court's law. And so we're beginning to see a lot of brave attorneys general fighting back against the radical gender ideology and the administration's implementation of it in our court system. My organization has a very important lawsuit in this area as well. And I would say that the, it gets back to the same issue, which is that all of these trans policies are facially discriminatory against women. And so we created this whole body of federal civil rights law to protect women's spaces, to create separate leagues for women's sports in order to ensure that women are not discriminated against because they are women. And now we have in the name of trans ideology, we have men taking opportunities away from women right and left, not to mention invading their personal spaces. And we've all seen the stories about, you know, for example, naked men parading around women's locker rooms and the things of that nature. In fact, my organization has a lawsuit against Loudoun County public schools in Virginia, which alleges among other things that students are being forced to share bathrooms and locker rooms against their will with the opposite sex. It's absolutely insane. I mean, it truly is. I mean, Steven, we were talking with Senator Ron Johnson last hour. And I don't know that we ever would have ended up in a situation where you have to, in order to be able to get a Democrat nomination for the state or Senate, you have to be willing to not say that only women can get pregnant. Like you have to say men can get pregnant or they will not nominate you basically for a statewide or certainly national office now. It's become the most important litmus test in America. Yeah. We would be wise to use it in reverse, which is the state of the American people. Do not support any person for any position of power anywhere in this country from your school board to the office of the presidency. If they are not prepared to say that only women can get pregnant. This wild that we ever got this is this is now we're now on the cutting edge of conservative theory here by just saying only men can get pregnant clay. This is where we are. Only women can get pregnant. Sorry. You got crossed over there. You're going to be the nominee for the books. Only women can get pregnant. Sorry. Sorry. Last question about this that I encourage everyone to think about today, which it was a picture of someone trying to get off the Titanic. I shared it this morning. It's so good. Yes. Only women and children can leave and then the gentleman said someone to the effect of oh, I'm trans. How is the Titanic evacuation? It worked with if the trans ideology had been in place back then. Great question. There's such a great meme for people out there who remember the movie Titanic. The bad guy in Titanic is trying to get on the lifeboats and the guy says only women and children. And then the next shot is him saying I'm trans. And then I mean, it is really ridiculous and funny one, but what would you do that? One of Billy Zane's better moments in film is when they say half the people on the ship are going to drown. He's like, not the better half. By the way, he definitely is a Biden voter. I'm just going to say it. Oh my goodness. That is a fantastic line. Stephen, we appreciate the time. Keep up the good work. Thank you. Talk soon. Clay, we got some breaking news, buddy. I haven't told you what is some breaking news could could be kind of a big deal. That's what we call a vague tease. What do you think that is a vague tease indeed? I'm looking up. I'm like, Oh man, I got so wrapped up and how good that meme was. I don't even know what the breaking news is myself. Involves nukes. I can tell you that. Oh, that well, that sounds pretty serious. Well, let me tell you this. This is nowhere near as serious, but I went. I had an awesome time. I was down in Orlando, Florida over the weekend. A couple of my friends from law school have now been married 20 years. We went to celebrate with them. Congratulations to Chad and Rachel Cruz, by the way, in Orlando. And while I was there, you know what I did, Buck, I wore my wolf and shepherd shoes out to my party and man, they were awesome shoes, comfortable as sneakers, but have the great look and finishes of Italian leather on the top founders, a former track athlete and a shoe designer. Two is phenomenal. They are so comfortable whether you are going out for an event like I was at a 20th anniversary party for a couple, whether you're going to work, whether you're just going out to an event and you're a woman out there and you don't trust the choices that your man is going to make. And I know there are a lot of you when it comes to what he is going to wear, you need to get in the wolf pack and join wolf and shepherd. You will love them. They are really a game changer. Rob Gronkowski wears them. He's going to be in the NFL Hall of Fame, Clay Travis and Buck Sexton wear them. And well, maybe one day we'll be in the radio Hall of Fame. You can join the pack at wolf and shepherd.com. No promo code needed. Visit wolf and shepherd.com. That is spelled S H E P H E R D. Do it today. Hi, I'm Dr. John White, Web MD's chief medical officer and host of the health discovered podcast where we bring you fascinating stories and unique perspectives like our recent episode where we break down the myths to uncover the facts of type one diabetes. A lot of people, very well meaning people who cared about me just thought that it was caused by a diet or can be cured by diet and exercise, especially right after I was diagnosed. People saying what was it that you ate or are you going to have to change your diet to get rid of this? There's still a lot of people see me pick up some kind of dessert and they're like, oh, should you really be eating that? Or thinking, you know, if they give sugar free things to people, that's helpful. Listen to health discovered on the iHeartRadio app or wherever you get your podcasts.

It felt like my movements were in the spotlight. In Gresa, Valbenasine Capsules is a prescription medicine for adults with TD. It's the only TD treatment that's always one pill, one staily, and it's number one prescribed. And people taking in Gresa can stay on most mental health meds. In Gresa can cause depression, suicidal thoughts or actions in patients with Huntington's disease. Pay close attention to and call your doctor if you become depressed, have sudden changes in mood, behaviors, feelings, or have thoughts of suicide. Don't take in Gresa if you're allergic to its ingredients. In Gresa may cause serious side effects, including angioedema, potential heart rhythm problems, and abnormal movements. Report fevers, stiff muscles, or problems thinking as these may be life-threatening. Sleepiness is the most common side effect. Now that treatment has reduced my TD movements, it's nice. People focus more on me. Ask your doctor about In Gresa. Or learn more at engresza.com. And visit engresza.com. Welcome back in Clay Travis, Buck Sexton Show. We are finishing off the Monday edition of the program. We've had a lot of fun. Also, hopefully you've entertained and educated all of you. Senator Ron Johnson was our guest in the second hour. And then we just talked with Stephen Miller. Encourage you guys to go sign up for the podcast. Make sure you don't miss a moment. Help us set a new all time record in July. I mentioned Buck that I had finished Endurance, which was your recommendation. If we have the Clay and Buck book club here. And that built off of me telling you, Undaunted Courage was really good. And then we had a conversation surrounding Unbroken. All three of those, and I will respond. I said they were all great stories of American will and ingenuity and endurance. They're British. All right. So I've acknowledged the Brits were involved in Endurance, which is an incredible book. I got a suggestion from one of you. I think one of you emailed in and Allie, our producer, forwarded it. And I already had this book, but I hadn't started to read it. I did over the weekend. The boys in the boat, about a 1936 Olympic rowing team originating from from Washington. We got a lot of listeners now in the Seattle area where the University of Washington is located. And it's fantastic. I'm about halfway through it, Buck. I'm in the mood right now to read books about people triumphing and overcoming difficulty and everything else. And all those books kind of run together in the indomitable spirit of the American will. And I'm loving it. I rode crew at Amherst for three seasons. Oh, I didn't know that. Yes, I did. And I can tell you that it involved in New England, at least getting up very early, going very cold and having your hands look like uncooked hamburger meat pretty much four or five months of the year at a time from rowing with a wooden oar for hours and hours. So what got you into the idea of rowing? I had no idea. You'd done that. Oh, yeah. No, they had they had try. So basically the tryouts involved being on an erg machine. So it was just almost like a general strength fitness thing. And then they would put you they would put you in in boats. And now some people were recruited or came from from high schools where they had already been rowers, but to fill out all the boats, they basically said, look, we'll teach you to row if you can pull a certain score on on erg machines, you'll be in a sort of erg machine rowing machine. Same thing. Side note, by the way, even people who are very fit far far far better shaped than me, of which there are unfortunately for me far too many people do not know what the hell they're doing on the rowing machine and the gym. It is the most misused piece of equipment people look like they look like a caterpillar that's having like a problem one of them. Yeah, they have no idea what they're doing like a caterpillar that's been electrocuted. But it's important to know how to do that one properly. But anyway, yeah, I rode and was I froze. I didn't do it for very long three seasons and and then realize the season is a long time three months, maybe he's not very long. Oh, no, I did for all freshman year, sophomore year, and I stopped at the end of sophomore year. It is a rowing for those you've done it. You have to really love it because it is just physical punishment. It's a little bit like it's an endurance sport. So it's for people who like things like to like, yeah, like I really want to do one of those 50 mile ultra marathons. And I'm like, and then I was here the stories by these guys. They're like, it was it was amazing. The blisters covered my entire feet and my nipples were bleeding from the chafing. But I loved every second of it. I'm like, that doesn't sound like fun to me. Those things are not for me. I did a half marathon when Laura, my wife was before we had our second kid. She was like, we need to do something together. We're going to run the Nashville half marathon. And so I hate running. I mean, I would I don't hate running in a sport. I hate just being outside running like over and over. Same thing. So we started to train. She found out she was pregnant about halfway through and then was too big to be doing the you know, 12 and a half miles or whatever the heck it is of running a 13.1. And so I did it and they take your photo when you cross the finish line and they said, Hey, this will change. You know, you train for a half marathon or a marathon. You're going to feel so much better about yourself. And there is a still photo of me crossing the finish line, the half marathon. And I look utterly disgusted. It's a perfect representation of it because the only thing I could think when I finished was I wasted so much time training for this. And I'm not an incredible athlete or even a very good athlete by any or even a good by any stretch of the imagination. But when Oprah Winfrey ran a marathon, which she did, I don't have any doubt that if I trained enough, I have the ability to do it. I hate the time and the effort that goes into training for something that takes them. By the way, I did say that there was breaking news and I know I wanted to talk about this instead. So Iran says they can build a nuke anytime they want at this point that they've enriched a 60% they can get to 90% the last 30% is a much faster process. So we're going to be hearing a lot more about a nuclear Iran as in a nuclear weapon holding Iran, everybody on Biden's watch war in Ukraine, nuclear Iran up next and maybe China invading Taiwan. That's quite a foreign policy he's got going and Russia's visiting Iran right now. And the way you'll know whether Iran has a nuclear weapon capability or not, it's based on whether we attack them. Because if we attack them and they have nuclear weapon capabilities, uh oh, that really gets scary. We're just leaving some things to the very end here. That's why you got to join us tomorrow. We'll break all this down and more clay and buck over and out. Clay Travis and Buck Sexton on the front lines of truth. Okay, round two. Name something that's not boring. Laundry? Ooh, a book club.
