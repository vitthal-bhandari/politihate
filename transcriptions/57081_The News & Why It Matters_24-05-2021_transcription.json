    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you. No matter how dark things have gotten, if you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on the screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind Today at BlazeTV.com slash The Blind. Today, Ron DeSantis signs a bill cracking down on Big Tech and a new U.S. intelligence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic actually originated inside a Chinese lab. Uh oh, another flip flop on the horizon. We've got a lot coming up today and it starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez, Happy Monday. And usually when I say Happy Monday, what I mean is it's Monday and it's really not that happy. It's very gloomy here in DFW, but we are here anyway. I am joined today by the one and only Eric July, BlazeTV contributor who is looking very fancy and red. Yeah, just red. Please all in red. And also joined by former sports reporter Jill Savage. Thanks for being here again. Thank you. And this weekend while it was also gloomy, it's going to dispel any notion that anybody thinks I'm cool out there. I was watching a documentary on one Thomas Sol featuring more of Eric July. Much to my surprise. There I was on my couch over the weekend saying Eric, you're in my living room. Autographs after the show. Oh my God. I will be signing autographs after the show. Because that's what we do when it rains on Saturdays. Yes. All right. So Governor Ron DeSantis, he is like really, really making me really want him to run for president. He signed legislation today, reigning in big tech companies and empowering users who believe they have been discriminated against unfairly. Now his office sent out a press release explaining the bill and it says all Floridians treated unfairly by big tech platforms will have the right to sue the companies that violate this law and win monetary damages. The attorney general of Florida can bring action against tech companies that violate this law under Florida's unfair and deceptive trade practices act and social media platforms can be fined like $250,000 per day on any social media company that de-platforms. Here it is. De-platforms, any candidate for statewide office and $25,000 per day for de-platforming candidates for non-statewide offices. And by the way, it does say any Floridian can block any candidate that they don't want to hear from. So they're basically saying the onus is on you, user, if you don't want to hear from someone, you can just hit that block button. But it is not up to the social media companies to start blocking and treating unfairly any potential political candidate. Now I know a friend of the program, Anna Pauline Oluna, who was running for Congress, did have this happen to her. She was censored majorly by not only Twitter, but Instagram as well. And it makes it very hard, as it turns out, to run for office when you have a big tech colluding against you. So DeSantis said in remarks at the ceremony that the big tech companies have surpassed that of early 20th century monopolies that spawned US antitrust laws and that tech companies have become the new public square. And he slammed them for suppressing ideas that are either inconvenient to the narrative or that that they personally disagree with. Eric, he says that this is the new public square. Do you agree? I agree with that. I mean, I know some people that probably are going to watch the show are going to disagree with me, but I disagree with you. They are there. Oh, right now. I do right now. This is on the libertarian jet. Yes, I am at it again. I disagree wholeheartedly with that particular position. I will say this. And I haven't read the actual act, which I am going to make sure I do my homework because I want to make sure I do kind of a long form response to this. But I will say this, when it comes to, it doesn't really matter. I don't care if the person is running for office or not. But the argument when it comes to social media, tech companies and their regards is that look, you have a terms of service as far as I'm concerned, that is a contractual agreement. It definitely with their partner, like what I am with Facebook or something like that, where you get in the monetization program. So not only am I expected to obviously follow the rules that you said for me, the same goals for you. And unfortunately, I think a lot of folks have lost sight of that because a lot of folks that have went that angle, this guy right here, I'm back to back strike removal champion on YouTube because I went flip tables, raised a little hail, but I'm not looking at it from, okay, you're treating me up, which they are. Let's be clear. Yes, of course, when it comes to the actual like political positions, we know they have a heavy bias. We've even seen that they reported that around the election, looking at Facebook employees and like the vast majority of them all, you know, of course, lean Democrat. I know that, but my position is more so you have a contract contractual obligation. My political position is a relevant to that. So you got to uphold that. So you just looking for a reason to, let's say take me off. Okay, if I violated a natural rule, that's one thing. If you said it fine, be clear about it. But what you can't do is just up and do it. And you know, it may be a more so contradictory to the rule. So I need to look at what more so he's looking at. It seems like it more so only applies to a candidate sees and look, I'm not oblivious to the idea that yeah, if you're definitely, if you're not known, like if you're not someone that's verified or anything and you go get out there, you don't have a rather bigger name for yourself and you're trying to campaign, you got to kind of have to use Facebook. So I can totally understand that. But this idea and it's very dangerous. We've talked about this on the show. This idea that, okay, they have monopolized something, which again, they haven't. If you can point to me some sort of like grants and stuff that they're getting to stay afloat to be as big as they are, I'm a hundred percent obviously for moving them, but they don't have a monopoly. Let's say on, let's say being on social media, there are plenty of alternatives to these websites, some of which one of which maybe went down, got back up, but there's other ones that exist. So we can't even claim that. But this whole public square argument, that is a dangerous position. And I don't want to go in that direction, which unfortunately it sounds like he has been a lot of other conservatives are going, but that's why I'm going to be bumping heads and now you get to see for the goes, look, oh, he's just some crazy conservative. Yeah, you're going to see where we actually disagree. And this is one of those positions. Yeah, Jill. You mentioned how you had another strike on YouTube, Stephen Crowder has that going. It's a very big lawsuit. Now he said this is the big one. Steve Day said earlier today on his show, he got his second strike on YouTube. They aren't telling them why they're getting me. They didn't tell me. So I have an issue with that. I know that this is all about the political aspect for the Floridians. But when you look at social media on a bigger scale, you can't have this continue down this road where YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, they can just deplatform you without giving you a reason, right? If you're going to go back to your argument of we're in this two way contract together, you have to uphold your end. Now it might be something where there is legislation, it might just be, hey, we're just going to sue you and figure this out until you have to uphold your end of the deal because you can't go on YouTube and have them just not tell you what they're going to give you that second or now, potentially even a third strike for it and get you done forever. You don't have that platform anymore. Is that fair? No, that's not fair. So we have to figure out and rectify that. But for Florida, hey, there was one politician that lived in Florida. Maybe I know he doesn't live there right now. He's moving back up north, but maybe we can get a Trump back on if we can get some floridian protection here. It might make it more fun again. What is your opinion on DeSantis' comments that the tech companies have become the public square? See, I could see it in a way because especially during COVID, right? Nobody was going out, nobody was communicating in the public square of any kind. Social media became that for us because we were all stuck at home. So if you just take it from that aspect, I can definitely see where that would be a public square, if you will, because this is where we have our dialogues and our conversations. In the olden days when they would go literally to the town square to have these conversations, we now have them from our living room right there on our keyboards. It's a difference and I see where he's trying to take this and I could see and I could make sense that this would be where everything would be leaning towards. Do you, are you in favor of the section 230 protections being revoked or? Yes. Okay. Take them away. And just, I mean, see, here's my main issue. And Eric, I know I've heard where you stand on this, but it's like, what do we do with these companies? Because I certainly am not comfortable with the Biden-Harris administration creating some sort of new rules, having some big government regulations on big tech at this point. So what is the answer? Yeah, I mean, Mark Zuckerberg is trying to get regulations. Which is like, you're like, oh, we're not here. Yeah, okay. Your spot is just going up. Yeah. And you go, this doesn't feel right if you're asking for that. But that's how those companies have always operated and that's the part of the history when we talk about monopolies. They're historically speaking, there has been absolutely zero monopolies. Then whether you go back to the bail monopoly that didn't use the state to basically become exactly that. Because that's what you have exclusive right, rightful ownership of whatever product, good whatever. And you need the state to obviously push out your competition. And this is why I'd say, and to answer your question, I don't know. But I believe there are, certainly with the Googles of the world. I don't know if you guys know, definitely we talked about this with Amazon, for example. Before they even became profitable, they were working with literally hundreds of countries' governments around and hosting them on the cloud. That's my issue right there is that you're basically taking taxpayer money, though not necessarily directly, but it's more so in the form of a grant or a subsidy or in this case a contract where the state of course is monopolies. Now I won't say monopolize it, your money here. But they take your money and then they give it to these companies by way of let's say a contract, which I've seen that happen with Amazon. They bragged about it. This was even long before AWS was even turning a profit. That's what they did. I want to attack that. Unfortunately, I've not heard a lot of, let's say, conservatives or the Republicans that are in Congress that talked about that. Let's look at all of these companies. Are they receiving contracts? Of course they do. We know that the ad council, for example, works now. We see that with COVID where they literally get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to pump out this propaganda. How about we get rid of that stuff, so that they have to compete with the rest of the market for your dollar, not trying to rely upon, which in a lot of cases again, it happened with Amazon where they were propped up by way of the government because of those contracts. I'd much rather attack those, but everybody's unfortunately too busy looking at, all right, well, this is a public space. The government should, you may have some Republicans go as far as I say, the government basically should take hold and control of these sites such as Twitter and Facebook and all that. We don't want that. We do not want that. So let's attack the actual issue and let's look and see if they have money that they're bringing in by with contracts or just direct grants and subsidies. And let's trip them of that. Let's discuss it. Yeah, by the way, I would like to just remind all of you out there that Republicans had a lot more control than they do now and chose to do absolutely nothing in regards to big tech. So just so you know who the people out there are who are fighting for you, it's not anyone. Congratulations. Well, it's us. All right, it's us. Very few and far between. We find those fighters that are actually in Congress right now. All right, we've got more to come. First we want to thank our sponsor, Built Bar.

Oh, and they've got some new members. Did you guys know this? New members, Corey Bush and Jamal Bowman. Congratulations to the squad for expanding. I didn't realize there was that much stupidity in the Democrat party, just kidding, yes, I did. They all issued statements over the weekend or late last week amid this rush of anti-Semitic attacks in American cities. These were taking place after the Middle East conflict between Hamas and Israel. As you can see, we played this last week, but just as a refresher, there are people literally hunting down Jewish people in the streets of America, asking, are you Jewish, are you Jewish and beating the tar out of them in response. So the squad members of course spoke up. Ilhan Omar said, horrific and unacceptable. Nobody should face threats and harassment based on their religion or ethnicity. Let's see, Bowman said, there is no room for anti-Semitism, hate or prejudice. But other members of the squad issued statements that were more equivocal mentioning anti-Semitism alongside Islamophobia or couching statements against anti-Semitism with critiques against Israel. So they can't just come out and say, hey, if you are pro-Hamas, which by the way, you are a terrorist organization, so probably shouldn't be for them. But if you are pro-Hamas, probably don't attack people, don't beat the crap out of them because of their religion or ethnicity. But that was not said. It of course was like, well, I mean, yeah, you definitely should be an anti-Semite, but also I mean, Palestinians have a right to say, no, no, no, no, no. Let's address the issue at hand here. Where are we going with this, Eric? Look, guys, I just, what they do is textbook gas light. And I think people need to start paying attention to that because you see that we point out the inconsistencies and it doesn't matter to this group. And this is why I think playing with these guys with kid gloves is a way that you lose. Because let's, I mean, we don't have to stop there. Let's go back just a little bit further when we consider what was happening over the summer last year. And at no point in time was it, or rather, did they see any sort of consequence for hyping this up, whether it be in property damage that ended up happening out of response to all of this ordeal. And people were unfortunately killed in some of these events and riots and what have you. At no point in time, was it suggested that they were inciting any of this? Now here, of course, to try to rid their hands of any blood, that's what they're going to say. But I know it can be frustrating when you look at the hypocrisy it is that they have, because it is. But you've got to understand this game was rigged. It's been rigged for a very long time. But that's, this is just, you get another example of, and then it has shown you that they don't care. So they can get away with whatever. But the minute you say anything and even with whatever, Jay Weary, which we found out a lot of January sick, if not all of it was a lie, but for the most part, everything from the 500 being beat to death, the cops, that was all bull crap, it was all nonsense. Yet again, they would, of course, prosecute anybody. They're sending their, they're trying to arrest people's grandmas and all kinds of stuff, surrounding that. Of course, we know how they're treating people that supported the previous president and saying that you, you incited this and all that. And what's going to happen to them? Jill, I want to add to the conversation. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Friday, There is no room for anti-Semitism in the movement for Palestinian liberation. Our critique is of Israel and their human rights abuses. This is not an excuse for anti-Semitic hate crimes. And by the way, let's not forget in 2019, Alon Omar said, Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. Yeah, that's why I was really surprised that she actually came out and said something in favor of Israel. Now you do look at it and they have one side and then they balanced it out with the other. Oh, Islamophobia, you can't have that either. You can't just have, have, you know, Israel for, and the forefront in front and center. You actually have to look at the issue. What's happening right now in New York, in L.A. Jews are out there eating, dining. Yeah, they're being told to say it home. Walking around the street being asked if they're Jewish and then being beaten up. Like in American society, I never really thought that that would happen. You hear the stories of the 30s and how did these people turn in to this kind of a society? If you don't stop it now, if you don't take that hard line now, where will this lead, right? We saw the peaceful protests. We're now seeing Jewish people being beaten up in the streets in multiple cities in the United States. You have to call it out for what it is. You have to call it, you know, it's, it's wrong. It cannot stand. If we don't have enough people coming together, the squad, they're a joke anyway, but actual leadership coming behind this with some jail time, with some arrests, with some actual gusto behind it, I'm scared to see where that's going to lead. Yeah. And again, it goes back to the gas like I was talking about. I know every time we get to talking about the subject, I bring up Gina Carano, but I just want to compare and contrast what she got prosecuted for. And they acted like she was just going all that Jewish people when literally what she said, what she was afraid of happening, it's happening now. It's happening by people, actual, literal Jewish people are being attacked. And all she did was share some meme that basically said people wonder how it gets like that. Well, you get folks turning on their own citizenry. Like what? That's, that's, she's been vindicated more than no, but again, my frustration is always going to be not necessarily with the hypocrisy. It's the fact that there's going to be no consequences. We're going to sit down here, yeah, the top of the mountain, like you're a bunch of hypocrites. You know, you, you play by different rules and they don't care because again, they're going to see absolutely no consequence. But the minute you, you don't even have to slip up. If they can try to pin something on you, they'll say you inciting violence and they'll pay $2 billion to protect themselves over in the capital. Yeah, the FBI is still looking for grandmas from January 6th. I mean, come on. All right. So there is new US intelligence out that was first reported yesterday that adds to the, I'd like to call it, I guess I need to call it a conspiracy theory because I don't want to get dinged for anything because, you know, the overlords, the big tech overlords that we talked about just earlier, you know, they might ding us for false information because that's what they did. Oh, back in 2020 when people said, Hey, guys, we think that this might be from a COVID-19 might be from a lab, a Chinese lab leak. So this of course suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic originated inside China's only biosafety level for laboratory. The same guy who way back when told us that was nonsense is here now to tell us this today. This is of course, Anthony Fauci watch. But no, I'm not convinced about, I think that we should continue to investigate. Oh, she'll find out to the best of our ability. Exactly what happened. Certainly the people who've investigated say it likely was the emergence from an animal reservoir that then infected individuals, but it could have been something else and we need to find that out. So, you know, that's the reason why I said I'm perfectly in favor of any investigation that looks into the origin of the virus. Obviously. Well, he's perfectly in favor now. I mean, it wasn't perfectly in favor previous to this information arising to the public anyway. And this is of course that three researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick enough with COVID like symptoms in November 2019 that they required hospitalization. So now all of a sudden, I mean, people got kicked off of social media for spreading this conspiracy theory. Now all of a sudden, like most things that have happened in the last couple years, someone says something that they believe is true based on the evidence that they have at the time. They get banned from social media. Oh, all of a sudden whoops, actually it was true. Yeah, it'd be one thing if they were just, which not most people did this, but it'd be one thing if they were like, hey, okay, we still don't, we're trying to look into this, we're trying to find out what actually happened. But that's not what they did. You saw the CNNs of the world and all their headlines were like, well, the president said this, which you said exactly that, that the virus originated in the Chinese lab. And they would say that that didn't happen like it did happen, like as if it was conclusive. Like you mentioned, this is part of the course with everything else that has been happening as it pertains to COVID-19. It's only a conspiracy until it's not. And if Archie's big head behind, all he does is take both positions. So he can come out on the top again, I'm always reminded of always the sunny of Philadelphia because that's what they always say. I always take both positions. So I always come out on top. And that's what Fauci does. He's done it with the mass thing. And now he's here like, well, this is where I'm at with it. Maybe they needed it. I'm always, I was always for it the whole time. I wanted them to investigate what was going on out there in China. No, you weren't. Like, let's be 100 about it. But as I mentioned, no consequence. Who cares? Fauci gets to take every position. It was still going to be the highest pass for him to pull a government employee. He's going to see no consequences. This is why I want to keep kicking his can down the road and remain irrelevant. Yes, I do believe he's narcissistic enough to he actually loves being on the front of those. This story is a summation of everything that we have been talking about with social media, with the de-platforming or, you know, silencing of opinions. Now you look at there have been no consequences for anything. This story encompasses all of that. And this is where it leads to that even at the end of March CNN was still saying, oh, it's a comic thing. Like don't even look at the possibility that this could have come from a lab at the end of March. Here we are now at the end of May and saying, oh, of course, why couldn't this have happened? It's the only level four bio lab in China. It's common sense to think this now. President Trump said this in April of 2020. Do you think that the president of the United States has a little bit more information than anyone else that was up there speaking? You know, that day, like there's common sense. That we just avoided the whole time because it was orange man bad. Yeah, it is interesting because when you look back, pretty much everything that President Trump said about what was going on, he's been proven to be right later on down the road. Like remember when he said they were spying on my campaign, they were spying on us and it turned out that he was right and they, you talk about gaslighting Eric. Epic proportions of gaslighting going on. Oh my gosh, this is a conspiracy theory. He's full of it. He's crazy. He's psychotic and then all of a sudden a year or so later, we keep finding out that those all of those were even the like even the microchip thing, like Pentagon had to come out and yeah, I see that 60 minutes deal that they did with it. Well, technically it's not a microchip. We injected under your skin and they can detect certain viruses like COVID-19. It was like, what's a certain? It's a microchip. It's what it's like. It's like, yeah, exactly what it sounds like. I don't know. Yeah. So, first of all, we want to thank our sponsor Omaha Steaks. So you got to get ready for summer.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio just announced that the city's public schools will fully reopen in September. This is, of course, after being closed the entire school year, last school year under extreme pressure from teachers unions. By the way, there's going to be no remote option available. Here's Bill de Blasio today. Mika, it's good news. New York City public schools, 1 million kids will be back in their classroom in September. All in person, no remote. Wow. That's the news. I think parents, kids, everyone's been waiting for to know. They're going to be back, strong, ready, safe. COVID is plummeting in this city. I'm happy to say we're almost to 8 million vaccination doses since day one. And it's just amazing to see the forward motion right now, the recovery that's happening in New York City. But you can't have a full recovery without full strength, schools, everyone back sitting in those classrooms, kids learning again. So that's what we're going to have in September. This is of course the same time that the president of the second largest teachers union in the country was slammed for a... I wish that I were making this up. Randy Weingarten, this is of course the American Federation of Teachers. She was slammed for... She's so tone deaf. I cannot believe she is the spokesperson for this teachers union. She said that number one, we want schools to reopen for a rapport and we don't want outbreaks. We want them to stay open. But teachers don't want to be the mask police. And by the way, teachers are tired. They are exhausted. We have to find a way to repair and nourish them as well as families in terms of attracting and retaining our teaching force. It's weird because I can't imagine how... Are they exhausted from going out and partying while they don't go to school and teach the kids? Is that like they're exhausted from spring breaking? I don't know what the teachers that she's referencing, what they could possibly be exhausted from, especially since this is the woman who basically co-opted the CDC guidance when it comes to whether or not schools should reopen. Eric. Look, I hope people are seeing that. The fundamental issue with public education and public school system in this country, I wish that there was more of a hardline approach, direct approach to, let's say, eliminating them as opposed to just trying to force people back in at ease, what I deem as indoctrination camps because that's exactly what they are. Now like you mentioned, we know that leak, I guess, came out where we saw the CDC. I was working with the teachers' unions and using the same rhetoric. So it's like basically their rules are updating their guidelines and came directly from them. Now why? People would want to still send these people to these institutions. It's certainly beyond me. But can you not- We have to be argument though that my taxpayer dollar is going to. Right. But that's the thing like that issue doesn't ever get addressed until we address the problem for what it is. And unfortunately that's all we ever do. And I think they bank on that. They bet like of course, because it's been around for as long as it's been, I say this all the time. If the state, let's say monopolized shoes, there's only plugs of public shoe system. So that's the public. But it was public shoe system. When you put a party's outrage everywhere. When you put a party's problem. But the thing is, all it would take is one generation and then people would be like, well that's the point. That's the way it is. It has to be in the minutes you talk about getting rid of it. Yes. Oh no, we can't people, you want the poor people to go without. Without the shoes, we have to address that issue. But that in itself, the politics that are being played, shows you the core problem with the public education system that doesn't go away with the kids going back in there. And unfortunately we had an opportunity, I think. This is why I'm not ever going to let them make it. But I think people, oh thankfully they're back in the school will act like nothing happened. But we had a golden opportunity to take probably the biggest acts that we're ever going to take at the public education system. And yes, Republicans included mainly held, botched it, completely botched it. It is interesting, Jill, because you know, Eric brings up a great point. I remember when Governor Abbott came through and said, oh by the way, the mask mandates are gone. Congratulations. And everyone clapped and cheered for him as if he wasn't the person who did it in the first place. You see Bill de Blasio over here saying, oh yeah, isn't that great? Great. Yeah, we've got schools back. Isn't that awesome? And it's like, hello, am I like living in a crazy town? You're the person who did this to begin with. You don't get to pat yourself on the back now for opening up a year later. If it's such great news, why hasn't it happened now? Why couldn't we have figured this out in January, in February, in March? I understand that in New York, it's a little different in the mindset they have all been programmed now to be fearful of this. So they needed something for everybody to come out of the brownstone. So they had the vaccine. Okay, it's fine. You can come out now. Your kids can go back to school. But I think it's interesting because I'm originally from Iowa. My niece and nephew, the governor in Iowa, Kim Reynolds, said that you cannot institute a mask mandate in schools ever again. And there are people in Iowa that are just freaking out. Like you're telling my kid that they can't do this anymore. We're like, no, it's the opposite. If you want your child to wear a mask, that's still completely fine. Send your kid to school with a mask. You or she may or may not wear it because they aren't that comfortable over kids. But you have that option. And every other family should have always had that option. The fact that we didn't, we look at it now a year later, we're like, gosh, what have we done to ourselves? It is interesting because especially when we're talking about the New York case, because New York shut down the schools, but they opened up day camp places, which were basically the schools where the kids should have been learning. But instead it was just a babysitter area for kids when their parents had to go to work. So this one is especially evil, I feel, for Bill de Blasio to come out there and say, oh my gosh, we just learned this new information. Now we can get kids to congregate again as if kids weren't already doing that just under a different name so that teachers didn't have to actually be held to actually like teaching that teacher. So a lot of us call up up at school, the system overpriced daycare, where fortunately they pump a bunch of propaganda in your kids' heads. But definitely now, I mean, oh my god, in the last year. But we had a chance, man. We had a chance that we blew it. The one good thing might have been that more families are looking at the school boards and actually going to meetings and speaking up now. Do you think that one might be? I don't know. I hope it does. Because I think it'll get lost in the next news cycle. I have to have hope though. Yeah, but that's always the fear though, right? Because like it once, and that's why they do it. It's like, hey, if we just say, all right, everything's back, we're good. They'll forget about it tomorrow. Which is why they did that because they've completely lost control of the narrative. All right, we've got more to come, but so we got to take a quick break. Optimistic. You got to stay optimistic. I love it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. Kinda bad. What'd you like to know? CBS News's 60 Minutes ran a segment yesterday that talked about transgender youth in America. And I think that they may be canceled soon by the left because they actually happened to include in part transgender individuals who decided to reverse course and detransition after taking hormones and even undergoing surgery. is a little bit of 60 minutes last night. They asked me, so why do you want to go on testosterone? And I said, well, being a woman just doesn't working for me anymore. And they said, OK. So that was that. You got your prescription for testosterone. Mm-hmm. Yep. Just four months after she started testosterone, she says she was approved for a mastectomy, what's called top surgery, that she told us was traumatic. It started to have a really disturbing sense that a part of my body was missing. Almost a ghost limb feeling about being like, there's something that should be there. And the feeling really surprised me, but it was really hard to deny. And so she detransitioned by going off testosterone and then went back to the clinic. And she says, complain to the doctor that the process didn't follow the W-Path guidelines. I can't believe that I transitioned and detransitioned, including hormones and surgery in the course of less than one year. It's completely crazy. It greatly concerns me where the field has been going. I feel like what is happening is unethical and irresponsible. In some places, everyone is very scared to speak up because we're afraid of not being seen as being affirming or being supportive of these young people or doing something to hurt the trans community. But even some of the providers are trans themselves and share these concerns. By the way, there was another individual that was interviewed later named Garrett. Garrett said, I went for two appointments. And after the second one, I had my letter to go get on cross-sex hormones. And then later got a breast augmentation and felt significantly worse, not better, which is what the LGBTQ community tells us. Well, these people need to be affirmed. They need to get the surgery so that they can feel better. Well, Garrett says, I had never really been suicidal before I had my breast augmentation about a week afterwards. I wanted to actually kill myself. I had a plan and I was going to do it. But I just kept thinking about my family to stop myself. How am I ever going to feel normal again, like other guys now? It's almost as if maybe we shouldn't be encouraging people to chop off their body parts. Because if they were to do that themselves, what they're asking a doctor to do, they would be taken to a mental institution, not have a bunch of people coddle them and tell them, yes, definitely, we will do exactly what you ask because you asked it so nicely. It's beyond me how that conversation, it became more of an uncomfortable one to have for so many people, even though a lot of folks feared that that was the direction that it was going to, specifically with young folk. And this idea that it's perfectly OK, they put you on the news, they'll put you even on the talk shows, like, hey, look at me, my young kid just decided that he was a boy, wanted to be a girl, so we make sure we did everything that we could to make sure that happened. This is damage that is irreversible. And this is serious stuff. And unfortunately, because, like what the young lady was saying, they talk about it on ethical and all this, because they are afraid of the conversation that has to happen if they take that position. And that defines the whole, or around like, definitely with the social justice bull crap, a bunch of people who know something smells bad. And we're like, OK, maybe that's a little too far. But I can't say it. So many folks that power, I know you probably get it. I know I get it all the time messaging me. I love what you say about it. Start definitely this issue. I can't say it. Why? The reason why this has gotten as crazy as it has is because y'all are not saying anything. At some point, we got to have this conversation. This is a messed up thing. And thankfully, people are starting to highlight, because let these people tell it, that definitely, with the mega entertainment sectors, those type of people don't even exist. The folks that have went through with some sort of transition and later regretted it. They like to think that that's not even a thing. But it is. It's a very real thing. And unfortunately, if we keep just putting it in like this, I don't know, just a bubble where it's only one size fits all. And that's like you have to confirm every single thing that every person's idea is if they have this sort of idea that they want to transition, I say why? For what? For what? Just because you said it? Maybe there's something else wrong here. And when that same subject matter, we apply that to anything else, it's like what you said. We consider that a mental freaking, like something mentally is going on with that person. But for whatever reason, when it came down to gender, we just threw that out the window. And here we are. Now people are too uncomfortable to have a conversation. Well, it used to be that gender dysphoria was considered a mental disorder until very recently. I believe it was 2015. They removed it from the DSM. So Joe, what are your thoughts? I think this is a random act of journalism by 60 minutes. And they should be applauded for this. I think this might be like making up for the DeSantis stuff of like, hey, we tried to spook all of you and get this by you. You didn't see it. So now we'll give you an actual piece of journalism to make up for it. But we're better off because we have it. We look at this story and it is the well-meaning liberal friends. You look at it and you say, we should allow this. This is the right thing to do by these kids. I'm using air quotes. It's not. And in doing it in this time frame is not helpful to any humans out there. The fact that this girl became a boy and then back to a girl all within one year, you're not helping anyone. You're not going through the psychological issues that they're dealing with, the mental problems. Why do you want to become this? Let's talk about this. Let's have a time frame where we're going to work through this. Serious decision. If this is what we ultimately even end up with, right? There's no counseling in there. You don't hear any of that. They, oh, you want this? OK, here. Here are your pills. After two appointments, that's not OK. You're not helping any of the youth. And like that boy said, after he got the breast augmentation, he felt suicidal for the first time. He wasn't suicidal before. He felt bad, and he didn't understand why. And they look out and they see on the internet, oh, I feel great when I do this. I feel great when I changed my name. I feel great when I got my body changed. And then it all falls off. Because there's nothing left. They're still empty inside. You have to address the emptiness before you just go chopping off body parts or taking testosterone or estrogen. That's not going to change how you feel. Yeah, that's not a coincidence that before transitioning, people who believe that they are a different gender also have. You see those same rates of depression, of suicide. And it doesn't change once they actually transition. There's a reason for that. The common denominator is that the root of the problem is not being addressed. Because we've got a bunch of quacks out there who are like, yes, I'll write you a prescription for whatever. You want sweetheart. So we better hope for all of our children's sake that the mental health community gets an awakening and quick. All right, we've got to take a break. We'll be back.
