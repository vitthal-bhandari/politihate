Two very influential members of Congress back to back. Juan A. Vetterin, you know him well. Congressman Jim Jordan. He is here to talk about so much of the developments of the Sussman trial, the Russia investigation and all the other things that are going on in the democratic world. Word yesterday that the USDA, the Agriculture Department, is going to tie future school money programs. These are the programs that give money so that poor and working poor children can get a lunch, can get a breakfast at school that they might not get at home. A healthy one. This is an important subsidy that millions of families rely on. You'll be cut off if your state does not agree to the transgender Title IX rules that the Biden administration is trying to impose. So they not only want to take away the trophy that your daughter might have won swimming. They might want to take away the food that your child gets at school if you're in the working poor or to have a participant in that very important program. Lots of things to react on. After Jim Jordan, we've got Congresswoman Kat Kamik. That's one of the youngest members, the youngest Republican female I've ever deserved in Congress. She's got lots of energy. She's working on the baby formula crisis. Day and night, she's got great insights on the food shortages, the food inflation factors and so much else that is hitting home, making it harder to get food on the dinner table, making it harder to put gas and certainly more expensive to put gas in your car. She's going to tell us all that she's working on in this extraordinary moment in American history where so many families are beginning to feel the pinch of binomics. Two great interviews back to back, Jim Jordan, Kat Kamik. Before we do that though, just real quickly, I promised you we would break that story on the Capitol Hill police investigation. We did in fact, the entire story is up on the site. In internal investigation by the Capitol police inspector general found that the Capitol police did in fact enter Troy Nell's office, did in fact photograph a whiteboard containing a sensitive legislation plans. Something it probably shouldn't have done. They said that the officer took the photo, exercise questionable judgment and that the department lacked both policies and training to protect the privacy and the constitutionally protected work of lawmakers from such intrusions as occurred last November in Congressman Troy Nell's district on this Sunday. We're going to have Troy Nell's on the Sunday podcast. We're going to hear his take on it. But I want to just point out a couple things at this report found because it found a culture of failure inside the Capitol police. They didn't have the right standards and procedures for patrol officers to take a situation like this. They had questions about the officer's account that he found the door wide open because when they tested the door time and time again, it closed on its own. It never stayed open without being propped and the officer claimed it was open without being propped. No one could explain that discrepancy. He filled out the wrong form. Supervisors tried to keep the entire episode out of the public record system for the Capitol police and none of the many supervisors that were alerted to what happened here took any corrective action. The IG said it was a very strong indictment. I'll just read you this quote because I think it sums up what the report found. First off, Congressman Nell's was repeatedly called a liar by the Democrats and the media. His concerns were validated in a big way and a line of failures. Not one or two, but a line of failures were identified by the department. We just read you this. The department did not have adequately detailed and updated standard operating procedures in place for patrol officers inside the Capitol building, which created ambiguity in the lack of accountability. The deficiencies included outdated and vague guidance of failure to establish procedures to complete the proper notification paper insufficient training on the procedures to follow on entering an unoccupied office. The end result is that the police department doesn't have the sort of protections to make sure that I guess this is even a better quote when you look at it as I'm going through the report here. Beyond not having those things, there wasn't a proper balance of understanding. I don't agree with this exact quote. They didn't have a proper balance of protecting congressional representatives and their staff from physical outside threats while simultaneously protecting their legislative proposals and work product from possibly inappropriate photography scrutiny and questioning. This is a police force that's been doing this for decades. How could they not have these procedures in place? This report actually raises a lot more questions than it resolves. We're going to talk about that with Congressman Nell's on a Sunday podcast, but deeply concerning strong condemnation of the behavior here of that police department. Questionable judgment is the term used insufficient training, insufficient policies. To do the right thing, when you find something as simple as a door, a jar and a member of Congress's office, remember they took a photo of this officer did of the secret private legislative plans this congressman had scary stuff. Well, speaking of Congress, we've got two members of Congress back to back here. Congressman Jim Jordan for the great state of Ohio followed by Congress woman Kat Kamik of Florida back to back. Great stories, great policy insights, big actions that they're taking right now. We'll be back after this commercial break. Folks, I don't know if you know this, but last month, the G20 announced the plan to impose digital currencies and digital IDs on their respective populations. Central Bank digital currencies essentially allow the government to track every one of your purchases that you're ever going to make. They could even allow officials to prohibit you from purchasing certain products or easily freeze or seize part or all of your money. In essence, they enable the government to take more control over your finances and your shopping purchases. Concerned Americans are diversifying their assets into physical gold with the help of my good friends at Birch Gold Group. If you want a physical asset held in a tax shelter retirement account, you should go to Birch Gold too. But learn for yourself. Text JustNews to 98.9898. That's JustNews to 98.9898.

Then call them because if digital currency becomes a reality, it'll be nice to have some gold to fall back on. All right, folks, welcome back from the commercial break. Really proud to have this next guest on every day he's in the trenches, getting the American people truth from a government that doesn't want it. Give it to us. Congressman Jim Jordan from the great state of Ohio. Congressman, great to have you back on. Always good to be with you, John. Thank you. You should have been a dentist because you have to extract a lot of information every day. I don't know how you do it, but you keep doing it. Huge revelation that you and Congressman Gates had earlier this week about the special equipment in room that the FBI seemed to install in Perkins Cooey suggesting there's a long-term relationship going on here. What's the latest on that? Well, yeah, it's in essence kind of like a skiff at the actual law firm itself where they can deal with classified information. Now, there may be valid reasons for that. Maybe there are some maybe there are other law firms that have a similar arrangement, but this was for an extended period of time. It was for the guy who had access to this and using this is Michael Zusman who happens to also be, of course, the Democrat party's lawyer, Clinton campaign's election lawyer. I find that part interesting. Of course, he was the same guy who was indicted, although the jury reached a decision that I thought was sort of strange, but they did. But yeah, all that together. We're just wondering like, why? What was the reason here? Why was Michael Zusman the key figure involved with this in essence, a skiff at the law firm? Yeah, it seems like there's a very cozy relationship that we didn't know existed between the law firm, and that's the sort of relationship that can get abused in a political dirty trick, like what assessment helped pull off. I know you're frustrated by the jury's verdict because the facts seem to be pretty clear in this case. One thing I've heard from some of the jurors and people around them is the fact that the FBI had to admit they were lying to themselves about the case kind of made the whole jury sour on the whole thing. The idea that the FBI keeps getting caught lying, it doesn't matter if it's the Michigan case with Dr. Nasser, all the lies in the Russia case. How do we fix this FBI? Well, I don't think it's the agents across the country. I think they're good. In fact, we've had a number of them come forward as whistleblowers talk to us about what's going on relative to January 6. Some of these guys, we put that letter out. So I think the agents are good. I think it's a leadership at the top. It's always been the problem. It's the folks in DC. We saw that with Comey, McKay, Baker, struck Page. That whole group there. You're right, the cozy relationship they seem to have. Remember what we learned in the Zussman trial. We learned that Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State, former First Lady, former United States Senator is telling Zussman to take false information to the press. That same false information winds up at the FBI. The FBI seemed all too eager to use it. That's kind of frightening stuff. Again, we learned that not because John Solomon or Jim Jordan are talking about it. We learned that because Hillary Clinton can't be made. He did. Robbie Mook. On the witness stand in a court of law testifying under oath said that. Then of course, that same individual, Michael Dustman, at Perkins Cooey Law firm, the Clinton Law Firm, they have this special skiff. We'd like to get some answers to that. The first answer that came for the law firm gave a general understanding of what it was, but not why they needed the skiff. What was the skiff being used for? That seems to be the mystery question right now. Do you think you'll get some more responses from the firm? Well, I hope so. I don't know if we'll get much more from the firm. I hope we get some answers from the FBI. But in the Biden administration, the number of letters we've sent to DHS, to the Department of Justice, to the FBI, it seems almost endless and it's only been a year and a half. And the kind of response we get back has always been pretty weak, as you know. I'm not holding my breath, but we'll wait and see. Yeah, it's such an important mystery to solve as we go on this. There's another trial ahead. So I think something that jumped out at me at the trial, I want to get your take on it. September 19th, 2016 is the day that the dirty trick came into the FBI from two different angles. Sussman comes in and gives Baker the Alpha Bank stuff. And on that same day, Christopher Steele delivers six of his memos from the dossier. By the way, the first six at headquarters had ever gotten at that same day. That can't be an accident. The two separate branches of the Clinton campaign hit the FBI on the same day. Yeah, it's a coincidence. And no, no planning there. And you know the game because you've written about it and covered this more than anyone. You know the game. It's to take information that they've created out of thin air, to take it to the press, try to get the press to bite the same time they're taking it to the press, or taking it to the FBI so they can tell the press the FBI's looking into this. And then if the FBI's looking into it, or they can tell the FBI, oh, the press is interested in this. They've been asking about it. And it's all it's all an circular type of thing. It's all created out of thin air by the Clinton campaign. And that's that's sort of what we all thought years ago. But now Durham is at least showing that for sure is exactly what took place. Yeah, those are some very important revelations. I want to pivot to some stuff outside of the Russia collusion case because you are one of the most articulate voices on the impact of the Biden agenda. We don't have baby formula, though, illegals do at the border, apparently quite well. We don't we have twice the price of gas we had a summer ago or two summers ago. We've got inflation on every aspect of our lives. And now, even after the message that Virginia voters sent about woke school agendas, the US Department of Agriculture tells us that schools going forward may not get that lunch money that helps millions of children get healthy lunches and poor families. If the schools don't adopt the transgender policies of the Biden administration, your thought of holding children's meals hostage. No, it's it's crazy. It's wrong. It's it's leftist. But this is how the you know, this is how the crazy left operates. You know, I thought also what was interesting this week, because you mentioned the inflation did 41 year high inflation rate we have. And the fact that gas is now already in eight different states over $5 a gallon. Janet Yellen said this week, she said, we were surprised that that we had this kind of inflation. We didn't really see it coming. I'm like, how could you not see it coming? You spent like crazy. You paid people not to work and you drove up the cost of energy. And and and somehow you're surprised that we now have a record inflation level that there's no way she's that stupid. So for her to say that, just sort of reinforces what what I've long now believed, which is it's sad to say, but this is intentional. What they've done to the border, we know is intentional. We no longer have a border. What they have done to the price of of of energy is intentional. We talked about Rokana in a hearing four months ago, where we had the energy and gas executive there. And he went down the line and said, why don't you promise to decrease production? Well, why won't you decrease production? What's your and it's like, dude, do you do you want $8 gas? And of course they do. And Biden as much as said that last week when it said we're in a transition period. So so this is what's frightening. And then you throw on top of that all the woke stupid things they do, like what this issue there with with schools and school lunches, it makes no sense. That tells you this is intentional. And why it's so important, we both these folks out of office in the midterm, a lot. Yeah, the midterms are going to be such a message from the American people. Another guy who seemed to be surprised was Joe Biden yesterday, who said, I had no idea that if we close down the largest baby formula, plant in America that we didn't have with a shortage. I didn't even know how to respond to that one. But this is a president that campaign that he was going to be more competent and less drama. We seem to have more drama and less confidence than ever before. Do you think this is the boomerang moment, this election? I do. I mean, you know, we never want to get overconfident, but we need to campaign hard. We need to take the message to the American people, point out all the crazy things that left up to and that if they put us in power, we can at least put that in check. It might be tough to reverse it all, but we can at least stop the the a lot of the terrible things that they're doing. I do get a sense that I travel around Ohio, travel around the country that people have had it. And I think they're going to show up in a big way. And as you said, we started to see that in Virginia. Last year, I think that's just only going to continue to build. Yeah, it feels like at the polling down there. Last question, because I know how busy you are. There is an open border that you see the terrorists coming over. You see the drugs in Fentanyl. There'll be this standoff with Republicans are in control, which is that they'll have the house the president will be able to veto things is the use of the appropriations right are going to be the one place where Republicans can force by and tighten up that by the border. It's the only it's the only avenue we have. And it's the avenue the founders of vision Congress using as the power of the purse. And so in we'll have to make the case all next year, let's say the American people put us in power will have to make the case throughout the year. But when we get to September of 2023, it's going to be important that we win something on some important policy in exchange for passing the level of spending that Joe Biden and Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer are going to want to have. So that I think is going to be the real test next year. And we need to start getting ready for it. And I talked to our conference about it that look, we need to be ready for what we're going to fight for. And I think it has to be something on the border and probably border security is where it needs to be. But it could be energy, it could be education can't be five things. It's got to be one or two key point that the American people expect us to get. Yeah, that's such an important strategy. And they're going to be looking forward to Sir, always an honor to have you on we always learn a lot. And even in a short period of time. Thanks so much for joining us today. You bet. You bet. John have a great week. You as well, sir. Thanks. All right, folks, we're going to take a quick commercial break. When we come back Congresswoman Kat Kannick will be here a lot to keep conversation going about that formula shortage and several other things that you may not be aware of with the USDA right after this. All right, folks, welcome back from the commercial break. One of my favorite guests every time she comes on this show. We have a really important conversation joining me now from the state of Texas. So she represents Florida Congresswoman Kat Kannick Congresswoman. Great to have you on the show today. Hey, it's so great to be back with you, John. You are doing an important thing today. You're speaking to young conservative women at the TPSA event in Dallas. Lots of energy there. Your takeaway on where young women in the conservative movement are going. Oh, I would say not where they're going. It's the fact that they're leading it. You know, I always love coming to this particular event because there are thousands of principled young conservatives. And they just happen to be women. And they come from every background you can imagine, you know, well to do and some not well to do, you know. Really, every economic class you can think of is represented here. Every color is represented here. And it's not about checking the box. The thing that is the driving factor that brings all of these incredible people together is a common cause. And it's that these are all young patriots. They love their country and they want to get involved. And so this is a wonderful experience for young women to come to and really see that there is a movement happening where they not only get to be witness to it, but they get to be a part of it and lead in this movement. So it's really exciting. And it is absolutely very, very bright future for so many of these young girls. Yeah. And listen, a lot of them are moving into ages where they're beginning to feel the impact of the Biden big government socialism thing, the baby formula shortage. There was a moment yesterday where the president I still can't believe he said it. I didn't realize closing down one of the largest baby form in factories will might cause a shortage. How does someone sitting in the real world say, well, how do you process that from a president? This is a guy that promised us competence. It's obvious if you take a lot of supply of the market, there's going to be a shortage. Isn't it? Well, that's what I mean, common sense tells us that. And that's the thing that has been the most frustrating, I think for me, as we've been really leading on the baby formula issue, exposing the hypocrisy of this administration, you know, it was a whistleblower last fall that started raising concerns. And so FDA and CDC, they had already begun the process last fall of looking into Abbott. And when they conducted their investigation in January and February, published their findings in March, you know, parents at the beginning of this year were already starting to say, you know, hey, things are getting a little tight, like it's not bad, but things are getting tight. That is something you would see or hear if you spent even an hour in normal everyday America, you know, if you went and got groceries just once you'd hear or see that. And so you fast forward to March, the CDC and the FDA come out with their findings very quietly, saying, oh, there's no scientific evidence linking what we found in Abbott to the tragic deaths of those two infants, which your heart just breaks for those families. And, you know, they obviously deserve and need answers. But at that point, you would think that the FDA would say, well, you know, we shut down the manufacturer who gives us 43% of the market share in baby formula for the country. Maybe we ought to get them back up and running. Instead, they kept them shut down for no good reason. And the thing that is most frustrating is that they kept it under wraps and they denied it. And then it took quite literally moms and dads screaming at the top of their lungs, calling their members of Congress to actually get some attention to it. And the thing really blew up when board of patrol agents started sending us photos and videos saying, I can't go down the road five miles to the target in in McAllen, Texas and get formula. But here I am on loading it out of the back of tractor trailers. Yeah, unbelievable. It was shocking. And for Biden to come out and say, I didn't know, well, first he said, if we had been better mind readers, talk about a flap in the face. And then today, I, you know, I didn't know until April, well, leadership starts at the top. And there has been no leadership. And you could probably tell like it really worked up and passionate about this because to me, this is just, it's simple stuff. And and they have failed on every front. It truly is an America last agenda, if there ever was. It is remarkable. One of your colleagues, Buddy Carter was at the border yesterday, Congressman from Georgia and said the stacks of formula for the illegals, it looks like a Costco warehouse. So there's plenty down for people legally enter the country, just not for the mom and dad who are lawful citizens of the United States. It's mind boggling. I want to take each other announcement that's in this food USDA category. And that is the announcement a couple of days ago that the agriculture department has its own title line prerogative that says, if you don't implement the transgender discrimination rules that we want implemented, you're going to lose access to the money that feeds a lot of poor and working poor children through the school lunch and school breakfast programs, your thoughts on tying those two things together. It's absolutely shameful. How dare this administration basically hold hostage a lunch program, food for children that come from underserved families. They have some economic struggles over an issue that quite frankly, it should never be an issue. I mean, I sit here struggling to find the words because I feel like we're in the clown country. Why are they trying to tie these two issues together? And instead of looking for a real solution, their answer is to punish. I mean, this is what happens when you have limousine liberals and elitists who have never had to live a day in normal working class America. And their answer, their solution, their method is you will bend the knee or we will break you. That is their answer to everything. And to me, it's just shameful. You know, I've been on the House Agriculture Committee and with jurisdiction over USDA, we are going to be tackling this issue amongst others. But just chalk it up to another failure of the Biden administration. It just breaks my heart that so many good people, working class people and their kids, we're just trying to just trying to make it through this administration. They again are constantly getting labeled and attacked. It's just it's so shameful. Yeah, it's absolutely remarkable. And you have been one you were the first person I talked to that said, hey, we have a food crisis of food inflation crisis on the horizon as many months ago. We just saw the latest statistics consumer food prices up 8.8% year over year, the largest 12 month advance since 1981. Not only do we have shortages, it is becoming incredibly more expensive to just put dinner on the table for everyday families. Is there a way for Republicans quickly to get a policy in place if they're in charge to bring this down? You know, I I'm going to say something that not many elected officials say and that's I don't know. I don't know because things are so fundamentally broken in Washington, DC and the method for Nancy Pelosi to operate. Her MO is just seam role. She doesn't want bipartisanship in our nation's capital, which is really a shame because we have some incredible solutions that would have an immediate impact, right, and would drive down the cost of fuel, which would in turn immediately drive down the cost of food. These two are are linked. And when I sit down, I talk with my farmers. I've show last night I was having a conversation in Florida with a lot of my ranchers and farmers. And they said, you know, one, you can't find anybody to help. Two, you can't afford the fertilizer. Getting into the hundreds of percent increase and three, the fuel prices are killing us. And so the cost of food and everything else by extension will continue to go up. But you see what the Democrats are focused on. They're focused on gun control. Never let a crisis go to waste, they say. And man, have they taken that to heart? That's what's so frustrating to me is that we have solutions and they're for the good of our country, not for one party versus another, but for the country and our people. And they refuse to act. And, you know, on the food issue, and this is going to be an increasingly hot button issue. I was reading an article in the Wall Street Journal this morning that was highlighting what was going on in Ukraine with the harvest, lack of harvesting and planting. They are right now having to try to recruit drivers from Poland to come in and help harvest what is left of the wheat crop. Their emergency meetings happening in Egypt, which is predominantly the receiver. They import all of, if not the lion's share, of Ukraine's wheat harvest. It's not just that we don't have the drivers and the harvesters and these crop lands are being destroyed from the war that's taking place. It's that they're not going to be able to replant. So when everything is said and done, you're going to see real famine. And it's going to hit some of the hardest and most dangerous nooks and crannies of the globe. I mean, you're already starting to see some real issues in Egypt, Yemen, Somalia, all these places that really rely on importing wheat, you're going to see them the hardest hit, which of course is going to turn into rebellion and revolutions, which shakes the global economy even more. It's really going to be a rough couple of months. But I think if we can look past the party politics and say, let's do what's right, we can bring that common sense and that stability to the table. Yeah, and destabilizing the globe is the last thing we need. I know there's enough instability in the globe without a food of famine to be the next pressure point on that. You have talked a lot about this. And I think it's important. One of the quick ways that Republicans have in their arsenal right now to get this is get energy prices down yesterday, the House caucus released a six point energy plan. It reduces carbon emissions. That's important, particularly young voters, creates jobs, eliminates dependence on foreign adversaries resource. That's a good idea. And it's getting a lot of good reception. A lot of people are getting excited about this. Is this the moment that Republicans could flip the climate change debate back on Democrats? Yeah, you know, I think that that's the thing that we always come back to is, I don't know if anybody who's not born in all of the above strategy, but in the case of the left, they constantly are looking for an either or. And it shouldn't be that. And when you look at the energy industry and keep in mind, we are an energy economy. Everything from start to finish, it's based on our ability to operate and produce energy. And so when you think about this from start to finish, what it really takes, it's certainty. And so I think we can actually come to the table. Every constituent and every congressional district is getting hit hard by gas prices, by diesel prices. And if we can actually kind of loosen the vice grip that Pelosi has on the Democratic caucus, I think we could actually get something done without fear of her colleagues losing their committee seats as they often say when they can't vote for something that they want to vote for. And she's taking the conscience out of voting, hasn't she? Man, when you go to Washington as a Democrat, you don't wear and take an oath to the United States Constitution, you take an oath to Nancy Pelosi. It is that bad. But I will say, I've talked to so many on the left privately and they have said, man, I would love to support that. I would love to do that. I can't do that though. And you look at what she has done, she being Nancy Pelosi, she has blocked six times our energy, domestic energy independence bill that would restart production here in America. Why? You have to ask yourself why. So one, we got to get back to some common sense, common ground. And two, we've got to provide that long-term certainty for the industry as a whole. It's not a light switch you can turn on and off. So while I'm encouraged by a six-point plan, it's not near enough. And when you've got seniors and working class families trying to make the decision between filling up their gas tank or getting groceries, that's a sad state of affairs. Yeah, it sure is. And it's getting worse by the day. I mean, that's the part that you can just see, this is going to spiral into the fall in more and more consequential ways. Last thought, I saw what a busy weekend you had over Memorial Day. You are such a great champion of not only the men and women in blue, which your husband serves as a law enforcement and first responders, but also all of the great armed service and veterans. The Veterans Administration is sliding backwards. We had a story over the weekend. Weight times are up to as many as 88 days in some facilities. Joe Biden, this is all in the last year that's happened. A lot of fraud cases where VA employees are being caught dipping stealing stuff from veterans. Is there a need to put a little more focus on the Biden agenda for veterans? Because it seems like it's putting the whole situation back in reverse after a lot of gains made under the Trump administration. Yeah, you know, that's the thing that is so frustrating for, I think, so many veterans and their families. The adage within the VA has always seemed to be you delay, deny, until they die. And that's one of the most heartbreaking things that I have heard from veterans when they talk about their experience in navigating the VA. There were tremendous gains made under the Trump administration cutting the red tape, streamlining the bureaucracy, really getting people to move and do their job. And what we have seen is one, the federal union that is within the VA. That is a real problem. And we also have a real problem with the national personnel record system, particularly the office out of St. Louis. I have seen firsthand the double speak, the refusal to provide records, which you can't get any appointments, comp and penny bells, working with appeals, survivors benefits. None of that can happen until you get the records. And it's one place that houses records they have been trying to digitize for years. But now they say because of COVID, they can't help anybody. Yet you can go online and pay $75 and magically your records show up 48 hours later. So tell me that there isn't something funny going on there. Where a member of Congress and anyone within the government can't get the records. But if you pay, you can get the records. I think that there is something very, very sinister there. And we are in the middle of investigating that and we will get to the bottom of it. So I hope that you'll follow up with us on that. Beyond that, I attended several Memorial Day events. And I can never really bring myself to say Happy Memorial Day because it is not a happy time when you think about what it really means. And in so many of the events I spoke at, I challenge my neighbors and friends. And I say, you know, they gave so much. We should at least strive to be worthy of the service that they gave our nation. And so my challenge for my community is let's be citizens worthy of the sacrifice that our men and women in uniform have given. And I think that we could all do a better job. No matter who we are or where we come from, we can always do a little bit more. So that's my challenge to anyone listening. Yeah, that is a great thing. I think there was an old Ronald Reagan saying, is that we're never going to be able to honor the sacrifices with words. So let's throw some action in there at least to let them know that we're going to carry on that incredible legacy that they gave us. And the photos you had posted were so beautiful. You can, you know, it's funny and you see a lot of smiles of people on a solemn day because they know they're a member of Congress is right there honoring alongside them the sacrifices made. It was fun to see all those photos you posted on social media. Really, really great moment for all of us, Congresswoman. Well, thank you. Now, see, you're going to have to come to Florida for your next trip. That's going to be an easy one for me. You can sell me on Florida any day. Well, Congresswoman, it's always a wonderful time to have you on. We learned a lot this USDA, food shortage, big, big crises, energy shortage. So glad to have your insights. And I know if you get in control next year, a lot of action is going to happen really quickly. Oh, man. Yes, it is. But thank you so much, John. Appreciate you. All right. Have a good one. You too.
