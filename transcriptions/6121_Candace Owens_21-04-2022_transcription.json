I cannot believe that the president of the Great United States of America is half dead and he don't know where he's at half the time. His wife is having a coach. He's not running our country. is impossible for him to be able to run our country in a set i mean it's about saudi arabia this is the reason why they are making fun of us in their version of saturday night live mimicking you know the leader of the free world you know i mean mocking the leader of the free world and mimicking him doing exactly what he says and does today we got to talk about the crisis pain yeah we got to talk about the crisis in africa yeah russia i want to talk about the president of russia uh... poochin uh poochin poochin mission to me i have very important message to you the messages i mean it's just it's it's pathetic on the world stage it's funny to watch but it's also pathetic that's where i get it's funny to watch but at what point does this become a national security issue it is the bunny directing him away what is that job description look like i'm actually curious hate don't let the president say anything at any time uh... i don't know when it when we when we step in some how we step in but does that happen and i can't find my words i just i i do feel like jill but jill byden was jill was underneath the bunny costume like you know it is just like oh my gosh left right you know and as a part of this that makes me really sad because it reminds me of like when my grandfather was deteriorating in the end once the duration starts it happens very quickly and they do things just like that little that little moment that he has when she starts reading he's like they're not gonna let me read like that reminds me of a person who's just he he he he he doesn't have a mental faculties about him and they just want to say things out loud they shouldn't be saying out loud so there's a part of this that really does feel like elder abuse to me and so i like that it's funny and then i realize actually despite the fact that you know i dislike him i think as administration is tyrannical that this is this is fundamentally an older man that is being abused by everyone around him least of all his wife like i can't imagine being married to someone and allowing them to suffer and be embarrassed on the world stage simply for power you know if i was a conspiracy theorist which let's be honest i've been called many times in the last two years i would argue that the person in the east or bunny costume is the mysterious day that byden is always referring to they told me i can't answer questions they told me i'm not allowed to read the book they told me i'm not allowed to be out here because what's really interesting is if you go back and watch that video where the bunny starts waving his hands and pulls him away and he looks all confused in that moment he was answering questions about what happened in afghanistan and the media isn't talking about that but he was starting to be very candid about all these things that were going wrong in his administration and immediately out of nowhere this is to bunny appears to whisk him away and make sure none of that can be revealed so it's not just abuse which it absolutely is but it's absolutely covering up not just for the failures of this administration but even the intentional actions of this administration that are putting american citizens at risk they're putting peace on the world stage at risk and they're ultimately going to lead to the collapse of the free world as we know it if it goes unchecked right and imagine not letting him read of children's book like they're thinking somebody in the background that they are assessing the risks here and going even him reading a children's book is going to go very wrong and we can't allow him to do that that's that's sad you know like it's just it's it's it's just gone incredibly too far we will get back to the show in just a moment but first we all know that inflation is out of control but the one place that we are seeing it most especially is in the grocery store the prices for me are absolutely insane unless you are a good ranchers customer because even though grocery prices look they doubled good ranchers prices have stayed low and affordable once you subscribe your price will never go up that means they lock you in for life at whatever price no matter what the markets or what the inflation is doing you're locked in how good ranchers for life at whatever price you sign up for and they only source and sell 100% American meat from local farms and ranches their beef is prime and upper choice the two highest grades possible they have signature steak burgers and wagyu burgers that are packed full of flavor and they're pre-trimmed and pre-merited chicken breasts are absolutely delicious take it from me and very very very easy to prepare they're better than organic meaning that they are completely antibiotic free prices for beef are only going to get higher as some more approaches and your favorite cuts will be harder to find lock in your price and supply with good ranchers right now but a good ranchers.com slash canis to save on the quality that you've been looking for don't forget to use my coat canis and enjoy your box of 100% American meat and your $30 savings you don't buy the meat in your house tell the person who does to check out good ranchers American meat delivered all right we obviously have to talk about the mask mandate that has been lifted i i can't celebrate it i just literally cannot celebrate it it's like i it's great for when you travel but i think we've become too comfortable celebrating our basic freedom and rights you know what i mean like we should be outraged it should should just lead to lawsuits against the cdc like this judge obviously came back and said you have no constitutional authority to do this and immediately by administration said we're not going to challenge it because it was a waste of time and money for them to challenge it challenge the ocean decision it's this is just you're doing things that are not legal and and they just keep pressing forward this infuriates me yeah it felt spooky yesterday when i was on a plane and and they finally let everybody get their freedoms back and there were some people who were excited you know i was everybody cheered i threw it away i asked them could i burn it they told me i can burn on the airplane but then there were the noxies there was a lady at the ticket counter you know she was getting ready to scan me into the plane and she literally screamed at me she could not believe that she had bought into the propaganda and i was now free it just screamed you got a wild mask and i wanted to say something crazy too but i'm a christian and so i just told her i just said ma'am okay i thought y'all were done with it i put the mask on i took it off instantaneously um but it was interesting to see how people were liberated almost and it it appears some people were almost tearing up because they were glad that they didn't have to wear there's videos of that there was one that went viral last night of a flight attendant crying because she was so overwhelmed that she didn't have to enforce this anymore the same thing happened to us with the mask nazis at the airport yesterday we went through tsa we knew that the president of the united states had said this mandate's no longer in fact no one said anything we get to the gate for our boarding area and a flight attendant for a different flight that we weren't even on comes running full speed towards joe bob and i wearing her mask and gets very close to our face and screams it's federally mandated for you to be wearing a mask in this airport and i calmly said well no ma'am it's actually not the president of the united states has expressly said this mandate is no longer in effect well if you're planning on getting on my plane you better have a mask on your face and this kept up throughout the first half an hour of our flight or so until american airlines eventually came forward and said we're no longer enforcing this when mid flight magically covid disappears i guess and half the airplane is allowed to take it off but what really boils my blood more than anything else is that all this took for more than two years was one judge one person being courageous enough to say this is completely unconstitutional and instantly tsa says we're no longer enforcing this the white house says we're no longer enforcing this every airline comes forward this morning uber comes forward and says sorry we know we've kicked a ton of you off of our service and you can't ride in our cars anymore over the last two years but no more masks now one person really that's all it took go ahead sorry i think the thing that irritated me the most we were on the same flight every single person i know up in the front they didn't have that same every person but a hundred percent of the people on the flight took off their masks or at least that i saw which tells me every single person knew that it was ridiculous and so if that's the case why then didn't we all just collectively over the last couple months go you know what we're done with this because they were threatening to arrest you right so that's the only reason i mean the only place that i ever wore a mask was on a plane and it was only because i was running the risk that you know and and running the benefits and going okay i'm going to an event to talk about you know the tyranny and society so i'm i'm willing to travel on a plane for an hour and a half masks i refuse i was never going to mask my child like that was like completely out of the question and i i can't believe that there are parents that actually did that but that's why they were they were literally told that they were going to get a federal charge if they did not comply even though we all knew it was stupid we all knew it was unscientific and worst of all we all knew it was unconstitutional but i took this long think about the fact that they were able to do this unconstitutionally for this long they put people on the no-fly list alongside terrorists over this it's insane it's absolutely insane and then you have this woman um who said okay this is done and what's happening of course they are essentially trying to set the ground for her uh to be harassed but this is kathryn kimbal mazelle i mean just putting her full name like that right she's a federalist society judge who worked for Clarence Thomas oh the horror oh my gosh the american bar association said she is unqualified to hold office but republicans confirmed her any way after trump lost she just ruled the cdc can't require masks on planes these are our typical brown shirts rushing to twitter um they got this trending to talk about her to put her face out there because you know what they're going to do these these are the people who are white color right they put the tweet out they put her information out now they're waiting for the antifa thugs and the dogsers to come in behind them and to find her into harass her she will be harassed there's no question about that there's no question that she's going to be receiving phone calls complaints uh that people are going to try to threaten her on the internet this is how the left plays the game and they go oh i did was list random facts about about kathryn kimbal mazelle i can't be held responsible for everybody else that's coming around um and harassing this woman this is the the pro woman women party right this is them this is what they do this is where we stand though this is where we take a stand we have to defend people like that we have to stop being cowards not us on the panel i'm talking about somebody else on another show we have to stand up for these people because they cannot bully us in the ways that they have been bullying us when somebody takes a stand like her we should get behind her we should support her we should put her all on the social media and then when the mob come out against them you know then we stand but we cannot acquiesce to their uh fake outrage and violence or we will never you know make a difference in the ways that we want they were talking about yeah so there is a lot of talk about her taking a stand the thing is i don't even see this as a conservative or liberal issue no this is a scientific issue everybody all of the scientists oh just normal everyday people all understood that these don't do anything on the plane so when people are calling her all right wing extremists doesn't want to do it masks on a plane anymore i don't even know if that makes sense because it's not a side issue it's simply a hey this doesn't make sense any so we should she didn't even she didn't make us argument on the basis of science you know the constitution said the cdc yeah are unelected bureaucrats they have no right to make laws that's just the truth right at any person doesn't matter if they're a left-leaning judge a right-leaning judge judges are supposed to not be left-leaning or right-leaning you're just supposed to interpret the law supposed to interpret the constitution and say this is not okay and that's exactly what she did here right and if they had any legal grounds if they could if they at all thought that what they're doing is constitutional you better believe the by administration would have challenged it further right they didn't you know they said actually uh no no we're talking about and which is a perfect time by the way to show the clip of peter deucey who i would like to have a coffee with questioning gen saki he said about this mass ruling out of a federal court in florida that it's a disappointing decision and you say you continue to recommend that people wear masks why is it that we can sit here in the white house briefing room with no masks but people can't sit in an airplane cabin with no masks well peter i'm not a doctor you're not a doctor that i'm aware of if you're a doctor i wasn't aware of that today until today okay not a doctor just making sure i don't know um and nor does he play on tv there you go most days um but these determinations remember the masking guidance is there are is green yellow and red we are currently in a green zone in washington dc so they're not recommending it there we go she coughs all over the white house but we're currently in the green zone what does that even mean do you guys understand what dc is it's a city of of transplants people are flying in and out of dc at all times well these are these are where your elected congressman go they're flying in and out so this whole idea that dc some protected city when they're the most exposed i mean when you have all of these these politicians coming in out of the city driving in and out of the city all these events all of these parades all these protests i hate trump i love trump i love biden it is completely ridiculous to believe at any point in time ever washington t's dc could be a green city it's made up it's pseudoscience and the american people have had enough and this should not stop this is not satisfactory whatsoever until people like dr willensky of the cdc are behind bars plain and simple we i hope that they get they're held accountable for this it's not enough for us to just say we got our freedoms back now they manipulated the system children have been affected there's lasting effects that's going to come from this that we don't see now but it's going to come out and they need to be held accountable they lie to us they betrayed us they're making up stuff to control us this is all about control everybody knows and i say this every time i speak if you can smell a fart through that mask you get in covet and so this is from personal experience yes somebody somebody was busting butt on the plane the other day and i could smell it and i said okay i'm dead already y'all hey this is yep stop lying in manipulating the system but here's the thing you're going to see people are going to still wear masks and you can wear masks you want you that's on you but they're going to be upset that we did not fall for the propaganda that we are now going to express our constitutional rights and be able to be free and they're going to be upset about that just like that lady she took it i almost want to yell it and say you're taking this personal you act like i'm attacking you yeah this has nothing to do with you so i'm i'm i'm interested it's going to be interesting to see how the fallout happens are people going to protest the planes we heard somebody on the view one of these uh brain dead people on the view say that they don't want to be on the plane then don't go on the plane but those the whole point you're allowed to stay locked down you're allowed to triple mask you're allowed to get 17 000 vaccinations a day just stop requiring the rest of us to have a mental disorder with you right you know i saw a viral tweet on this last night that someone who was on a delta flight when they made the announcement mid flight and encouraged everyone to take off their masks had an absolute meltdown because she was with her children who were too young they're not eligible to get vaccinated yet so they are immunocompromised and one of her children is so young that it's actually unsafe for her to mask her child so it's up to everybody else to keep their masks on and the way she worded it was fascinating she said i'm so disappointed in the delta flight crew for taking away our choice to be safe and I said to the contrary they're giving you a choice to be what you consider to be safe wrap yourself in seren wrap do whatever you need to do wear the hazmat suit i don't really care at the end of the day but people are completely melting down and i love brandon that you highlighted the effects that we haven't even seen yet but there are societal effects that we're seeing right now we're in the midst of the greatest mental health crisis for young adults that the world has ever seen we're talking about record levels of suicide anxiety depression substance abuse fentanyl overdoses are through the roof to a rate we have never seen before because we've messed with people's heads so substantially that they don't even recognize their own humanity anymore and i said beyond humanity it's like you are exactly right i say this all the time we are now seeing government sponsored mental disease you have a bunch of adults and if they see a child breathing will freak out right they see a person showing their face and they freak out right that anybody could look at that objectively i mean if you're like an alien species looking down the planet and you're watching that oh face you would go oh my gosh what has happened here like we should look at this and see what's happened this is a mass brainwashing and people now have real psychological disorders they're angry you know they're scared they think it's a form of violence to see a face think about scare but this never happened ever in the history of humanity all of a sudden you have people in america that are scared to see a human face they need and they need help they really do need help and we've seen people that are elected officials say the exact same thing member when aoc but no chores to come out and said it's going to take some time to get used to just you know not wearing a mask it's like girl you had 32 years without having to wear a mask now all of a sudden like after one year you just like don't know what it means to see your own face yeah you know and so it is sad but it is it is government sponsored insanity and it's because they want people insane because people that are not mentally stable always become government dependents whether that's believing you can pick your gender and you're a boy and you're a girl or it's believing that you must be masked forever to maintain protection you are going to be a person that turns to the god of government believing that god is that god is government for solutions we will get back to the show in just a moment but first as the dollar becomes worth less every day you must transition some of your savings to something of

okay okay so this week we have two inmates of a female prison that were impregnated by their transgender inmate i'm gonna guess it was a man i don't know and this is a new jersey so let's actually see a picture of the woman that impregnated wow it looks like a man how did i know that a man impregnated woman i don't know how i knew this it's i'm not a doctor but i think he got to be a man to impregnated woman i'm not a doctor i want to be clear before and after i don't even know this is like the before picture of him when he was a man and this is the after picture of him now that he's a uh transgendered woman taro just put on a little eyeliner i think he shaved his beard i think he just shaved his beard i think i was a little bit yeah that's my brow shaping but this is this is the strat i mean this is where what is what's going to happen in the future if you were a man and you could find an advantage of becoming or identifying as a woman then you win you want to beat people in sports and have records then you just identify as a woman if you want to go to if you got some doing some time in prison and you ain't gonna get no access to women are you do is become a woman and now you get impregnated women so i think this is you know where where are we where is our country going by doing things like this this is blatantly obvious that this should not happen clearly he's impregnated two women that you know he's probably had relations with more than two women and we're gonna see this happen more and more in the future if we don't you know stand up against it it's brilliant it's absolutely brilliant i mean if i'm a man i don't want to go to a prison with other men and risk getting beat up i know that i'm safer in a in a woman's prison i know that i have i have the option to have sex other woman i know that all i have to do is pretend that i'm a woman obviously i'm just a straight man a straight male criminal right um who doesn't want to suffer any real consequences so this is on behalf of criminals this is a brilliant strategy it's just about how long this brilliant criminal strategy is going to last before we as a society are allowed to formally acknowledge that men can never be women and women can never be men that's the question before us today yeah i have a bipartisan solution to this now you're not going to like the beginning part of this uh oh bear with me i think we should have taxpayer-funded trans surgery for transgender inmates now the left always likes that sort of stuff we already do have that well widespread i think so yeah really interesting i think well we should promote it more because the left loves giving uh taxpayer dollars to in disenfranchised communities meaning such as transgender's but now the problem solves itself because the next time an inmate says hey guard i think i'm a woman the prison guard gets to say okay let's schedule your surgery chop chop Robert time to meet Roberta and i guarantee you i guarantee you you have less transgender males in the in the female prison you're right making a requirement hey there you go hey trans alright yeah i mean i'll pay for that this is this is becoming a joke i mean we're going straight from the you know the you pen swimmer who is crushing records and now we're seeing this and yet they still won't formally not if you say on twitter as charlie kirk did or i stuck her carlson shared that men can't be women women can't be men if you put up these two pictures and you and you and you say obviously these are both pictures of a man before and after shave right before and after a jeremy's razor right official and they kick off your account and you're considered bullying and harassing i mean where where are we right now in society you know i'm not a biologist actually i quite literally am a biologist i think what my degree is and it blows my mind that we have arrived at a time in american history where a man can walk around with a penis in a woman's locker room in a woman's prison out in the middle of pride parades and it fully knewed and say i'm a woman today and society says yeah okay that's fine we're on board with that that's totally fine i really think this is the hill we have to die on especially if we're serious about equality really quality not equity that the left is trying to push but what you know feminism was actually supposed to be way back when when it truly was about equality under law not pushing for people with penises to rape women and somehow call it progress and i've i've spent so much time thinking about this lately why we're going after kids especially with this ideology and trying to push this so substantially and i really think the left is aware that if they can convince an entire generation of people that may be the most fundamental thing about their identity their biology their gender what formulates how they respond to stress who they're attracted to what they're passionate about what their passions in life will ultimately lead them to do they can convince them of anything if their gender somehow is not in the right and innate and they're realizing how successful this can be we're seeing the effects of that every single day if we're serious about indoctrination and overturning that and actually educating people it has to start here because this is the most fundamental way that they are convincing children of nonsense couldn't agree more and that and that is it in terms of the great human experiment understanding how malleable our minds are you can say that the left the left has won that space i mean you would have never dreamed up when i was a child that you could convince the girls they were boys and the boys that they were girls right or the men that they were women and the women that they were men and yet here we are in society where this is becoming policy it's not even just convincing it's becoming actual government policy to acknowledge that this is real and we wonder why china and russia and the whole entire eastern quarter sees it as opportune um you know to start invading on the west to start mocking i mean the middle east to be mocking us on the world station and they would have never done ten years ago we're not a serious country and an unserious country should not be taken seriously by anybody if i was leader of any one of these countries i'd be looking at i'd be mocking and laughing at america too and it saddens me to say that as an american citizen who loves this country and believes in the tenants of everything of his country was a built-on with the founding fathers dreamed we're no longer living the founding fathers dreams we're we don't even know what a founding father is anymore right we're just like a founding person yeah founding person we'll be there soon it's a joke today guys laugh it up today and suddenly it'll be a thing tomorrow the founding person so if it's a pregnant person it's definitely a founding person um it's it's sad but you know hopefully things are changing i don't want to end this uh panel on a bad note so this is the greatest story that's ever happened in the history of the world um well that's a lead up it is and i'm telling you i don't know if you guys saw the perspective juror for the parkland shooter uh shooter trial dismissed after discussing her sugar daddy with the judge um but if you haven't seen it you need to see it because i love this woman and i want to be friends with her and i just want to talk to her about things so here it is she can't be a juror because she got to take care of her sugar daddy here it is no one expected jury selection in the parkland shooter's penalty phase trial to go viral but this clip of a potential juror explaining why she can't serve on the panel made the rounds on social media i need to figure out something i have my sugar daddy that i see every day yes i'm sorry my sugar daddy okay i'm not exactly sure where you're talking about but i'm tired and i have my sugar daddy okay i see him every day that woman mrs. Bristol a native new yorker says she wasn't trying to weasel her way out of jury duty if i do this case for six months i have a hardship that mean my sugar daddy can't support me she told me that six months frame would put her in a financial bind how much exactly per month she claims she'll miss out on eight thousand dollars a month the penalty phase for the shoot of the last up to six months jurors would have to make a recommendation to the judge of a life or death sentence it's all day for six months and that was my hardship i didn't my sugar daddy money bristle says she was on it saying her hardship was financial so the judge excused her i said to the judge i have a sugar daddy and i'm married and i have a husband just like the judge heard other more common hardships like having two jobs or a long vacation but none as unique as this one wow mrs. Bristol what are you gonna do you know what i mean like and i needed this light-hearted ridiculous story like in the midst of everything that's crazy i'm just like what i need my sugar daddy eight thousand dollars my sugar daddy shit daddy paying will i know it's actually like a spot you know if you have a hardship obviously and you can't be a juror nobody's ever forcing that you could just be like i'm actually juggling two men right now and i'm like it's supposed to be two jobs a lot you know like juggling two men is a lot right now and i cannot lose this eight thousand dollar income like i don't know who mr. Bigg is behind the scenes but this is incredible and i have i got to get credit to find it funny that they see a hardship is what she said versus what she was doing and she seemed to be completely drunk yeah i offer a rocker so i don't know why they didn't think that was a problem it's a sugar day thing is more appealing i've heard a lot of excuses to get out of jury duty that would be a first i've heard you know i don't believe in whatever this is going to be about my religious view is going against this sugar daddy's maybe the new frontier first i i'm definitely using that just to see if i can get away with that and i was sugar daddy i was already eight thousand dollars and my husband and they're going to be like all right you're dismissed i love it thank you for your time thank you thanks for joining me on this segment of candace if you liked this podcast be sure to subscribe and leave us five stars on apple podcasts spotify or wherever you listen to watch listen to the full show become a member at dailywire.com subscribe"
