He got a pacemaker this past year and then they even like that was programmed wrong and he had to go to the emergency room and it was weird because they like fixed it on a computer. Anyway, science. The guy never complains, which is lovely, but also maddening because it's impossible to know how he's doing. So he and my stepmother Janice have one treat at the end of the night that they do every night. They eat a tootsie pop. It's like their thing. It's cute. And Janice licks it slowly until it has melted in her mouth. And she let be bites it like the owl in the old time, he commercial. And, you know, one chomp and it's done. So the other night they get into bed with their tootsie pops. Dad chomps his and four teeth came out. Four teeth. He didn't tell me this. Janice told me this two days later. So then, you know, it's late at night. So the next morning at eight AM Janice calls his dentist and they don't open until nine. But it says, you know, for an emergency press to or whatever. And my dad's like, don't you press the button for emergency. Emergency is only if you're in pain. I'm not in pain. You will not admit pain. He could be on his actual deathbed and you could go, Dad, how are you? And he'll go, you know what, Sarah? I'm fucking phenomenal. Fucking phenomenal. That's how above and beyond he lies. He does complain when he's alone with Janice and then completely gaslights her when she brings it up to the sisters, my sisters and me. You know, it's masculinity. It's who knows what it is, but it's little maddening. And so anyway, so she doesn't press. He won't let her press the emergency thing. So they call back at nine when the dentist is open and they have them come right in and they just glued him in and then they would need to with surgery put them in proper. But he's like, the glue is fine. The glue works. I can do anything. I can eat ice cream. I could blah, blah, blah, you know, whatever. But no, he did get them. They got his teeth put in properly and pretty such a character. You know, and they I'm guest hosting Jimmy Kim alive next week, the 11th and the 12th. And of course they want to come and, you know, at Jimmy Kim alive, they're they want, you know, they're like, we want to do something with your dad and I always want to do stuff with my dad because he's so funny. And but I'm, you know, worried. I'm worried about his energy. I'm worried about his health. I'm worried about the I'm worried about the the fucking Delta variant. And you know, we put together like a just a weird sketch that should be easy for him. But I don't know, we'll see. I just he does not speak up for himself at all. He's he's oddly shy. You know, remember on the Hulu show Raj, we shot like two or three hours straight with him in a pool just answering questions about life because he's he's not good if he's given lines. But if you just ask him questions for to answer like, X, temporary, he's incredible. But you know, they kept going like Mr. Silverwood, you like some water and he's like, no, I'm okay. Take the water the next day. He was in the hospital for dehydration because he's too shy to say, sure, I'll have some water. Dad's, I don't know, you can't kill him. You can't, uh, you probably could kill him. I mean, he's 84. I don't think anyone's gonna suspect foul play. Here's some ads. This is an ad for Lord Jones.

So Rory and I we didn't get into a fight. We got into like not our biggest argument, but for some reason it was hard to like we always talk everything through until we're laughing. And for some reason, this was so dumb. And for some reason, it was like hard to get past. It was so dumb. Okay, I in the in my living room, we leave like the sliding glass door open to the backyard. Just leave it open when we're in there, you know, and and a B came in and it was like on its last legs, it was just kind of sitting on the couch. And I go, Oh, B. And I was doing something at the sink or whatever. So Rory just grabbed like the first glut he opened the cabin and grabbed just like a small clear glass and put the B in it and to put it outside. And you know, I've explained this. I've told this story to like two different friends. And by the time I told it last night, I was like, I'm I'm majorly wrong here. But the glass he grabbed is my favorite glass. I I covet them. I bought a few of them. They're they're small juice glasses. And I don't know why they make me so happy. I have like juice in it. I have coffee in it. I just they make me happy. I'm not really into stuff and things, but certain things for some reason I get attachments to and he used one of those and I go, gross, gross. Here he is. He's immense doing a menshee thing. But you know, if it was me, I would it was very weak. This B, it wasn't like yet to catch it. It was just kind of like sitting on the back of the couch, like the kind of with its hands on its knees. If you can imagine that. You could have picked it up just with like a napkin, you know. But he grabbed a, you know, and then I go, well, why'd you have to get my favorite glass? Like, why didn't you use your coffee mug sitting right there? You didn't use your favorite coffee mug. He was like, I just wanted to use something clear so I could make sure that the B was in there. Oh, yeah. Well, how you didn't use your John and Nora's wedding tumbler that you love to. What's a tumbler? What's the big one, the big glass that's like this, that you put like draft beer in? I think it's a growler or a beer. A stein, a beer, a glass. A what glass? A pint. Yeah, it's a pint glass. That's what it is. Yeah. From my friend's wedding. Why didn't you use that one that you use every day? But you know, he wasn't out to get me. I even kind of go, you know, you know, that's my favorite glass. Like, I wonder what in you, like I use like, Therapeon, I mean, it's so shitty because it's like, I'm saying, I did, I implied that he did it maliciously, that there was, it was some kind of passive aggressiveness. And that's what really bugged him. He put up with all my shit, but that really just made him kind of shut down. And of course he did. What a fucking asshole. I am. I don't know. I was just, I got worked up. I could sometimes I can't get my head around something and it's like a, like a pit bull. Like my jaw locks on it and I, there's no reasoning. So then I double down like a fucking asshole and I grab his coffee mug that had long been empty to put it in the dishwasher. And it drives me crazy. And I, I've heard Adam Corolla used to say this all the time too. And we're afraid, I mean, I just remember him saying this, but it's, you know, just put a little water in it when you're done drinking the coffee, just a little bit of water so that it doesn't harden on the bottom of the mug. It's so easy. And he and I said it. I mentioned that and he goes, Jesus, I, I, it's not like I put it in the sink and didn't put water in it. I forgot to put it in the sink. I finished it and it, I left it there. All of this is irrelevant. It's just for some reason, we were not connecting, not vibing. And it stemmed from me. I'm realizing, you know, like it's, I, there was absolutely nothing to fight about, you know, and to insinuate that he did it in a passive aggressive way is just so unfair because this man, not a single part of him, doesn't just fucking love me. So what is this self fulfilled self fulfilling, is I say self fulfilling prophecy that maybe I'm a, what am I pushing away? What is this? What's going on? Crazy bottom. No part of me believes that, you know, that he took my favorite glass so that he could contaminate it with a deathbed B. He was just small and clear. So he grabbed it. I don't know why I was so worked, but because I was, I just kept going, you know, so, you know, then he's like, I mean, he's just like, do you want me to go home? And I didn't. I sure was acting like I did, but I didn't. I don't know. And then a couple hours went by where we were just really disconnected, just kind of like doing her own thing on. I was, I was, it had not become clear to me yet how wrong I was. I just was purely working off of feelings and I was hurt. And I, you know, I know these are the things that I want to work on as we have this ongoing conversation about, you know, eventually living together. But you know, now that I think about it, I wonder if my knee jerk reaction. It was like a real toddler reaction was from that being, you know, in the back of my head. Turning into a three year old who has now learned the word mine mine mine. Is that what that came from? Like I just suddenly got the idea of living together made me possessive or, I mean, I want to live with them. I totally do. I, I was, I was not my best self. And, you know, that always comes from fear, I guess, I think for people, right? And I do want to live with them. And I would do in a share my life with them. I just want to figure out how we can, how to do it. So we both get what we need, you know, like my first thought about living together besides that makes all the sense in the world. And I would love that. And I should be so lucky is I like to be alone, you know, a lot. So can we achieve that? So Saturday we had this, uh, we had like a trial of let's pretend we live together and we're doing our own thing in the house. Let's see what that looks like. Because you, because now it's like when we're together, it's like a little bit more of like dedicated time to be together. So Saturday we did our own thing in under the same roof. And it was great. I took a fucking bath. I watched some law and order. I, I trimmed my cuticles, which I never do, but I got this nail kit from a company that's going to advertise on here. And I, I can't believe what a difference it makes. I never care about my hands, but you put this, it doesn't matter. Anyway, I cleaned up my cuticles and it was really satisfying. And then I put a shiny coat on. Um, I, uh, then I got out of the tub and I, I just spayed out on my bed, which is my favorite thing to do. Like a, like a beach dwell, but, uh, you know, in a good way, I guess. I, the beach dwell, it's definitely not a good, I mean, those whales are not happy. I don't know why that would be the analogy. But, um, and then I, uh, grabbed my guitar and I, I completely learned Taylor Swift song Betty on guitar. And then he was downstairs and he like hooked up the, uh, place date, you know, he hooked up the, whatever the console, Xbox, PlayStation, whatever. And, uh, he did some work and then he watched a bunch of mythic quest, which then I came downstairs and I started watching. He, he started turning me on to mythic, mythic quest. Yeah. It's really good. It's really, really good. And it was a really good night. Anyway, you know, if we're going to live together, like I want to be in cohabitation training first before the real thing. Could I be more anal? I don't know. And he of course indulges it because he's the shit and I'm knee deep in it. And there you go. Let's take a call. Hey, Sarah. It's Lola from San Diego. Just wondering if you feel that the term vulva for female genitalia is a gross word that you don't like using because it's actually accurate, more accurate to save all the, in my opinion, or if you don't mind using the term vagina, which is only one part of the whole thing, the sex canal and the baby canal. So I tend to not correct people, but just drop the term in conversation with them. And so my question to you is, do you feel that that's like a douchey thing to do? Or do you feel like it's a worthy movement to start using the term vulva, which is movement. It's more scientific and anatomically correct, or to keep using the term vagina, which is one part of the miraculous whole that was a double on tondra that I didn't mean to. And yeah, I love you for years and years and forever and ever. Thank you for this wonderful podcast. Take care. Bye. I didn't know that. I didn't know vulva is the whole kaboodle. And then vaginas. Do you ever just say kaboodle or does it only come with a kit? A movement, you know, I don't think we need a movement when as we change language necessarily, I just let people know like you just let me know. And then I'll know, but you can't like go like, see this no. I think that's a fatal flaw on the left a little bit. Yeah, I didn't know that. Okay, so the vagina is the the baby hole and the sex hole. And they are the same hole. I feel positive. I've only used it for one of those things. And then there's the p-hole that's separate. And that's, I mean, I know it's, this is very embarrassing. I do not know where my p-hole is. I have looked at a map of a vulva, but it seems so small. Is it like, on the clitoris or is it like another thing or I don't know where my p comes out of. I just know it's at least three places. Okay, then vulva it is. I like it. If I'm talking about the whole nine yards, I'm saying vulva. But China, if I'm just talking about my sex hole slash baby canal. vulva is like a badass sounds like a heavy metal band. It sounds like a nine inch nails side project. vulva very few words with two V's in it vulva. Vivacious vivis section, vivica a fox. Four, four words. All right, what else? Hello Sarah Silverman. It branches here and I have a question for you. Well, it was a statement about leaders of the so-called tree world. Our Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been called out for not being able to operate an umbrella. I don't know if you saw that online. That was so funny. Just have difficulties opening an umbrella. I know that your former president had trouble with speaking in general. So what would you say, what would you suggest as a new sort of firm criteria for selecting leaders of powerful countries? Do you think there should be additional psychosymmetric testing? What do you think? What do you think the criteria should look like? Thank you. Great question. I think anyone who vies for office should be able to work a washer dryer. Really any basic household appliance they should know how to use. I think they should have held at least one working class job. They should have at some point known how to ring up a cash register. They should know the cost of living at all times for the average family or the average person and how that coincides with a full work week on minimum wage and make sure that they always work together fruitfully. They should probably be able to fill out a map which disqualifies me. I just cannot contain. I don't know where any one of us are. I really don't. In eighth grade, I lived in New Hampshire my first 18 years of life and in eighth grade I got New Hampshire wrong on a map. New Hampshire. I mean, plus many other states probably most. I think I got Texas and California and Florida. New Hampshire, I labeled, I know what you're thinking right now. You're thinking, oh, she thought New Hampshire was Vermont. Shockingly, no. Even though they're sister states, I labeled Delaware as New Hampshire. And that is why I should not be a politician or representing Americans here.

Hey, Sarah, I got a lot to cover. One, there's a chrome plug in called a jailbreak the patriarchy, which will swap mail, gendered words or masculine words for feminine words. Pretty amazing to see because when you swap he for she actually start to see the way that the whole phrase or a whole sentence is masculine, not just the the the word itself, like the phrase the adjectives we use to describe men versus women become more apparent. A lot of people already noticed this, but it becomes more apparent when you just try and read a news article and hear a description of, you know, a he and that you swap that pronoun to she and you're like, this feels really over the top. Anyway, the real reason I called in was to ask about how you feel or just to talk about as a as a dude. I feel not attacked, but I feel guilty or in association with the patriarchy. Like, like I'm part of it just by being a man, I am now part of the patriarchy and I benefit from it. And those things are true. I'm not refuting it or saying it should exist. But I was raised by women. You know, I all my teachers were women. Women played a big part in my life. And I feel like whatever I am now, whatever habits I have now, were shaped by them. And I don't want to give them any more responsibility. They taught me and raised me. I'm not blaming them. I'm just wondering how that plays into this whole thing. That was really interesting. You know, it's great or it's lovely or it's interesting that you were raised by women. But it you weren't raised by women from this moment in time. None of us were. Those people are babies right now. So those women were raised in the patriarchy and they raised you from how they know life to be. And it doesn't mean that you are you are. I don't know who how you were raised. So irrelevant. But yeah, the women that raised you were raised in a world dominated by men and masculine language. It's all they knew. It's all I knew. It's rad that you were not raised with toxic masculinity, which is, you know, Rory has talked about and is to be aware of is is amazing. It's in it's so run so deep. And that's a giant leg up. I would think you sound absolutely lovely. I understand that feeling of frustration. You know, it's like Catholicism. You were born a sin born in sin. I don't know. Just for being a white male, I understand what that must feel. And you don't I know you're not being defensive about it. And and what can you do about it? Yeah, listen, I understand that feeling of frustration and guilt because I to benefit from from white privilege. Needless to say, but being aware of it, doing everything that you can to correct it, that's what you can do. Even if you're only doing it, so you don't feel so helpless, you know, nothing helps the feeling of helplessness more than helping is something I just made up and seems like it could be true. But I know it's it's tricky, you know, sometimes your ego wants a prize of some kind for being an ally, I guess. But doing the right thing is supposed to be the prize. Or there's not supposed to be your prize. It's kind of like finding a wallet, you know, if you find a wallet and you return it, it feels so good and you should feel good. But also it's like what you're supposed to do. You know, I know you feel like a hero, but like you returned a wallet. The alternative is you find a wallet and you don't return it, which is that would make you a piece of shit. Unless you really need the money. That's different, I guess. But you know, return the like, license and credit cards. If you really need the money, you know, then you can just go, oh, it I found it, but it didn't have money in it. I mean, that's a lie, but I don't know, I just I was remembering when my dad's tricycle, he rides like an adult tricycle. His tricycle was stolen couple of years ago. And all he said was, you know, they must have really needed it. They did, they needed it more than me. That's what he said. So yeah, if you need it, but still return the, how did we get on this? This is when we talked about the patriarchy. All right, what else? Hi, Sarah. Hi, I'm Elizabeth. I'm 20 years old and I got a breast reduction when I was 18. I went from a 32 H to a 32 double D cup. And I'm so happy with my results. This is it's truly been life changing. And something that I've been doing since getting a breast reduction is I've been going braless because I don't like wearing bras, they're uncomfortable and they're expensive. And I just have sort of a personal disbelief in them and their purpose other than sports bras. And the other day, my mom told me that I look trashy and that I look bad because I don't wear bras and that I need to start wearing bras. I sort of just left the conversation where I had where it was. But I'm just wondering how you would go about responding to this because I don't want to wear a bra just to appease her if it because I find them so uncomfortable. But I don't want there to be more problems. I don't think she should be talking to me like that. Anyway, I love you and your podcast. I wish you were my mom. Bye bye. You know, I think that what you just said at the end of that was is a perfect thing to say to her. You know, I love you, but I don't want to wear a bra, something that's uncomfortable for me just to appease you. And I wish you didn't maybe talk to me like that because it hurts my feelings. I mean, listen, we all have our Michigan's with our mothers and she'll probably roll her eyes and look, you know, I don't know what to say. Your mom wants your tits to be higher than they normally hang. This is something that's for some reason important to her. It seems to be important to many moms. Really, it seems it sounds weird saying it out loud. I'm going to say but your yeah, your mom is not a bad person. This is what moms do. I can promise you that it has more to do with how she feels about herself than you. They project on to us all of their fears and insecurities. This is the cycle of life. Your physical comfort is more important, of course, than even your own mom's emotional comfort. I really think this is true. You know, you can get really upset or you can just laugh and kiss her forehead and say, I love you, mom, and I'm sorry my boobs are not high enough for your comfort, but you're going to have to find a way to love me anyway. Something like that? All right, what else? Hey, Sarah, how are you doing? Oh my God, this is my dad. I just want to talk to you a bit about how much better I like your set. Now that you changed it from a blank wall, from a blank wall to all those lovely pictures. And everybody loved the pictures. Oh, you're except for one person. You left out not the first time you left her out. And she took it really badly, actually. What do you not like about Janice? She wasn't a good stepmother. She wasn't a good provider for you girls. She was nasty to you. Must be something that you leave her picture off the wall. And because she doesn't know what it is she did to you, she's very, very sad about it. But the hope is that maybe you can get past your hostility towards Janice and just be a little kind of, maybe put up a little school picture of Janice. You're nothing big, but just something that you'll know that she's somewhat in your thoughts. Anyway, I love you. Okay. You know, Dad, I don't know if you've really looked at the pictures behind me. I mean, they're just kind of random. I, there's most of the people I love the most are not on here. There's a picture of you. There's a picture of my dad, Mom. And some pictures of me. And then it's like Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner. And Raj, our producer, there's like eight pictures of Raj. I don't know what to tell you. There's, you see this baby behind my head? This adorable baby behind my head right above and to the side of Jesus. That's Hitler. That's baby Hitler. I find it fascinating and I put it up there. Listen, good grief. It's just a collage of randomness, Dad. Everybody in our family knows that Janice is beloved and in fact, loved far more than you. And you know that. I really wouldn't worry about it. I can't imagine this is truly Janice's feelings. I hope that you and Janice feel how much I love you from when we're together in life and existing in our great family, in our personal life. There's a picture of Janice, right? Oh, that's white Jesus. Mm. Jesus, H, I love my family so much, but I just need to scream this for a second. It's never enough. All right. And we're back. What else? Okay. So all these women that are calling in here saying, you know, I'm just really sad because I don't really feel like it's right to be called the name Karen because it just silences woman. Shut the fuck up. Shut up. I'm tired of hearing women. I'm sorry. White woman. White calling in and pitching about being called a Karen calling into the podcast about this issue is the most Karen thing you could possibly do. It's actually hysterically funny when I hear these people complain about it. What is going on? Could you imagine every time you're upset and you speak out about it, you're labeled an angry black woman or a feisty Latina? Good point. I can because I'm freaking Mexican. And I know I can't smell myself. Oh my god. But good God. Good God. I love this person. That was hilarious. Not a lot to say other than some some spicy commentary from a very hot headed Latinx woman. Cisse Puede. Hey, Dolores. That was a great call. Thank you. I wish I knew your name. Did she say her name? I don't think she did. Hi Sarah. My name is Jenna and I'm calling because I was sitting here and I thought of you because you are in my head like Dr. Fraser came for me now. I listened to your podcast while I'm at work and it makes me really happy and I like all the good things that you have to say to people are just about things in general. I like the way your your head works. It's it's very similar to the way my head works, I think. So I'm going to ask you. I'm going to I'm going to ask you what you think about my dilemma. So I was listening recently to a woman who called into your show and said that she is tired of people asking her when she's going to get married, when she's going to have children. She was a bit older and she was just happy being single and she said she's a strong independent single woman and I think that is great for her. My issue is I'm weak. I'm weak Sarah. I am super single. I am 39 years old and I'm weak. I want to be with someone and I just keeps not happening. Every relationship that I'm in just crumbles and falls apart and I think I'm a decent person and I think I'm decently attractive and I just can't figure out what the hell and I'm looking around and I see it happen for everyone else and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. Sarah, tell me what am I doing wrong? Fix me Sarah. There's nothing wrong with you. I don't think maybe there is. I mean just superficially I'd say you sound super thirsty and you should just try to be a little more cool. I can only say my opinion. Let's get deep a little bit. First of all, you think it's working out for everyone else? Is that what you see around you? I don't know. All right kid, here's my opinion. I've said this before. I just really believe that you have to be your own best friend and enjoy your own company before you can really be appealing to other people romantically or otherwise really. This sounds maybe cunty but my favorite person to hang out with is 100% me and I mean that's something I learned so I know it's something you can learn. I do think that it is not only attractive but it is to get to that place is wildly beneficial to your life and to your joy and I think after working on that you're going to find someone or they're going to find you. You don't want to be in a situation where you're so afraid of being alone that you won't leave a bad relationship. So you got to work on the relationship with yourself. I know it sounds corny but it's true. You know, you know how we pretend to be the person we want people to see us as be that person. Be that person with your family. Be that person when you're alone. We decide who we are. Accept yourself. That's a big one. These aren't easy things. There's stuff you practice. You know, be as kind and forgiving to yourself as you are to any bozo on the street. Once you accept your whole self, you know, you will find that you have a lot more space for others. And before you know it, someone else is loving you just as much as you are. You showed them how by doing it yourself. You want a person who loves you warts and all. Someone who's warts and all. Someone who's warts you love too. I don't know. I remember seeing an episode of Roseanne when I was like first on where Jackie dates this guy and she's just acting like this person she thinks is is lovable and he falls in love with her. And she's so afraid that he fell in love with that person she was pretending to be that she finally opens up with to him and is like, I, I, you know, she's telling him all her bad habits. She's like, I bite my nails. He's like, I don't care. She's like, and then I spit them across the room. He's like, okay. And then she goes, they're my toenails. I remember thinking that was very funny and beautiful and you fucked up. But if you want to be with someone just because you don't want to be alone, that's probably not going to work out so well. It's achievable. I mean, but is that that the life you want to live? Really? I don't know. I would start by not putting yourself down. That's a really good practice. That self-deprecation is to me a form of self obsession. You're so concerned with how people perceive you instead of just being. And it gets in the way. So I'd work on that more than your outer shit. It doesn't matter like, you know, what your pedicure looks like in an open-toed sandal. Do you really want to spend your life with someone who gives a fuck about shit like that? I don't know. I always tell my friends before you call your ex, masturbate, and then see how bad you want to call your ex. It's kind of analogous, I guess. Like work on being yourself and work on enjoying your own company and the level of your desperation to be with someone is going to wane. Somewhat. I don't know. My analogies are not hot shit today. I always think about this thing, a guy, a guy I knew once told me about how his father described Instagram, which was, watch me watch the sunset. I love that. Wow. So yeah, practice just watching the sunset. Just you. It has to still matter. You know, if you fall in the woods and no one else is there to hear it, it should still make a noise to you. Fuck, I'm going to work on my analogies. And that's it, dad, you motherfucker. I love you. You're not always easy. But I'm here to say that we are winding down. This is the end. I'm wrapping it up. This is when I say, subscribe, rate and review wherever you listen to podcasts and check us out on YouTube if you like watching with your eyeball holes. That's hard to say. Eyeball holes, ball holes, ball holes. All right. Bye."
