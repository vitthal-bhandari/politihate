    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Today, Hunter Biden pleads guilty to tax crimes and ends up with a slap on the wrist. Who would have thought YouTube continues their censorship of questioning the science and a female student allegedly raped by a biological male in her school bathroom, but they told us that couldn't happen. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez and today the first son Hunter Biden has reached a plea deal with federal prosecutors that will likely allow him to avoid jail time by pleading guilty to two tax crimes involving failure to pay over $1.2 million to the IRS and admit the facts on a felony gun charge which stemmed from his illegal purchase of a firearm while on drugs, which he admitted to in his autobiography because he's an idiot. By taking the deal to plead guilty to the tax misdemeanors, he will receive a two-year probation agreement and only if he violates that probation agreement, will he be prosecuted on the felony gun charge. Hunter will also reportedly agree to enter a diversion program upon admitting the 2018 illegal purchase of a firearm and once completing the program will have the ability to get the charge revoked from his record completely. Hunter's lawyer released a statement saying, Hunter will take responsibility for two instances of misdemeanor failure to file tax payments when due pursuant to a plea agreement a firearm charge which will be subject to a pretrial diversion agreement and will not be the subject of the plea agreement will also be filed by the government. I know Hunter believes it is important to take responsibility for these mistakes he made during a period of turmoil and addiction in his life. He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward. So I guess Hunter believes in taking responsibility for his mistakes except when those mistakes involve having unprotected sex with a stripper that results in the birth of his daughter in which case he doesn't acknowledge the mistake and actually engages in legal action not to pay for that mistake which again of course happens to be his own child. The deal is awaiting approval by a federal judge which experts say will likely happen without a hitch. Boy, it pays to be the president's son doesn't it? A president who by the way places significant importance on gun control. A president who wants to disarm you, the law abiding citizen who wants to make it more difficult for you to own weapons who wants to prevent you from obtaining more firearms, empowers his own DOJ to go easy on a felony gun charge because it's his son. It's almost like he has no standards at all but don't worry I'm sure you or I would get the very same treatment. You know just like this 69 year old grandmother with cancer who was charged with the heinous crime of parading in the capital and forced to serve two months in jail or rapper Lil Wayne who pled guilty to the same illegal gun charge Hunter did but was sentenced to a year in prison. But then again that one shouldn't come as a shock considering Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have never had problem putting black men in prison. Remember this investigation began because of Hunter's laptop leak. A laptop bat according to the 630 page Marco Polo report right here this report right here which I can't sift through because I would be censored heavily. This clearly documents 459 crimes committed by the Biden crime family and their associates that includes 140 business crimes, 191 sex crimes and 128 drug crimes. But don't worry I'm sure this was a completely impartial unbiased decision by the DOJ. Oh by the way just as a reminder Donald Trump faces up to like 75 years in prison for having pieces of paper. Our justice system is just an illusion at this point here to discuss this and more we have Yaku booyans Blaise DB contributor and host of the bottom line and also Chad Jackson returning to the program co-producer of Uncle Tom and researcher extraordinaire thank you guys both for being here. You know I'm a little I'm just a little I'm a little perturbed about this because I hear the president's but it's this this the gun charge that really gets me. I hear the president talking about how seriously he takes gun control and how how important it is and you're talking about a man who purchased a firearm when he wasn't supposed to who lied on his ATF form. How am I supposed to take anything Biden says on gun control seriously when he's willing to let Hunter get a slap on the wrist for something that again if you believe in gun control if you believe in filling out forms if you believe in universal background checks and all of these things that he's purporting to believe in this should be a very severe sentence for someone who just committed a felony gun uh crime. 100% and you say you were a little perturbed. Just a little. I'm ready for the dragon fire to come out of Sarah because that's what this it's warranted. By the way they call it a misdemeanor. So don't forget that they swap felony to misdemeanor like it's nothing but here's the irony in the very process of prosecuting the case they break the law further they bend the law further it's not it doesn't stop so add to the crime because now there's conversations you know let's do a wire tap in the background to the judge and the prosecutors and the plea deals in the background that the American citizen does not get you don't get that opportunity you don't get access from the White House you don't get what's called force fraud coercion from the president of the United States you don't get potential threats in the background you say well if you don't do xyz if you prosecute Hunter like you prosecuted little Wayne well that's career death. Judge your children may disappear you may become a statistic in the report in the Marco Polo report you know so it's just it's crime against crime in this family so here's a slap on the wrist wink wink while we break the law even further and no no American will ever get this treatment unless you're in the cabal unless you're in the syndicate so and it's no different than the bushes to be honest. Jeb senior junior all of them you know the bushes the lies there the obamas dear lord the Clintons I mean come on so yeah not surprised but appalled. And and to add to that Chad just because I love that point that you're talking about all of these former you know presidents or I don't know elected official families and yet with Trump they investigated his whole freaking life and all that they could finally grab onto were pieces of paper that he had in boxes that he took from being president which like I don't think is as big of a deal personally as all of the things that you're talking about with the Biden crime family the Clinton crime family the bushes to your point and the obamas all of these presidents before him certainly not a heinous crime at all in fact you know there's evidence that both Joe Biden and you know Joe Biden after his vice presidency and Obama after his presidency had classified documents at their private estates to me it's indicative of this fact that when you look at the Supreme Court building and you see those words equal justice under the law it's completely bogus as far as these politicians are concerned there is no equal justice under the law because of course they get away with a lot of things that we the ordinary American people just would never get away with to the point that you made with Lil Wayne and others and you know I would also say that you know when it comes to the general public I wonder if many actually care or if they even know what's going on with with all of this stuff because again we are living in a you know to the point that you just made we are living in a post-Clinton political climate where the bar as far as the public perception is concerned of the presidency is so low that these people are able to get away with so many things and I don't know how you recover from that I don't need that yeah I'll say this remember you know Trump's not Scotland Bones those are the bushes he's not amazing he is not the inherited bloodline it's kind of interesting to see with the Santas but these guys are not an inherited bloodline so there's a change in American politics happening and look it's going to be painful for a while but it needed to happen because these were predetermined bloodlines okay from the committee of 13 and 300 and yes it's real those who run the operations both the white pope and the black pope and all these things these are predetermined bloodlines this is why historically Europe was heck Jeb Bush almost had a run for president and that guy Kentai shoelaces okay I mean so so but but these guys are now other they're outside they they're not they don't play by the rules they don't you know and so it is political war in America and this is why the GOP is a complete shambles look at the Texas House it's a debacle it's an absolute disgrace because status quo is being disrupted and it's tumultuous the thing is just do we have enough of a body a nucleus that you and I talked about before the show you know the concentrate that can say hey the great equalizer we think we have in the law no way that's gone the equalizer for diversity equity inclusion you know the equalizer that which makes things a level is supposed to be lady justice which should be blind right the only equalizer I can find today is Jesus because there's no other equalizer in this nation so I think it's going to be the remnant that can actually get back to absolute truth because the GOP is not even operating in absolute truth that that is where I think we're going to land but it's going to be a battle I will say though that when it comes to the charges and you know what he would have to endure hunter Biden to me it seems like on the one hand they're placating the enemies of Biden and on the other hand they are giving the supporters of Biden kind of an excuse to say see look look we too care about justice and exactly what the end of the day is just a slap on the wrist to your point so so to that end I want to play this is attorney he's a constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley who I know we've talked about on the program before but he he's not a Trump guy right but he has been very objective in the I don't know just the way that Donald Trump has been treated by the deep state and he was speaking with Fox News earlier today and just talking about how the plea deal was you know basically to distract from the scandal surrounding again Hunter Biden and his father in the criminal bribery all of that that that has nothing to do with any of what Hunter Biden is pleading guilty to so I think they're they're hoping that you might forget about that watch this plea deal does have all the I have a making of a an avoidance of any jail time but more importantly it was the invasion of the more serious allegations facing Hunter Biden and the Biden family so it is historic in the sense that the president's son has been a plead guilty to criminal act it is going to be very controversial for critics I think for many this is going to look like you take it at the getaway driver after a bank rock you know many people view the influence peddling allegations as being a very serious form of corruption with potential crime and he's going to plead guilty to relatively minor tax and gun charges and that's I think it remains to be seen whether or not the American public will just kind of conflate the two issues and go up well it was put to bed because Hunter pled guilty so justice was served and he he was charged and he pled guilty and that's that rather than saying hold on a second we're kind of only scratching the surface when we're talking about this because wait where did that that 1.2 million dollars that you didn't report to the IRS where so where did that come from we seem to be glossing over all of that I'd like to get back to that question just sex crimes all that now the laptop conversation all that disappears something just dawn on me I have a question for you okay do you think the son is taking taking one for the big guy here yeah I think that's exactly what's happening I do I just like Hunter listen son I got you you're going to plead guilty but you're going to take the heat and the smoke off of our family off of me because the big guy got paid remember that broke last week three what is it three two Joe but to the president five million taking a bribe five million the president of the United States taking a bribe now president then vice president but he's president now right I think he's take I think this was a call like son you know I don't yeah I don't disagree with you because it's funny that you say that I had a friend who I was speaking to earlier today on the phone and he said do you think that they're trying to this is how they're going to take Joe down and I said no actually I think the opposite this is how they're trying to keep Joe alive is look pliem down he'll avoid jail time it's really not going to be any big deal to him other than you know a public stain which I don't know he survived all the rest of them smoking crack and all of the naked pictures and everything that came out of the laptop that nobody ever wanted to see and somehow we had to see it anyway and so it's like is that really that big of a deal in Hunter Biden's life that he pleads guilty to some minor misdemeanors I would say that's not in the slightest I would agree I would agree 100% and you know the questions that you ask about the 1.2 million all this it requires a certain degree of awareness of concern to even ask such questions to begin with which goes to show that these people are banking on the fact that the American people will move in an ignorant way not ask the important questions and allow for these politicians to skate justice I can see it now a lot of your your black radio show programs which takes advantage of the people's ignorance to the extent that this you know becomes a national thing they're going to shill for the Biden's 400 Biden and say you know who among us are not guilty of you know a gun charge or whatever the case may be it's all good Biden is still doing a lot of good for America and that's that's exactly what's going to happen yeah well I mean we did hear if you don't vote for Joe you ain't black so did you realize that you didn't realize that until just now you're actually not black yeah yeah Biden told you so yeah I mean if he said it's possible he said it it's true all right we got to take a quick break we'll be back with more but we want to thank our sponsor Eden Pierce so they've got this thunderstorm air purifier that it quickly destroys viruses odors mold so much more they've sold a ton of them over 300 000 you know it works I know it works personally because we have them in my house we have them in we have one in the utility room where we have the litter box which is the worst part about owning a cat yes the their box it doesn't sink in there anymore though because of the thunderstorm air purifier we've got one in my my older son's room because he's you know reaching he's almost 11 and he just stinks sometimes and he doesn't like to shower as it turns out so put one in there and all of a sudden the air smells better in his room again and then of course the kicker we've got one where we have our younger son's dirty diapers because I just live in a house with too many disgusting smells but again that is why I needed Eden pure in my life you need it to because it eliminates all of these smells it seeks out and destroys these odors that it uses this it's o3 molecules so it actually goes to the smell and destroys it wherever it is in the room right now you can save $200 on Eden pure thunderstorm 3 pack for whole home protection trust me you will find a place to put them just like I did you can go to Edenpeardeals.com use discount code Sarah to save $200 that is Edenpeardeals.com discount code Sarah YouTube has removed a Jordan Peterson interview with Democrat presidential candidate R.F.K. Jr. citing of course vaccine misinformation this was a 95-minute interview it was published earlier this month here and you know I mean Jordan Peterson he's a clinical psychologist so he talked about all sorts of different topics as you would with a presidential candidate you would think right so his candidacy COVID-19 vaccines mainstream media, wokeism the environment and the possibility of salvaging the Democrat party and YouTube releases statement yesterday saying we removed a video from the Jordan Peterson channel for violating YouTube's general vaccine misinformation policy which prohibits content that alleges that vaccines cause chronic side effects outside of rare side effects that are recognized by health authorities which is interesting to me because if you've ever read an insert of any vaccine well I don't know we may have to just put up a slate at this point on the YouTube stream if you guys are watching it and the slate goes up you're gonna be like oh Sarah said a thing that she wasn't supposed to say but they they put these the the packets that come with the vaccines and it lists a long list of side effects and they are not always I mean there's a lot of them are long-term a lot of them are permanent these are so it's fascinating to me that we're supposed to believe that vaccines are just a medication that everyone can take 100% of the time and have no side effects and if you if you think it's a side effect don't worry your myocarditis is definitely from something else but I want to play I want to play a clip of this yeah I want to play a clip of this interview here watch I've seen the climate apocalypse use fear to induce something approximating the same kind of level of tyranny as far as I'm concerned that characterize the the vaccine lockdown help me sort that out and understand where you stand I see these huge levels depression and despair loneliness in kids and I don't think that there's a single cause to it um and I think blaming it on you know depression about climate is probably over simplistic in fact I think a lot of the problems we see in kids and particularly boys it's probably under appreciated um that uh how much of that is coming from chemical exposures including a lot of the sexual dysphoria that we're seeing I mean they're swimming through a soup of toxic chemicals today and many of those are endocrine disruptors there's atrazine throughout our water supply atrazine by the way if you in a lab put atrazine in a tank full of frogs it will chemically castrate and force forcibly feminize every frog in there and 10 percent of the frogs the male frogs will uh will turn into fully viable females able to produce viable eggs if it's doing that to frogs it could there's a lot of other evidence that it's doing it to human beings as well I would encourage everyone especially if you are a blaze subscriber to go back and watch the last episode of the show that peter mccullough was on a while back when we talked about the same issue um could vaccines be potentially contributing to this rise in sexual dysphoria and I mean rfk makes a very compelling case and the thing is is that he has the receipts to back it up that you know when you're talking about an endocrine disruptor an endocrine disruptor that you have in the water supply I mean here's a nih study right here atrazine contamination of drinking water and adverse birth outcomes uh in community water systems with elevated atrazine uh you know he talked about turning male frogs into female which absolutely can happen I know people joke about Alex Jones saying it turns the frogs gay but I mean these are this look at Berkeley news this isn't like it's some you know crazy right wing rag conspiracy theory outlet that's putting all of these you know all of these studies together and so it's just um it's really terrifying when you talk about the amount of censorship that exists within all of these platforms that are these main platforms that people go to to get their information um and you know rfk god bless him I think he's he is he is um he knows a lot more than the democrat party than the mainstream democrat party he gives him credit for also 100% and and they're abandoning him and canceling him because of that because they know that he knows he's seen behind the veil remember he's still a Kennedy okay so you don't you're not a Kennedy and all of a sudden you're just deaf dumb and mute right these things these stories these generational stories and again bloodline I talked about it earlier the Kennedy bloodline he has a lot of information some of it confidential information on our country and it's an accumulative thought pattern that he's delivering with a great scholar Jordan Peterson who's a highly intellectual individual on a quest of his own to find purpose but they dig and I love the fact that they dig and rfk jr is going after things that is even having some conservatives go man I think I like this guy just hold up a minute like I said about just okay just chill for a minute here still a Kennedy and an environmentalist and all these other things that we don't necessarily agree with but yeah for the moment I love the disruption on the left that he's causing he's a wrecking he's a bull on the china shop at the moment he is causing all kinds of havoc he's probably making Gavin Newsome really really nervous yeah yeah you know it's it's interesting when I look at um someone like rfk jr who has dedicated a large portion of his decades of his life with children's health defense fund and you know researching all of this material um really trying to get to the heart of it and at the end of the day I just it it fascinates me that someone would go no I trust the person who's funded by the government to give you the narrative that the government wants you to give rather than the person who's risking their entire you know like their entire character their entire existence their entire like how how public perceives them by telling you what they have found in all of their decades of research who do you think is in it for some sort of you know malintent or in it for themselves I'm I'm going with the government funded one it's it's crazy to me because you know when you look at someone like a rfk jr and you look at the juxtaposition of where the democrat party has gone over the past ten years they've gone far left and a lot of people are frankly over at this point rfk jr is a kind of a safe person for the democrat party but they don't realize it yeah a lot of a lot of the democrats themselves don't realize it it's funny though because you know we interviewed dr peter mccollator studio in dallas a year or so ago and we posted that to our youtube channel and youtube took it down within four or five days and so it's interesting because you know you know who's in power as they say but who you can't talk about I wouldn't say that big pharma is in power per se when it comes to youtube however the global elitists who control the flow of information are in in power and when you look at the fact that they want for everyone to take these vaccines I think that that's something that we should all be concerned about mhm so can I share a couple statistics real quick I just want to get it on it cut me off from over time here the the government and those followers stand to make 60 billion a year from the vaccine program okay are you aware that they make 500 billion a year from dealing with the complications of the vaccine program the the collateral medicine so it's a pro that whole different conversation isn't it ironic that that interview gets canceled by youtube the same week and check me on this number where the cdc quietly releases a statistic that oh you're 130 000 more likely to have myocarditis or a heart condition post vaccine and pre-vaccine the cdc released this ups softly but we're gonna shut Jordan down because Robert you know rfk jr is saying hey there's something to look into here this doesn't quite add up yeah and i i don't know why the government wouldn't want rfk talking about the fact that the stuff that they're putting in the water supply is making you freaking sick because it's not just after zine i can tell you that um by the way speaking of social media censorship i was going to share this so i kept posting stuff on instagram and i was like why is nobody's seeing this what is going on well uh quietly very quietly they apparently went and disabled my account and suppressed it to where no one who any non-followers cannot see any of my any of my account uh no it's not shown in explorer it's not shown in search it's not shown recommended it's not my reels are not shown it doesn't pop up on anyone's pages because i want to show these to you there's there were four things two of them were me as a legal gun owner at a gun range responsibly training with my firearm that i am legally allowed to have the other two uh were me exposing a north carolina doctor for performing mastectomies on minors which you can see in these two pictures they're very small but you can see the blacked out areas because i have already censored it but apparently according to instagram my post may go against their their guidelines for sexual activity or nudity now child sex trafficking on instagram totally fine completely fine me exposing uh you know doctors mutilating children not fine we that's your account is not safe for others so this is this is the level of depravity that we're dealing with when it comes to all of these media and social media platforms it's really disgusting um all right we got to take a quick break we'll be back with more but we want to thank our sponsor jace medical so i want

local and federal governments would rather we all forget what happened i'm laurin chen and to uncover the truth about that day in the aftermath including through exclusively obtained 911 calls the blaze and i traveled to mowie for this first ever blaze original documentary and this is just the start of blaze originals a new docu series featuring your favorite blaze tv hosts as we investigate the most important regions of our national theater covering groundbreaking issues and standing in the void left by the elimination of investigative journalism watch what really happened in mowie a blaze original streaming now on blaze tv.com and use the code laurin plus to save 36 dollars off your annual subscription according to a new report a young female student was allegedly raped by a trans female which we know is a biological male in what is called a trans inclusive bathroom at her new mexico middle school she detailed the incident that took place in october of 2021 in her diary saying i was raped i was raped effing kill me a sixth grader at the time of the alleged attack this is at ask academy charter school in rio rancher new mex Rio rancho new mexico detailed how she was raped by this biological male that was older than her but again you you have access to the same bathroom you have access to the same locker rooms the same changing rooms and the male student entered the girl's restroom attacked her pinned her down and forcibly raped her and her mother did not hear about it until she saw it in her daughter's diary um and this is you know it's it's really infuriating because you're called all sorts of names you're called a bigot you're called a transphobe you're called a homophobe if you say hey allowing biological males into women's you know anything could lead to disastrous consequences they're like i can't believe that you would call all trans people sexual deviance and it's like i mean i didn't say that i'm just saying this is not a good idea to mix the sexes in this way this is not a good idea even if it's not a person who actually thinks that they're trans it could be but to think that this policy wouldn't be manipulated by people who are sexual deviance is absolutely preposterous but again we're not supposed to care about women anymore we're throwing women just under the bus i guess at this point but that is really you just nailed it this is the greatest attack on women this nation has ever seen it's the greatest attack on children it's the greatest attack on the womb it's a it's the greatest way satan can attack the kingdom of god is to destroy legacy and legacy comes through procreation because two lesbians cannot procreate nor can two gays go try you will fail like a hundred percent of the time and that's what this is all about and so we you say it in sex nation sera so eloquently in the movie they destroy the family unit that's when they win maybe you need your c sera say that and you're eloquent in that and that's what's going on here as if the tools that a man has in his pants makes him a man it's in your wiring system it's in your DNA it's in the neurons in your brain it's in the you know endorphins in your body it's chemistry so you take a guy that has cut all these tools off and you put him in a bathroom with girls and he gets aroused chemically and he's brine and he's gonna act upon it i don't care if he tells you he was Martha from birth it doesn't matter yeah he can't stop that you can't no doctor can replace that you can't cut that out it will happen well don't worry because the Rio Rancho police department i mean they're investigating but it's a little slow because of staffing shortages so i'm sure justice will be done well yoco i wouldn't recommend that people go and try to try it create with the same sex but i do get your point and and but you know what i mean yeah i know i know what you mean they do it anyway and they know they say you know you fail that's why you fail your you fail at this you cannot 100 i agree with everything you just said and um you know for me call me a radical but i disagree with co-education in the first place um when it comes to the very existence of a of a what do they call it a transgender bathroom yes trans inclusive trans inclusive bathroom when it comes to these things it's indicative of a culture of disorder and so it can only ever breed the kind of incident that she wrote about in her journal um and of course you'll begin to see more things like this come out and you know genuine conservatives have been warning all along that these transgender bathrooms would lead to this kind of a thing and of course democrats and leftists and marxists i will know it won't um we're the party we're the ideology of morality and of decency when in reality they're they're not and i think that this should be proof that they're not i want to i want to um really quickly i want to cover kind of where else this leads because it leads to of course women being raped and um in uncomfortable situations where they're being assaulted um but it also leads to just complete break from reality at all uh take what's going on in southeastern england which again you're like well that's not here that's not in this country just wait a few years it will be there is a school that is under fire from parents and critics after one of its teachers scolded a student over her refusal to accept a classmate as a cat i'm not making that up her refusal to accept a classmate as a cat because that is how her classmate identified this is eighth grade students at ry college in east in east sussics and they were subjected to a class on life education during which they were told they can be who you want to be and how you identify as up to you and then they got chastised uh for you know needing a proper education and despicable for not agreeing with this gender ideology watch and what do you think we have so many problems in the world with homophobia yes those are lesbians and gay people i've gone off and against them but gender is there is a lingon between it and you have no people that is strange they go on to be they go on and then you get a face attached no or not you're confusing that's sex and no i'm not though because if you have a client you're a guard you're a kid you're a woman you can't be you can't have a vagina if you get out of it i'll show you it's so good even then because you've got those kids how are you identity now you're identity there's not a pinion with a big impression this is no it's not if you don't like it you need to go to a different school so i have a report in the infamous willowess you need to have a proper educational conversation about about equality diversity inclusion because i'm not having that expressed in my list but i'm teaching you about you can be who you want to be how you identify is up to you okay how you identify is up to you i love the kids schooling i know taking to the cleaners a teacher miss willows how embarrassing how embarrassing i'm going to report you to miss willows okay go ahead and and she makes an argument of gender you know and then but but the kid can be a cat right right it's homophobia so it's all are we not talking about a kid being a furry here trying to be a cat that's a dolphin what i hope phobia transpecies that that's we jumped the shark from transgender not the same thing at all at all why do they smoke at that school yeah oh my gosh all right we got to take another quick break we'll be back with more but i want to tell you guys all about a new show that we have here at blaze tv make sure that you turn tune into it and it's actually taking place right behind me is the new set for normal world this is a dave landau comedian dave landau and quarter black garret uh who i'm sure you guys are are familiar with here on blaze tv they've done some stuff in the past and they are coming to you tonight at 10 p.m. eastern and they're going to reinvent the you know the late night top talk show they've got topical sketches comedic conversations on the latest political and social news and sometimes even musical guests so make sure that you watch normal world head over to youtube.com slash normal world or you can watch it on blaze tv tonight at 10 p.m. eastern well at least someone some organizations are fighting back against the weaponization of the justice system against conservative specifically donald trump in this case this is the heritage foundation which is a conservative think tank in d.c. they filed two lawsuits against soros manhattan district attorney alvin bragg for not releasing trump case records they claim that bragg has failed to comply with two freedom of information law requests he failed to release his communication with the justice department the white house and any other democrat law maker regarding his prosecution of trump and in the lawsuit they state regrettably these questions have not been met with answers these reports have raised concerns in many circles based in large part upon the long standing history of president trump's political opponents coordinating their activities to systematically weaponize the criminal justice system against him and thereby pervert the course of justice i know we talked about we kind of alluded to what was going on with trump earlier in the program with the class of i documents and we can talk about that too when we're when in this discussion but just to remind everyone since trump's getting it from all sides this is not the classified documents case this is the other case this is this is the manhattan case where they're like you falsified business records and the statute of limitations has run out but we're gonna we don't care about that so we're just gonna just throw a bunch of stuff at the wall and see what sticks and that's what they're doing it'll be fascinating to see how this plays out because i mean look we all know why bragg isn't going to release all of the communication that he's had between the white house and the justice department and democrat lawmakers i i think we all know why he's not doing that now i mean the thing is it leaves a kind of aura of suspicion and that's what they want that's exactly where they want the american people and um i don't know it's just it's just a shame because it goes back to what i was saying earlier with regard to the fact that a lot of these politicians are swamp people here along came trump who was for all intents and purposes an outsider and because he claimed that he was going to come and drain the swamp and do all the things they became very alarmed by this and so the politicians along with the media who love to shield for them decided to try to get trump on a technicality and to the extent that they are now trying to get this information on okay what exactly do you have on me they don't want to release any of it so it's crazy well and i i know earlier you made the point it's just like how do how do we get back to how do we get back to like where we see some sort of a subjective you know um system where protocols are followed and laws are followed and if you have a freedom of information request you fulfill that request and you don't just stonewall people i mean the biden white house is doing it i'm excuse me the biden regime is doing it uh the justice department is doing it you've got you know state uh district attorneys who are doing it it's like how do you even how do you even write the ship when we're so far gone yeah you don't look we are my concern is a correction is needed historically and this is just the pendulum theory that pendulum is going to overcorrect if we don't find equilibrium and balance but it's not quick this is not a four-year cycle you don't this little skillet cannot be undone in four years okay this is going to be a process because the damage that has been done in america throughout every system every branch of government every social construct has been affected by this and because the world came to a halt again we spoke before the show you shut everything down this is what china did ten years of no education you burn every book and you start over everything shut down they had a reset moment and now everything is corrupted you don't just turn that around by occupying the oval office they want to go hey man we're back baby mm-hmm you've got agents of destruction in in education department health care throughout government i mean this swamp is exponentially larger than it was in 2016 because it's bold now it's been emboldened right and so even in your fight you know drag shows for kids we didn't have that issue in 2016 and 2015 right it's a completely different that sketch so the concern is here the GOP does not play a long game we're very short-sighted we're very reactionary and i'm not seeing leadership in the gop from a leadership position galvanizing the grassroots saying this way here's the vision now you grassroots need to go do it that's how we're gonna it's gonna be us doing it not them but where's mcconnell where's mccarthy where's you know where's gram where's the leadership of the gop casting a vision they go no no no trump will do it when he gets into the white house buddy when you blink two years of gone and it's impeachment on impeachment and trial on trial and then so it's got to be a long road go ahead one thing i will say real quick is what i did like about the san tis' governorship there in florida is he did always seem to be on the offense he did always seem to be informative in terms of getting ahead of things and letting the florida people know this is what we're doing this is why we're doing it i feel like whoever the republican nominee is they need to take cues from that and get ahead of things because people are blissfully ignorant and that's the reason why this want people are able to do what they do because nobody's calling attention from a posture of a of a large platform um to the corruption that's going on in washington dc yeah all right we gotta take a quick break we'll be right back well uh joe biden gave a speech on water conservation in california yesterday and there was um kind of an interesting moment where a congresswoman like had to physically pull him across the stage to meet with attendees i'd it was it it was just weird flutch look this way yep i'm so pulling all right we're going we're going this if i couldn't just tell you i didn't just telling you would not have been enough because you don't seem to understand direction instructions because i've seen the way that you're like there here where where there here so i think she just felt you know what i'm just just to avoid confusion i'm just gonna drag you i think in her mind when she grabbed his hands she's like oh crap he's locked up i mean people like dave shapelle and and comedian should have a field day because he's giving so much content every day i mean it's fun actually oh my god it's sad it's sad and fun at the same time well we left so you don't cry exactly we'll do that we'll we'll agree to do that um so if you guys were watching
