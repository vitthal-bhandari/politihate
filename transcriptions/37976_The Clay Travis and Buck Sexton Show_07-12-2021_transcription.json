    "text": " Hi, it's Carol Markowitz. I'm so excited to launch my very own podcast. We'll talk to the biggest names and politics, news, entertainment, and get to the truth of the issues that affect your family and have some fun along the way. It's the Carol Markowitz Show, part of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Podcast Network. New episodes drop every Monday and Thursday on the iHeart Radio app, Apple podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts. Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Welcome back in Clay Travis, Buck Sexton Show, hanging out with all of you. Appreciate you guys as we roll through Tuesday edition of the program. We talked about the COVID madness that continues to descend upon our cities across our country. One of the other wild things that's going on right now is an attempt to use COVID as a justification for why the overall crime rate is skyrocketing all over the country. 2020 we discussed with you, FBI data showed nearly a 30% increase in the overall number of murders, which was the largest increase on record. Things so far in many cities are not getting better. It's likely that we are going to see an overall increase from that massive increase in 2020 in 2021 as well, meaning that things are not going to have gotten better in many of the places across the country. Why could that be occurring? And what is the overall impact on so many of you all over this country? Well, this is interesting. Beverly Hills Police Chief Mark Steenbrooke is willing to actually speak out. Of course, Beverly Hills, a part of Los Angeles where we have seen overall in the city of Los Angeles, massive increases in crime all over California. And he says the police chief there does, does that the reason why crime is surging is because California voters have been sold a bill of goods when it comes to criminal justice reform. The California voters were sold this bill of goods that these laws would reduce the criminal population in jails. But the money that was saved would be used for job placement, drug and alcohol treatment, mental illness, housing, those sorts of things. And we just haven't seen that those services on the back end to reduce crime. Even if that were a good plan, Clay, over the long term, which is highly debatable, the notion that you should allow for what we've seen, which is the loosening of the enforcement of the law and the undermining of police simultaneously. And that that wouldn't result in people suffering now. You can talk about better services and outreach and all this thing. And that's all on good. By the way, that's already going on at stunning levels in places like New York, Los Angeles, where there's a massive, you know, social welfare and services state and operation of bureaucracy. That's by the way, highly inefficient and not very good at a job. But there's already all kinds of stuff going on with regard to that. But in the meantime, people get their homes broken into, get their stuff stolen and get clubbed over the head in New York City here when they're on the way to the subway. I mean, you know, crime, the crime that matters to you is the crime that's local, right? So I just want to make sure that we always keep in mind this is true of basically every major city across the country and most medium sized cities. If you look at places across the country, I've mentioned Wichita and Lansing, because I crunched the numbers on those. There are others though that are, you know, in the less than less than half a million range, a couple of hundred thousand where they've still had big increases in crime, Portland, a city of 600,000, a thousand shootings in the last year, right? So Clay, what we have though is a Democrat party that is in denial about this. Because what are they going to say? Right? How are they, they pushed all this stuff like they had the panacea, undermine cops, more social services, less crime. Everybody's happier, more social justice. What we've gotten is all ladies being clubbed on the head on the way to the store. Those guys being allowed the same day because no cash bail, people being either not prosecuted for felonies or very lightly prosecuted for felonies because social justice is going to be better. This is madness. AOC said just last week, this was the quote, folks, we have to talk about specifics, for example, because we're actually seeing a lot of these allegations of organized retail theft are actually not panning out. This is the interview last week. I believe it's a Walgreens in California cited it, but the dated and back it up. I mean, this woman's living on another planet. She's not even living in another country. She's living on another planet. This is insane. Being concerned with the punishment of criminals being too strong is a luxury of low crime. And I hate to sound like Matthew McConaughey in a true detective, but time is a flat circle. What ends up happening over and over again is we go through the same cycles in this country. People get convinced that police have too much power and there's a couple of viral videos that go out and it becomes anecdotal evidence to support the an indictment of police everywhere in the wake of George Floyd. And the overall result is so imminently predictable. Crime skyrockets, the people that are ostensibly being protested for are the ones who bear the brunt of the crime. Because make no mistake about it, Black Lives Matter in an unbelievable irony leads to the more active Black Lives Matter protests are the more Black people who die. That happens almost every single city. If you look at the data, the more active and protest are, the less police are able to do their job, the media disappears and the murder rate skyrockets for those who are left behind in those cities. And so this is imminently predictable. It's why in 2022, we need to see a massive outreach of Republican voters to repudiate, defund the police and to let police do their jobs again and put violent criminals back behind the bars. I mean, to me, even though people want to pretend it didn't happen, Waukesha is a perfect example of this buck. You had a guy who never should have been on the streets at all. Daryl Brooks was a violent harden criminal who was allowed out with a limited bail. And then what we believe committed racially charged murders in Waukesha and the media wants to pretend it didn't happen because the media directly has blood on its hands with what happened there. But so do the DAs who are not enforcing the law and are allowing violent criminals. You see this all the time, Buck, how often do you see whenever one of these incidents happens? The person who does it almost never has any kind of clean rap sheet, right? They have been in and out of prison for years, violent crime after violent crime. They had no business being out. This is happening all over our country, whether it's Milwaukee, whether it's Phoenix, whether it's Houston, whether it's New York City, Atlanta, you name the place it's happening everywhere. Clay, there was just a horrific fatal stabbing in New York of a PhD student. There actually were two stabbings, one Columbia, the other, right? I'm sorry. A Columbia PhD student, right? Yeah. The Columbia PhD student who was stabbed to death and unsurprisingly, the guy who stabbed him to death had already been arrested 11 times. Now, I understand that the story that we're supposed to believe here from the criminal justice reformers out there on the left, the Soros thinking social justice, progressive prosecutor types or whether the prosecutors are just individuals, but that same mentality is, oh my gosh, some guy got caught for the third time stealing a pair of socks and he's going to prison forever for it. And that shouldn't happen. Now, by the way, that shouldn't happen. But what also shouldn't happen is you changed laws that aren't really going to stop that, but we'll result in people who have multiple felony convictions, arrests. I mean, once you've been arrested 10, 11, 15, 20 in the case of a guy who hit an old lady here on the street some months ago, but it went viral because there was video of it. Let me just clocked an old lady and they had walking past her a broad daylight, an elderly woman, a guy that arrested 100 times. Okay. So at what point do the libs have to accept that when someone's been arrested 15 times, 50 times, 100 times, it's not because the system is so unfair to them, at least the criminal justice system. If anything, it's too permissive. And there are people that need to be taken off the street for the safety of those around them. Notice with COVID, you're a threat to other people if you breathe, but with violent felons, it's, Hey, come on, let's not be too harsh. Let's not get crazy. You know, this guy doesn't need to go to prison. He only hit his fifth old lady over the head with a hammer. Maybe if we give him some more social services, he'll stop hitting old ladies with hammers. The irony here also, Buck, is that maybe the only thing Joe Biden's almost gotten right in his entire career. 1994 crime, crime bill, which he now has repeating. I know it said amazing. The one thing. And I wasn't a guy. They were Republicans at the time just out of like sheer hatred of Biden, we're saying, Oh, he even turned his on. Like, no, no guys, but that was, that was actually good. I was actually one of the things he's got. That was actually a good thing. And now we should be hitting him for abandoning the one good thing that he did. Anyway, I mean, it's, it's crazy. Everyone's saying, I mean, you know, we've got, he just go down the list, right? New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Phoenix, Minneapolis, all these cities, people listening across the guy Houston, shootings way up, crime way up. What the heck is going on? Democrats. That's what's going on, folks. They're in charge. We're all about pets on this program. Yours are as we love them. We want our pets to be healthy and well fed. One way to make sure that's happening is to give them the benefits of a healthy food supplement. It's called rough greens and it's meant to supplement the dry, kibble dog food. You're feeding your dog every day. Dry dog food does not have the living ingredients your dog needs for a healthy digestive system. Vitamins, probiotics, enzymes, and antioxidants, just the name of few, those all come with rough greens. You sprinkle a little on your dog's food. You'll see just how your dog loves it. The ingredients that are in it really help with your dog's overall health, digestion, energy, you name it. What you get is a happier and healthier dog. Jason in Kansas saying now that his dog, he now tells us that his dog pushes the bowl as quickly as possible so that the rough greens can be mixed in quickly. The folks at Rough Greens are so confident your dog is going to love it. They've got a special deal for you. Go to roughgreens.com slash EIB. They're going to give you the first bag free.

Yesterday, December 7th, 1941, a date which will live in infamy. The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. There we have FDR right after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. You've all I'm sure heard that before. Today is of course the 80th anniversary of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Clay and I both like to weave history and her discussions here and you know Clay it is a reminder I think as first of all so many things. I actually just read for the first time recently. I never actually read with the old breed which was largely the basis for the series the Pacific right and it's about a marine who was at a couple of the nastiest battles in the Pacific theater in World War II and it's haunting to even read it. It is one of those things where you look back on the history of America and there have been a lot of wars a lot of battles fought the Marines and the Navy and everyone who served in general but the Marines in World War II and the Pacific theater what they were willing to go right into the teeth of almost defies belief. I mean it really was the Spartans at the pass of Thermopylae outnumbered 100 to 1 in terms of just the the risk and the unbelievable you know fearsome adversary that they were up against. No doubt and I think and you probably have noticed this too. There oftentimes is I think in World War II a bias towards coverage of what happened in Europe because of the clear delineation the Nazis Churchill Hitler the fact that the east coast of the United States is so much closer to everything that was going on in Europe and obviously D-Day such that the war in the Pacific is in many ways sort of ignored comparatively in terms of the scholarship surrounding World War II and interestingly there's even a little bit of an analogy with this in the Civil War. The war in the west which obviously wasn't that far west at the time but Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia everything in the Western theater gets a lot less attention than what happened with Lee and Grant and everybody in the Eastern theater of the Civil War in such that what happened in Pearl Harbor and the shock of it all gets way more attention than the battles that took place in all of the Pacific theater really what you get is a lot of times D-Day and then everybody skips ahead to the atomic bomb and overlooks in many ways what had to take place in the Pacific theater and how savage that war was with Japan. Unbelievably high casualties taken in conflicts like Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, numbers that you know the modern world just wouldn't be able you know modern western societies wouldn't be able to handle a week of what we were seeing in terms of those figures coming out of some of those battles and you know you mentioned the way that this is covered and historically how kids learn about all this stuff in school. I would just say this we all know that the evils of the Nazi regime were something that still almost defies belief or defies possibility how can I be that evil the Japanese imperial regime was really evil too and anybody who fought in that theater anyone who liberated POWs anyone who was you know in the Philippines after the Japanese occupation spent any time in mainland China after the Japanese were through they allied with the Nazis I think this is often forgotten they were you know the right hand in the far east to the Nazi regime and that was reflected in the way that they fought in the way that they treated POWs the way that that regime completely dehumanized the enemy abandoned all rules of warfare and so you know because we also still have this ongoing debate about ho dropping the bomb what we saw in the various theaters whether it was Okinawa, Iwo Jima, Guadalcanal there was a willingness to essentially turn these islands into trench warfare battles and fight to the very last man and that's why we're taking such high casualties because we cleared out you know our soldiers our marines and and the people that were on the front lines we're clearing out yard by yard these volcanic islands essentially that are that are almost like a giant bunker was the way they'd been constructed so it was you know I don't think there's really enough I mean a lot of people listening to this our big World War II history buffs so they know but I don't think kids are learning this stuff I don't think they're understanding the full scope and scale of what happened I think it's well said Buck and not only that this is living memory you probably Buck have to have been fortunate enough as I have to speak to so many different people who thought both in the Pacific theater and also in Europe my grandfather was on the USS baton he was there for Lady Gulf which was the biggest naval engagement I believe in terms of ships involved in modern history and he rarely talked about it but a lot of you listening to this I'm sure know when you talk to World War II veterans toward the end toward the latter four or five years of the end of his life a few times he would talk about what it was like for five days straight of kamikaze's coming and he would just start talking about it out of nowhere I remember I told this story a few months ago I think about my great uncle who had met patent in while he was serving in Europe and patent was walking down the line and talking to talking to the different soldiers and they had been out fighting for a long time and he stopped in front of my great uncle and said have you gotten a chance to kill any Germans yet and he said no and he said you will kid you will and the point I think that is so illuminative and an illustrative in so many ways is right now the way American history is being taught now I was a history major in school so I understand the concepts of historiography and how we decide to tell the narrative of the past but we are skipping over the living memory of the greatest generation I believe 30 survivors of Pearl Harbor are scheduled to be at the ceremonies today and we're skipping over the greatest generation and the legacies that they have left us and are still here illuminating and instead we're going all the way back to 1619 and trying to argue that America is founded as a fundamentally unfair and unjust country and we're skipping right over your point buck which is we went to war with the Nazis and with their allies in Japan who were determined to effectively destroy freedoms in the world in the living memory of many people that are here with us right now and we're trying to pretend that that isn't the actual legacy of America when it clearly is and it's just so fundamentally a lie that it's why those generations and people who are closer to them are so patriotic because they understand what America represents and younger generations are being taught hey 400 years ago America was a bad place and so you should hate this country today it's a fundamental failure of our country to own our country's history in an honest and transparent way there are parents and grandparents and maybe even some you know some listening right now we're there and saw some of this themselves but a lot of people listening have parents and grandparents who prevented a global totalitarianism from turning us all into slaves of an authoritarian system that is that is the legacy of America within the last 100 years which is a pretty remarkable thing when you think about it by the way it wasn't just the Nazis and the Imperial Japan and their allies it's also the Soviet Union which we worked with in the Second World War kind of because we had to under the circumstances a whole other conversation we had about how really twin you know cousins of the evils of authoritarianism the Soviet regime and the Nazi regime socialist evils by the way and in yet here we are now as to your point Clay being told constantly that America is a bad place and I know we make jokes about how you know the French would be speaking German if it weren't for us but it's true it's also worth remembering that yeah we can all kid about it now but thanks to the you know thanks to some of the dads and grandads of people listening to this program right now and many people all across the country we actually do live in a free society and it is worth it is worth fighting for it something to remind ourselves all right I mean whatever whatever day we're dealing with Clay with the craziness of the left these days we're not being asked to charge a machine gun nest at Guadalcanal when the chance of getting through that one alive is anybody's guess think about the difference buck between people today who called others they disagree with Nazis on social media as opposed to the grandfathers and fathers of many of the people listening right now who had to fight actual Nazis that's where we are as a country we have the legacy to now be able to just yell at people anonymously online who say mean things or things that may make us unhappy those guys had to actually risk their lives fighting legitimate Nazis we're gonna switch gears here for a second we've also got some calls 800-282-2882 so if you want to give us a ring I think we've got some calls lit and we've also got a segment coming up with someone from the border patrol union to tell us what the heck is going on at the us max go border that'll be the top of the next hour that's all coming up why not start off the new year with a cost saving on your

in hour number three Tuesday edition clay Travis and buck sext and show rolling through the program here encourage you to go sign up for the podcast if you haven't already and give us five star lots of discussion points all about the latest covid madness we talked with our experience and at the top of the second hour he was fantastic as well so many different angles to discuss so far in the program and we bring in now one of the biggest stories and biggest failings of many failings in the Biden administration is what's going on at our southern border we bring in now Brandon Judd he's the president of the national border patrol council which represents rank and file border patrol agents nationwide he had an op-ed yesterday with Fox where Brandon reported that in the month of November the border patrol recorded more than 52,000 godaways on the southwest border enough people I'm reading from his article to fill Joe Biden's hometown of greenville Delaware 22 times Brandon is there any suggestion that the Biden administration basically throwing up their arms and reembracing what the trump administration had done with the remain in mexico policy is going to fix what has been a sieve at our southern border or is it possible for the Biden administration to fix the mess that exists right now it is possible for them to fix it are they actually going to implement trump's policies no they're not going to they've blocked themselves in a corner they know darn good and well that if they implement the migrant protocols or more commonly known as remain in mexico they know darn good and well that if they implement it properly illegal border crossings will drop to historic lows and if it drops the historic lows then they're going to have to admit that they were wrong they're going to have to admit that trump got it right that his border security policies were good and that they were wrong for causing all the chaos that they caused they're not going to do it which is why they're slow rolling it right now i mean we're only enrolling um around 30 people um at any given time into the migrant section protocols um so no i i don't think that they're going to actually implement it properly because they know if they do it's going to work hey Brandon it's buck so basically they're saying they're doing this so that then they can say they're doing something because the alternative is the continuation of the de facto open borders status quo um and i've been down there in some months but last time i was down there at the border brand and they were just uh the border patrol agents were telling me they are overwhelmed overstretched to put it mildly and that people who want to run illicit contraband drugs uh human smuggling into the country apart from the situation of the migrants who are surrendering themselves and claiming credible fear it's just all out of control can you give us a sense of where we are right now with the year in uh you know the overall year numbers like what how many illegals have actually crossed in how many godaways are we having a month i mean i think that puts it into perspective for everybody and are we hitting all-time records i mean have we ever had a year that's this open so in fiscal year 21 which ended at the end of uh september we we broke all records in both apprehensions and godaways we had more than 400 000 godaways in in 21 alone um we had nearly 1.7 million apprehension and the first two months of this fiscal year we already have a hundred thousand godaways now in the op-ed i wrote 52 000 in the month of november um but you couple that with the 48 thousand it just just under 48 000 in the in the month of uh october and we're already at a hundred in two months we're on pace to go 600 000 godaways and on top of that we're on pace to make two two million apprehensions yeah this just it's they this administration refuses to define the problem and if they refuse to call this um uh you know the chaos that they've caused if they refuse to define the problem they're not going to come up with the solutions they need i mean all they say is well it's a challenge it's it's a it's a challenge it's not a crisis it's challenge so if you don't define it as a crisis you're not going to develop the policies the programs the operations it is going to allow us to fix the problem they're just not going bran and thanks for coming on with us several months ago the fox news was able to report on a mass collection of illegal immigrants many of them Haitian underneath a bridge if i remember correctly in del rio texas they then cleaned up that huge a mass of people but my understanding is the vast majority of those people were just allowed into the country how many people that are coming across the border illegally are just being allowed to enter into the country being given a report that they have to show up at court or whatever else but then we just never end up hearing from those people you talk about getaways and people who get across the border and all those things but we're releasing a lot of these people into the country with the hope that they're going to show up for these uh these court proceedings when many of them aren't isn't that a reality of what's going on it is it is it's called a notice to appear we will issue notice to notice is to appear or notice is to report nta ntr's um with those nta's we give them a de facto legal status so so imagine this you cross the border illegally you you break our laws and then you're rewarded by giving by being given a de facto legal status and release the border patrol alone released um approximately 150 000 people with nta's um in fiscal year 21 then ice released just as many um then we then you also have to consider to unaccompanied uh um children that were released to hhs or r on that's helping human services off the refugee resettlement um they then release people to uh to foster homes um it was nearly 600 000 people were released in fiscal year so so yeah no I mean those are astronomical numbers wow 400 000 godaways and then 600 000 people were released with nta's or ntr's a million people that's how many people we added illegally to our population in fiscal year 21 we're speaking of brandon jud president of the national border patrol council he's got a great op-ed on foxnews.com published yesterday uh brandon where does this where does this go i mean at at some point you have to wonder how it's possible that this can continue as it is with the numbers just growing growing month after month without some real i mean the american people are very actually when they pull them dialed in on the issue of immigration think that illegal immigration is an important challenge to deal with and yet there seems to be not only no political urgency in dc right now under the biden regime to do anything about it but obviously there's a general media blackout one of the reasons why we want to have you on is to just keep making sure that we get the information out there all across the country where do you see this going i mean is this basically i'm asking you does it seem like the people in charge right now like what's happening yeah they it does it does it looks like they're pandering to their base it it truly it truly feels like this is a lame duck administration it feels like they know that they're a one and done and so they're going to try to get uh as much done to to satisfy their liberal base that they possibly can um you know it's funny because as much as uh as much as much i love put on the uniform and and going out and patrol the border i'm heavily involved in politics uh for my membership and and in any any intelligent person knowing what biden's age was you know we all wondered when he won you know if he really going to run for reelection because if he is he's going to be a centrist he's going to be right now in the middle obama um in his first term he was he was pretty much down the middle and then of course when uh he he won reelection that's when he started uh legislating through executive order um but this administration it truly feels like they know that they're a one and done so they're trying to do as much to satisfy their liberal base that they possibly can in the four years that they have brandon joe biden's people have tried to make a big deal the fact that he's not been to the border uh as as it not mattering and that he had been to the border at el paso back when he was running for president i think in 2008 or whatever they tried to say why does it matter for the president based on the people that you represent to come to the border and see for himself what is happening there as much as i hated the Haitian crisis as much as i hated seeing um how much stress uh my fellow agents were under in in that particular stretch of border um it was great that the american public got the visual it was great that they got to see what is actually happening on the border you know we had at the at the top number we had about 14 000 people under that bridge um but we're arresting between five and seven thousand people every single day every single day we're arresting more than a caravan every single day and unless you come down here and actually see it you will not get uh you you will not understand the full magnitude of what's taking place if you don't go into the process because i i look back in uh in in 2019 when uh when vice president pence went to mccallen he went into the processing centers he saw how bad it was and it was like night and day the changes that they made um and so if you do not come down and actually see for yourself what is going on it's just like defining the the issue if you don't see it if you don't define it you're never going to come up with the solution and that's the problem and let's be clear um yo biden didn't come to the border he drove through el paso um you know it's it's a it's a far cry to drive through a border city to and then actually going out on the border looking at uh seeing whether or not we have the resources that are necessary seeing all of the different things um aspect on the border all he did was drove through el paso he's never been to the border Brandon just want to know before we let you get back to speaking for the minimum of border patrol how's their morale how are they feeling about the mission and what they're being asked to do day in and day out so 24 years i've been doing this job um i i've never seen the morale lower than than what it is today um you know we we put on the uniform all law enforcement this this goes for law enforcement across the nation i don't care if it's a department of public safety your your local police officers your county uh sheriffs every law enforcement officer they put on that uniform because they want to do a job and protect the american public we care about the american public but when you put that uniform on and you know that all you have is is people that are trying to defund the police um not not putting policies in place to take care of the smashing grass um not doing anything to actually secure the border you really wonder why why is it um that i continue doing and you know thank goodness thank goodness to my fellow agents for having that dedication and even in the face of what is taking place right now they still every day put on that uniform go out do the best that they can to protect the american public that's what drives them brand and jud president of the national border patrol council brand and really appreciate you coming by talk to you again soon thanks you guys have good clay i got some breaking news for you real quick buddy can i throw it out there we'll we'll have you tackle this one

with us we roll through the tuesday edition of the program encourage you to download the podcast make sure you don't miss a minute give us five stars double go read the reviews if you make double after you may find yourself being read alive on the program this kind of makes me laugh because it's absurdly ridiculous and unfortunately it is where these policies on gender being a choice lead us particularly in the world of sports there is right now a university of pennsylvania swimmer and i touched on this a little bit on friday but then this swimmer went and performed in a meet over the weekend and set all sorts of new crazy records so at the university of pennsylvania there was a male swimmer who was on the team for three years and was really good buck like an all ivy league caliber male swimmer then this swimmer decides to identify as a woman gets estridge and treatments or whatever it is to fulfill in c double a rules for a year and now is competing on the university of pennsylvania women's team this is not a made up story this is not an onion headline this is not uh some sort of crazy outlandish this can't be true story this is really going on in the ivy league three years a male swimmer at an elite level for an ivy league school university of pennsylvania decides to change gender now swimming as a woman and buck over the weekend won the 1650 by 38 seconds this man did who is now swimming as a woman by 38 seconds and then also in a 500 meter race won by nearly 15 seconds on pace for all time records in in c double a races this u Penn swimmer a man who identifies as a woman now this is an interesting part of this story buck we have written about this at out kick the website that i run a voice for sanity in the world of sports very often out kick dot com you can check it out after we wrote about it at out kick and after this story was widely shared on the internet over the weekend and early part of this week several different swimming coaches and also several different swimmers in the world of women's swimming have reached out they are terrified to use their actual names because of being called transphobic but they are saying what i think many of you listening right now are saying this represents the destruction of women's sports you have all of these women biological women who have trained their entire lives to compete at a high level and suddenly a biological man is crushing them and they're afraid to speak out your thoughts buck sexton well this is this is interesting because you know i've been uh doing talk radio now conservative talk radio for ten years and i remember a decade ago uh talking about how it was just a matter of time early on the lgbtq trans movement right yes it was just a matter of time before you would have the bathroom policies the athletes competing against you know the people of of different genders um i even said what about uh mixed martial arts fighters and then there was a mixed martial arts fighter who was biologically male and who was just destroying i mean it was horrifying a lot it was not even close when this former male mma fighter is fighting women right in the ring the things oh and then also in prisons now increasingly there's a movement to take trans you know trans uh females who are biological males and put them in women's prisons or women whole women you know women's uh uh jail facilities and all the things that clay we brought up to say this is the logical terminus of the left insanity this is where it's going they said your fear mongering no one's going to do that that will never happen is that but when you understand the nature of the left's argument you know that of course that's where it's going so this is where we are now this is essentially the eradication of women's achievement in sports before our very eyes people who have spent countless hours uh blood sweat and tears trying to be the best they can at their sport what's what's even the point now you have to wonder how long before all of the women's records in different sports at the nc double a level and even at the professional level are held by biological males it's not very long before that's going to happen at the current rate and and so that's one big part of it and the other part of for me is i just think it's so interesting that you know there was this moment in time where people would still refuse we are all now using the language of the left on this and i find that i find that very troublesome what i mean is you know you turn on you know news channels and everyone's saying she now i believe you know my first name is james in case i don't know my middle name is buckman and i'm i've been called bucks and some baby my point being on that you know your name is whatever you want it to be right if somebody wants to be called you know if they change their name to darth vader legally i'm gonna call them darth vader whatever your name is i'll call you right gender is a biological reality and part of the movement of the lgbtq the effort has been and what the left has wanted is for people to really be a party to ally here i mean to the point where even the new york times which is a left-wing rag but the new york times has had to have discussions internally about whether the plural usage they for individuals even if it seems nice is just so grammatically problematic because you're not multiple people so it's confusing to the reader we are now in a point where it's gone so far that clay everyone i see in the news this is a male this is a male we can say a transgender female if you want it is not a female this is a biological male and we're all saying she and she's doing this and all the why i mean i i'm i don't think that i don't think that pronoun is an issue of preference i think that pronoun is is an issue of biological reality and we're making a concession i mean this is all over the place by the way i'm sure i've done it to even unwittingly the same way that occasionally you know you'll say wait the undocumented oh my gosh i don't want to say undocumented because it's everywhere now my big thing is just you can't allow this to happen and i've been on this for years as well and it's so clear that men are bigger stronger and faster than women this is why we divided men's and women's sports hundreds of years ago because if men competed against women and we had a unisex competition women would never win anything and that's not me trying to demean all female athletes i love athletics period but if we just had basketball and we didn't have men's and women's basketball no woman would mostly ever even make a high school basketball team clay clay that the best men's 16 year old soccer team annihilated the women's national olympic team annihilated them it was a joke there would be no women's soccer there would be no women's tennis there would be no women's track and field at the olympics there would only be male medalist pretty much there might be some woman who is a great ice skating shooter ice skating you know i think it depends on how you would define ice skating right because they have women's ice skating male ice skaters are really good to my understanding too hey right actually maybe the artist you know would push them over the top maybe the artistry but i think i mean my want my wife was a was a gymnast but men are able to jump bigger higher faster in terms of doing all of the things that women do as well even in gymnastics so my point here is if you are going to allow biological men to compete against women then you are destroying the entire fabric of women's athletics so buck what i find to be most disappointing about this entire process is almost no one is willing to have this conversation and all these female swimmers who are getting crushed by this biological man who has decided to identify as a woman almost all of them are terrified to even speak out the coaches are afraid they'll lose their jobs the women who are 19 2021 years old are afraid that they'll never be able to get a job because they'll get branded as transphobic if they speak out which now for folks i know this might sound crazy but in the more liberal corridors of the country to be transphobic is right alongside being racist with you are and untouchable that's right you are someone who cannot it is a liability to even have you around certainly as part of a corporation certainly as part of um as part of a workforce so yeah if you're an ivy league swimmer and you're looking to get that job and you know goldman sacks or some hedge fund or some law firm or whatever transphobic is the that's the end it's a kiss of death that's the end of it for you yeah and so how do you how do you reconcile this i think it's such a big conversation because it's spreading down to the high school ranks and some people say well this is not a big deal because women also compete against men yeah but they never win women who decide to change and become men and compete against male athletes they don't destroy accomplishments that they get annihilated and then they don't want to play the sport anymore against the men this is destroying women's achievement what's amazing is that the feminists are quiet on this because the feminists are actually just left as trying to under under uh or rather kick at the load bearing walls of american civilization that's a quick way of putting it but kalay i think this only goes away when uh enough people are so sickened by it and just find it to be so detestable that there's a public outcry against it but i think we're a long way away you're gonna have to have a lot of women's records destroyed and there'll have to be a movement to say you know sorry we're gonna take the names off the trophies for the best women's you know 500 meter 800 meter whatever that are actually men we're gonna we're not going to allow this we're gonna and that's years away i think because people are so look at what we see all the country there's so much conformity everyone just carrying around the little propaganda machines of their phone in their pocket all the time and they're also scared of their friends that ever so terrified of being told that they're not a part of the smart cool herd unfortunately i think that's true and man i don't know how it's gonna end i think the women's athletics is going to be under a fundamental at an existential assault before this comes to a real head uh michael indell he's the inventor of my pillow his team finished for our pillows we got them all throughout
