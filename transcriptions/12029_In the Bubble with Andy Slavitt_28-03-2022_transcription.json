ColaGuard is available by prescription only. Lemonata Welcome to In The Bubble. This is your host Andy Slavitt. It is Monday, March 28th. We have an extremely powerful show. I want you to stop and think about the question of what do you do when you see a bully? I know that as a kid, I didn't always act as I should as ways that would have made me as proud of myself as I would like to be. When you're unsure of yourself and your own standing, you don't want to call yourself out to the bullies, lest you become the next victim. And so many of us want to fight bullies in only the safest way is possible. And I suspect that many of us have some experience with bullying of some sort, either being bullied, or self, as kids, or as adults. Seeing a bully and feeling helpless around them, maybe having our kids bullied, which is a really helpless feeling. Maybe you even have a painful memory of at one time bullying somebody that you regret. It's not something that adults we think about as frequently, but I will tell you it is one thing now that gets my blood boiling. Is this whole idea of seeing someone bullied? Hey, I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bunk. Oh, hey, Beth. Hey, guys. How are you doing? You got my homework finished, McFly. Well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday, hello, hello, anybody home? Hey, think with fly thing. You know, bullies have their power for making you feel helpless, self-conscious, unsupported. And basically that someone has basically taken over the proper rules of civility and society and bringing their own form of lawless justice. And so you, you wonder, kind of where are the authorities? Where's something going to step in and see this wrong that's happening? But what if that bully is society itself? What if that bully is the state government that you live in? What if they're bullying you? Major outrage in Texas today after the state attorney general Ken Paxton likened kids getting gender-affirming medical care to child abuse. Paxton says medical care such as puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and gender-affirming surgery must be stopped, adding that he'll do everything he can to, quote, protect against those who take advantage of and harm young Texans. Now, Texas Governor Greg Abbott taking it a step further by ordering state agencies to investigate any reported instances of what he's calling abuse. So what do you do when you're in a state, as in Texas right now or Florida, which is mixing together, frankly, I'm just going to call it as I see it, a brew of ignorance, politics, and hate, and points them at our own children. And so I get off the phone and I like run down the hall and I found my assistant and I just threw myself in her arms and I mean she's tiny, you know, she was physically holding me up and she said, what's wrong? And I said, it's finally happening. I said CPS is on their way and they're going to take my babies away from me and I'm so scared. And she held me tighter and she started crying too. And then I just fell to the floor. I just collapsed. All right. So we're going to get into this topic today with Dr. Rachel Levine. Rachel was the Secretary of Health in Pennsylvania. She led the pandemic response there by all accounts to rave reviews, which is hard to do in this pandemic. She is a pediatrician and is now the assistant secretary for health. Essentially, the person in the government whose portfolio is the health of the nation, our health. We're going to begin by talking about our nation's health, quickly honing in on how we define it. You might have thought that the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, played that role. This is actually the Surgeon General's boss. Rachel is also the first transgender Senate confirmed official in our history. Rachel is also the first four star officer in the US government who's transgender. Now, you'll hear in this conversation, Rachel isn't going to shy away from being a symbol to transgender youth and to the LGBTQ plus community. And you will hear that. But she plays a far more expansive role. And part of that role is systematically standing up to the bullies of all types. With a force and if that bullying is misinformation, if that bullying is something which is not consistent with what's good for the health of all of us measured in physical, mental, other tolls, Rachel is clearly and systematically and forcefully calling this out. This is a show about clinical and social and very reasonable thinking as it stands up against basically someone who is spewing hate and using politics and demagoguery. And it's a very hard tricky thing to do to stand up to a bully like Paxon. And we talk about like the best methods for doing it and how do you get there emotionally, etc. But the thing that is most profound about this conversation is when Rachel says, look, in many respects, we all have a choice. We can either be the bully or the evidence shows that when it comes to a kid, particularly an LGBTQ plus kid, all they need as a starter is one caring adult. One caring adult who recognizes them, who understands them, who appreciates them, and who supports them. That one caring adult makes a massive difference, not conceptually, but by research, by clinical evidence, you and me as a caring adult actually are a silver bullet in some kid's life. So when we choose not to be that caring adult, but we choose to, I don't know, other people or make them less than human, make them doubt who they are, make them doubt their choices. And they're a kid who are still fully forming their identity. That's a really bad choice. And it leads to really bad consequences. It leads to really bad consequences. And we're going to talk in this episode about some of those consequences. We're going to talk about how that can sometimes lead to suicide. So if that's a topic that you'd rather not hear about, I get it. I just want you to be aware. It's not, I don't believe we touch on it in any kind of irresponsible way. In fact, I'm pretty confident of that. But I just want you to be aware of that going in. And look, if you are a parent of a kid who has been bullied or is being bullied, look at what Rachel Levine has become. Look at this role model, listen to this person. And if you think appropriate, have your children listen to this very inspiring woman, this role model is four star admiral who is serving the country and is the antidote to the Paxans, the Abbots, the Santas, the world, those who would use politics and ignorance and hate to victimize kids. That's what the show's about today. It is one I hope you enjoy as one I hope you get something out of is when I really, a conversation I really loved. Well, thank you for joining. My pleasure. I'm very pleased to be here. You are the Assistant Secretary for Health for the Nation. Tell us a little something about the health of the nation. And how do you define it? How do you measure it? I mean, longevity, inequality, crime, the level of tolerance, violence, bullying, the state of our public dialogue. How do you think about the state of our nation's health? Well, there are many measures that we can use to evaluate the state of our nation's health. And I think that it's important, of course, to have a holistic view of health. So that would include physical health, but as well as mental health. And I think that we are continuing to have significant challenges. Of course, we're having challenges with COVID-19. Although we're doing much better right now, we're having decreasing case counts and decreasing number of hospitalizations and deaths. But the mental health challenges that we're seeing in our nation are significant. And the President highlighted that during his state of the union address. So, and you alluded to health equity. Health equity is a very important measure of the state of our health of our nation. So we have lots of challenges ahead of us. So with all of those issues, how do you pick your priorities? Because you can't solve them all. And yet it feels like I get the same sense that you do that we have a set of challenges that they're not superficial challenges. And many of them feel structural and deep and complex. And we talked about the origins of the mental health crisis. We could probably go on for a long, long time. We talked about the origins of inequality and violence and the lack of tolerance and all the things that I think prevent us all as many of us as possible from living as long and healthy and fulfilled life as possible. It would be really complex. Where do you start and how do you decide which issues are the most important ones for you to focus on? Sure. Well, there are a number of answers to that question. Of course, my priorities as the Assistant Secretary for Health will align with Secretary Becerra's priorities. And that aligns with the White House priorities. And I think that we really need to deal with the challenges that are right in front of us. So that remains COVID-19. Again, we have made so much progress in the last year in terms of our safe and effective immunizations, in terms of expanded testing capability, in terms of the therapeutics. And it's very comforting that the numbers are going down. But we have to be prepared for challenges in the future, especially if we start to see new variants that might significantly impact our nation and the world. But mental health has really risen to one of the biggest challenges that we face. And the President again highlighted that during the State of the Union. And Secretary Becerra and I and many others in HHS are going on the road talking about the mental health challenges that face us. And that includes our youth. And Vice Admiral Murthy, our Surgeon General highlighted that with an advisory last year. And I have gone now on several different trips. One with the second gentleman, one with the Secretary. And then we just recently came back from Seattle and visiting Seattle Children's Hospital, talking about youth mental health difficulties, as well as a federally qualified health center. So we have challenges with our youth that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic that we have to address. And of course, there's overdoses. We've seen more overdoses now than we saw previously due to synthetic fentanyl compounds, as well as other synthetic compounds such as methamphetamine. So those challenges are right there before us. And we're going to work together across HHS and the administration to address them. So I think if parents are listening to this, and a lot of parents are, and whether they have kids that have either, either, it's a very mental illness or depression or anxiety or addiction challenges. The thing that we hear the most, and I'm sure you do as well, is they don't know where to start. They don't know how to enter the system in a way that helps them. And my view is that the stigma that's the most harmful type of stigma is self-stigma, when kids who feel like, I can't be treated because there's something wrong with me. And that deepens the mental health challenges. And so I feel like these are the things that are occurring in society for whatever reason they're occurring. But our inability to address them just magnifies the problem. Because we don't have, you know, there's no logical front door for most parents. If you go to the average emergency room, you won't find a mental health specialist. If you go to the average school, you won't find a mental health counselor of any sort. So are there big structural things we can do? So you are correct. I mean, we have, we face mental health challenges with youth before the pandemic. And in my field in academic medicine, before I entered public service, I was at the Penn State College of Medicine and Pediatrics and adolescent medicine. And what I did is see troubled young people, troubled teens and young adults with eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, as well as related other behavioral health challenges, such as depression and anxiety and others. But they have all been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The challenges of social isolation, the challenges of not being in school, of learning loss, so many different challenges that our youth have faced and our families have faced over the last two years is that those youth mental health challenges have gotten worse. And so we are working at HHS across the different divisions to make this better. So I'm very pleased to co-chair the Health Disparities Council with Assistant Secretary Delphin Rittman, my colleague at SAMHSA. And we have different subcommittees. And one of them specifically is about youth mental health. There's another on workforce, another on that integration between physical health and mental health at all different levels. And so we are working to create those open doors that you've been discussing. For a parent right now, I think a good place to start would be their pediatrician or their family physician. If they have one. If they have one, but most people do, if they don't, then potentially a community health center or every county has a mental health office. And so that would be another place to start. And so every county in the United States has a mental health office that they can contact if they and often with hotlines that they can contact. And of course, Assistant Secretary Delphin Rittman is working for SAMHSA to put out the 988 suicide hotline nationally later on this year. So we are working on more resources. Do you want to spend a second on 988? Because it's a great thing that the President announced during the State of Union address. And I'm not sure if everyone caught it. Sure. So we are working on a three digit national hotline for suicide. And this would be for youth. This would be for adults. This would be for seniors that people can call and they will be directed to local resources to help them. So it's going to be sort of nationally run but locally implemented. And it's quite a task that Dr. Delphin Rittman is working on. But they're up to that challenge. And I think it's going to be really successful. Also, you know, for teens, teens don't often call now. That's for people like you and me, Andy. And so they text. What's calling? What does that mean? What does that mean? For you to talk to a teenager. So they text, they might be online and do chats or things. So they're going to have to they're going to build in text lines as well that that young people might access and be able to get support and help at their local level. So it is a tremendous effort and a national program. And I think it's going to be a real service to our nation for people in pain, people that are suffering that they'll be able to reach out and get help. Yeah, it's great. And it's simple. And this front door, I think, giving people an entry point will hopefully allow people to act more quickly and more reasonably and not feel that sense of stigma. This message is sponsored by ColaGuard. Hi, I'm Kate Bowler and you might know me from another Lemonade on media show called Everything Happens. If you listen to my show, you know that a lot of it is inspired by my experience with colon cancer. So of course, increasing awareness around colon cancer screening is really important to me. In case you didn't know, you should start screening at 45. And a great at-home option to screen for colon cancer is with ColaGuard. ColaGuard is the only FDA approved noninvasive screening test that looks for both altered DNA and blood in your stool. You can use this test on your own time at home with none of the prep that's required for a standard colonoscopy. ColaGuard offers control of your colon cancer screening by screening how you want and when you want. In addition to the convenience and ease of use, it's also affordable. Most insured patients pay zero dollars. I really admire what ColaGuard is doing, creating an easy to use and accessible way for people to get screened. So if you're 45 or older and at average risk, ask your health care provider about screening for colon cancer with ColaGuard.

I want to jump into an area that is hot right now and it's a hot place where politics and what's best clinically are running right smack into each other and that's the idea of gender affirming care. So first of all, I think you've got some expertise here. You're a pediatrician. You're the country senior public health officer. You also happen to be transgender. You might be considered to have some expertise. First of all, maybe, and I should say that the Attorney General of Texas has labeled gender affirming care as child abuse. I'm not inserting words in his mouth. That's what General Paxton said. The governor is called for parents to be quote turned in for allowing it. First of all, can you just inform us what gender affirming care actually is? Sure. So, you know, we see young people who are transgender or gender diverse and you are correct. I do have expertise in this area in my field of pediatrics and specifically adolescent medicine and I've been involved in academic medicine at Mount Sinai and then Penn State for most of my career and actually saw children, teens, and young adults for gender affirming care. And there are standards of care to assess trans and gender diverse youth. They are established by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, WPath. There's a US arm called US Path and there are standards of care. The last edition was in 2011 and this is going to be a new edition published in 2022, updating those standards of care. And then there are medical articles based upon that. So, this is a medical field. There is research done on that. There's evidence based that inform these standards of care. And then much of the care for youth is provided at, for example, our expert children's hospital. So, I've been able to visit some of those clinics and at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. I visited a great clinic in Seattle Children's Hospital in Seattle yesterday. I know there's a great clinic at Children's Hospital Philadelphia, DC Children's. And so, it involves a multidisciplinary team with psychologists to help the young person and their family and then medical care to implement these standards of care for gender affirmation. It is by no means child abuse. And any insinuation that it is child abuse really is very politically motivated and is egregious. This is provided by experts either at LGBTQ health centers or Children's hospitals. And it's very carefully done to support and affirm and empower the young person and their family. So, you know, one of the things that I find interesting in being in healthcare as long as I have, and I'm probably older than you. No, you're actually a little bit older than me. I think I'm older than you. I think you win. I think you win. You definitely win in the wisdom front window. You're still going to be out about that. But one thing that I've kind of what I've learned in healthcare and whether the issue is you think about how all the clinical and social pieces interact is we all want silver bullets and there's no silver bullet for most anything. So, something really interested me and I think that somewhat related to this topic and I'm wondering if you can comment on it. Suicidality among teens is obviously a very high and a very high level. It's a very big problem. Among LGBTQ plus kids, it's even higher. And among trans kids, it's even higher still, really startling and sad numbers. So, it does turn out, however, that there is one simple intervention that research shows dramatically reduces suicides in this population. And the reason I talk about silver bullets is because I never, ever find, well, there's one thing that actually helps. And that one thing, according to the research that I've seen, is that if you call people by their correct pronoun and name, it has a significant impact on their mental health and reduces suicides, that that one simple act is for people in their lives, that adult in their lives, recognizing who someone is, makes a transformative difference. Is that evidence you've seen as well? Yes. So, for trans youth and gender diverse youth, the ability to talk to somebody, to ability to be who they are and to be affirmed is that really can be quite powerful in terms of helping them with some of the challenges that they face. So, I want to point out, so you are entirely correct, is that, yes, suicidality, suicidal thoughts and attempts are significant problems among youth. And we had just talked about the new 988 hotline, which can be used by text as well. And we do need to work on improving the healthcare services for youth and the workforce for that as well. But LGBTQI plus youth, do have increased risks of mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety and suicidal thoughts and behavior. But I want to emphasize, there's nothing inherent with being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, et cetera, plus that would predispose somebody towards those mental health issues. It is the bullying that young people face. Exactly. It is the harassment. It is the discrimination and intolerance that they face. And they may face that at home or they may face it in their school or their community. Or even, the type of statements and bills that we hear in different states that predisposes them, that triggers those thoughts and feelings. So, that is why it's so important to infer them and to empower them. The last word I'd like to say is that in addition to what you talked about, actually one supportive adult, one supportive adult, you know, hopefully a parent, but it might not be a parent. It might be a teacher. It might be a, someone else at school, it might be a faith leader, it might be a neighbor or a friend or another relative. But one supportive adult can make all the difference in terms of those mental health issues, which is why the quote unquote don't say gay bill in Florida is so challenging. Because not infrequently, that might be a teacher or school person now who is that one person that supports that young person that can make all the difference for their behavioral and mental health. And so, we all need to work together to, again, empower these vulnerable young people not to limit their access to sports or other activities, not to limit their access to affirming care, and not limit their ability to talk to the teachers. So, you're making exactly the right point, I think, which is, there's plenty of hard stuff in this world that happens to us because life can be hard. But these are things we're doing to each other. Bullying people, making them feel excluded. When you, when you, when every one of us, I just remind me how every one of us has the option to be that one caring adult, any one of us, if I hear you correctly. That is exactly correct. And so, it's a choice we're making. And I just think about how punishing it must be to have political dialogue about it around and over you, your kid in, in Florida, here in Texas, or even if you're whatever state you're in. The fact that there is a state in your country doing this, that it's just got to be maddening. And I, and I know that we can all imagine a day, generations from now, when that's so long, or the case, that the fight is being fought now, so that people in future generations don't have to live with that. But we also see the impacts of people around us, and we can, we can see it measurably in, in harming people's lives. I've listened to you, Anne-Murl, and you've remained very calm, clear, talk about academic studies, not taking the bait, not getting angry, not yelling, not getting on cable TV, and, and, and screaming about this. How do you do that? At one level, I think, I so admire that response, that another one will, I wonder, like, how the hell do you keep from losing your mind? Well, well, thank you very much. I mean, I think that there are two techniques that I have learned over the years. One is the ability to compartmentalize. And so as a clinician, you know, in my pediatric training, and in my work in pediatric and children's hospitals, I mean, we see very ill children, and young people, and you have to be able to compartmentalize your feelings and to be able to do your work as a physician. And so I have developed the ability to do that. The other is that I've developed the ability to supplement, meaning I take those feelings and I put it into my work, which is to help people. And so that's what I felt most gratified about my career. Again, first in academic medicine and pediatrics and adolescent medicine to help young people and their families and to teach students how to help people and do clinical research and develop programs to help people. And that's what I feel so gratified about my role in public service and public health is first in Pennsylvania, and now nationally to help people with that broader public health perspective, with that broader brush, with all of the different challenges that we've been discussing. So, I feel a level of personal ass animosity to someone like Paxton when he makes a statement like this, because I feel like he's hurting people. I just emotionally, I feel it. I also probably feel like that's not the right public reaction for me to have. And as I've listened to some of the things you've said, I think you've gone out of your way to be incredibly civil in this conversation, and it must be exhausting to take on all people who is about prejudice, yet it must be exhausting to not have a strategy. And I think your talent voice, I think, makes more people listen and understand. And I suppose that's why you do it, but I can't imagine it's easy. So, I think that's a really important point, is that I think sometimes many of these feelings come from a position of fear, is that people fear what they don't understand, what is beyond their experience. And fear can lead to a lot of negative emotions. And so, I think that for many people, these issues of potentially sexual orientation or certainly gender identity are just beyond their experience, or they think it's beyond their experience. And so, people fear what they don't understand. So, my job and my goal is to educate them, to be that calm voice, talking about these complex issues, so that they can fear less and learn more, and then develop that sense of tolerance and acceptance. Now, I understand that many of these issues are politically motivated, and I can't change that. So, I'm going to stay calm and focused and to continue my work to support the public health of the nation. And that's what I'm going to continue to do, and I'm going to stay laser focused on that mission. Every day, hundreds of Americans die from addiction, but it is a treatable disease.

Hey there, it's Mary Harris, and I host Slate's Daily News podcast, What Next. It's a show I made because I was grappling with this question. Why is the news everywhere, and I have no idea what to pay attention to? My Daily Short podcast is here to help you make sense of things, from flushing out new angles to uncovering stories that have largely gone unreported. When the news feels overwhelming, I'm here to help you answer What Next. So, subscribe, wherever you're listening, right now. You make me wonder something else about how you do your job and how you go through life. You get a lot of really incredible recognition, well deserved. All you have to do is read an article about you, and you know people know you're the first transgender person ever confirmed by the US Senate. There will be many more, but there will only be one first. You're the first transgender four four star officer as the Admiral of the Commission Corps. That's another first. Is being the first of something exhausting? Is it tiring? Do you get treated like a symbol sometimes? Do you feel like you're too closely, you're so closely watched or expected to behave as this person, as opposed to just allowing who you are, like all of us, to inform, but not define your agenda. Not really. I mean, I am honored to have had these privileges. I am honored to have these opportunities. And so with the opportunities I had in Pennsylvania, and now the opportunities that I've had as the Assistant Secretary for Health and as the Admiral and the Public Health Service Commission Corps, my goal is to give back. My goal is to give back and support the LGBTQI plus community. And my goal is to support medical issues and public health issues nationally and to help people. That is always what has driven me, and that is what continues to motivate me. One of the other things that's interesting in your perspective is that you've had both a state role and a federal role. And there are a lot of places in the pandemic where I think people have understandable levels of confusion when they hear something from the CDC and then over the course of the last several administrations, states have been, some states have very much been known on their own page. Either of Florida saying, hey, we're going to do it this way and not your way or vice versa when you get the federal government in the last administration who was saying, hey, it's all up to the states. So we've got this sort of, I think two things going on. One is federalism and the other is regionalism. And you're in a perfect person to kind of help discuss, I think this here, like on the one hand, federal regionalism makes a lot of sense in public health. If there is a outbreak in Tennessee and you're sitting in Washington state or Oregon, you shouldn't, you shouldn't be under the same kind of concerns and restrictions as people in Tennessee. We live in a large geographic country. That certainly makes sense. There's a federalism component here though, which I think is really interesting and really tricky, which is that the ability to fight a pandemic, whether it's something like this or something like Ebola, at some level requires a national level of effort. And because of political views, constitution, whatever, we're not as able to mount one federal response. Again, allowing for regional differences, I think is a different matter. But the sort of the structure of government means that a federal government sometimes can't say, we can only protect people in New York, we can't protect people in Ohio. So can you think through it or reflect on how the state federal public health infrastructure should be working together? Sure. So, you know, I mentioned that one of the lessons of the pandemic is that we're all interconnected. The second is the lesson of the pandemic is the profound importance of public health. So we tend to focus on medical issues and health system and health care issues, but it really has focused the critical importance of public health. And it works best when local public health officials, state public health officials, and federal public health officials are working together when we collaborate, when we coordinate and we communicate. And so that is our goal. That is our goal in the administration is to all work together to make sure that the different policies and procedures that we have both have a national perspective, but also can be implemented at the local level and have the ability to have local and statewide variation exactly as you had talked about. Most of the time, we don't need as much of a national perspective in terms of, say, infectious illnesses. We do for flu, but nothing has been like the COVID-19 pandemic. I mean, the world has not seen anything like the COVID-19 pandemic in 102 years. And so it has really challenged public health. And so we need sustainable funding for infrastructure, for IT and data capabilities. We need sustainable funding to increase and maintain our public health workforce. But we need to all work together. So, you know, I do have that perspective. I was the Secretary of Health of Pennsylvania, and I was the President of ASTO, which is the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. And now I'm in this role from a different perspective, but I speak with state and local health officials every week. What looks different at the federal level that folks in the state didn't understand? And I'm going to ask you the reverse question. But if you sit here, what is it that when states look to the federal government, they miss or they don't see about the challenges there? Sure. Well, one of the big differences is when I was the Secretary of Health of Pennsylvania, I would focus in on Pennsylvania. So I would have this national perspective about what's going on in the rest of the country, but my responsibility was Pennsylvania. And so I would focus in on the number of cases in Pennsylvania. I would focus in on the number of hospitalizations, the number of deaths. And, you know, we would look regionally and we would talk with other state health officials in our region. And we would have national calls, but my focus was different. And then when I took this position, I had to draw back and not just look at Pennsylvania, but to look at all the regions and to look at the national and even international perspective in terms of COVID-19 from all of those parameters. I think that in Pennsylvania, we would focus on Pennsylvania data. And, you know, we would share data, but sometimes we would be cautious about sharing data. From the national perspective, I need that data. From all the different states and the local health departments so that we can make those national recommendations. So it's a different perspective. I think all of them are valuable. That local perspective for local and big city health departments is critical. That perspective from the state is critical. And now the perspective from the federal government is and then I'd add the international perspective. Because this really is this is a global pandemic. And, you know, it really has always had global implications. I think it sounds like it makes sense when everyone can communicate and is willing to share. What do you do? And today, for example, when you have a surgeon in general, I believe it is in Florida who basically says, we don't think kids should get vaccinated. And I'm paraphrasing now. Can you pick up the phone and have a conversation and try to meet eye when you have those kind of policy differences? We can, but we can also, you know, be advocate through to the public. And I advocate with other public health officials, both in the federal government, but also those state and local health officials that we don't agree with that. That, you know, that we don't agree with that interpretation and that medical opinion. And we feel that immunizations for children is absolutely critical to protect them to and protect their families. We also, you know, work with other stakeholders. For example, you know, I have been a fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics for about 34 years. And I think we figured out with them that I have been a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics since medical school. So we are now talking 40 years. And the American Academy of Pediatrics really has almost all of the country's pediatricians, I believe about 60,000 or more pediatricians that are members and fellows. And, you know, they strongly feel that immunizations for children is extremely important for children's health and their family's health, as well as the American Academy of Families Physicians, as well as the Children's Hospital Association and other associations. So, you know, I think that that medical opinion that those immunizations aren't necessary is isolated. Well, I know you've got to get back to your busy agenda.

If you listen to my show, you know that a lot of it is inspired by my experience with colon cancer. So of course, increasing awareness around colon cancer screening is really important to me.
