    "text": " Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Hey, good morning everybody. I'm Dave Rubin. This is The Rubin Report. It's Monday, July 17th, 2023, we're live streaming on Rumble, locals and YouTube. We've got a post-game show as always at Rubin Report. You like that move then? However, that was a little Trumpian, wasn't it? On Friday, Tucker Carlson was part of an event with the Blaze and a couple other organizations and they did this political forum where Tucker went toe to toe with a bunch of the candidates and he ended a couple candidacies, I would say, and he also, well, I don't want to say boosted a couple but showed some of the goodness of some of the candidates. We're going to unpack all of that plus Trump was at a turning point event. It was a big, it was a big political three days so we're going to dive right back into all of that but first let's dive into Moinkbox because you good people know that 60% of US port production comes from one company owned by the Chinese and their hogs are given something called Raktapamine which is banned in 160 countries including China yet you find it in your grocery aisle every day. Well, there's a better way guys. I want to tell you about Moink which is Mo plus Oink. Moink delivers grass fed and grass finished beef and lamb, pastured pork and chicken and sustainable wild caught Alaskan salmon straight to your door. You choose the meat delivered in every box like rib eyes to chicken breasts to pork chops to salmon fillet is much more. Plus, you can cancel anytime. There's nothing better than cooking some filet mignon on my big green egg on a Friday evening. I did it this past weekend. Shark Tank host Kevin O'Leary called Moink's bacon the best bacon he's ever tasted and they guarantee you will say, Oink, Oink, I'm just so happy I got Moinked. Keep American farming going by signing up at moinkbox.com slash Ruben right now and listeners of this show get free ground beef for a year, a full calendar year. That's one of the best ground beef you'll ever taste but for a limited time and now back to me. So Tucker Carlson does this big event on Friday and I thought we would start the show with Tucker explaining a bit about how the whole day went and then we'll show you some stuff from the day itself. When you got up this morning, yeah, did you imagine that you would see not one but two presidential candidates light themselves on fire in front of you. When I got up this morning as every morning when I wake up, I don't imagine anything. I haven't had a drink in 21 years and every single morning I wake up hung over. I feel like I've had a cordy stoli and a six pack of some rotten beer. I just feel horrible in the morning. Every morning. And so I put my pants on a shuffle downstairs and got coffee and love. So I didn't think about it at all until I was seated across from a Scott who was the first and I really like, I mean I like them all. Politicians are super charming. They're good with people. That's why they're in this business. So I like all of them. But no, I do think that Republican voters or the system controlled by the Republican party doesn't ask a lot of a lot of its candidates. It's like enough to say certain to repeat certain bumper stickers from the 80s, piece to strength, lower taxes, whatever. I'm for all that by the way. But they don't like no one ever gets pushed very hard. Right. And so it doesn't take much. I was certainly not acting on a hostility. But if you're just like, well, what do you mean? Oh, you're so mean, really? You're trying to run my country. Yeah. And you know what I mean? Yeah. Okay, so the way the forum worked is that Tucker throughout the day, it was a it was a long day event with the family leadership summit and my good friends at the blaze who did a bang up job credit to Glenn and everybody over there. They did a really great job producing this thing. And he sat down with each one of these candidates. Not everybody showed up. Donald Trump, for example, did not show up. But the rest of them, most of the rest did. The ones that we at least believe will be on the debate stage on August 23rd. And he gave them a chance to talk. But what Tucker did, which was very clever, was really ask probing questions, not do the thing that they do on CNN, right? Not just tee it up. He asked them the right questions. So let's get to the first one. Oh, no, you know what, before we get to the first one, actually, I thought I'd frame the show because that was Tucker Post. Some of the things we're about to show you. So now we're going to show you a bunch of things. And I normally don't do this, but I thought I'm going to ask you guys two questions to have in mind as you're watching today's show. Because I think if you can answer these questions by the end of today's show, you'll have a little more of a direction in terms of who you might vote for come November of 24, which again is basically a year and a half from now. But number one is what they are saying in line with your political values. That's the obvious one, right? Like, do they say things that you basically believe in? Like, are those whether it's on abortion or taxes or foreign policy or whatever? Are those the things that you basically believe in? How do you order those things in the hierarchy of importance to you? Is abortion number one or taxes number one? Is the border number six? Like, whatever that is, just think about that as question number one. And question number two is, if so, if you find one of the people that we're about to show you, we're going to show you everybody, several clips from everybody. If you find the guy or gal that that you line up with the most, is there evidence to suggest that as president, they will actually succeed in cementing those values, those beliefs that you hold into both law and culture. Basically, do you think that they can do it? So those are the two questions that I posed to you as you watch today's show. So first, let's start with Mike Pence. Mike Pence went, I believe third of the day, but this was really like the wrecking ball moment of the entire conference. Tucker got into it with former VP Mike Pence over focusing on Ukraine rather than focusing on what's happening here right in the United States of America. Sorry, Mr. Vice President, have you? I know you're running for president. You are just, you are distressed that the Ukrainians don't have enough American tanks. Every city in the United States has become much worse over the past three years. Drive around. There's not one city that's gotten better in the United States and it's visible. Our economy has degraded. The suicide rate has jumped. Public filth and disorder and crime have exponentially increased and yet your concern is that the Ukrainians, a country most people can't find on a map who've received tens of billions of US tax dollars, don't have enough tanks. I think it's a fair question to ask like, where's the concern for the United States in that? It's not my concern. Tucker, I've heard that routine from you before, but that's not my concern. I'm running for president in the United States because I think this country's in a lot of trouble. It's not my concern. Now, I want to give the devil his due here. I want to be as bipartisan, nonpartisan as possible. When he's saying it's not my concern, like Tucker's saying, why don't you care about the cities of America? I don't think he's flat out saying if you listen to the extended answer, I don't care about the cities of America at all. What he got into was, I sort of care that America as a superpower can do a lot of things at once, but there is a tone deafness, unfortunately, with Mike Pence that I think that moment basically blew apart his campaign. I genuinely, and I don't think he's a bad dude. I really don't think he's a bad dude at all actually, and I hopefully will interview him. I don't know anyone that supports him. I have yet to meet anyone that says, I'm a Mike Pence guy. I don't know why he's getting in on this. They got further into the Ukraine thing, and it's like he's into this war. He's into giving them more weapons. Obviously, that's not Tucker's position. Now, Tucker's at least upfront about his position, which is contrary to say what someone on CNN might be doing when they're up there, right? If you've got Jake Tapper up there, they're not going to tell you what their position is, and they're going to ask you something, but frame it in a way that you'll sort of know it. Tucker doesn't hide what his isolationist position is on Ukraine and foreign policy in general, right? You may not agree with it. I don't fully agree with it. I do to a large extent, but it is what it is. Pence there just kind of blew himself up because he repeated this line over and over. That is not my concern. I don't care enough for the average American. Now, he may not have meant it, but that is the way it came off. Also, I would say about Pence just sort of, you know, part of this is based on personality, right? Like there's a cult of personality around Donald Trump. Pence comes off as sort of like the cartoon caricature, a Simpsons 1994, season five Simpsons, when they would draw like the generic Republican. How would he look and behave? That pretty much is Mike Pence. So it was a bad day for Mike Pence. He got Buddha Bunch like he got owned repeatedly on Twitter. It was not pretty for him. But speaking of not pretty, Aza Hutchinson apparently is running for president. Again, if you don't know anyone that's supporting Mike Pence, you know negative people, negative six people that are supporting Aza Hutchinson. Except that blonde lady whose name I never know from the view, whatever her name is, that extra blonde that they toss in every now and again, she said she wishes the Republicans would nominate someone like Aza Hutchinson. Well, here's Tucker asking Aza Hutchinson about chemically castrating children. No, no, no, but you said that children should be able to choose their gender and their parents should be able to affirm that and the state has no role in getting involved. So how is that different? You're saying that a child shouldn't be able to choose a bathroom, but he can choose his sex. I don't understand. Let me finish. Okay. What I said, let me finish. Oh, I hope you won't mind. Oh, please do. And the finish is that I told Obama they were wrong. I said it publicly that the school districts can ignore that guidance. And so that's where I think this the government should not be pushing an agenda in our schools. And that's what I pose. And so I want the government to stay out. I want the parents and communities and our faith to guide us through these difficult decisions. And I will stop with this, but you have repeatedly described delaying a child's natural progression from childhood to adulthood throughout adolescence. You'd describe that as quote treatment. And so that raises the, I mean, clearly you've answered question. You believe it's treatment. You believe, I suppose that people can change their sex. Because if you don't believe that, you wouldn't call a treatment, would you? Well, the God created two genders. And that's what I have stated. Okay. I don't know that I need to do much analysis on this one. There really was no campaign. The guy's not really running. I don't know why they put him on that stage. Yes, God did only create two genders. You cannot magically become a woman. If you chop off your penis, it's not how it works. The fact that he's so unclear on this stuff when it comes to children, especially and the chemical castration stuff and the drugs and all of it, like he basically, Tucker, Tucker just ended something that didn't even exist. It wasn't even necessary, but Tucker did it. And then as if that wasn't the kill shot, and then it was, it was the kill shot. Asa Hutchinson was just laying there as just like, like a puddle of nothingness. Then they got into it about vaccines. And Tucker actually came out with a shocker here. Watch this. One of the powers that government did usurp over the past several years is the right to decide what medicine you take in the form of COVID mandates. How did you feel about that? And how many COVID shots did you take? And how do you feel about it now? In retrospect. How many COVID shots did you take? Zero. But I think it's fair and I can see that you were spoiled when I asked you that question. I don't think, honestly, you should be asking people about their medical care, but that became a matter of public policy. And I do think that the whole country ought to pause and assess like, what did we just go through? How do we feel about it now? And so it's a very straightforward question. All right. So this is pretty powerful. Asa Hutchinson aside, Tucker, just for the first time announced that he never took any COVID shots. Now what's interesting about that is Tucker was on air. Obviously throughout COVID, Fox had all of their regulations related to COVID. Tucker was obviously doing his show from home or remote studios throughout a lot of it. They were forcing employees to be vaccinated. It's interesting to me and I would love to know from Tucker. And hopefully I'll get to talk to him about it at some point why he didn't say that earlier. You know, it's interesting. Everyone has their own, first off, your private personal medical information is not anyone else's business as a general rule. You guys may remember at the height of COVID when I was on Fox LA TV with civil rights lawyer Gloria Allred. And she asked me if I was back then I asked her when the last time she got laid was like it's nobody's business these things. So I was a little surprised that Tucker asked the question, but so be it. Hutchinson just walked right into it. I would like to know from Tucker personally what his calculation was on not saying it while he was at Fox. Everyone has their own calculations. I have my own calculations. When we were living in LA, if you remember the Rubin report back then as frustrated I was with COVID and mandates and everything else. I never fully said I was not vaxxed until we got to Florida because I did not want to risk getting arrested or God knows what if I had shown up to a restaurant with a fake passport or whatever stupid thing they were doing of the day. So I it was fairly obvious. I think if you were watching the show and playing along with some contextual clues that I was not vaxxed. But I again, I did not fully openly announce it until we moved to Florida in December of twenty one. Anyway, that's just like a little bit of a sidebar there. But you could feel what's interesting to me is the audience's reaction to that. The audience basically explodes in applause when Tucker says he's not vaxxed and that will be an interesting thing that I think Donald Trump is going to have to continue to dance with and figure out how to make his moves around because he did warp speed. Obviously Tucker seems to own the base as much as Trump does and there is going to be some tension around that. But okay, let's move on because Hutchinson, I think Phoenix, can we make a note? Hutchinson, we're never mentioning him again on the show. Right? Like what's the point? Okay, Hutchinson, out of the way. Next up was Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina. You guys know I think Tim Scott is a good decent man. I've interviewed him on the show. We have tried actually to get him on the show since he announced president and his people got back to us and basically said, well, we know you support the Santas so it doesn't look like we can do it. Which, whatever is what it is. Again, I'm being honest about my opinions. He's going on plenty of other shows where they're just hiding their opinions. But so be it. I'd be happy to have him on any time again is what it is. Here is Tucker Carlson and Tim Scott going at it over Russia and Mexico. Here's, I'm just interested because all measures are relative. So Russia's bad, Russia's a threat, Putin's evil, got it. But the total body count from Russia in the United States is right around zero. Like, I don't know anyone who's been killed by Russia. I know people personally who've been killed by Mexico. The government of Mexico allows fentanyl to be made in its country and to come over our border. Yes. Remittances from Mexico are a huge part of their economy. The Mexican government is party to the murder of hundreds of thousands of Americans. So why is Mexico less of a threat than Russia? Well, two things. I think we can walk and chew gum at the same time. Okay, good. Frankly, here's, here's, no Americans killed by Russia. Hundreds of thousands killed by Mexico, but Mexico's our ally and Russia's our enemy. How does that work? Well, I'm not going to pretend like I, the legislation I have sponsored and I would sign as president of the United States freezes the assets of the Mexican cartels, targets of Mexican cartels, and hopefully eliminates the flow of fentanyl. I do agree with you that 70,000 Americans losing their lives on annual basis is an existential threat to America that we can solve. We don't have to choose the good news as we solve that. Would you be willing to say to the Mexican government, your economy runs on factories right over the border, car plants, for example, but many other manufacturing plants. And we're just going to sub tariffs on that and tank your economy, like tomorrow, unless you stop allowing poison to come into our country. Like why not do that? Okay, so what's interesting here is Tim Scott didn't totally flub this thing. What Tucker was trying to do was make the clear distinction that what's happening in Mexico right now, the amount of people that are coming over, we've covered that a gajillion times, you get it, the amount of drugs they are bringing here, the crime, all of the stuff, what is happening in the border towns of all of those Texas cities that nobody seems to care about until they somehow make their way up to Martha's Vineyard, that as Americans, we should care far more about that, but you guys are always talking about Ukraine, right? You guys are always giving money to Ukraine when we should either be building a wall, we should be dealing with the 12 million people that are here, all of the stuff. Basically, what I think you got out of Tim Scott there was just more of the kind of nothingness. Well, we can do both at the same time. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great. So I'm trying to give you a little bit of a temperature on each of the candidates. Asa got, I just said, asa again, even though I said I was never going to say his name again, asa for the last time got demolished, we're pushing him to the side. Tim Scott, it was just, it was just sort of lukewarm, not much. Now I want to shift to some of the ones that did well, because a couple of them, I think, did do well. And in contrast to Tim Scott, Nicky Haley, Nicky Haley, who I've had on the show many times, Nicky Haley, who knows that I'm obviously supporting DeSantis. Nicky Haley has been on my show since live in Miami, what about two months ago, after I was obviously already supporting DeSantis, she went on and got into it with Tucker. And I think she really did quite well. And I've been saying there's one dark course in this whole thing. I think it's Nicky Haley. Here they are talking about what you do about these federal agencies that are interfering in our elections that have become big, bloviating, obstructive monstrosities. Various government agencies, intel agencies, law and court FBI, CIA, NSA, were involved in shaping public opinion about the last election. They interfered with our election. And that suggests to a lot of people that maybe those agencies have too much unchecked power. You've worked in government. What do you think? Well, yes, that's true. You know, when I was governor, I went and replaced the heads of every agency. It's the first thing I did when I came to office. First thing a president should do is you control what you can control and you start with your agency. So I replaced the heads of every agency. I made sure they were people, some didn't vote for me, but they were people who knew that sector. So if it was veterans, it was someone who knew the challenges of veterans. If it was tourism, it was someone who knew heads and beds, people on golf courses, they knew what they needed to do. And I did that across the board. But the second thing I did is I put people in every agency. I send in teams into every agency to clean it up, pull down regulations, pull out down old issues, get rid of problem children. So in some cases, we had to tweak agencies. In other cases, we had to gut agencies. If you look at the American people, don't trust our intelligence agencies. They don't trust our Department of Justice. So you can't just replace the person at the top. You've got to go through and really look at gutting those agencies and getting out a lot of that senior management and things that happen. Okay. So I want to throw you back to the two questions that I asked up top. Does this person that I'm watching right now sort of roughly believe in the political things that I believe in? And then the second question was the key part. Do you think they can accomplish it? What Nikki is showing right there is she's laying out, hey, do you think I can get rid of these agencies? Well, I did it as governor of South Carolina. And here's how I did it. Sometimes I would get rid of people and appoint people who didn't vote for me, but they were experts in their field. So there's every reason, the reason I was impressed by her on Friday was there's every reason to believe that she has a track record of doing the things she's going to say she's going to do. Now, you may not agree with all of those things. But I'm just going back to those two questions that I asked you up top. Also keep in mind that she was the US ambassador to the UN under Trump and she leveled that place, demolished that place, which is a wretched hive of scum and villainy. And she went in there and broke skull. So she has a track record of doing what she says she's going to do. Tucker also asked her this was this is a kind of fun one that keeps coming up. What do we do about all of these classified documents from 60 plus years ago related to JFK, aliens and a whole bunch more. Last question, which I can't resist. If they're still classifying the JFK assassination docs 60 years later, they're just mocking us, aren't they? They're told it's the same thing with the UFOs. They're totally making everybody want to know what happened. You just need to release all of that release at all. Let us see it. There's no reason to hold on to that now release it down. Good for you. Well, thank you. You won me on that one. Nikki Haley. Thank you so much. You won me on that one. I mean, that's good praise from Tucker. Look, they do not agree on a lot of Ukraine stuff. I personally happen to fall more into the Tucker camp when it comes to Ukraine. That's exactly what I said to Nikki Haley when we had her on the show just a couple months ago. But she did a nice job. I think you can objectively see that. Let's go on to someone else who did a nice job who sometimes I have some frustrations with. But I'll call it as I see it. The Vekrama Swami was on and Tucker asked him how he thinks the United States is currently doing. How do you think the country's doing? I think the country is doing poorly is the answer. I think that we have a void in our country. I'm the first millennial ever to run for US president as a Republican. And I see people my age in particular across this country who are not doing well because we're starved for purpose and meaning. The people are looking to be part of something bigger than ourselves. And yet we've lost the things that used to ground us. Faith, patriotism, hard work, family. These things are gone. And so we're lost in the wilderness. I mean, that's solid, right? Like you could argue maybe those things aren't supposed to come from government. They probably aren't. But the basic things that used to bring us together say roughly around faith, roughly around pride in this country, hard work, all of the things that I'm always talking about on this show, right? Things that Jordan Peterson is always talking about. Like the things that give you purpose because you have some autonomy in your life. So he hits that. And I think he is right as did he describe himself as a millennial? He's the first millennial, right? Yeah, he's the millennial running for president. There is something about younger people being sort of lost in the woods right now. And by the way, you can't blame them. It's very easy to make fun of all the young people out there. But you can't blame them because look at what their leaders did. Look at what their parents' generation and their great grandparents' generation. The boomers now who won't let go. So I have a lot of sympathy for those people. So I think he was, he actually made a really good point there that sort of transcends politics. Like there's something else going on here that's wrong with us at a somewhat spiritual level, as I often talk about. He also connected that later. This is another good answer by him. He connected that to his personal life growing up in a family with two parents and why that actually has some value. Regardless of the color of your skin, how are we going to be a country that ensures opportunity, black, white, man, woman, doesn't matter? You know, my parents came to this country with almost no money. I've gone on to found multi-billion dollar companies. And then people tell me, oh, that's because you had privilege. They tell me white privilege. It's sort of an interesting, it's kind of interesting. Do you tell them? As I take the blindfold off and now you have your answer. But the interesting answer is, actually what I do tell them, Tucker, is that I did have privilege. I didn't grow up in money. But I had two parents in the house, a mother and a father with a focus on education and a faith in God. And you know what, that is the ultimate privilege that if I'm going to enjoy that, every kid in this country ought to enjoy it too. Okay. Absolute credit where credit is due. He is right about that. That is the stuff that Thomas Sol has talked about forever, right? The family unit, having two parents, having a stable home, going to school, knowing that you had breakfast, that someone's going to be home. When you get home from school, all of those things, I was blessed to have all of those things. Those are the things that give you the foundation to go out and do good things in the world. And we have gotten away from all of those things. And by the way, that's probably connected to his earlier answer, right? He was talking about family and faith and hard work and all those things. Like those things connect. The family is the sort of building block at the bottom that then we can build everything up from. I do want to just quickly address, because I've had some frustrations with Vivek. I think he's done a couple really dishonest attacks on DeSantis claiming that there are hate speech laws in Florida, which there is literally nothing that you cannot say in Florida that you can say in Ohio, where he is from. I asked him repeatedly and he refuses to say it. We have property rights laws here that DeSantis tightened. If there was a hate speech law in Florida, hate speeches against the First Amendment and it would be on its way up to the Supreme Court, but it's not hung up in a court anywhere. So I just want to mention three things with him that I think are worth noting about Vivek and some of his history, because he also mentioned that he created billion-dollar companies. This is from the New Republic. Rama Swami seems to have paid Wikipedia editor Jay Hoffman to remove information from his page that he presumably thought would damage his candidacy in the presidential and the Republican primary. A few days later, he announced his 2024 bid. The editor scrubbed off information related to Rama Swami receiving Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans in 2011 during his time as a Yale Law student. Prominent right-wing figures like Jack Passobiak have directed attention toward Rama Swami's past fellowship, presumably in line with the aforementioned use of Soros as a catch-all for anything suspicious. Also, Rama Swami also removed from Rama Swami's page was his work serving on Ohio's COVID-19 response team. The editor claimed that Rama Swami had explicitly asked to remove the mention of his work on the COVID team while the editor himself deemed the fellowship to be extraneous material. Okay, so we've got some Soros connections. We've got some COVID stuff he didn't want people to know about. And there is this WEF relation. This is a quote from Ben Zinga. Vivek said he fundamentally disagrees with Geneva-based international non-governmental agenda. He added that WEF, without his consent, named him a young global leader. Rama Swami has spoken at several WEF events, including the annual meeting in Davos. In 2019, he co-chaired the WF's Healthy Futures Initiative, which focused on improving access to healthcare and promoting innovation in the sector. In 2021, the businessman participated in a virtual discussion on the role of technology and addressing COVID-19 pandemic as part of the WF's Davos agenda event. So he does rail again. I'm just putting this out there. You can, again, you can do with this information what you like. But while he is railing against the globalists and all of those things, we know he has connections with Soros, and we know he has connections with the WF. These are just facts. And I want to show you one other thing because he did mention that he has created multiple billion-dollar businesses. This is from the New York Times. Mr. Rama Swami's enterprise is best known for a spectacular failure. As a 29-year-old, with a bold idea and Ivy League connections, he engineered at the time what was the largest initial public offering IPO in the biotechnology industry's history only to see the Alzheimer's drug at its center fail two years later and the company's value tank. But Rama Swami, now 37, made a fortune anyway. He took his first payout in 2015 after stirring an investor excitement about his growing pharmaceutical empire. He reaped a second five years later when he sold off his most promising pieces to a Japanese conglomerate. In 2022, Rama Swami founded Strive Asset Management and Investment Firm that branded itself in opposition to environmental, social, governance framework ESG used by some firms to make investment decisions amid a broader pushback against so-called ESG from conservatives. Okay. So there you go. So look, he did create billion-dollar companies. He could, the main thing that got this company to go to IPO was this Alzheimer's drug that turned out to be a failure, but he became a billionaire through doing it. I'm just putting it out there. It just is. And then I just want to show you one other thing, because look, I'm giving him credit where credit is due, the good stuff at the beginning. Then he said something that it was fairly bananas, which is that the deep state is trying to get him. My gut instinct is that I will be the nominee and in a position to win this in a landslide versus Biden, and they will not let Biden run against me. So I believe that if I am the nominee, they will not let Biden run. It is why they're holding in the back pocket, the document's case against Biden. It is why they're holding in the back pocket, everything else that you're wondering why they're not charging or bringing now. It's not a Democrat or Republican thing. It's a managerial class, deep state bureaucratic class versus elected official puppets. What he just said there was that if he is the nominee, that the deep state will not allow Biden to run. Now, I do think the deep state does all kinds of crazy things. I think there is a huge issue if it is not Trump, because if it is Save Vivek or Ron DeSantis or Nicki or anyone that is younger and more competent, the juxtaposition of that old dimension, written man versus these young people will be too much. The chasm will be too wide. The Democrats won't know what to do with it, but the idea that he's saying it basically as fact, the deep state is holding it in their pocket, that they will get rid of Biden if it is me. That's Trump level gish gallop. Gish gallop, when you lie so brazenly that nobody knows what to do with it, so they let you have it. That is basically where he is at with that. Anyway, I'm trying to give you the good and the bad. I hopefully did that in as honest a way as possible. Now, before I jump to DeSantis, and obviously DeSantis is the guy that I think is the best at the moment, who I think is the most competent and all that stuff. First, I want to note my cards are on the table when it comes to this. Secondly, I want to note that I think DeSantis could be doing a better job in terms of campaigning. He needs to do more combative interviews. He needs to get on Rogan, if Rogan's going to have the presidential candidates on so that he can do a three hour long form, just sit there in a t-shirt and talk shit kind of thing. He needs to go on Meghan Kelly. He needs to do a bunch of other. He needs to go on the view. Go on the view. Sit with those ladies and call them out with their lives, even if you got to do it. Ted Cruz style. What did Ted Cruz do as they were lying to him? They were lying and Ted Cruz goes, well, I got the records. Here we go. So DeSantis needs to make some adjustments. I want to just put that out there. That's my feeling about this at the moment. But let's dive into a couple of the clips. Here's which is what's clip one. Oh, sorry. First they went on to a litmus test when it comes to hiring executive officials. You also have to have certain character of people. Like if you're the attorney general, everything you do to deal with the DOJ and the weaponization of government, deal with the FBI, the press is going to rake you over the coals. The left is going to rake you over the coals. The Democrats, they're all going to rake you over the coals. You either are down for that or you're not. And if you can't handle that, if you don't have the backbone to do that, you will fail at that job. So you need people and I look at different folks in government like on the Supreme Court, I would look to Clarence Thomas as the example because he doesn't budge. He doesn't care what the media says about him. They've smeared him six ways from Sunday. He does what he thinks is right. So you got to have those people and then you have levers that you can pull. I believe Article Two of the Constitution means the president has the executive authority. We just say these bureaucrats somehow can't be held accountable. I disagree with that. I think you can fire them. If we have an FBI agent going to harass a pro-life activist like they did Mark Halk and send a SWAT team, I'd fire them immediately. When you have FBI colluding with big tap to censor dissent, I would fire those people. Okay. Again, I would harken you back to the two questions I asked at the beginning. Do you roughly believe in the political positions that this guy has and do you think he can do it? So obviously, for me, right, I obviously believe in most of the political positions he has. And do you believe he can do it? There's every reason to believe it because I don't know one one thing, but I would welcome this in the comments. Give me one thing that Rhonda Santas in his now five plus years as governor has said he was going to do that he did not do. Right? He picked all of those fights when he's saying, I admire Clarence Thomas for doing what he is right, what he believes to be right. Regardless of the ramifications, I think that's basically the way this guy is governed. By the way, I do have some differences with him. As you guys know, to me, the six week abortion thing was too much. I think 12 weeks would have been fine. Florida had 15 weeks and I never heard any Republicans complaining about it. However, I did hear multiple times at events that I was at with DeSantis in the last year where he would talk about his personal pro-life beliefs. And he as the chief executive of the state who won in a landslide is then allowed to set policy. You can decide if you like that or not. And again, as I said earlier, you have to decide where say abortion falls in your hierarchy of importance when you're going to vote for somebody. But there's every reason to believe that when DeSantis says he would fire the people that are overstepping their authority that he would do it. How do you know? Well, we had a Soros funded DA. I think it was in Tampa. We don't anymore. He's getting ESG out of our colleges. He's revamping all of the institutions. We now have a super majority of Republicans because he did the right thing and then was rewarded at the ballot box for it. So I think that is fairly clear. He also got into what he would do on some of his first day stuff. And I think you'll like this one. There are thousands of positions in the executive branch that are pointed by the president. You got to have all those people ready to go to be submitted to the Senate in January of 2025. You can't wait two years to fill all the positions because then these career bureaucrats, they just take over. So you got to have your people in there on day one. Had I been president 2020, Anthony Fauci would have been fired and you've got to be willing to do it. Okay. Now you can either believe him or not, but we all know, certainly if you're watching this show, you know that Florida became the Citadel of Freedom, the number one place literally in the world fighting against mandates. We have now put it into law that these drug companies cannot basically force you to take drugs. They can't force you to be mass. The government can't force you to be mass. All of these things about lockdowns, like we've done more on that than anyone else. So to me, there's every reason to believe that he would staff properly, that he would be ready to staff properly. So the day he comes in, he's going to bring in the right people and you don't have two years. Look, Trump had a problem with this for sure. And again, I voted for Trump last time and I was a huge freaking supporter and I had a lot of it cost a lot to do that. Okay. It absolutely did personally and professionally. But one of the problems that everyone knows Trump had, and I think he's going to have a harder time if he becomes president next time, is who wants to work for him? He has turned against literally everybody basically except his son or his family. And that really is an issue. You have to have good people working for you. Can he do it? I think to say that this can, I think it's going to be harder for Trump. I want to show you just two more on him, but this one I think is the most interesting one because one of the things that I sense that the Trump camp and the Tucker types are hitting DeSantis on more is the Ukraine stance where he doesn't seem to be for nation building or big wars, but he hasn't been anti-war enough. So here is his position on Ukraine, the war in general, and Putin specifically. I've always thought Putin's a bad guy. I still think he's a bad guy. But that's a separate question for a leader who's got to look at the world in very clear-eyed glasses. You know that it's not all peaches and cream out there. And you have to make a judgment about what's in America's national interest. And so that's the position that I believe. And I also believe that I wish the DC elites cared as much about our border as they do about the Ukraine-Russia border. Because there's people pouring into this country. We have people dying from fence and all overdose. The cartels are running the show. And what I've said is this is something on day one, declare a national emergency, mobilize all resources, including the military. Stop the invasion. Yes, build the wall. But most importantly, authorize the border patrol, authorize our military to deal with the cartels. If they're breaking into our country, bringing product, if I'm in charge, that's going to be the last thing they do because they're going to end up stone cold dead. Again, do you agree with the guy's policies and do you think he can do it? I think there's every reason to believe that on day one, he would mobilize the military and that we would be defending the border. And it was interesting because, you know, when we showed you that answer earlier from Tim Scott and Tim Scott, basically, when Tucker asked him about Mexico and Ukraine, he sort of was just kind of me. He didn't do much. It was just lukewarm. What we can do both, we can sort of do something about Mexico and fentanyl and we can still help Ukraine. And DeSantis was like, we are going to deal with the border 100%. That is going to solve the Mexico problem. He then later on went to say he didn't want this endless war and we've got to put pressure on Putin, etc, etc. So we'll find out more about that. I do see that as if you're like the most isolationist libertarian type, which by the way is just a sliver of the voting electorate. Most people aren't. But I could see that being a concern with DeSantis and I think we'll find out more about that as time goes on. I want to show you one more because I just thought this was nice relative to things that are going on here in Florida because the amount of people who are moving here, could it change the electorate of Florida as we take all of the refugees from the blue states. And that's a good thing. But when you see half any Jersey down there, does that make you worry? So here's the truth. When I became governor and I was born and raised in Florida, I had never seen a California license plate in the state of Florida in my life. And all of a sudden we start seeing California plates. My supporters are like, uh oh, who are these people? Because remember, you know, I may have won by 20 points in November, but usually Florida races were 1%. So if you bring in 50,000 Californians, 50,000 people from New York, all of a sudden it could be a blue state. We would have supporters go to supermarkets in like Palm Beach, find every New Yorker New Jersey license plate, put a flyer in the windshield and say, do not vote down here the way they vote up there. And, but what ended up happening was I think we drew people who believed in what we were doing. It wasn't just these were liberals who just wanted no state income tax. There may have been some of those, but I think most of these people said, you know what, Florida is a free state. I'm not dealing with these lockdowns. Florida has kids in school. I'm not going to not have my kids be out of being school. Florida has a 50 year low in the crime rate. I don't want to see rioting in my neighborhood. So there were a whole bunch of reasons why people did it, but the political orientation of it actually turned out pretty good. So you're getting the good ones. We're getting good ones. And you know what, we're converting people to. I mean, that's I think something that we have to do as a movement. You know, you can't just preach only to the choir. I want to get some other people who may not have voted Republican in the past and get them on our team. And we've done that in Florida on record numbers. And I think it can be done across the country. Yeah. Yeah. I want to reiterate something about the it's not just liberals coming for low taxes. You guys, I mean, I left as publicly as anyone when I left California and made it here to Florida. When I look at my numbers, when I talk to my accountant and my business manager and I'm like, wait a minute, wait a minute, I'm saving money to be in the freer place. I'm saving money to be in the happier place, the more functional place, the place with better infrastructure and better better education and all of that stuff. It's crazy. But as you know, I meet tons of people wherever I go, whenever I go, if I go to the grocery or I go to Home Depot and I meet refugees all the time who are first time Republican voters, not only I had voted once or twice for Republicans over my life, obviously before this, Larry Elder, for example, in the recall against Gavin Newsom. But I am a first time registered Republican here in Florida, as are several of the people in this room. I want to give Daphne some credit. She was a registered Republican, even in California. Wow. Look at you. Look at you fighting the power. But DeSantis is right. If you do the right thing, it's a different time. Post COVID, when 10 years ago, people used to move places largely simply because of taxes, you'd make a certain amount of money and then you were retiring and you'd be like, I don't know. I don't know if I want to stay in New York anymore. I'll move down to Florida, but I'm going to still vote that stupid way. You just don't even associate these things together. It is very, very different post COVID and the numbers bear it out because the guy won by 1.6 million votes after winning by barely 30,000 votes the time before to a guy who turned out to be a methodic, but nobody's perfect. Anyway, who was not at this blaze summit? Who was not at this blaze summit? Well, Donald Trump was not at this blaze summit. He said he had another engagement. I don't know what that engagement was. It was not a public engagement. I think partially he did not want to go there because he did not want to be questioned by Tucker Carlson because Tucker, for as much as he likes Trump and my gut feeling, I think there's every reason to believe that if Tucker votes, he voted for Donald Trump, Tucker would have had to have hit him on vaccines and Fauci and warp speed and the wall not being built and going after Florida relentlessly when he lives in Florida and like all of the stuff and Trump did not want to deal with that. However, Trump did do something over the weekend. He went to a turning point USA action event in West Palm. That's home country for Donald Trump. That's where Mar-a-Lago is and he gave a speech. I want to show you a couple clips. He started. I'm going to show you like the kind of nonsense first. Then we'll get into some of the meat. The nonsense part was listened to how he goes after DeSantis. When I'm president, it will be done very quickly. I believe in 24 hours. Now, somebody like Ron DeSantis cannot do it because he's owned and controlled by the globalist establishment who always puts America last. We all saw how quickly DeSantis reversed himself on Ukraine. It's funny the other day they were doing a straight new show and they said, in Ladies and Gentlemen, we have Ron DeSantis here and they scream, no, it's DeSantis. That's called good branding. They can't even get his name right. The guy's introducing him as DeSantis. I love that. I guess you love it, Don. You love it. I'm kind of over it personally. I want someone that can do the two things that I started this show with, that believes in roughly the things that I believe in. Actually, you're getting it on that Trump. Even still, I think we roughly believe in the same things and want to live in roughly the same country. The question number two, the key question, can you accomplish those things? Well, look, there's always the name calling and DeSantis in Desanctimonious. You could tell people aren't even laughing at it the way they used to. It feels like watching a sitcom that you've seen this episode 25 times. You're watching Friends. You've seen this episode 25 times and it starts getting less funny over time. Then one time you turned it on and they don't even have the laugh track anymore. Then you're like, boy, was that still funny? Anyway, also this thing about DeSantis being owned by the globalist. Where's the evidence? Where's the evidence? What politician has done more of the anti-globalist stuff than DeSantis, right? Getting rid of ESG, fighting central banking. This is what DeSantis is fighting all the vaccine mandates, everything else. He just says these things in a certain amount. Oh my God, he said DeSantis and he said he's owned by the globalist. Donald Trump has far more connections with Paul Ryan than DeSantis ever did. I think DeSantis said he met him once. So I'm just putting that out there as the frame of this. But now I want to get on to the next part because Trump said, and again, you have to say he's, do you believe in the policy and do you believe he can accomplish it? He says that he is going to stand up against big pharma for vaccine injuries. kindergarten through college, you don't get anything. You don't get anything. I will also continue my long record of standing up to big pharma by creating a special presidential commission to investigate what is causing the decades long increase in childhood diseases, autoimmune disorders, autism, obesity, infertility. Okay, so you do you think he will do that? Now, this is the guy that pushed Warp Speed. He said he's very happy about the vaccines, all of that. Do you think now the second time around he will create this commission to look into what vaccines have done from people? His campaign has taken money from Pfizer all that you just have to decide for yourself, right? Would he be better than Biden? Ain't no doubt about it. But would he accomplish the things that he's saying to do? Is there any reason to think that he would drain the very swamp that basically drained him as president? He gave Fauci an award as he was leaving after four years of being president. He also did an interview over the weekend with Maria Bartiromo from Fox Business. And they talked about the Ukraine war and his feelings about Zelensky and Putin and a bunch more. And this is a mixed bag in this answer. Take a look. You said you could end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. Yes, I would. You do that. I know Zelensky very well. I felt he was very honorable because when they asked him about the perfect phone call that I made, he said it was indeed. He said it was he didn't even know what they were talking about. He could have grandstanded. Oh, I felt threatened. Well, that's not going to be enough for Putin to stop bombing. No, no, no, I'm not saying that. I what I'm saying is that I know Zelensky very well, and I know Putin very well, even better. And I had a good relationship very good with both of them. I would tell Zelensky no more. You got to make a deal. I would tell Putin. If you don't make a deal, we're going to give him a lot. We're going to give more than they have a got if we have to. I will have the deal done in one day. First off, I want to be clear about one thing. You think you make the perfect phone call Donald Trump? Every phone call I make is the perfect phone call. That's number one. I've never screwed up a phone call once in my life. Okay, that's one thing. Secondly, the second part of that answer, again, it's always that people like him. He has a great relationship with them both. Okay, fine. Zelensky. Now, look, putting pressure on Zelensky, the first part of that answer was right. I think the putting pressure on Zelensky, like you may have to make some sort of agreement here would be good because Zelensky right now, what is he getting from the United States? Oh, don't make an agreement, right? We know that other countries have tried to step in and make agreements. Zelensky has said no, and our administration basically tells him to say no, because they want to keep funding the war and billions more dollars in and keep that grift going. So putting pressure on Zelensky to say you're going to make some concessions here. That is good. The second part of that where he said, well, I'm going to say to Putin, who, and I have a good relationship with Putin, which is a little bizarre, but okay, I have a good relationship with Putin. If you don't make a deal, I'm going to basically give Zelensky with everyone's. I'm going to give him more weapons and everything. Trump is actually doing the most reverse move against the base you could possibly do, which is saying I will escalate the war to give Zelensky whatever he wants to say to Putin, I'm going to give you whatever you want. I'm going to give you all the munitions you want, all the tanks you want, all the F-15s you want. I'm going to give you freaking nukes, chemical weapons, the whole world, open up the stockpile, get going. To say that to Putin, that that's what we're going to do. That's what we're going to give to Zelensky. Putin might go, oh, well, I still do have nukes. Thus, you've escalated the war. So this is one of those things. And then you have to wonder, again, what were my two questions at the top of the show? Do you roughly agree? And do you think he can do it? I can end this in 24 hours. I can end it in 24 hours. Like, I'm asking you, I'm not even taking a position on it. Do you think he can end it in 24 hours? I want to show you one more clip from that interview with Maria Bartiromo, because by the way, she's basically a Trump supporter. I mean, I think she's taken a lot of hits for it. But in essence, as a Trump supporter, they talked about whether Trump actually did drain the swamp in the first place. I think that you could look back on in 16, that you think maybe you want to do differently this time around? Well, the mistakes would be that a lot of people, for instance, say you should have been softer. But I was under siege by people that were very dishonest. If I was soft, I wouldn't be talking to you right now. Believe me, I wouldn't have been able to finish out one of the most successful terms as president to a point where it was so successful that I'm leading by 50 points right now. You know, I mean, that wouldn't have happened. The mistake would be people. I mean, I wouldn't have put a guy like Bill Barr, and he was weak and pathetic. I wouldn't have put Jeff Sessions in. There are some people that I wouldn't have put in. You know, most people were good. But I had some people, we had Esper. I didn't like him. He was incompetent. I thought we had other people. I didn't like... Why did you put them in the job then? Because every... Look, every president, you put somebody in, you think they're good. It's an on-contrition, a moment of contrition, almost like a maya culpa with him where he's... He never admits making mistakes ever. But like, to basically be like, I screwed up a bunch of people that I brought in. I mean, you could go through the list. It's Bill Barr, Jeff Sessions, John Bolton, Christopher Ray, Esper. Like, the list goes on. He's turned against Kayleigh McEnany. Again, who has he had? There's been a couple people he has not turned on. I would say junior, most specifically, Rick Rennell. I mean, I guess there's a couple more. But you just have to. When he says, I can end the war in 24 hours. I can drain the swamp properly this time. You just have to think for yourself, okay, can you actually bring in the right people to do it? That question I leave up to you. I want to shift to one other thing before we finish the show, which I suspect is going to be our longest, perhaps biggest show ever today. That's where we're heading right here at this very moment. I thought this was absolutely just spectacular because beyond Democrat, versus Republican, or even Republican, versus Republican, we do seem to have one enemy. The enemy seems to be, and we can all discuss how you take the enemy out the most or who's going to be the most effective at draining it or any of those things. But the biggest enemy right now does seem to be that deep state, that machine, as I often talk about, that is constantly lying to us, that is pushing us into wars, that elevates the worst people and crushes the good people and all of those things. So an actual beautiful moment happened over the weekend on Twitter because the FBI got fact-checked on Twitter. This is absolutely spectacular. So here's the FBI's tweet. This is from over the weekend. In reference to the false assertions about investigating parents at school board meetings, FBI Director Ray told the House Judiciary Committee that the bureau is not in the business of policing speech. Community notes, this is Twitter's crowd sourced fact checking apparatus. The FBI statement is misleading. On May 18th, 2023, former FBI agent Steve Friend testified before the House Judiciary Committee that he and others were directed to surveil and document parents attending school board meetings. You really got to love it, people. You've got to love it. And this is what is so interesting about the way the internet has been splitting, as I've been talking about for the last couple of weeks. Zuckerberg creates threads, a Twitter clone, the guy in charge of censorship online, basically more than anybody else, who has admitted to working with the government to censor people. He creates threads. Threads, by the way, after it blew up for that first week, Zuckerberg basically hasn't posted in a week, like the things falling apart already. Twitter is doing the often messy difficult job of even fact-checking the FBI. You have to decide which one of those platforms you want to be on, if you want to be on any of these things to get actual honest information. I want to show you one clip in case you did not see it, our full interview with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. went up on Rumble and YouTube yesterday. It's been up on Locals Had Free for about a week already. But there was a clip that was going viral over the weekend directly related to censorship, big tech, government, all of that stuff. I was the first one that they ordered censored. The Biden administration came it off as on January 21st, 2021. On January 23rd, they contacted Facebook, the White House contacted Facebook and asked them to start to remove me. Then three weeks later, there was a battle. The people in the White House were threatening Facebook with withdrawal of their Section 230 immunity, which is an existential threat to them. Section 230, of course, is the liability shield. If you defamed Donald Trump on Facebook and said something that was untrue, that you knew to be untrue, that was scurrilous and very damaging, he can sue you, but he can't sue Facebook. Facebook is supposed to be a neutral platform and it cannot be sued. That's called Section 230. Mark Zuckerberg said, if we lose that, it's existential. We cease to exist. They would actually have to censor more in that case because they would have more liability. So they'd be basically censoring everybody. And then the White House invited in all of these agencies, the really weird agencies like the Census Bureau, I mean, the CIA was involved, the FBI was involved, the TH had the Department of Homeland Security was involved. Also, like the IRS and the Census Bureau and a whole bunch of other agencies were all involved and identifying people that needed to be censored and have come and can silence this critics as licensed for any atrocity. Okay. So I think you get my point, whether you agree with me or disagree with me on any of the analysis of any of the political candidates I've talked about today, the bigger issue these days right now is how we can get to something truthful, how we can make sure that the government is not stifling our free speech, how we can make sure that the government is not working with corporations to do that, which is known as the F word, that's fascism actually. And that really is the sort of meta problem, meta, ironically, it's that's the meta problem as we deal with all like the specific policy problems. David Sachs, who of course I've had on the show many times from the All In Podcast, he was on his show, the All In Podcast, talking about how Google and YouTube are actually directly influencing our democracy. And this is in relation to RFK. YouTube just banned a video of Jordan Peterson interviewing RFK Jr. Why? What gives them the power to interfere in our democracy that way where they just decide for their own reasons that the public can't watch a video of Jordan Peterson interviewing RFK? I was pretty controversial when you said blow it up. I mean, I would love for you to say more on that. Yeah. Well, I paraphrased a line from RFK Jr, who is paraphrasing a line from JFK, which is he went to shadow the CIA into a thousand pieces and scattered to the winds. I said that after they banned the Jordan Peterson RFK interview, that we should shatter Google into a thousand pieces and scattered to the winds. And that thing went massively viral. There's a big part of this country that has really passed at Google in the way they're exercising their arbitrary power. How many did they get? 12,000 likes? I just think that the people running that company, I don't understand how they make these decisions. All right. I think David, as always, it's well said, what right does YouTube have when they have certain protections that RFK was talking about, right? The Liability Shield, Section 230 of the Communications Act, what right do they have to decide what information you can hear or not hear? Let's say RFK Jr is wrong about half of the things he says. And let's say that Jordan Peterson, who interviewed him, that's what they were referring, Jordan Peterson interview of RFK Jr, let's say Jordan Peterson was a complete crackpot. He obviously isn't. But even if both those things were true, should YouTube have the right to censor it from you, especially if we know that the government is working with YouTube to do so, which we now know because of the Twitter files? It's interesting that the YouTube files have never leaked, right? But how many times a day do I see messages from you guys or my team will forward the messages of people, you guys that watch this show on YouTube, you subscribe to this channel, you click the notification bell so you're supposed to be notified of all of our videos and you do not see our videos or the suggested tab on the side of our videos actually sends you to completely the reverse or whatever it might be, we are being manipulated. It's not the ways that we know we're being manipulated that I'm worried about. It's the ways that we do not know that we are being manipulated that I'm worried about. But competition, whether it is ideological competition between the Santas and Trump, or whether it is competition between rumble and YouTube, competition is healthy. It's healthy for a presidential candidate. It's healthy for a better product. And what we need right now, I think, is a strong leader who will fight that machine with everything he's got and do it knowing that the machine is freaking evil and it can turn anybody. That's the character that I think we are looking for right now. I want to end with one more thing. This is from Jordan Peterson on Lex Friedman's podcast, talking about how that fine line between being good and suddenly becoming a monster is one that can be difficult to tread. Battle not with monsters, unless you become a monster. And if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you. Right. But I would say bring it on. Right. Because I also say knowing that he's absolutely right. But if you gaze into the abyss long enough, you see the light not the darkness. Are you sure? I bet my life on it. Yeah. Well, it might distort your mind to where all you see is abyss is the evil. Powerful ending to today's program, guys. Right. That is the challenge. I guess that's really the challenge for all of us. It's not just the challenge for politicians or the challenge for tech leaders or anyone else. Like, what is the evil that you see out there? What is that abyss? And will you stare into it? And the old idea is that if you stare into the abyss long enough, the abyss might stare back like you might suddenly see something so horrible about yourself. What Jordan is saying is through that, you might see some light, you might see something good. I think that's the challenge on all of us right now. So I'm ending a very political show in a very philosophic way. I also do think this might just be our longest and perhaps biggest show ever. I thank you guys for watching. And if I haven't made myself clear, we are on rumble at rumble.com slash Ruben report. I do not trust our overlords at YouTube. Oh, and it's me Monday over at locals. Here's what I put up this morning in relation to everything that happened on Friday. American cities are none of my business. And that's Tucker Carlson pulling the plug on Mike Pence. Mike Pence, obviously again, I will gladly interview him. I will be at the Republican debates. So I hope I will be able to sit down with him and everybody else. The guy who I just said, I'm not going to mention anymore. I'm not going to mention anymore. Not because I'm afraid of him. It's not a Voldemort thing. I just don't think there's it's worth spending another brain cell on. I don't think he'll be at the Republican debates anyway. Anyway, we leave you with a cold clothes that I think you'll dig. And then for everybody else that wants to stay in direct contact with us no matter what because Big Cat Tech cannot take us down. Join us for the post game show at rubenreport.locals.com. Ciao.
