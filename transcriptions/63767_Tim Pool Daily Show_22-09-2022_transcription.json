What's actually happening on the ground and where does it head? I'm Eric Erickson. I'll explain to you the state of play in Israel. To hear the special episodes, subscribe to the Eric Erickson podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts. Today is September 22nd, 2022. And our first story, Vanderbuilt Medical Clinic shut down its website after Matt Walsh's Expos\u00e9 goes viral. Sex change surgery for children is a losing political issue. It goes against the science and it's going to backfire on Democrats and cost them the midterms, or at least be one factor costing them the midterms. The evidence? Glenn Youngkin, the Republican, winning in Virginia. In our next story, the North Dakota man who ran down and killed a teenager for being Republican is free on bail. Double standards, no no bounds. In our last story, California will allow human composition into soil. So I don't know, Soylent Green, it's coming I guess. If you like the show, give us a good review, leave us five stars, share the show with your friends. Now let's get into that first story. Matt Walsh recently published an Expos\u00e9 on Vanderbuilt University's medical clinic that was providing child sex change surgeries. Now apparently the university did not deny anything simply saying that there are parents involved that are consenting to this. I certainly think the issue is particularly complicated. There are questions about the expertise of doctors and the right way to help children. But of course, this is a particularly contentious issue in this upcoming midterms. And I think it's fair to say, the average person does not support irreversible hormonal, medical or surgical intervention for children. And we are seeing this with Glenn Youngkin's victory in Virginia. When parents started getting wind of what was being taught to their children, and this was just ideology, they revolted, they ousted the Democrats, brought in a Republican who is now vowed to make changes. In response to Matt Walsh's Expos\u00e9 on Vanderbuilt, Vanderbuilt pulled the entire website down. Why? Why take the website down? Was the website susceptible to some kind of attack? It's just a digital website. The argument coming from the left is that they were exposed to threats of violence and extremism. No, no, no, hold on, everybody. We don't want any of that stuff. We want to protect these kids. I do believe that there are many kids who are suffering from gender dysphoria who do need appropriate gender care. I don't think affirmation, as the left tries to describe it, is necessarily appropriate. I'm not the individual doctor for these children. But I do think there is a problem. As we've heard from many D transitioners, people who were told they were trans, received medical intervention, and then regretted it, there is a problem according to them, with many of these kids being rushed into it, with universities and organizations seeking to make money off of it, and the lives of these children being forever harmed. Now we are dealing with the aftermath of this. But I think what you see, plain as day, the reason Vanderbuilt took down their website. The reason why many other universities or medical clinics take down these videos is because they know when regular people find out, when your average person finds out, they are giving pre-pubescent and pubescent children sex change surgeries. They have a very negative reaction. Now, of course, we don't want anybody to take things to the extreme with Boston Children's Hospital. There was a negative reaction. Someone did call in a threat. I believe it was to the hospital itself, not to the police. And we don't want to do that. What we need is for more expos\u00e9s, for more people to see exactly what's going on, to be told the bare facts and say, that's it. And have a nice day. Why? Because it appears that Democrats know this is an issue that is very, very bad for them. They are being backed into a corner and the only thing they can do in the media is try and frame it as though unhinged fascists are coming for their children. When in reality, they're just calling out the practice. And of course, once regular people hear about the practice, they have a negative response. I have to say this, if there's one thing that you can ask people, because this is a big issue right now, especially with the amount of kids that are being offered up, medical intervention, ask your friends and your family with this election. How do you feel about child sex change surgery? Perhaps many of them support it. Well, okay. I'd be willing to bet many of them will say that's not happening. Well, okay. Then why don't I show you exactly what's going on in Tennessee with Matt Walsh's expos\u00e9? So you can tell them, know my friends, it is happening. Double mastectomies on young girls. Look at jazz genings, a very prominent individual. Now I have nothing but I hope jazz lives a long, healthy life. I have no issue with jazz and seriously wish jazz the best. I want these young people to be happy and to be safe. However, you can clearly look at a prominent television show depicting a minor who was given sex change intervention to know it quite literally is happening. Now, if you're a Democrat, you support it by all means, support the website, ask them to keep it up so everyone can see it and make sure you let all of your friends and family know that you agree with it. I happen to believe that with an issue like this in play, people are going to vote Republican because the Republicans are actually making moves to shut it down.

I want to show you the perspective of the Daily Beast, which is a leftist outlet on what Matt Walsh has done, and then show you what's happening actually. An Asheville area hospital has shut down a webpage for its transgender care center. After a right wing commentator and podcaster attacked the clinic for providing gender affirming care. Full stop. What does gender affirming care mean? Let's break it down. Affirmation means in support of to affirm, to confirm, to agree with. These are children who are going in and they're dysphoric or confused. Not every single person, every child who has come in experiencing what may be gender dysphoria actually has gender dysphoria, which is why often the criteria needs to be or is rigorous. Some kids may be suffering from anxiety and want to fit in. And thus, they just say what they hear around them. Doctors then try to figure out if this truly is gender dysphoria. And if it is, and if it's not, there may be appropriate treatments. To say gender affirming care is to imply that it is always about making sure the child is correct. No. Kids get things wrong. We need to help these kids, not just tell them that if they're, look, if a kid comes to you and says they think they're a pirate, do you affirm it? Well, no, of course not. You say it's make believe. If a child is suffering from from delusions or a mental ailment, let's say that the child is suffering from a very early onset schizophrenia. I have friends who've suffered through this as teenagers. And they say things like they're being watched, they're paranoid that men are trying to kidnap them and they're all around every corner. These, this is a common paranoid delusion. There's a paranoid delusion that people suffer from where they feel that everyone is spying on them and trying to kidnap them and experiment on them. I'm not kidding. This is a legitimate recurring theme. I don't know why, but it's a specific set of a paranoid delusion that people can experience. Now, if someone came to you and said, that guy, I saw him when I walked in, he's one of them, you'd say, no, he's not. I will not affirm that we need to help you. Now, if there is a child who's suffering from a medical issue that turns out not to be gender dysphoria, wouldn't we want to make sure they get to appropriate care and they aren't just affirmed? That's a big risk here. But let's read more. Let's read more. On Tuesday's episode of the Matt Walsh Show, Walsh claimed that Vanderbilt University Medical Center doctors drug and mutilate children, castrate and butcher them when they provide services to help children transition. In a string of tweets promoting the episode, Walsh screenshotted a segment of the hospital's trans clinic website that he claims offered chemical castration by offering services like gender affirming hormone therapy and puberty blockers. In response, Vanderbilt took down the clinic's website. On Wednesday evening, Walsh tweeted that Vanderbilt responded to his accusations, quote, they do not specifically deny anything in my report. Their only defense for drugging and mutilating kids is that their parents allegedly consent to it. Some online critics claimed that Walsh's accusations were going to get people hurt or even killed. Okay, that's absurd. Calling out something in the media, you can't be responsible for the violence that ensues from it. Even to that regard with Joe Biden calling Republicans extremists. And then a couple weeks later, someone coming out and running over a kid, I don't blame Joe Biden for having an opinion. But if the left wants to come out and screams to castic terrorism, anytime someone criticizes them, the same criticism can be applied to them. Can it not? I don't agree with it, but I'm trying to shine a mirror on their hypocrisy. Here we go. From WPLN, Vanderbilt is the latest target in a far right campaign against transgender health clinics. There's a lot more here. And the latest development is that Republicans are moving to strip Vanderbilt, Vanderbilt Hospital of its child transgender surgeries. I can only tell you this. Why do I think this is backfiring and why will it hurt the Democrats? Because of Glenn Yunken, the New York Post editorial board writes, Virginia Governor Glenn Yunken delivers utter sanity in new school rules on trans kids. Let me tell you my friends, I want to help children suffering from gender dysphoria. I believe they do exist. I've heard from some conservatives and other personalities, they don't think these kids do exist. They think these kids are confused and being manipulated. I disagree. I think gender dysphoria is real. And I believe that there's a lot of issues like endocrine disruptors, hormonal disruptors, things like that, which may cause it. How do we help these kids? I certainly don't think what these universities are doing is helping them. In the end, these kids can suffer from permanent physical disabilities, bone density loss, the inability to experience, let's just call it adult sensation permanently and sterilization. I do not believe that is helping these kids. I believe these kids are suffering and there are issues that need to be worked out. In the end, however, Democrats, I believe no, they're going to suffer very serious consequences because of this. Bill Maher recently came out on his show and said Democrats need to get away from the woke stuff, stop talking about pregnant men from Tennessee lookout.com. Republican lawmakers plan to strip Vanderbilt Hospital of Child Trans Surgeries fueled by a Twitter report. Republican lawmakers are planning to pass legislation in 2023 to stop Vanderbilt University Medical Center from performing pediatric transgender surgeries. Meanwhile, Governor Billy requested an investigation. An attorney general, Jonathan Scrimetti's office said he will use the full scope of his authority to make sure state law is being followed. House Speaker Cameron Sexton, our crossville, said in a statement, he is looking into conflicting reports on the matter, but noted, it is quote, inappropriate for any minor to have any gender reassignment surgery or puberty blockers given to them, quote, your biological sex at birth is your identity. There will be legislation filed this session by many members to protect Tennesseans from his this barbaric practice. Outrage surfaced among some legislators after conservative blogger Matt Walsh posted video and reports Tuesday showing Vanderbilt officials discussing gender affirming surgeries. Walsh, a political commentator, blogger and podcaster for the conservative daily wire engaged in similar social media accusations against Boston Children's Hospital last month. What followed there were threats of violence against staff and doctors, including a bomb threat that forced the evacuation of the hospital full stop. I do not believe there was an evacuation. I believe this is false. This is incorrect. I think there was a lockdown, but they did not evacuate further. After the threat came in, police didn't respond, I think for about an hour. So many people assume that it was not credible to begin with a statement released by Vanderbilt University Medical Center on Wednesday noted that the acclaimed teaching hospital is now the subject of social media posts and a video that misrepresent facts about the care the medical center provides to transgender patients. VUMC began its transgender health clinic because transgender individuals are a high risk population for mental and physical health issues and have been consistently underserved by the U.S. health health system health system. The statement noted the hospital provides care to all adolescents in compliance with state law and in line with professional proactive standards and guidance established by medical specialty societies, including requiring parental consent to treat minors for issues related to transgender care. Okay, it's simple then. It's simple. In Scandinavian countries like Sweden and Finland, they've discontinued this practice. Then Republicans citing the science should ban it if they see fit. And then these universities will not be in accordance with state law and it will be done with. Now, the strange thing is when it comes to Democrats or Republicans in politics is that Republicans are often advocating for things that will ultimately help Democrats. No, hear me out. The Democrats are advocating for a position that ultimately will cost them the election. I'll simply put if Republicans ban this stuff before an election, but they're not going to. They're going they're moving forward in 2023. The Democrats won't have to campaign on it, I guess, or will they? In the end, this is a detriment, a detriment, an extreme detriment to Democrats. They say on web Wednesday, the websites for Vanderbilt Clinic for Transgender Health and Associated Pages were down. Walsh on Wednesday posted a series of videos on Twitter. He said were taken in 2018 and 2020, including one featuring Vanderbilt physician Dr. Shane Taylor, calling gender transition surgery a big money maker. Some procedures which are covered by the Affordable Care Act could bring it up to $40,000 and others could cost $100,000. Taylor said in the video, that's on video. It was said. So let Democrats roll around in this. Taylor does not refer to children in the video clip. Walsh posted, which did not appear to contain her full remarks. Either way, another video Walsh posted includes a Vanderbilt plastic surgeon discussing guidelines. Doctors must follow before performing top surgeries or double mastectomies on trans patients. The requirements include a letter documenting persistent gender dysphoria from a licensed mental health provider and ensuring patients are capable of making fully informed decisions on their own. The physician said, patients who are 16 or 17 years of age, who have been on testosterone and have parental consent may also qualify. But Walsh inaccurately characterized the remarks to suggest that after children are drugged and sterilized, Vanderbilt surgeons will happily perform double mastectomies on adolescent girls. I'm sorry. What about that is inaccurate? Let me let me let me break that down. It may be loaded in your mind. But if you're saying that a 16 to 17 year old needs to already have been on testosterone, then they've been given drugs, correct? Admittedly, Matt Walsh is a bit more bombastic in his approach. But yes, teenage girls are adolescents. That's what adolescent means. Adolescent doesn't mean it doesn't mean all children. Adolescent means before the age of of 18, which can include 16 to 17 year olds. Walsh also posted an undated video of Dr. Ellen Clayton of Andrew Bell, the professor of law, pediatrics and health policy, noting that conscientious objections to gender-affirming surgery is problematic. We'll take a look at this. The Christian Post, conservatives angered by Fox News profile on trans identified child horrifying evil and sick. Yeah, Fox News ran an LGBTQ plus pride month advocating for trans children. The reaction from the right was pronounced. They were furious. They slammed Fox News. I bring this up to bring you to the New York Post story about Glenn Youngkin. This story has only to do with the education of such matters. When conservatives are outraged over a video report from Fox News, how do you think they feel about surgeries? Very negatively. But when Glenn Youngkin wins an election in Virginia, which was which had swept with Democrats, what do you think this means for Democrats who embrace not just the education, but the surgeries. The New York Post editorial board states, making good on his campaign promises. Virginia's Governor Glenn Youngkin has overseen a new state guidance on how schools should handle trans issues, reversing some of the last governor's extreme policies. Schools can no longer keep kids' choices secrets from their parents. Gone are rights to compete in sports as your ID, ID gender, as opposed to biological. Same for bathrooms, locker rooms, and other such other such spaces. Father, daughter, dances, and the like are no longer verbotan. Naturally, the Washington Post, New York Times, et cetera, framed this as rolling back trans students' rights. When in fact, it's a rebalancing. It's a clear win for female students, athletes in particular, for parents and for kids who don't actually suffer permanent gender dysphoria but are just confused, which too often proves to be the case. Though the individual in question may not sort it all out, until they've had irreversible surgery, that's because there's an entire industry and an ideological cheering section actively pushing this as a best solution. Schools and parents need to treat all these kids with love and kindness absolutely. And the new guidelines say so. They simply excise the heavy-handed idiocy that the old guidance imposed. Virginians elected young kin to start restoring sanity to their public schools. Good for him to be doing so. And now we have from Matt Walsh, he says, Tennessee will become the first state in the country to make surgical and medical gender transitions for children illegal. We will pave the way. This is just the beginning. Marjorie Taylor Greene responds, Georgia next. The 118th Congress must pass the protect children's innocent act to make it a felony to perform gender affirming care in quotes on minors. If we don't, some states are going to do the opposite of Tennessee and protect general mutilation of kids before they are old enough to vote. If a person cannot consent, then they cannot consent and children cannot consent. That's it. Now we have a question about parents. Fine. We do. There is a question about parents. Do they have the right to consent on behalf of their children and the answer is yes. They do. They absolutely do. In Florida, we have questions about parental rights and education. And there were concerns about schools refusing to tell parents about the anxiety or other sufferings of these children. A law was passed called the Parental Rights and Education Bill, which says that teachers can't withhold this information. The left called it don't say gay, which is weird because you also couldn't say straight and argued that it would force teachers to out their students. What do you mean out the students? The children are being raised and guarded by their parents. The parents have more of a right than the teachers. Well, there's a question here. Do the parents have a right to consent? Some argued that the schools shouldn't be giving sex add to children without parental consent. What if the parents decide they should? The Bible, for instance, has some passages that are adult in nature. What if a parent says, no, I think the children should read the Bible? Well, it's up to the parents. What if there's a book on gender ideology? Well, then it's going to be up to the parents. And that means they may be left or right that I agree with. But when it comes to the issue of sex change surgeries, things get particularly interesting. How a parent takes care of their child is up to them. And I don't think I don't think that other people should intervene on their behalf. There's a challenge here logically and based on our principles. I understand the conservative position. They think parents are being misled or are just wrong. And I also think we have a risk here too. But let's break this down because there are challenges. I believe there are many parents suffering from Munchausen syndrome by proxy. That is parents who want attention. So they claim their children are suffering from some ailment or otherwise. Then they seek out surgeries on these kids and ruin their lives. That needs to be checked for. I think there is a challenge here. I personally don't believe that children should ever get a sex change operation or medication. However, I'm not the parent. And sometimes there are issues of the government intervening or not intervening. And I don't know when the right place to intervene would be. All I can really say is I'd prefer the government not to be involved at all for the most part. But that means there's going to be parents going to doctors and doctors telling them to permanently sterilize their children. That's worrying to me. However, most of you know, I come to a more libertarian position on many of these things and I defer, I defer to the government not being involved in this to a certain degree. It's tough. It absolutely is. But I'm going to go with the parents on this one. Now that being said, the science I believe is coming clear with Sweden, Finland, Denmark, other Scandinavian countries questioning this stuff. I think it's now high time. We do intervene. My point is this. If the doctors are saying this is a legal procedure and we recommend it, how, how could the state intervene? That's my point. They intervene at the point of legislation. This is what I'm trying to say at current. There isn't any. And if the parents are being given this advice, then they should follow it. Or are they should they should do what they deem necessary? What should be done, in my opinion, is that the state should decide some things are beyond reproach. So let me make sure I'm making this clear. Right now, I think it's up to the parents. However, I think we should elect leaders who pass legislation making this illegal, not an option. I believe these doctors currently are wrong, but they are operating within the law. The law should be changed. Short of that, I don't think intervention before legislation is appropriate because I don't think the government should intervene on the personal opinions of where we are. We're following the science though. So we got to move fast. I don't think this should be allowed to be continued. We used to allow lobotomies. Yeah. Yeah, we don't do that anymore. I think what we're seeing now with sex changes for kids is going to backfire in Democrats faces. It's going to result in Republicans winning. And this one issue will result in Republicans getting through many other issues, notably issues of abortion pro life. We're going to see more of that. I would say right now what we need are for is for these representatives, Marjorie Taylor Greene, making note of this at the federal level to say, we will no longer permit this. Why? Because the science says so. Just take a look at our progressive friends across the pond over in Scandinavian countries. They're out right saying it. We should probably follow that right? Right. CBN Forbes Yanks article about teen girl who detransitioned claiming it violated editorial guidelines. How strange. Here's one of these stories that I think people need to hear. And when you do, you'll understand why the Democrats are looking to lose. And they're being backed into a corner. And I'll stress this again. When you share this video, when people say to you, children aren't getting sex changes, refer them to Chloe Cole at just 15 years old. Chloe Cole underwent a surgery that radically changed her life. She had a double mastectomy after taking puberty blockers, believing she was a transgender male born in the wrong body. Forbes initially published an article critical of an now 18 year old Cole, who has spoken out about the dangers of body altering surgeries for children and teenagers. The outlet has since removed the story written by transgender writer Don Ennis from its website. Ennis, a male who identifies as female, originally wrote the piece for the LA Los Angeles blade, a pro LGBT website. It was republished to Forbes on Sunday and immediately drew criticism for content many readers believe to be factually inaccurate. We remove the article because it violated her editorial guideline for publishing work that was published elsewhere. We only accept original content. One of the leading critics of the piece was Libs of TikTok, who quoted from the piece, but her campaign is based on lies. The fact checking fact checking team at PolitiFact determined Raichik's viral claim was false. While there have been exceptions for some 15, 16, 17 year olds, most surgeons won't operate on anyone younger than 18. Quote, miners aren't getting gender affirming surgery except when they are incredible journalism. That's right. Children are look at jazz Jennings. And I mean this in no way to spectral to the celebrity. That is jazz who has a TV show in any way. Just to point out jazz exists. Jazz is or was a transgender child and is now a transgender adult who received medical intervention to prevent puberty. It happened because of this jazz did not develop fully. And that resulted in some complications. These are all facts. This stuff does happen. They're going to say Cole for her part has become an outspoken critic of early intervention in the lives of children who believe they are transgender, arguing these significant body altering treatments, procedures and surgeries irreparably change a person's life. The California native, a target of those who support the trans movement started to identify as trans at just 12 years old by 13 she was taking prescribed puberty blockers and testosterone supplements and underwent a double mastectomy at 15. That is a child. Two years later, Cole realized she'd made a huge mistake. She regretted everything. Now 18 years old should become a staunch supporter of the increasingly vocal D transitioners movement, a group of people who want identified as transgender, but have since realized it was not the cure. All they hoped and has claimed in the removed article, which still remains public on the blades website that Cole is an outlier and argued most surgeons won't operate on anyone younger than 18. In mid-August Boston's Children Hospital faced criticism, criticism for a since deleted video in which medical personnel promoted what they refer to as gender affirming hysterectomies for young girls to identify as trans. They scrubbed the video. I'm sorry, thus scrubbed the video highlighted by Libs of TikTok was part of a larger series published by Boston Children's Hospital nearly a year ago. In one of the other videos, when does a child know they're trans? Dr. Jeremy Carswell, director of the gender Multi-Spectralty Service at BCH claims children will often know that their transgender from the moment that they have the ability to express themselves. I'm just going to say in my opinion, and I'm not a doctor, just because a child plays with alternate toys or wears the other gender's clothing does not make them trans. And they've actually stated this many experts have come out and said, if a child plays with dolls or action figures, they may be trans. That's one of the signs. I humbly disagree. I do not believe in these sexist misogynistic to stereotypes. I believe that some men wear skirts. They're called kilts, but they look like it. I know they're different to a certain degree, but there are many men who dress in women's clothing who aren't trans and aren't even gay. Maybe they just like it. I don't know. Maybe for some of these older men, it's just a fetish or something, but they certainly wouldn't want surgery. For these children, they may just be exploring social norms. And that's totally okay. In fact, Mad Walsh even said this before. I believe I believe it's something like this. If his kid wants to play with dolls, he'd say, okay, you play with dolls, but you're a boy. You're allowed to play with dolls. Just do what you want. The funny thing is I read once, I could be wrong, that pink used to be the boys color. When children were born, boys were given pink and girls were given blue. And at some point, it just changed. I don't know. Maybe it did. I have no idea. Do you know that Republicans used to be blue and Democrats were red? And then it wasn't until I think the 80s that they started changing the colors and associating Republicans with red and Democrats with blue. It's funny how that works, doesn't it? Anyway, look, there are a lot of kids that are suffering and they're experiencing anxiety, and I think social media plays a large role in this. I've heard many stories about kids who are suffering from gender dysphoria, but it turns out they weren't. It was social anxiety from peer pressure and it manifested in an outward appearance of gender dysphoria. These kids were given appropriate therapy, treatment from a medical professional, and ultimately came to be better without the need of surgery. This is what they're doing and are more progressive neighboring, you know, friends, are more progressive friends, countries, Scandinavia. They're giving them psychotherapy. And you know what appears to be working better. The problem right now is that you'll see these videos of people like billboard Chris walking around saying, Hey, I think this stuff is wrong. The far left extremists will scream in their face and yell at them, ignoring the science. I want these kids to be safe. Happy. I want them to be better. I think some of these kids are genuinely dysphoric. There are many people on the right or who just oppose the left, oppose the wokeness who don't think so. No, they're entitled to their opinions. But when Alex Jones comes out and says that Atrazine, for instance, is an endocrine disruptor that was turning frogs in a hamaphrodites, you have to wonder what endocrine disruptors will do to human beings, plastics, phthalates, PCBs, etc. I think that stuff in the womb is probably leading to this. So we hear a lot about trans kids. And we say there's a big explosion of trans kids. Bill Maher says either we're creating them, or we're, we're, you know, I've read exactly what he said, either it's a social pressure or it's something really happening. But why then only California, why not Ohio? I will tell you, it could be social. I think a social component is yes, no matter what, even if it really is true, endocrine disruption, I believe social issues play a role. But look at this way. A woman gets pregnant. She is drinking from plastic bottles nonstop. Those PCBs can affect the fetus. I've covered stories about how certain birth controls masculine and I masculinized female fetus brains. I believe we are going to be dealing with that and we need to make sure these people are getting appropriate treatment. My main point in all of this, I don't think irreversible surgery is the treatment. Because you're basically ending these children's, these human beings ability to procreate and live full lives. They may suffer from gender dysphoria, but maybe they just need social support. I don't have all the answers. What I can say is, we can see that something is truly happening. A lot of it is social and this doesn't appear to be the path according to the science. These people are jumping the gun and they're so angry at the right, they're failing to see that. I'll leave it there. The consequences come this November. Next segment's coming up tonight at eight p.m. over at youtube.com slash Timcast IRL. Thanks for hanging out and I'll see you all then. A man has admitted that he got in an SUV and he ran down a teenager crushing him, killing him, and he did it because he said the kid was part of a Republican extremist group. That man is now free on bond. Think about any other circumstance that we've seen in this country and it's always the same story. Let's talk about Kyle Rittenhouse. He's in his own neighborhood where his family lives. He has a legal firearm. The city is being ransacked and burned down. Someone threatens to murder him several times, chases him and only after someone fires a gun does Rittenhouse turn around and only after this man reaches for the weapon and nearly grabs it does Kyle fire upon him. He flees to the police. He's attacked. He went to jail for over two months. They did not let him out. He did eventually post bond or bail or whatever and get out. Think about how the media maligned him. How they said that he crossed state lines with a weapon. No. That he wasn't even from there. That he was hunting down black people that he was a white supremacist all of the lies. And of course it's not just him. Think about, you know, think about what happened in the summer of love in Minnesota. David Dorn, for instance, people who were killed and murdered and we don't hear anything about these people. And then think about what happens with Chauvin and other officers. Right? Another big story where apparently one of the officers is going to be getting like three years in prison and he has a register as a predatory offender or something like that. And here we have a story where a man has confessed. He has outright stated that he did this over politics. Terrorism. Free on bond. Like that a couple days later. Yeah. So when people say there's not going to be a civil war, it might deescalate. I think, I think you're wrong. I think you are in it. People are killing other people. And it's clear that the legal system is only flowing in one direction. As it's been for some time, Antifa and BLM can go and destroy cities and Kamala Harris can bail them out, raise money from other people to do so. Joe Biden's staff can do the same thing. Yet Kyle Rittenhouse acting independently in his own neighborhood defending his his community. Yeah. The media tries to destroy his life. And even now, I'm hearing reports, I don't know too much details, but he's facing civil lawsuits. Yeah. From Fox News, North Dakota, man free. The North Dakota man who allegedly admitted to fatally striking a teenage pedestrian with his car because the pair had a political argument was released from jail on Tuesday after posting $50,000 bond. Shannon Brant 41 spent just days in Stutzman County jail and criminal charges related to the death of 18 year old Kayla Ellington before he posted his $50,000 bond and was released. Brant, a Glenfield resident was arrested in the early morning hours of Sunday after he told the state first responders radio that he struck the pedestrian because the pedestrian was threatening him. According to a probable cause affidavit provided to a Fox News digital on Wednesday morning. Brant stated the pedestrian called some people and Brant was afraid they were coming to get him. Brant admitted to state radio that he hit the pedestrian and the pedestrian was part of a Republican extremist group. Oh, he was being threatened, which justifies why he got into an SUV and chased the kid down. The kid called his mom saying this guy was threatening him and then he killed him in a vehicle. Okay. North Dakota Highway Patrol on Sunday reported that there was a street dance on Jones Street near Honeck Street in McHenry when Brant struck Ellington and then fled the scene. Interesting. Ellington was rushed to a local hospital with serious injuries but could not be saved. Brant and Ellington's families both shut up at the scene shortly after police arrived. He or they were chasing him. Here's what the probable cause affidavit says. On September 18th, I blank redacted was conducted by redacted. Looks like it says sergeant something and requested to respond to Northern Foster County for a fatality hit and run accident. I responded from my resident north of Jamestown according to state radio logs. The reporting party identified as Shannon Brant stated that he struck the pedestrian because the pedestrian was threatening him. Well, that has some clarification. It wasn't it wasn't initially as it was reported that because he was just a Republican. Brant stated that the pedestrian called some people and Brant was afraid they were coming to get him. Brant admitted to state radio that he hit the pedestrian and that the pedestrian was part of a Republican extremist group. Once on scene, I met with redacted and was shown the area of the incident. Limited evidence was observed in the night time. A first responder who was first on scene was interviewed and showed where the male pedestrian's body was approximately located. The responder identified as redacted stated the family of the pedestrian showed up along with the family of Brant shortly after his arrival. I declared her penalty of perjury under North Cordellaw before going is true that the foregoing is true and correct. Just a couple weeks. After Joe Biden said these people are a threat, a paranoid and psychotic man fears an 18 year old kid and claims he's being threatened gets in his vehicle, runs him down. Now, the thing is, this kid apparently called his mom and said this dude was threatening him or coming after him or something like that and he needed to be picked up. Doesn't sound like this guy's story makes a whole lot of sense. Sounds like he's paranoid and he heard Joe Biden saying the mug of Republicans and he's like, Oh, this mug of children dangerous psychopaths and he's free walking around capable of doing it again in a paranoid delusional state. This guy should have been remanded. You know, this idea he was being threatened. You're in a car, dude. You're in an SUV and there's a bunch of kids leave chasing him down and ramming him in an alley. No, no, hold on. I don't know the full details. I don't know exactly what happened. We've seen stories like in Provo, Utah, where a guy's driving down the street and some some anti-viguy shoots him, runs up to the window and shoots him. We've seen, we've seen similar stories and it's hard to know exactly what went down. But I think so far what we know, this guy regardless should not be out publicly on bail. Ellington's parents later told police they knew Brant, but they did not believe their son did. Ellington's mother described how she was on her way to pick up her son from McHenry when he called her and said that he or they were chasing him. She could no longer reach him after that. So this guy was being threatened, but he was chasing this kid. He's lying. Investigators later tracked Brant to his Glenfield home where they stopped him outside the house and he began talking. He admitted to consuming alcohol. So he was driving drunk, driving drunk, chased down some kid, killed him. Now hold on. Maybe the kid was just saying he's chasing me. Who knows the details? Here's what we can't say. A man in a vehicle said he was threatened. He was drinking. He crushed a kid. Here's what we have from the police probable cause affidavit. Redacted responded to Brant's parents house in rural McHenry and then to Brant's house in Glenfield. There Brant was interviewed by Sergeant redacted outside his residence and admitted to consuming alcohol prior to the incident. Brant admitted to striking the pedestrian with his car because he had a political argument with the pedestrian and believed the pedestrian was calling people to come get him. Brant admitted to leaving the scene, the scene of the incident and returning shortly after where he called 911. Brant did not remain on scene till law enforcement arrived and ultimately returned to his residence. Brant was placed under arrest for DUI, redacted and wow redacted and trans so there's another another charge that we're not seeing and transported to Stutzman County jail. Brant was advised of his Miranda rights and the implied consent advisory. Brant consented to a chemical breath test. The result of the chemical breath test were above the legal limit of 0.08. He was drunk, delusional, chased down a kid and killed him and this guy released on bail. The judge said $50,000. This guy is a he's probably a blue and non psychopath cultist. One of these people who's sitting there watching CNN shaking and going, oh, and he killed a kid. He killed a kid. Teenager young man. Fine. Either way. It's crazy. Brant was ultimately charged with criminal vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of a crash involving a death. Jail records show Brant was charged with driving under the influence though criminal complaint did not include the charge. They say the reports headline was updated to clarify that Brant allegedly admitted to striking the teenager not killing him. Oh, I suppose that's important, but it did kill him. So if he admitted to striking the teen what the kid then got up slipped fell hit his head and then died. Sorry. This is the crazy thing here from the postpilonial. North Dakota man who intentionally killed conservative failed to render aid and fled scene. Now you want to argue, I suppose that allegedly he did these things fine, innocent until proven guilty. Just because the police are saying he did it. I'd like to see how the court case is resolved. But if the man really did admit to hitting the teen with an SUV, then I believe he admitted to intentionally killing the teenager. Early Sunday morning, Shannon Brant allegedly ran over 18 year old Kayla Ellington. Now the revelation here, which was mentioned in Fox News, let me let me read a little bit more here. Mia Cathall says an affidavit says Brant fatally struck the teen over a political argument. I've a Mia Cathall says I've obtained a search warrant and criminal complaint that says Brant failed to render aid to the dying teen who was found slain in an alleyway, fled the fatal hit and run crime and returned to his residence in a different city where he was later arrested. So this may be slightly incorrect. The teen apparently had very serious injuries, was dying and was left to die. This is important. He died apparently at the hospital. They could not save him. This is important because it's possible that had this guy rendered aid, this 18 year old may have actually lived. This is the world that we live in right now. And I don't know to tell you, they're trying to take away your right to defend yourself. Antifa and a black and black classmates are ran up and shot a guy in Provo, Utah. They couldn't, dozens died in the, in the summer of love riots, the George Floyd riots. And this is where we are now, only a couple weeks after Joe Biden's unhinged rant, screaming of the threat of Trump supporters. He tried walking it back, but we know what he was talking about. This happens. I want to show you the inversion here. Matt Walsh, he, he responds to a guy named Zach Hunt. Let's see. Who is this Zach guy? Zach is just a, is a verified Twitter guy. He says, Hey, FBI and the Justice Department and Minneapolis are not, it's, it's M and Metro Nashville Police Department. So I assumed M and was Minnesota. M and PD Nashville, Matt Walsh is targeting Vanderbilt hospital the same way he targeted Boston's Children Hospital. Please intervene before another one of his followers starts calling in bomb threats or worse. Matt Walsh has left us, start trying to get me arrested or for factual reporting on Vanderbilt's transgender clinic. Here's another one from Matt Walsh. Alejandra Caraballo, Caraballo, Vanderbilt Medical Center has had to shift medical appointments for its trans clinic to virtual telehealth appointments as a result of threats being made. Matt Walsh is inciting a terror campaign against a hospital and disrupting care. You will get people hurt or killed. Matt says, I'm reporting on what the hospital is doing and providing extensive documentation and video evidence. You are desperate to shut down any conversation about the drugging and mutilation of children because you know you can't defend it. This is their only tactic. We should have light on their own behavior and they cry incitement. It's pathetic gutless dishonest ploy that won't work. Now here's here's the point. Different stories. When Matt Walsh does reporting as a commentator and pundit and journalist, they call the police, they scream for the police, they claim he's inciting violence. On the right, where's uh, what's being done? What's being done about this man who literally just killed the teenager and admitted it was terrorism. Anything? Cricuts? Hmm. Nothing, I guess. Our good friend, Jack Passobic has this tweet. He says, here is the Republican in quotes, A. G. of North Dakota's first comments on the murder of Kayla Ellington. He said, first, good morning. Second, bail is set by judges, not prosecutors. Dog is MAGA response. And what is your recommendation for bail? And he says, States attorney is the prosecutor. It's absolutely quite incredible. The attorney general of North Dakota has a lot of powers and he can do a lot of things. He's the attorney general. He can go after this guy. He can do a lot. Look at what Merrick Garland is doing at the federal level. It's amazing. And this is it. He can't do anything. Can he? Okay. How about this? New York A. G. Leticia James announces lawsuit of Donald Trump, his company and his family members over fraud claims. You mean after several years of criminal accusations leaked to the press, the best they could muster up was a civil lawsuit because Trump's company did not do anything wrong. Or at least the Trump family didn't. That's all they could muster. I don't care about this story right now. My point is the A. G. of New York is bringing down the iron fist on Donald Trump. By any means necessary. A civil lawsuit over fraud claims, the best they could muster, but it's something they could. Meanwhile, the A. G. the Republican drew H. Riggly is just like, it's the prosecutor and the judge. Don't look at me. Yeah, Republicans are useless and everybody knows it. Everybody knows it. Everybody knows it. So what? I see these memes. They're really funny. It's like, you know, Republic of the RNC is asking for donations. And it's like, why would I give the RNC any money? I'm not you get nothing. I'm not giving you money. Sorry. Trump's people maybe. I don't trust Trump all that much to be completely honest. He raised a bunch of money off that stop the steel stuff that I think is just absurd. I think there are reforms we can enact. If there was like a voter integrity thing, I'd be fine with that. But I don't I don't necessarily trust Trump either, but I would donate directly to people I think are fighting and doing a good job. Rand Paul, I think does a great job. There's many MAGA Republicans who I think are doing a good job. I think Marjorie Taylor Greene is doing a good job. I think many of these many of these MAGA Republicans are fighting back. And this is why they lose their minds. The tactics used by the left, literally to murder children. Okay. He was 18. He's a young man. I'll slow down. Literally to murder teenagers. In this case, a teenager. Police to beat them, to attack them, to defend it, to fundraise on behalf of it, to ignore the problems and the threats, and then use the media to keep everyone silent. What do the Republicans do? Well, I'm going to have a humble argument with you about this. I'm sick of people like Drew Wrigley. I get it. The prosecutor is the one that's a prosecutor here, but he's the AG. There's a there's a ton of things he could do. But more importantly, if the left is willing to use the attorneys general in various jurisdictions to bring an iron fist down on their opponents, and it's unethical or wrong, well, then we're done. I had Rick Santorum on Tim Castile. Maybe you saw it. And respect, you know, I appreciate the guy coming on and voicing his opinion. I humbly disagree. He said, we can't play the same game. We have to play by the rules. We there. There, there. Let me explain something to you. We're all playing a game of monopoly right now. We're playing a good old game of monopoly. You roll the dog, boom, you land on Baltic Avenue or whatever. Hey, there you go. I'll buy it. And as you're going around the chessboard and playing by the rules, we are watching the left just grab $500 bills out of the bank. And you're like, you can't, you can't do that. It's cheating. And you're like, do you want to keep playing or not? And we're like, I guess that's what they're doing. And I mean, to be honest, quite literally, like the Federal Reserve and the printing of money, they're going around there. They land on the go to jail. They, you know, go directly to jail. And then they're like, no, and you're like, but you land and I don't care. Do you want to keep playing? It's like, fine, I guess, then you land on like Broadway. And you're like, I'm going to buy it. And they go actually go to jail. What? And they pick your piece up and they put it in the jail and you're like, but I'm not in jail. And they're like, you are, you want to keep playing? Yeah, okay, I guess. That's what it feels like all day every day. And then people say, why are you sitting here letting them do that? Why are you letting them put you in jail when your guy didn't even land on the on the go to jail thing? And their guy did. And you won't even put that. Well, I don't know, because they're the one who set the board up. They're the banker. They can just do it. You know, maybe stop playing. Maybe put their piece in jail. That's the game. The game is the left will cheat. The right won't. There you go. And you lose because they're literally this guy, he killed the kid. Okay, you know, figurative kid, teenager, a young man, he killed him. And he's free. He's walking around. No press coverage, no big media storm. This should be national news. The terroristic murdering of a Republican child. Okay, okay, I know, I know, I keep saying it. A Republican teenager. The terroristic murder. Nothing. Where's the Republican leaders? Look, where is even any of these federal politicians to come out and say, this is Joe Biden. There should be wall to wall outrage from every single Republican, a teenager who supports you, was murdered. There should be bills being introduced called the Kayler Ellington Act. There should be inquiries and there should be, I mean, Joe Biden should be impeached for this. There should be articles of impeachment introduced right now, because the words of Joe Biden himself has resulted in this. Don't tell me it's a coincidence that two weeks after Joe Biden says MAGA Republicans are extremists, that a guy says, he's a Republican extremist and then runs him down and flees the scene. Even the Republicans we like, where y'all at? I'm gonna, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna start texting people. I'm gonna start texting people being like, what's going on? I'm gonna start tweeting about it. I'm gonna start tweeting at people. Jack, come back on the show. Let's talk about it. Let's, let's sit here and, and, and call out as many Republicans as possible and say, why aren't you holding a press conference right now and demanding a federal investigation into what this guy did? Why aren't you calling out Joe Biden and demanding an apology? They do it. The left will do it. They'll blame Donald Trump for farting. Trump will fart and then they'll say that he's, he's coming after fast food restaurant workers or some other nonsense. They'll just make it up as they go. Yeah, well, there you go. This is worrying stuff, man. It's scary stuff. It's maddening. It's sad. Matt Walsh is reporting on Vanderbilt is, it's good stuff. It's good work. And so they're screaming that he's inciting violence. They want him arrested. They would wield the power of the FBI against a man for tweeting and we can't even get one person to call on any kind of action against this guy who ran down a kid. It's amazing, isn't it? You know, the media will scream and scream and scream about Donald Trump, even after Donald Trump is long out of office and we can't get anything about what just happened. He's free. He's free to go, free to go innocent until proven guilty. Yeah, we get it. This, there's going to be more of it. And unless the Republicans in North Dakota and at the federal level are willing to actually do their jobs and push back, then it's going to get worse. I'll leave it there. Next segment's coming up at 1 p.m. on this channel. Thanks for hanging out and I'll see you all then. Over the past few years, I have reported consistently on stories and opined on stories about pending food shortages. That's right. From chicken shortages to the rising cost of mannehs, I have told you faithful viewer many times that we may be facing food shortages and inflation. I could put us at risk. I must apologize and issue a correction and retraction. I now believe we will not be facing a food shortage. Thanks to our good friends over in California. Decomposing human remains can legally be used as compost from 2027. Thanks to new California law aimed at tackling climate change. Oh, I was worried for a minute. I was like, how are we going to grow crops? How are we going to get food? Now we got it all figured out in California. You just take a human body, decompose it and use that as soil. Uh huh. Yes. Right. Are you excited? How do you feel now? Are you more worried about the food supply or less? You're going to have food, my friend. Don't worry. It's just made from composted people. Well, of course, the plants grew from the corpses. Okay. Okay. Let me calm down a little bit. I still think food shortages are coming. We have numerous stories saying as such. And now we're getting these alarming profit reports where they're saying that next year, the forecast for corporations is dropping dramatically. A major global recession is coming. The one of the top executives at Fed X said something like that would be happening. So maybe it's going to get bad. I'm not entirely sure. I do think it will be bad. But of course, I always say I'm not sure. I'm not a psychic. And then everyone's going to come on and be like Tim pulled predicted and he was wrong. It's like, no, no, no, look, the stories that are coming out predict that it's going to get worse. Conveniently, there's a story about us using human compost. So I don't know if there will be a food shortage, but it looks like there will be. And if there isn't, I'm not sure how I will feel about the food that I'm eating in the first place. I'm going to be checking the ingredients for cricket. And I'm going to be checking the ingredients for, well, actually, they wouldn't tell you. You are not going to know if you're eating human compost corn. You see, that's what's soilent green got wrong. Soilent green is people, they say, I believe it was the end of the film. But what they get wrong is they're not going to feed you the people. They're going to feed the people to the pigs and then feed the pigs to you. They're going to filter the human through some kind of vehicle, either because the corn will grow from your corpse and then we'll eat the corn or a pig will eat it and then we'll eat the pig or a cow will be for I don't think cow can eat human anyway, but I think pigs can. Then you'll eat the bacon and you'll be like, this bacon sure does taste good. I wonder why only the finest human fed pork. I like my, uh, I like my beef grass fed. So, you know, it is what it is. All right, here's the story from the Daily Mail decomposing human remains can legally be used as compost. All right, how about this? Before we get started, my friends, head over to safe and ready meals.com. You can get a one month 30 day emergency food kit lasts up to 25 years for 229 bucks. You save 60 bucks. Let me tell you my friends, you can also get, I think they might have a bigger one. Save and ready meals is just marketing the one month with inflation. Here's, here's what I'm saying. When I bought my emergency food, it was a bit cheaper than this and I don't blame them for prices going up. It's not their fault. We can blame Joe Biden for a variety of reasons. I do think Putin takes some of the blame on this one. Absolutely. Warren Ukraine is disrupting global food supplies and there's a lot that's happening that's hurting us. I think I'm going to throw it to the commander in chief and our and Congress. The government is being mismanaged, but suffice to say, it's a good idea to have this stuff. You buy it now for 229. What happens in a year when inflation is 10% maybe more, maybe it's 20 and Germany was 45. Then they're going to be going for 300 bucks or maybe 260. You get it now at last for 25 years, it's cheaper. What is this? It's a big bucket. You pop it up and congratulations. You got a bucket. Now inside that bucket, you got little packages of freeze dried food. Actually, I don't know if it's freeze dried, but it's a, it's packaged food that lasts for 25 years. You mix it in with some water, you heat it up, boom, you got mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, you got stew, you got pancake mix. We actually eat every soft and I'll just say that. Safer, many meals.com. You've got two potential worst case scenarios, I guess. Worst case scenario apocalypse happens. The disaster happens. A flood happens. A war happens. You've got food. So that's actually a good thing. But then let's say nothing happens. Let's say you were wrong and you bought this food and then nothing happens and you didn't end up needing it. Congratulations. You can eat it. It's food. It's a win-win because now, let's go to the main story. California will begin offering the option of human composting after death thanks to a bill recently signed into law that aims to tackle climate change. Human composting, also known as natural organic reduction would be an option for residents who don't want to be buried or cremated upon their death starting in 2027. The process involves placing the body inside a long reusable steel container along with wood chips and flowers to aerate it, allowing microbes and bacteria to break down the remains. Approximately one month later, the remains will fully decompose and be turned into soil. Advocates for the bill, which was signed into law by Governor Newsom on Sunday, said that the NOR is more climate friendly option. Okay, now hold on. I don't know what they're going to do with that soil, but heaven held bus, it is soil. Please. Are you going to put the soil in a coffin? I don't think so. I think it's soil. What are they going to do with it? They say cremation in the US alone and it's about 360,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. Well, and to be fair, you burn your body up and we go into the atmosphere. I think we're less grossed out by that. The trees and the plants absorb it, sure, sure, but not the same as like planting things in human soil or mixing human soil into other soil. The bill bans the combining of various people's remains unless they're related, but it does not make it illegal to sell the soil that results from the process or use it to grow food for human consumption. Oh, it's happening, isn't it? I hope this is sensationalist nonsense. I hope we don't go there just because it didn't make it illegal doesn't mean it's going to happen. But Murphy's law man, someone's going to be sitting on a big old pile of soil and be like, why not sell it? Welcome to the future, my friends. The future is gross. AB351 will provide an additional option for California residents that is more environmentally friendly and gives them another choice for burial. Okay, now I want to pause right there. Personally, I don't want to be embalmed or stuffed in a coffin. I don't even really want to be cremated. I want someone to just throw me in a trash, you know, like Danny DeVito's character and so he said, he said, that's what you're going to do with me when I die. It's so many trash. Now you can't do that legally, but the next best thing is Viking funeral. I would personally rather my body decompose and be reabsorbed into nature because we are nature as opposed to being locked in a box that creeps me out. Put me on a little ship, put some hay all over it, kick me out into the ocean, fire arrow, let me go. I mean, I guess it's kind of cremation. But if you could, I mean, just to find a plot of land, no coffin, no embalming, just right there. I guess the reason you can't do it though is because it'll attract critters and there's weird smell and stuff like that. But I'd rather decompose naturally than be locked in a box. That's for sure. The only thing I take issue with is I would prefer then that if that war to happen, no one would take that soil and grow plants over it. That's creepy like in that movie secret window. Quote, with climate change and sea level rise is very real threats to our environment. This is an alternative method of final disposition that won't contribute emissions into our atmosphere. I look forward to continuing my legacy to fight for clean air by using my reduced remains to plant a tree, she wrote, noting that she herself may choose the method when she passes away. I'm okay with a tree, but like not a fruit tree. I mean, it's just kind of, there's this thing that can turn you into mushrooms where they like wrap you up and then mushrooms start absorbing your body. And then there's also a thing where they can like make you a tree by putting, they wrap you up and then they put you in the ground and then they put like seeds over something and the tree starts absorbing you and then you become the tree or something like that, I guess. I also don't know. I feel about that. Quote, with cremation instead of sitting with our person and saying goodbye, we are very divorced from the process. Truman said when a body is composted by his facility, the resulting soil is returned to the family to do it as they wish. Some customers have planted trees or flowers while others have spread it into the ocean. Okay, I'm okay with that. That's actually totally fine. My concern is people using it for food okay, and just because they didn't make it illegal, I mean, it's going to happen. I just want to make that clear. She had the process was developed. Oh, no, and oh, are you essentially the same process as a home gardening composting system. She added the process was developed for livestock, not humans orgies. These methods of disposable were used to lessen the possibility of disease being transmitted by the dead carcass. Using these same methods for the transformation of human remains can create an unfortunate spiritual emotional and psychological distancing from the deceased. Washington Colorado and Oregon have all legalized the process of composting human remains. However, Colorado does not allow the soil to be sold or used to grow food for human consumption, but they'll allow the food to be grown for animal consumption and then you can eat the animals. Now, I know, I know at a certain point, we are nature. If you die and then your body rots and then plants grow and then something comes along and eats those plants, okay, okay, it's not like you're eating human. If you kill the deer and eat it and the deer ate leaves from a tree and the tree was from a person at a certain point, the cycle continues that I can get. I just don't like the idea of them taking the soil and then growing vegetables or something and then you want to eat it. It's like it's a little too close for comfort. They're going to say under a bill recently passed by New York state legislature, other only cemeteries would be allowed to apply for a license to offer human composting. Yeah, what we should do is we should bury you with a tombstone and that's the soil and then we don't disturb it. Maybe in 100, 200 years, everything will get mixed up and you know, eroded or whatever. We'll see. Yeah, man. See, here's the issue. Well, I have stated numerous times just because they're going to allow the composting and just because they didn't make the use of soil for human consumption illegal doesn't mean it's going to happen. But hold on there a minute. World food shortage going from bad to worse, UN official says, oh boy, I'll tell you what's going to happen. I'm telling you, I'll tell you what could happen. There's a food shortage, a fertilizer shortage and they're going to say we need fertile soil. What do we do? And they're going to be like, well, y'all can starve to death or you can use the human soil and people are going to be like, I'm hungry. I will eat tree bark. And then they will use it because as we know, soil and green is people. It's from August 23rd. It's from a month ago, rising global food prices brought on by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and commodity shortages trigger by climate emergencies, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. We get it. A food shortage is coming. It's the story that keeps getting from going from bad to worse. UN World Food Program Chief Economist, Eryph Hussein told Yahoo Finance. When the World Food Program is setting records, that's not a good thing for the world. And we've been doing that since at least 2021. According to the World Food Program, 50 million people across 45 countries are already on the verge of famine. Another 345 million people are approaching starvation across more than 80 countries who Hussein said a 25% increase from the start of the year. And it's particularly bad in Africa, in India, in parts of South America. Yikes, man. Now I think we here in the United States were mostly okay. Mostly. It's going to get bad for a lot of people. If you're working class, middle class, lower class, your prices are going to squeeze you dry. It'll be brutal. But it's going to be apocalyptic for people in Africa, North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, in the Middle East. It's going to be apocalyptic. They go to mention that the war is exacerbating the crisis, blah, blah, blah. A shortage of fertilizer coming from Russia, one of the most important suppliers has only added the problems driving import dependent countries with higher costs and less food to eat. You could easily put about 50 million people to the consequence of war. Oh man, look at this. Russia and Ukraine dominate grain trade. Look at that. Russia. What is that? They're doing like 200,000 or 20,000. 1,000. Wow. Metric tons. That's crazy. That is a lot. And you know, it's not just that they're not exporting grain. It's the fertilizer as well. There are a lot of countries that are not sustainable. And that's just the reality. The reality is that many of these countries import food because they can't produce enough. You know, that's not going to work in the long run. You can't do that. Russia can make more food than it needs. Okay. Well, then maybe Russia should have more kids and eat their own food. It's a problem and we have to use major massive vehicles, chock full of fossil fuels to transport grain from Russia to say, you know, the Pacific Islands or to Africa or whatever. Yo, that's crazy. And because of that, they're going to eat. They're going to have more kids and it's going to make the problem worse. Sooner or later, this was bound to happen. Regions that can't produce enough food for their populations are unsustainable regions. So it's no surprise that we're seeing now in the US these moves. Now, as they mentioned, several states already allow this. So, uh, yeah, I think it's coming. I don't know how. I don't know when and maybe you'll never hear about it because they won't want you to know. Think of it this way. Do you know how hot dogs are made? Most people don't. What about chicken McNuggets from McDonald's? I love it when I say McDonald's people like, it's McDonald's Tim, like as if I don't know that. Yes, I know. I call it McDonald's because it's funny. So anyway, there was that whole controversy around pink slime where it's like, I think it was the nuggets. They like pull a lever and like pink slime comes out and then they just mash it into shapes with the machine and then it fries them and like, that's your chicken. And then people are like, I don't want to eat pink slime. Yes, you do. Chicken McNuggets tastes great. Actually, no, I'm not a big fan to become less. I would go for boneless wings. Real real cut, rest meat. And maybe, you know, I prefer traditional wings. I like the dark meat better. It's healthier too. But once people figured out that that what that pink slime was, they were like, I don't want to eat this sooner or later, my friends, you're in for a world of fun. Sooner or later that pink slime is going to be supplemented with crickets. And I'm not kidding, crickets and roaches and whatever else. The pink slime, I mean, I'm surprised I'm not doing it already. In fact, a good business person would be trying it because think about the cheap supplemental protein. Now the chitin, I think it's called is indigestible bug protein. So I don't know how that'll work for us. But if you mill, if you mill into a paste, the cricket, and then you mix it in with the pink slime, I'm willing to bet people wouldn't notice. And they could still call it a chicken nugget because it's a miknugget, not a nugget and a miknugget. Well, that's a trademark term. If they added 10% cricket, basically cutting their chicken with cricket, who would really know? It's coming. I'm telling you this. We've already seen, I think it's up in Canada, they have like cheese puffs and the ingredient is cricket in the back. But how many people don't, they're walking the store and they're like, Oh, cheese puffs and they grab it. And then they're eating it and they're like, taste fine to me. I'll be honest with you guys. If it tastes fine, I don't care. I'll eat cricket. I really don't care. But cricket doesn't taste good. At least raw. If I went to a store and they had like a bug burger, I'd be like, I'll try it. You know, I'll try, I'll try, you know, I wouldn't try anything. Some people say they try anything once. I wouldn't. Some things I just be like, not interested. You know, something like I wouldn't eat blowfish, puffer fish or whatever, because there could be toxic ends like this is not worth it. If it's going to be cut just right or whatever, I think that's true. I don't know. Fact check me on the blowfish thing. My point is like if someone said this burger is made from chicken and cricket, I'd be like, I'll taste it. You know, and if it tastes good, I'll eat it. I really don't care. This whole thing that people are scared of eating bugs is funny to me. It's like, bro, if you were living in the woods, you would eat every bug you found and you do it with a smile on your face. I am not above survival preference. Okay. If I have a choice, I got chickens. Chicken's going to eat the bugs for me, not me. And then I'll eat the eggs and I'll eat the chickens. That's the weirdest thing to me that like they want you to eat bugs. When you can filter the bugs through the chickens, the chickens then crap on the ground, which makes the ground more fertile and then vegetables grow. It's like, it's perfect, man. It's you could farm. You don't got to eat human soil vegetables or whatever. Let's tell you how you do it. You plant the garden. You learn how to do the garden right. You grow your vegetables and then here's the best part. The chickens come in right before planting season and they till the soil for you. This is true. Yeah. So we had a garden. Here's what happens. After we harvest all the vegetables and we're done and the growing season is over, we didn't preserve it. Actually, we did make jam. We preserved. We made preserves. That was really cool with the wine berries, but those are wild. The next spring, we unleash the chickens and they rampage about the field tearing it up because they scrape the ground looking for bugs. They eat the bugs, turn the bugs into eggs. I love the eggs. I eat the eggs. We've yet to eat the chickens because chickens still too young, but soon we will be eating them as well, except for the original members of Chicken City. And then the dirt is all turned up and scratched out and you can start planting stuff. It's perfect. Why live this way? Like, who wants to live this way? That to me is so weird. They're like, why don't you just eat the bugs? And it's like, no, thanks. I'll give the bugs to my chickens. They don't want you to have chickens. Isn't that weird? They don't want you to have cows? What do cows do? Cows eat grass. It's it's it. Now we had a Daniel Turner on his got a farm and he was like grain fed beef grows way faster. Yeah, because grain is more easily digested and it's full of carbs and starches and stuff. Grass, they got a they hack it up chew the cud swallow it, hack it up and things like that. But they just walk around eating the grass. They're like mowing the lawn. What's the problem? It's very, very weird. Now I get it. People in big cities are crazy, in my opinion. If you went out and homesteaded by yourself, everything's way more sustainable, way less pollution, and the human homesteading and farming process actually creates a beautiful cycle of nature, which is better for the environment. So how about the city full stop being so dependent on these massive polluting systems? People get out of the cities, learn how to be responsible for themselves. So we don't got to worry about using humans to make our soil. I'm going to go ahead and pass on that one. And I'll tell you right now, my friends, maybe not right now, maybe not for a while, but sooner or later, something like this is going to come sooner or later, you will go to Walmart and you'll pick up bargain bin soil and you'll be like, I wonder why it's so cheap. And then in the bottom, it'll say with a little asterisk, soil from composted human remains or better yet, it won't. It'll be like in the fine print on the back, but you won't read it and you'll come on and you'll be pouring the soil out. And some teeth will fall out and you'll be like, why are there human teeth in the soil? It's like, sometimes it slips through. Good luck. That's what I'm saying to people. Good luck. I mean it. I mean it seriously. To all of those legitimate preppers, they're laughing at me saying this, this city slicker comes out here and thinks he knows how to survive. Not really. I think I'd be in trouble too, but I think I'll do better than the city folk who are sitting there laughing at the prospect of buying emergency food. Like, I don't need it. I can, I can eat the air. Is it? Yeah. I don't, I don't think they're actually, they actually think they can eat the air. They just think food will always be there. One of these days, it won't be. And this is what you'll get to eat. I'll leave it there. Next segment is coming up at four p.m. over at youtube.com slash Timcast. Thanks for hanging out. And I'll see you all then."
