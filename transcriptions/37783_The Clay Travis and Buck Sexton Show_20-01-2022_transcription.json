A lot of people, very well meaning people who cared about me, just thought that it was caused by a diet, or can be cured by diet and exercise. Especially right after I was diagnosed, people saying, what was it that you ate, or are you going to have to change your diet to get rid of this? There's still a lot of, you know, people see me pick up some kind of dessert and they're like, oh, should you really be eating that? Or thinking, you know, if they give sugar-free things to people, that's helpful. Listen to Health Discovered on the iHeartRadio app or wherever you get your podcasts.

Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. The president of the United States and the majority leader of the Senate have made breaking the Senate the central part of their plan for America. Thanks to the courageous they will not succeed. This country will be shielded from their radicalism tonight and making all the stake about it. This is radicalism. So the Senate will be saved tonight. America can breathe. I saw relief. This radicalism will have been stopped. It's a good day for America. Welcome back to the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show. That was Mitch McConnell last night after the effort by the Biden and the Senate Democrats to break the Senate failed, at least for now. What was this all about? And is this fight going to continue on in some way? We got somebody who can address that with us with real expertise. Our friend Senator Rick Scott from the Great State of Florida is with us now. Senator, thanks for being here. Well, it's great to be with you. But you know, think about it. The Democrat parties now, the anti-democracy party. Think about it. They've abandoned all their principles by the parents. You know, my parents were Democrats. And my dad, my doctor, dad, was a teamster, truck driver. He thought the Democrat party cared about him. Now all the Democrats care about is power. I mean, they've given up all their principles. They want to pack the Supreme Court. They want to take over all the elections. They don't want to, you know, when they're in the majority by one vote, the vice president, they want to be able to completely radically change this country. So I mean, this is this is just the now the anti-democracy party. Senator Scott, what exactly were they trying to get out of this? Because Manchin and Sinema had made it very clear. And as Manchin pointed out, he's been consistent, unlike other Democrats on this, that he's not going to go forward with any change to the filibuster. So what game was Chuck Schumer playing here? Was it just the optics? Was it so they could call Republicans racist going into the midterms? What's this all about? Well, first off, I think he's where he's scared to death of a OC primary. I mean, everybody I talked to says that he is scared to death at AOC. So he's now controlled by the radical left. He's always been a lefty, but now it's a radical left. And this is all about politics. They can call Republicans names. They can, you know, they talk about, you know, prior president or January 6th, this is just all of the data, because they have no plans. I mean, look at inflation. They have no plan to deal with inflation, secure the border, have a military that's lethal. I mean, they have nothing. They have nothing they can say other than the things that they've done badly for people. A hundred thousand people died of drug overdose. You know, by Medicare, I mean, completely open border. I just talked to a border agent today. He said there's almost no agent for tolling the border. They're all doing administrative duty now. You know, I just tweeted out yesterday, we're speaking to Senator Rick Scott of Florida for everyone joining us and listening. Senator tweeted out during the press conference that Biden had about two hours, not really a single. I mean, they touched on the border at one point, a little bit, but only to make the case for how people are coming because, you know, it's they're desperate and we're supposed to be sympathetic to the illegal immigration that's happening. No one asking about what is the regime the Biden presidency doing about illegal immigration. It feels like one, the American people aren't allowed to know, according to the Biden playbook here, what's really going on in the border. And two, there is absolutely speaking of a playbook, no plan to stop the illegal immigration that's hitting record numbers last year and will this year. Well, so I've been down the border a bunch of times. And as I talked to the border patrol agents, they will tell you this is the first president that had no plan whatsoever. They might disagree with how they're doing it, but they have no plan to secure the border. And what they want to do is they want to hide the information. I mean, there's now in this country, one of every 3,000 people that were alive a year ago died of a drug overdose in one year. One of every 150 people in this country today came in this country illegally in the last 12 months. So, you know, the debacle in Afghanistan, have you, you know, you probably haven't gotten all the information about how many people they evacuated and why they evacuated them and how many American citizens? You know why? Because they don't want you to know, we force them, I'm on the Homeland Security Committee, to give us a briefing. They made us do it in the most secure environment in the Capitol. And there was nothing in there that was confidential. I asked them, I said, so 79,000 people came to this country. How did you pick them? Well, they're at the airport. How many Americans? About 5,000. They say, how many people, especially about 2,000? I said, can you vet all the others? No, we didn't vet them. But they, I said, now, can they just walk off these bases? Yeah. Now, everything I just told you, they gave to me in a classified setting. And I said to them, is any of this classified? No. They did it so you don't know. This is the anti-democracy party. They don't trust you anymore. They don't trust American citizens to have good information and make good choices. They want to make all your choices. Don't worry about that. What happened in Afghanistan? We've got it all under control. Our way is the right way. That's the Democrat mantra right now. We're speaking, Senator Rick Scott of Florida, Senator Scott, you have introduced this smart act to prohibit bad policy when it comes to COVID restrictions, specifically about a vaccine mandate on US flights. Can you tell us a bit more about that? And just also, what are some of the things that you're trying to, the state of Florida has been the primary beacon of freedom from COVID tyranny for the last almost two years now. So what else would you like to see expanded across the country and other states to adopt and perhaps even if you could get some of your Democrat colleagues to go along with what we know you won't? But what needs to happen now? So here's how I think about it. I'm a business guy, right? I became governor in 2010. I said, I'm going to give people good information. They're going to make good choices. They're like a customer. You don't get to make the customer buy your stuff. You give them good information and they make good informed decision if you have a good product or service. That's what I thought about. I had poor hurricanes. I never mandated anybody evacuate, but people evacuate because they figured out it was safer for them. Our government has failed us with regard to COVID. At every level of government, they need to give us more information and we'll make good informed decisions and they need to quit the mandates. They shouldn't be telling us we have to have a mask on an airline. Let the airline decide what they want to do. Maybe an airline will say, hey, everybody has to have a vaccine on this flight. Everybody has to have a mask. But another one, they don't. And guess what? You as a consumer get to choose what this is. But the federal government shouldn't mandate for public transportation for Amtrak. For any of this, here you have to do anything. You have to wear a mask. You have to be have been vacu- vaccinated. I don't believe in that. I don't believe they should be telling you these things. I believe they should be giving you good information. You'll make good informed decisions. My parents had very little form of education. They made good individual choices and they wanted to take care, make sure all those kids were safe. And that's what- that's my expectation. I'm tired of federal government telling us how we are life. By the way, I was on the Senate floor and I proposed that Biden couldn't require us to get a vaccine mandate before food stamps, Medicare, Medicaid and public housing. And by the way, the Democrats blocked that because they believe Biden should be able to do it. Senator Scott, before we let you go, I wanted to know if you think- and we're speaking to Senator Rick Scott of Florida for everyone joining us- I want to know what you think about the Biden legislative agenda, the Build Back Better bill, which we're now hearing there's still some back and forth with Manchin. They're still negotiating. I mean, this is what at least the political reporters are running around with. Is there going to be a Build Back Better at some level, at some cost? Or you think this whole thing is just going to turn into a big nothing and then the people will sort it out in the midterm election? Well, first of all, I hope nothing happens and here's why. We have the highest inflation in this country in seven years. It's a result of an excessive government spending. And that's what the Democrats have been doing. We've got to start living within our means. We have to create safety nets for the people who need it. But if you can work, you shouldn't be having a safety net. I mean, you should work. Go get a job. I mean, we don't have enough people working right now. We need to have more people working than people taking benefits. And so I'm sick and tired of the Democrats saying, oh, we care about people. No, you don't care about people. It's real money. It caused inflection. The poor family, by the time family growing up, we lived in public housing. They had to deal with inflation when I was growing up. And it was very difficult because of wages. We never went up as fast as inflection. That's going on across the country. People are choosing like my mom will have to choose to put gas in the car or food on the table. So all those spending sounds really nice. It's not free. Either it's borrowed money and we already have 30 trillion dollars for the debt, or they're going to raise somebody's taxes. And so it's not like government has any money. The government doesn't generate money other than taxing people. And so we're causing unbelievable inflation. And we're making people dependent on government when they should be dependent on themselves. Senator Rick Scott, thanks for coming by the show. Appreciate it. All right, congratulations. Take care. Thanks so much. Come back to a little bit more of the Democrat strategy around all this and Kamala addressing. Oh, that's right. The vice president addressing some of Biden's remarks yesterday. You'll want to hear this. She's getting a bit a bit aggravated with the press. Remember, the press are supposed to be and they are the propaganda arm of the DNC, you know, operating semi independently of the Democrat party. That's what most of political media does. So when they start to get a little, uh, little frustrated with the regime, you know, it's because it's gotten so bad that they can't even make the propaganda stick. We'll get into all that in a moment. Valentine's Day this year, Tommy John has a new phrase for all. Keep it simply soft. Kiss for short. See how they did that.

There's no checks and balances in this process only for the only thing we have is a filibuster. And they think if you have a situation we have right now where you have the executive branch of government and you have Congress, the House and the Senate, they're all the same. And there's no check and balance because basically you just sweep right through it and the same thing could happen if Republicans had everything. And I just- the only thing I've ever said was this. The majority of my colleagues in the caucus, Democrat caucus, they change. They changed their mind. I respect that. You have a right to change your mind. I have it. I hope they respect that too. I've never changed my mind on a filibuster. I got news for Manchin. I think he already knows it though. Welcome back to Clay and Buck Show. They do not respect his position on this. And they do not care that they are the ones that the Democrats other than Cinima and Manchin are the ones who are engaged in what you could delicately call situational ethics. I talked about this a little bit on the Buck Sexton podcast this morning. You should all check out Buck Sexton Show podcast available wherever you listen to podcasts. It's in advance of a radio show, which you should also be listening to hopefully every day. I was listening to this. I'm saying to myself, this is all so clear. We have the audio of what they used to say. I mean, how shameless can these Democrats really be that the filibuster rules aren't just in place and something they've rhetorically supported in the past. That's true. But they have used them ruthlessly even to shut down Republicans in the majority who don't have the 60 vote threshold. And the original break in the filibuster of the nuclear option for so-called nuclear option for judges. That was a Harry Reid maneuver. So it was Democrats who who cracked away at the first time and they didn't want it for Supreme Court justices. And then Mitch McConnell said, uh, not so fast. You're not getting to play that game. So okay. So now it's for all judges, right? And now they want to make it just for this one piece of legislation. Does anyone actually think if Democrats had gotten their way on this and say it was just the one time just this once? Of course not. I mean, it's, it's laughable, right? This is, this is intellectually flimsy stuff that they're putting forward, you know, Chuck Schumer, who is, he is so shameless. He is so shameless that it is almost impressive. And then again, so is Amy Klobuchar when she's not eating her salad with a comb or throwing objects at staff members. Remember when that came out when she was running the primary eating your salad with a comb? Was it a comb you would use? I don't know. I'd probably just use my hands. Here's Amy Klobuchar saying, well, there's no mention of it in the Constitution. So like what's even the filibuster all about or something? Play six. Oh, I don't think anyone in our state wants us to come here and hug an archaic tradition. And then simply stop votes, stop debates, hug that tradition tight, and then throw the voters under the desk and go home and raise money. What our founding fathers wanted when it became clear that this country was forming, they wanted to have a senate that worked. And when you go back and look, there's no mention of a filibuster in the Constitution. There's no mention of 60 votes. There's no mention of culture. Rules developed over time. Oh, okay. So now if it's not in the Constitution, it doesn't exist and doesn't matter. Is that is that essentially what the the pitch is? Now, keep in mind, you could go back and listen to Amy Klobuchar and Chuck Schumer and others just a few years ago when they were in the minority going, Oh my gosh, if you get rid of the filibuster, it's the tyranny of the majority. These people are so shameless. But their base wants to see that you have to remember it. The Democrat mindset is not one of I mean, these people are commies at heart. They don't actually want what's fair. They don't want principle. They want power. They want their way. It's as though you have tyrant children in the government who are making demands and they're screaming and pouting and kicking and they want their way and all the rules that would stop them from doing that are bad. And it doesn't matter if they said yesterday they were good. Now they're bad because it stands in the way of the primary goal, the acquisition and utilization of power. That is, if the Democrat party could have one thing on the on the letterhead, you know, one thing on the business card. It's we acquire and wield power and we do so pretty ruthlessly. And they're good at it. They're better at it in terms of staying together and United as a party generally speaking than Republicans are. But on this one, cinema wants to keep her seat, mansion wants to keep his seat. And I think at some level two, they realize that Democrats are a little bit like the guy in the bar here who wants the fight is over are happy to yell, hold me back, hold me back. They really want to crush the did all those Senate Democrats really want to crush the filibuster. I saw Mark Kelly of Arizona. He said he's he was down. He voted in favor. Did they really want to do this though? Hmm. Be careful what you wish for Democrats, right? I think I think cinema and mansion may have actually bailed out the Democrat party in some ways because people might recognize, hold on a second, there's so much fraudulent at the heart of Democrat leadership. How could we trust them on anything? I mean, if they if they lie so shamelessly even about the structure and operations of our government, what else are they lying about? I wish people think that way. And we will get back into my friends in just a moment here, the discussion over the NCAA and sports and transgender issues. So stick around for that.

He's not flying his own wings, obviously he's on a plane. I was going to try to make that make sense. But he's flying down to Florida right now and he flew all the way to Florida and gosh, are his arms tired. But he's going to be down there for a Florida event at our wonderful affiliate in Fort Myers. I am in COVID quarantine, so I'm rocking the show today solo as I just said. And I want to get to some calls before we talk about the an update to that trans swimmers story that you got here. Plus Matt Walsh always always ready to throw down for the truth from the Daily Wire. He was on the Dr. Phil show and some he poses quite a question, quite a straightforward, very clear question to a trans activist, actually two trans activists and you will want to hear the not so clear answer. We got Jolene in Clyde, North Carolina. Hey, Jolene. Hey Buck, how you doing? I'm good. I'm much better. Thank you. Hopefully you can hear my voice. This was for me. It was Wimpy. It was Wimpy. Not that bad. Right. That sounds awesome. Well, I just wanted to make a comment about Joe Biden's idiotic remark about, Hey, look, if it's just a minor incursion, what's no big deal, because that's the mindset of this administration and the ages around the country that, you know, go ahead and steal up to $1,000 worth of jewelry or whatever. It's no big deal. You know, and then they wonder why crime is going up and they still want to blame it on guns and everything. So and I'm glad that the Ukraine, you know, shot back. Zelensky. Yes. Hey, wait, what? That is not, you know, that is not not acceptable. You know, there's the kind of students from a president, you know, that's a mess. And by the way, Jolene, thank you so much for calling in from North Carolina. I can get back then, North Carolina. I haven't been there about, gosh, a little over a year now. But, you know, that's the kind of thing that's very hard for the press team to clean up afterwards. And just remember that with Trump, every statement made about Russia was scrutinized, twisted, and turned into the pretext for World War three, Biden at a moment when Russia could actually start a major war with a westernized, a westernized nation with a pretty serious military of its own. And Biden says something like that, as unmeasured and reckless as you know, if it's a limited incursion, don't don't encourage the Russian bear, my man. Don't don't poke it either. Alex in Fairfield, Connecticut's got some thoughts. Hey, Alex, what's up? It hasn't gone. The Democrats call the Georgia voting law racist, but Connecticut, which is run by the Democratic Party, has tougher voting laws than Georgia. Here are a couple of examples. No early voting in Connecticut. Same day voting in Connecticut. Ideas required to vote in Connecticut. It was just announced that you cannot use COVID to get an absentee ballot. The only way you can get an absentee ballot in Connecticut is you have to have an illness physically disabled, active duty overseas. And yet nobody's talking about Connecticut voting law being racist, it's because it's run by the Democratic Party and Republicans can't win in Connecticut. Look, look at the Connecticut voting laws and you guys will be shocked. Oh, Alex, I know you're I know you're right. I mean, I know that this is a great point, by the way. Thanks for calling in from Connecticut. This is absolutely true, what he's saying. And if you live in a blue state across the country, if you were to look at the likely laws in your state about voting, and then compare it to say Georgia, where they're saying it's Jim Crow 2.0, literally saying Jim Crow 2.0, right? We're not exaggerating. That is the term they use, which is horrifying. You'll find out that there are blue states that based on the way they assess a state like Georgia or say the Carolina as you know, states that are North Carolina particular states that are close, that could go either way. If the Democrats don't get their way, it's evil racism and harkens back to the, you know, the darkest periods of the American past. I mean, that's what they'll say, which is just so gross and wrong. But this is what the Democrats are all about. Demagoguery, recklessness, dividing people pretending to unite while doing everything possible to divide. That is how the Democrats operate. Raymond just across the river in Hackensack, New Jersey. What's going on, Raymond? Hi, Dylan. Today, I'm a minor COVID survivor like you, myself. I just wanted to say that I believe everybody's missing the point on the failure of these voting bills that were done last night. And that the real point of it is to set up the circumstance where the Democrats can use the outcome of Republicans man-slowing them on this upcoming election as a rebuke to their policies. And they're going to call the 2022 elections in valid, saying, Hey, it really was to them, they cheated. That's what Raymond in the first hour, the show to thank you for calling in my, my brother from just across the river in New Jersey. As a New Yorker, New Jersey, you're like our, you're like our cousins that we joke around with, but we can't live without you. I got to say he's absolutely right. And this is what I talked about in the first hour. They're creating two things. One, a false, really a false narrative used to push the Democrats, community organizers and all the rest to get out there and say, see, you better help with our, with our vote efforts and you better do these, pass these laws we want or else you're racist. So that's part of it. But the other part of it, the other reason that Joe Biden is pretending there's this urgent, urgent need for voting rights reform is because, and remember, it wasn't apparently Jim Crow 2.0 before COVID when there weren't these laws that they used COVID as an excuse to enact, right? They said, Oh no, we're only knew this because of COVID because it's dangerous. And now they're saying, well, if we don't get to do mail and balloting again, if we don't get and mandate it at the federal level, if we don't get to do ballot harvesting, as just so many things that, I mean, look, they want control of district of congressional districting, they want, they want to make sure that they never lose an election. And that's all that they want to make sure they don't care about what's fair. They don't care about the intent of the founders of the Constitution. But by doing all this as well, by making this case right now, what the Democrats create for themselves is a built in already made excuse because if they lose the elections, what do you do you think? I mean, everyone listening across the country knows, all right, you know this right now as I'm talking to you, if if they lose badly, and I think they're heading in for a shell lacking, I think they're going to be getting their behinds kicked. I certainly hope so. I know you hope so too. But I think even some of the Democrats who are listening are like, yeah, we kind of deserve it a little bit. We kind of deserve it. And do you think that if that happens, if that happens, they're going to say, you know what, maybe we shouldn't have taken the party so far to the left. You think Biden and the regime and the Democrats in Congress are going to say, you know, maybe we shouldn't pretend like everything that happens is the result of every bad thing that happens in the world is the result of climate change. So we can try to pass the green New Deal, ie green socialism. You know, maybe that's not such a good idea. No, of course not. They're not going to do that. They're going to lose, and they're going to say Republicans are racist and they cheated because that's what they always say. Like spoiled children who can't lose the game, they'll say Republicans are racist and they cheated. And that's why they like to do this right now. They want to keep that all going. They create a false moral high ground for themselves in advance of the actual contest. Makes them feel better about it, right? It's a little bit nice to play a lot of tennis and I play tennis matches. You know, it's kind of like the guy who shows up and goes, Hey, so excited to be here. But man, I really pulled something in my shoulder. I'm really injured. And then you get out the play. The guy's shoulder looks fine. But oh, he already established if he loses, you know, if he loses that three set match. Well, I told him I was injured, you know, but in this case, it's like the Republicans fault. You know, it's not even just creating an excuse. Its Republicans are essentially cheating. That's the way they do this. I told you about that transition. This is fascinating. And it is from my friend Clay Travis, my friend, my co-host, my main man, his website outkick. They've got a story up on the transgender swimmer that is Wow.

Welcome back to the clan box show. This is Buck here in NYC in quarantine almost done feeling fine by the way. I mean I could go do some I was going to say inverted pushups but then a bunch of you would email me and make fun of me and say you don't do inverted pushups come on and that's I used to be able to it's been a while ago but I feel fine so that's the good news but CDC says so CDC gets five days of quarantine and clay is traveling to Florida but he'll be back tomorrow so you'll have the dynamic duo of clay and buck back in full effect but he's a site that he founded out kick which is now owned by Fox has a great story that I want to tell you about here for a second in an exclusive interview with out kick a biological female this is written by Joe Kinsey a biological female member of the women's swimming team said she believes her teammate transgender swimmer Leah Thomas colluded with Yale transgender swimmer it's a Henig who's transitioning from female to male during a 100 meter freestyle race on January 8th the swimmer granted anonymity due to what is viewed as threats from the university activists and the current political climate believes Thomas who has reportedly been comparing herself to Jackie Robinson wow and Henig cooked up a plan before a Penn home try meat with Yale and Dartmouth looking at Leah's time I don't think she was trying the Penn swimmer alleges I know their friends and I know they were talking before the meat I think she let her win to prove the point oh she a female to male beat me and quote I gotta tell you as soon as I read this this uh this on out it's on Fox News but it's an out kick story as soon as I read this I said yeah that's what happened that's a totally make sense because initially when I talked about this story I always said but hold on a second so a a male to female transition must have beat another male to female transition so I said no no no this is a female to male transition give me a break okay there's absolutely I do not believe that that Leah Thomas who was on the brink of getting all time records all of a sudden swims against a female to male transition athlete and loses substantially I do I do not believe it I think this is what think I think about how much sense this would make right because the whole argument is that a male athlete of a certain level is going to beat all women of a certain level essentially and I've done enough sports and been in enough situations where I mean I can see this right we used to do uh we used to do erg you know rowing competitions which by the way are absolutely miserable but I rode in college at Amherst College for three seasons and I do not I do not recommend it but you get up really early in the morning yeah you're getting good shape but your hands or your hands look like hamburger meal at a time constantly blistered up anyway it's not fun and but you know it's pretty good for it point being I remember from the erg times you could be if you were a a a mediocre male heavyweight rower at the college level you would be almost an Olympic level female I mean you would you would have been and look this is not telling anybody things that they don't already know we all know this right we all understand this and this is not to take any way from female athletes the whole reason we have male and female sports broken up by gender is because of this but I do think that these these two trans athletes are playing games here I think that something something went on because it didn't make any sense it didn't make any sense uh the disparity you don't go from I mean blowing all the other swimmers out of the water to being in this in this uh being in the situation where the female to male transition um would be able to win against this individual it just doesn't make any sense right there's something strange going on a female to male beat me so all of a sudden we're supposed to believe that it's not so unfair um the anonymous pen swimmer the piece writes on accuses Thomas of mailing it in I was on deck and said to a friend she's literally not trying you can just tell it was blatantly obvious I totally believe this there's a lot at stake here for people a lot at stake for a belief system the trans agenda belief system of the left and also the reality that the democrat party has really embraced this stuff and and sports media has certainly embraced it as well uh such that they can't even answer straightforward questions um I remember I I started working with Matt Walsh at the blaze oh gosh I don't even know now six or seven years ago maybe something like that I'm her thing in this guy this guy is going to be uh somebody that we hear a lot more from in the futures a very talented writer and you know he's also good on his feet and he was on dr Phil's show right he's on dr Phil's show and there was there were two trans activists there and he posed a very straightforward question to them because if we're going to get to the heart of the trans agenda and women's sports by the NCAA just came out with a new policy they're looking at their new policy for trans athletes and they're saying that it's going to be sport by sport which is what the olympics do but they're just trying to not really take a real decision okay this is about getting you to bend the knee to untruth ultimately because if the left can make you say that men and women there's no real difference they can make you say anything they control you they've emotionally uh disarmed you and psychologically and and intellectually well mad wall she doesn't go for that here he is standing his ground on doc i've never watched dr Phil's show before but i know dr Phil is but watch this i listen to this play 11 you stood up here and said trans women are women yes tell me what you mean so here's the thing so i do not define what a woman is because i do not identify as a woman womanhood is something that is an umbrella term that describes what people who identify as a woman what is that was to each their own each woman each man each person is going to have a different relation with their own gender identity and define it differently that doesn't come out of the way that's a trans women are women too you want to reduce though so that's a problem you want to reduce women you want to reduce men down to maybe just their genetics are genitals are chromosomes right that's what you're saying what you want to do is appropriate women you want to appropriate womanhood okay and turn it into basically a costume that can be worn well done well done just ask the most straightforward questions and watch the absurdity begin to spin out of control what is a woman someone who identifies as a woman you know what false sorry the sky is not is not green and you know water is wet and there are some things that we just have to accept as true and there are other things that we will not accept as true so well done here but remember they want to make you bend the knee because if they can get you to say men and women aren't different what do you think they can't what do you think the left can't force you to say and to undermine your own belief in your ability to discern truth in the process all right coming up here Kamala getting a bit testy
