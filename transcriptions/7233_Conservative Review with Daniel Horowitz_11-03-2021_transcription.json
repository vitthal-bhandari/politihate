    "text": " politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative true the conservative review with Daniel and welcome back fellow American Patriots and Miniman standing at the ready to guard our liberties to the one and only see our podcast this is your host Daniel Hurwitz back in the house for Thursday March 11th and we got a lot to talk about as always time is short and the work is great recording a little earlier today got to travel a little bit in the morning so I am not up on all of the news but obviously the big story everyone's talking about politically is the fact that Congress just fully passed and I mean the House agreed to the Senate amendments and they passed the $1.9 trillion communist bill that basically makes everyone in America dependent forever codifies covid fascism as a national religion codifies tasting testing tracing monitoring gives every single health department from local state federal full power to just do anything they want to you covid fascism is codified with two trillion dollars behind it and it rewards all of the bad actors it rewards all the all the people that are send our nation it gives all their NGOs and government officials and health care cartel education cartel endless funding it's the worst thing in the world and you know it's great every single Republican in the House and the Senate voted against it not one supported it awesome now you might be wondering didn't we see this rodeo before oh that's right this is actually the third version of it the first two passed with Republicans all supporting it in the Senate and the White House oh okay now don't get me wrong it is a horrible bill but it's pretty much with a couple of cowhide or cow pie cherries on top the same thing that's been passed twice last year and yet now suddenly all the Republicans oppose it or do they really and and that's really what I want to get into today and as I always do pick a theme and then kind of I'll go through the border I'll go through the trends transgender stuff going on but how Republicans are basically there to give us the conservative version of cow pies this is the conservative cow pie Democrats want a cow pie no matter how radical how immoral how illogical how illegal how destructive and deleterious their policies are we're gonna take their premise undergirding that policy we're gonna agree to it we're gonna take their policy agree to it and then walk it back in a couple of areas we're regarding the most kind of tangential minor elements of it that is essentially the Republican Party that's the conservative media going on now the first one uh introduce you to our sponsor today one right that you still have left in most states is the second amendment but guns and certainly ammo are a lot of money these days one thing people overlook is the proper holster those of you who come out to the training at Frontside Nevada through Patriot Academy Constitution coach calm know that a holster is everything in real life you're gonna draw from a holster if someone God forbid confronts you getting that right holster is going to get you on the target every time you need a safe efficient secure holster we the people holsters got you covered and here's the thing like with everything becoming so expensive they're still the same price starting at $40 and with offer code CR you get $10 off so this is a pretty good deal it's again we the people is made in America they also have EDC tactical gun belts which comes paired with their patented Cobra buckle you have to really make sure you have a good belt to hold it in the right place don't just use a standard belt I've learned that over the years every holster and belt comes with a lifetime guarantee you could send it back for a full refund if it doesn't fit again we the people holsters dot com slash CR and then like I said get an additional $10 off with offer code CR so you could really get you know for 30 to 40 bucks a very quality high quality American made holster we the people holsters dot com slash CR offer code CR so folks I have all these friends of mine call me up and hey could you come on my show talk about the pork the pork in the stimulus bill and I'm thinking like why is it that conservatives are incapable of militating against the meat and potatoes why do they have to look at the salad why do they have to nibble around the edges why could they never take a look at anything the left does at a given moment when we actually need opposition not in the future when it's not the battle in front of us not in the back what you know in the past when it's yesterday's battle but right here right now everything you are saying is immoral your entire diagnosis of the problem is wrong you caused the problem here's the way we could solve your problem for much cheaper and that will actually solve it you guys are solving nothing and you're harming people done like I've been doing for a year it is shocking we're almost coming up on the anniversary I can't believe it twilight zone March 27th when Republicans passed the same bill meaning the same premise of using a pandemic to throw individual welfare people corporate welfare loan guarantees but never of course actually compensate under the Fifth Amendment the people they shut down and then indiscriminately mailing out checks to people based on income not based on if they were shut down or lost their income so if you're below the threshold you and you didn't lose any income you get thousands of dollars in your account for free which is just utterly insane and if you're a little bit above the threshold it's a cliff and you get nothing even if you lost everything from the government this is the worst form of socialism that makes Obama stimulus look like Barry Goldwater but again let's not forget Republicans did that twice we could sit and split hairs about they threw in a little extra for pensions and labor unions and a little bit extra for the education cartel in the state and local governments but fundamentally it's all the same and they want to sit and talk about the pork you know folks I've said this again I've said this for a year and I'm gonna say it again now I will take any day of the week I will fund them a hundred Kennedy centers for them to leave us alone stop distorting the health care market stop lining the pockets of the health care industry that is censoring life-saving protocols and killing people and controlling our lives and all of the trillions of dollars spent on making not just low-income but now middle-income Americans basically like the impoverished and and that they're completely dependent upon government so that they find it good I mean let let let's start with the big enchilada whenever you look at a bill okay let's say it's a two trillion dollar bill and the biggest expenditure I believe is about 1.2 trillion dollars are you gonna focus on the one billion dollar expenditure when you're railing against the bill or you're gonna focus on the one point two trillion dollar expenditure and there's this talking point going around that only nine percent of the bill is for COVID funding and the irony it's not really true I mean it depends how you define that but it but the big thing of handing individuals checks and their fundable tax credits yeah I mean I agree it has nothing to do with COVID it shouldn't have but Republicans agree with it I'm not hearing them disagree with it and because indeed they passed the same thing twice so that's the first thing if you do you agree with the concept of for a third time indiscriminately mailing out money to people most of whom didn't really lose any money some inevitably did but most of them didn't they're missing the window people over 75,000 individual income over 150,000 family income get nothing even if they lost their entire business yeah we get it they have all the restaurant and loan programs no if you believe in that then you go and this really is the state's job because they're the ones who shut people down if someone lost a million dollars of revenue that year fifth amendment you got to pay them million million dollars I don't need some roundabout loan program that half of them can't even get access to most of them haven't gotten access to but that's the point so let's start with the big enchilada they're like well it's got a it's funding Amtrak I mean it does a little bit but I mean again like I'd rather them fund Amtrak from now until tomorrow I'd rather them give two trillion dollars to Amtrak than what they did the COVID funding is the biggest problem it's not the non-COVID funding I mean that's wasteful spending and some cases it does juice up their special interests but the COVID funding is what is underwriting and stimulating more shutdowns in tyranny no it won't be a type of shutdown that was induced by the March 27th bill of last year but it will be this nuanced thing where you could open but you have to wear a mask forever anytime there's a centilla of a sign of anything that we say is a virus circulating we're gonna test and trace and monitor and shut down again and now we have all the money to give out to all the health departments to use special technology to promote this that's the issue the problem with the bill is the COVID funding so first again let's start with the individual stuff I'm not hearing Republicans rail against it and I get it if Democrats say they're gonna offer people free money it's hard to fight against it but here's the deal Republicans started that premise meaning when when Trump was in charge had he said look we're gonna mail checks to people who lost income then that would be a different story but they started this nonsense so Democrats just did it without a gradual phase out like from 150 family income to 190 like the other two are and instead of 1200 it's 1400 dollars that's the difference but um so right off the bat any conservatives should ask if that's the case why don't we just mail everyone a million dollar check if it is that unlimited that we could spend trillions and more and more and just dump money into people's accounts let me speak to this on a personal level how destructive this is I'm trying to I can't even keep track of how much money I got so because I'm not a grifter and a whore I earn below the family threshold and you know my wife does it doesn't work she's home with the kids and homeschooling so I'm below the threshold so I just want you to know under this bill you get 1400 dollars per per I think per kid too so I don't I guess it doesn't go on my fourth child because that that would be the current year's taxation she was born last year but three of them says a family of five okay five people that's seven thousand dollars into my bank account and mind you I've already gotten like six or so six seven thousand if you add up the first two so what does that bring me up to probably close to thirteen fourteen thousand dollars free money okay then then they expand the refundable child tax credit which was already doubled from one thousand to two thousand now they're expanding it to three thousand for children over six and thirty six hundred for children under six so again I only have one child now under six and assuming she's not part of it but that's an extra three thousand dollars right there for me thousand dollars per child so I could be up to seventeen thousand dollars of free money I didn't lose any income because I was I was below the income threshold you take someone else that earns a few tens of thousands of dollars more than me and has a small business and was just destroyed by what government did he gets nothing think about that but that basic structure was set up by Trump and Republicans they juiced it up a little bit more but that isn't that what we've been doing on every issue for the last seventy years that Republicans agree to it often even started and Democrats just you know they'll step on the gas pedal and the Republicans are like hey you can't do that it's socialism at this point just I mean you know people are depressed and they work too hard they need to spend more time with family just give everyone a million dollar check at this point and let them live their life out you don't have to work why don't we just do that if it's free money this is the question we asked literally a year ago this time and all of a sudden now they're like J.D. you see what the Democrats pass I'm like um did you see what the Republicans passed and what Trump signed when you had influence over him why is it that conservative media only cares about things that they can no longer affect when the outcome is low no longer in contention they care about the Super Bowl when the results are in but not when you're on the field and you could play I never understood that and that's likewise now they'll focus on Congress not on Congress when Republicans had control and when Trump was present and likewise they won't focus on the state legislatures that they have super majorities and they could block a lot of bad things it's something really bizarre and it's rooted in the fact that Republicans and conservative media they don't believe in anything they don't care about outcomes they care about their daily talking points so I need a good talking point you see it has some pork there for the Kennedy Center stuck in the COVID bill could you imagine that we care about COVID and we're trying to help COVID and you're mixed again with the COVID funding meanwhile the COVID funding is the problem like I said I had my own stimulus my own stimulus would be banning all localities from from violating the 14th amendment COVID fascism is done we're mailing out kits to people for for a trillionth of the cost making I've remectin and hydroxychloroquine over the counter all the other supplements with a full guidance on how to use it what dosage when how much prophylactic how much if you if you start feeling like you're getting a virus and done and then a five-year moratorium on taxation regulation for small businesses rather than just handouts throwing into an empty hole and if you want to do some reparation payments to certain people then do that as well but that should really be funneled through the states states oh it you know obviously this bill is the greatest expansion of Obamacare in 10 years it like takes the both the subsidies and the Medicaid expansion to 400% of the poverty line four times higher than that but again Republicans fundamentally all them agree with it yes yes a pandemic yes yes throw money so throw more money at the insurance cartel at the health care cartel so they could charge even more and create an even greater a monopoly in asset bubble and destroy health care even more oh my gosh you see Daniel they threw a hundred and sixty-eight billion at the education cartel and they're not even requiring them to open well yeah that's horrible but don't you remember me talking about that last year when Trump was president this is the third round of them doing that maybe the schools are more like the second round I forget what they've offered the first time and of course again like I always say I don't even care about the spending anymore I mean we're beyond bankrupt that it's it's like be you can only kill a dead horse once um it's the policies that it will stimulate so they pay the school districts a hundred and sixty eight billion dollars for child abuse the setup concentration kits for social distancing and and and and mitigation you know what that means you know what that means so now the the education and health care departments of each state will be flush with endless sums of cash they already have um you know over a hundred billion dollar dollars that they the states haven't even spent so there's three hundred sixty two dollars that straight to the three hundred sixty billion straight for the states and hunt not a hundred sixty eight billion for um the teachers union but again I mean yeah 150 billion in aid to the states has not been spent that's what it is and this all started a year ago when I said look you already at that time passed two of the smaller like covid bills that you're measuring in billions not trillions and I said look you dealt with unemployment thing you dealt with your thing now let's hold endless hearings on the actual science of do we even need to be doing this is this harmful isn't this like voodoo um how else do you treat coronavirus right I mean we're we're running up against the year anniversary of all those shows I did I can't believe we're we're in this 12 months later and Republicans still at its core agree with their premise yes Democrats have reached a point where they milk the full shutdown to its full extent so anyway they were gonna retreat behind a more defensible line and go and bolster that and Republicans are helping them by still militating against that one last thing that's what they'll do yeah you need to open schools yeah they'll open schools as concentration camps I mean that's the joke I don't like I get it Republicans don't know how to explain health care funding and policy I get that I get they don't you know the dependency I get it but even the most radical issue is that you have so many good talking points because we're all looking for talking points to fight against it they still will not fight it yeah they all voted against it because they're in the minority but in the majority they agreed to it and then even when they're in the minority they find these random reasons to oppose it it's got pork in it it's like we'll have a bill to rape every conservative woman in America let's say Democrats said you know this is what we need to do we need to put whites in in re-education camps or I don't know something like that and then they'll stick like Cuomo tunnel projects and they're you see it's got the tunnel projects there could you imagine that they're messing up the rape bill I mean I'm sorry to be so crude here but it's just like that's what they are notice what watch carefully how conservative media deals with this and they're not very few of them I mean a few more than were a year ago but you would think it would be everyone by now they're still agreeing to it and then like you know that they'll take a look at like the 50 60 billion for testing and tracing and and vaccine and then you know another 50 billion or so I don't have it in front of me but something like that for therapeutics and R&D so that's the part of the Dutch good that's COVID but that goes that literally incentivizes big pharma to make the most expensive things with the least results right they're guaranteeing them income so you have mandatory they have minimum guaranteed income to the public below a certain income threshold and you have minimum guaranteed income for the health care cartel so why they have no incentive to get this right for a cheap way that's the whole problem when you have all that money in there like let's say tomorrow I'm just making I'm just exaggerating to prove a point but it's not that far off let's say tomorrow we would come out and find that Tylenol cures COVID whatever you know they would do everything they can even if it's true to discredit it and censor it and all that because it will expose this whole racket that's how government kills people it sounds nice yeah throw throw money at health care that's great it creates a monopoly for the people destroying health care if you want to know dr. Pierre Corey had a beautiful article about censorship of practitioners but if you want to know how that's coming down it's the it's the Medicaid and Medicare and insurance cartel and our entire way of looking at health care for years that Republicans have fundamentally agreed to while saying they oppose socialized medicine folks could we put that aside could we finally retire that line if this is not socialized medicine I don't know what is in many ways it's even worse than Europe and I think you're seeing that with COVID a little bit too there's actually even more censorship in America because in Europe it's more pure socialism in America it's the venture socialism funneled the basis like this Bernie Sanders and the socialists aren't wrong what they say about corporations in a vacuum but it's only right in the world that they created in other words corporations are very greedy we're all very greedy all of us want to get the most money and produce the least amount of work that's what we want to do that's logical but there is a natural check in balance on that behavior because you're not going to get away with it if you don't pony up to stuff but what if government hands you endless market distortions regulatory monopolies mandate monopolies and subsidy monopolies so then you have a free lane to do whatever you want with no check in balance on that behavior so then it's worse than ever because then you have government inefficiency and and competence and tyranny mixed with the greed that is now unchecked in the so-called private sector that's now totally one with government and in many ways you have one big tyrannical fireball that's worse than Europe that that's my view on the American health care system Republicans always like the current health care system wherever it is even if it's 10 light years away from the first one they liked oh don't do the next thing the left is saying and then they do it now like the next thing the next thing the Republican Party is a Nigerian Prince scam the conservative movement is a Nigerian Prince scam so I could sit in rail against this bill and it is this is I mean it's gonna be very tough because our whole project of fighting back in the States it just gives them all this money to use for nonsense and we're gonna have to think of creative ways to get the states to properly use the money for conservative stuff now the left is in stupid and they put in a provision for example barring states from using the money for tax cuts like you know if you throw if they already have 150 billion unspent funding they don't even know what to do with it anymore he's amazing well at least just always just cut state taxes with it but they knew that and they preclude that because they wanted to be used on lining the pockets of their cronies making people depend into don't pay taxes and and of course fueling the technology and the tracking and tracing and you know has a billion dollars in there for I forget the language it's something like marketing the vaccine effectiveness basically serving as Pfizer and Moderna's and you know J&J's private marketing arm that's the thing they don't need to do it government does it for them so that's why you don't have that's why the price that's how capitalism has been destroyed in America because it's not capitalism that's exactly what crony capitalism or venture socialism really is but um where is this it's section three thousand and two if you want to look it up three zero zero two in the bill one billion for quote vaccine confidence activities to strengthen vaccine confidence in the United States and to provide further information education with respect to vaccines mind you that's one pork item I don't think Republicans you know the cost is relatively low it's a tremendous amount for marketing campaign but relative to the money we're playing with it's one billion but that's something you don't really hear from too many Republicans because you know that would you know require you to actually fight against the premise and I don't know we'll have to talk about Amtrak or something and again I dude like we've spent something I haven't tallied it up but my head maybe five to six trillion on all these bills put together over the last year I would have rather spent five to six trillion on Kennedy centers on railroad tracks tunnels whatever you want to spend it on I don't care heck buy every liberal of villa and stay there and leave us alone this the problem is the real spending is the problem I'm just sick of this I don't even know what to do when I go on these programs like do I burst their bubble play along with it yeah this is terrible we've never seen a bill like this before wonder where they got it from so that's the latest with the virus when then and the bill there's again a lot more stuff with the virus as we have every day you know again Trump put out a you know he puts out these press releases he said I hope everyone remembers when they're getting the COVID-19 vaccine that if I wasn't president you wouldn't be getting that beautiful shot for five years at best and probably not at all I hope everyone remembers the beautiful shot okay all right well it's one way to refer to it I guess he stopped promoting hydroxychloroquine there we go by the way one other important thing I wanted to point out a blast from the past dr Andy Boston sent this to me an article from June 9th 2020 I think I think this is very important widespread mask wearing could prevent COVID-19 second waves because now like everyone forgets all the benchmarks they blew through this is a perfect time if you remember June June 9th maybe that's where it was slowly starting with the second southern wave it was mainly a southern wave because they didn't really get much of the first wave the third wave was universal so for a lot of places they really only had like two waves but anyway if you look almost and not almost every blue state had an ironclad mass mandate and by that point and a good number of the red states had it by then and guess what the wave came the second wave came and the third wave came the whole thing is a joke and there's still like you know you should wear a mask because it could prevent the variance the a fourth wave well you could say the first wave were caught by surprise but the second and third it didn't prevent so you know again like they're never held accountable another piece of news I wanted to touch before just getting back to our theme today of the conservative version of hell that the that the conservative movement and the debt of Republicans give us this is a medical express calm Austrian court overturns virus mask mandate in school the Austria's constitutional court ruled Wednesday that two government measures to fight the spread of coronavirus in schools compulsory mask wearing and splitting classes into halves were illegal in addition it was decided that all persons present school buildings apart from doing during teaching time and had to wear a mask or their mouth and nose or this is what they had but the constitutional court ruled that the measure in question was illegal it explained in its decision by stating that the ministry has not made clear why it considered these measures necessary two children their parents had brought the case before the court saying that the measures violated principles of equality before the law the right to private life and the right to an education now look the way they express those rights is not in our constitution but I will tell you what Republicans and Democrats alike have been funding and expressing they believe in that so somehow that goes out the window here but I do believe there is a right to bodily integrity that that is the most basic definition of individual liberty show your work show me where it shows that kids are a problem more than any other year if not less than a typical year show me an example of where kids being masked work better than kids being not masked show your work but yet we don't have that in America even in the reddest of states again there is more freedom in Europe than in America and most of countries are very free but I'm just saying geez I'll get to some good news at the end but I just wanted to go back to something else here there's another thing percolating that you guys need to know about HR 1440 HR 1440 now this was introduced by congressman Chris Stewart of Utah second district a rhino from the pit of hell and he's introduced this in prior Congresses he introduces December 6 2019 so I'm reading from the old press release because I just don't have the new one in front of me if he has a new one but I'm hearing that it is gaining steam and it's something we need to talk about the fairness for all act Stuart protects religious freedom and LGBT individuals he forgot the queue and the dollar sign and the other sexual behaviors there as well and basically this is this is I'm just bringing this up because it's quintessential republicanism if you want to know why the left has succeeded in the most radical things it's because this is what Republicans do instead of being like you did what you're codifying testicle cutting and mutilating bodies into the body politic and culture and society are you kidding you need to be locked up no it's like yes we're gonna so it literally amends the civil rights act and puts in LGBT I don't even know what that means it spells give me an a but I don't give me a tea I'm not sure like does it have like a residual clause there and and any other letter of the alphabet that subsequently added I'm not sure what that even means and like do they have the queue in there but it I'm just saying this is like the conservative version of the the sexual alphabet suit bill so you know mind you they don't have the 60 votes it's not passing just leave it alone and and fight our our battles no they have to basically basically it's um codifies their stuff into civil rights but then has like this nebulous religious exemption classic classic thing now dude you see what the courts did with this before it was ever passed Congress into law um imagined after oh don't worry you'll have some religious liberty so basically seeds the bathroom issue seeds the female private space issue but like if you're a religious or Catholic University or something it gives you an exemption but I have to read the my understanding is if you would go through it it wouldn't even be that but again I haven't had time to delve into it but I wanted you guys to just be aware of that because that's emblematic of what we're talking about with the covid reaction look at covid look at January 6th look at BLM the most radical destructive issues of our time for which we need the most vocal the most truculent the most categorical opposition that's when Republicans a seed to their premise more than anything but here's um on pro-life pro-gon like we talked about yesterday you know the other thing the state legislatures are doing is they're focusing a lot on right to work and I think you know that's one of the few issues where we still agree with the chamber of commerce there's a decreasingly or increasingly fewer issues that were on the same side with with the chamber but again it's like you notice that whenever there is an effort to get critical mass to pressure Republicans respond to pressure so once in a while it's good there is a gun lobby there's a pro-life lobby there is a you know the kind of chamber of commerce with the right to work you with covid the one bill that every Republican legislature immediate boom boom boom within a couple of days passed was taking off liability for businesses and again I don't disagree with it but I'm saying it's just jarring how that is the thing they did but to really go after the premise and the tyranny no nothing because they're the chambers on the other side of it this is the game it amazes me how whenever Republicans are in charge meaning either in Congress when Republicans of the majority when they have the White House or always in a number of state legislatures it's radio silence like nothing exists the only time they will speak up is when Democrats do something when usually they're only doing that because they were empowered and enabled by Republicans greasing the skits for that in the prior months and years when they could have used their influence to actually preempt the entire chain of events this show more than any show I've done recently I want you to really bookmark this as foundational to understanding why we are where we are and a lot of these guys that you like hearing in conservative media just understand they're worthless and I'd say worse than worthless they're actually the forward advancing guard of the left see if you didn't have Republicans as a false flag punching bag fake opposition see let's say the left just pushes and pushes people are gonna rebel but if you have Republicans that create a fake fight over the final one percent so they give sort of a consensus that the other 99% is not a problem and it's indeed consensus so people are like okay I guess that's that's what needs to be done it's COVID we need to be doing this oh but there's some you know you know really like nasty you know crony political projects stuck in that bill this is what they get people to chew on I'm just telling you click-servitive media are the most pathetic lot but bunch of bunch of people that have ever existed in the face of the earth it's just unbelievable truly hard to believe man I know it's depressing but um there's also more news going on with the border yesterday's border numbers came out 101,000 apprehensions just to understand that's in February and that's a shorter month it was 28 days so I'm still 101,000 if you annualize that you get over 1.2 million annualized flow 1.2 million invaders you cannot imagine the type of people coming in to our country one of the things I noticed is that you know so obviously you have nearly 10,000 teenagers and by the way just so you know it's not like there's family units and there's unaccompanied alien children like that there's two like natural inherent groups of people they're the same families but it's just that the cartels and and I mean Reuters even discussed this they coach them and they understand the policies that we have in place sometimes each sector has its own policies and they know about that and they'll coach them and they know that in some sectors they're still turning around family units but if you're an unaccompanied teen they send you in so what they do is if they have a 15 year old they'll just spin them off and cross them individually I mean that's how much of a scam this is but anyway there's a list of criminal aliens that they caught like with criminal convictions and in just the first five months of the year they caught 220 sex offenders at the border first five months of the year more than any other year for a full year total so it's basically on par if that pace would continue all year it would be more than triple the number they caught last year now the reason why this is important is as you well know illegal aliens are the most proud I mean they have a huge saturation of child molesters and drunk drivers those are the two big I think categories we're seeing and the danger to our society is just enormous you couldn't kill a civilization more than this every year ice a prehens on the interior enough illegal aliens that combined just just eyeballing the last number of years roughly 13 to 16,000 sex offenses among them they're not necessarily unique individuals it could be some with multiple because you know it takes a couple to lock people up you know because child molestation is a low level nonviolent first-time criminal offense to our system but this is a big problem I mean we've talked about this before the culture girls not brides left-wing NGO when they talk about their home countries they actually tell the truth the child marriages it's in the culture it's a huge problem everyone knows that one report from only 30 percent of North Carolina's counties over an 18 month window from 2018 to 2019 the epic times had this a few years ago like two years ago again 18 month period 30 one just a third of North Carolina's counties had 331 illegal aliens charged with 1,172 child rapes and child sexual assaults so this is very prevalent so now all those thousands of people that have been deported over the last number of years now they hear you could come in now you still got to believe that if they catch a sex offender they're not gonna release them but I'm not convinced of that but certainly you if you are one of those you are worried that you're gonna be caught so again when you have this act of love in the families and the UACs you understand that the cartels have have a business model like this so let's say you're a family unit that they they they don't have to sneak you in they just you know throw you to the border patrol and actually they want to do that to tie them down because they're babysitters so you're 5,000 a pop oh you you want to be crossed quietly because you're a sex offender you don't want to be caught you're 12,000 dollars so and you got to believe they have a successful business model otherwise they couldn't charge that much so if we're catching 220 in five months how many sex offenders got in that we didn't catch I'd bet anything over a thousand now think about how many drunk drivers how many burglars robbers assault battery how many criminal aliens have gotten in the sheriff's department in Cochise County Arizona tells me on their cameras they see that only 35% of those caught on the cameras are every apprehended by CBP heck of a lot of them are released by the way they're releasing drunk drivers just so you know they are releasing so when they say they're having priorities right so there's one thing to say I'm is horrible enough to say we're not gonna go around and round up people on the interior that have what they believe are low-level offenses aka gang membership drug traffickers firearms violations drunk driving no there's a very low level they're not they're not harmful to society at all but but what I learned yesterday is that they're taking it a step further and they're applying this even to those freshly coming over the border and caught oh 3d ui's yeah not a priority let them go so even the criminal aliens they're letting go but again you listen to Republicans and they're like every Republican may I saw Ted Cruz all them you know buttons not focusing on the humanitarian crisis really God forbid could you ever shoot at the heart the meat and potatoes of the issue it's always you have to have some talking point you see but in puts kids and cages more than Trump did you see he's mean to the illegals oh humanitarian what is wrong with these people we have one Democrat party why do we need to why do we need the kitty table version why do we need the faint and pathetic echo why do we need the pale pastels why do we need the Simon says mini me follow the leader party why I don't get it the Democrats do a good job promoting their values don't we deserve market share for our values all of them all of them are messed up anyway I promised I'd end up off with some good news so just before I go two things some of you have contacted Ken Paxson the Texas Attorney General's office to say that a lot of the school districts and now even just entire counties Travis County Austin are disobeying the rescission of the mask mandate so Ken Paxson sent a letter that he has heard over the last 24 hours that they're still going to require face masking and he says we have already taken you to court under similar circumstances you lost if you continue to flout the law in this manner we'll take you to court again and you'll lose again and he did tweet out something like making fun out of them like with your double masking or something he says city county leaders must not be thinking clearly maybe it's oxygen deprivation from quintuple masking whatever the case they've tried this before they've lost so look I mean it's something and you know again keep up the pressure keep calling the attorney general's office there and we need to do this in every state the other news I wanted to end off with is I spoke with a friend of mine the Ohio Senate Ohio is looking to be a bright spot now it's horrible at this point but Ohio is one of the states where they are open the legislature's in session all year which as I've talked about before we we absolutely need it because it gives us time to build and promote things we have a lot of people signed up for our Ohio group I am going to look for a team leader it's one of the states I want to focus on and they just passed their bill passed the house and the senate again and it's going to go to the deWine's desk SB 22 it does terminate the entire order that unfortunately because it's whenever you pass something if you want it to be implemented immediately you have to have an emergency provision and you need two-thirds passage and they could only get three-fifths which is enough to override his veto but not enough to pass something as emergency actually they got it in the senate but I don't think they can get it in the house quite two-thirds so it will take three months not because the draft language allows the emergency to go for three months but any bill like that you know any bill you pass it doesn't go into effect for three months so that part is annoying because we'll die by then but what is nice is that the bill look it's not perfect but it's the best thing I've seen that passed along party lines 25 to 8 so they got everyone the senate pro temp the leadership they all voted to rebuke deWine and they're all promising to hold to override his veto um that is really gonna weaken him and that is an absolute priority we have a moral obligation to get that dirt bag out of office there's no reason ohio should be that way western ohio is where all the conservative voters are and that's where you have jim jordan and warren davison's district warren davison needs to run for governor jim jordan his endorsement would be amazing and he should better get trumps endorsement and we could totally get rid of deWine so that is an engender item of mine um i don't know warren if you're listening but if you are i will fly to ohio and break into your home and not leave until you commit to running against deWine um because my fear is if he doesn't run there might be some other people but i don't know if they could win and a lot of them aren't good so there is a bright spot and again this all comes full circle with today's show in the sense that there's so much we can do there's so much that these guys who have audiences 10 50 times larger than mine and he put all them together there's so much these guys could do news max you know it's become another fox news evidently um in terms of primary the governors everyone covid fascism focusing on legislation banging away we could literally have heft the country free if we just took the existing infrastructure and focused on it but sadly it's malignant infrastructure it's meaningless it does more harm than good it's kind of like a lockdown that's what conservative media is so again we're gonna have to build it from scratch i thank all of you for volunteering for con action.network those of you who want to sign up for a liberty strike force team in your state to really be our eyes and ears on the ground to advocate on behalf of our values sign up at con action.network as we get the website up and more user friendly but you could still easily sign up we'll get your name and we're starting to look for team leaders we got one in
