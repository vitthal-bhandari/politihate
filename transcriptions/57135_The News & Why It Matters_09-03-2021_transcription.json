    "text": " Today, critics slam Joe Biden after he appears to forget the name of his defense secretary, and also in Biden news, the education department decides that racially segregated groups not discriminatory at all. Don't worry, nothing to see here. We've got a lot coming up today, and it starts right now. Welcome to the News & Why It Matters. I'm Sarah Gonzalez. Today joined by my friends, Yaku Buyan's host of the Yaku Buyan's show. Thank you for being here. Thank you. It's good to be with you. Yes, and Amy Robles. Hello. Hello, Sogio. Oh, it's good to be here. Alexa Uplodica. So glad you're here as well, and also congrats. Oh, thank you. Thank you. I feel like I am always pregnant when I come on your show, at least I feel like that for the last two years. So I mean, maybe you could find out what's causing that. It's quarantine. We gotta get out of quarantine. So I think you're doing that's causing that. These have been a big spike in babies. Thank you. Very happy to see you. Thank you. All right, so we have a... We've got a lot of Biden news today to get into. So personally, I like to start with the news in which we discuss how Biden is probably not all there these days. Now, I know this comes as a shock to no one who has either sat at this table or been watching this program. We've been talking about this. We've been showing the evidence of the mental decline in Joe Biden for a while now. Magically, here he is as president. So let's discuss his video yesterday afternoon, where President Biden appeared to forget the name of his defense secretary and also, oh, you know that building over there, the pentagon watch. So I want to thank you both and I want to thank the former general. I keep calling him General, my guy who runs that outfit over there. I want to make sure we thank the secretary for all he's done to try to implement what we just talked about and for recommending these two women for promotion. Thank you all. May God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Kind of an awkward moment there for Joe Biden, you know, and again, I want to make this very clear. We may poke fun at Joe Biden. I do. I mean, it is a sad thing that we're seeing happen. However, this is the leader of our country. And I feel like we should be able to hold him to the standard of, hey, he should be able to, oh, I don't know, get sentences out. Remember the names of his, you know, defense secretary. Know what the pentagon is or read a teleprompter. At this point, surely he's not going off script. I mean, you would think that he's not doing anything without a teleprompter, and yet we still continue to have this. And I think the sad thing is yesterday, you know, you have this nomination of these two females for generals, these high positions. And that unfortunately was overshadowed by this bluff, this lapse in mental judgment. And like you said, it is sad. I've been saying since day one, since he was debating, since he was out there campaigning, this is elderly abuse. This is not shocking or surprising to any of us. But I think the biggest thing and the biggest takeaway is we had calls for you to evoke the 25th amendment with Trump. All right. After the protests at the Capitol, right? He would breathe wrong. And it'd be like, he's not mentally fit. He's not mentally stable. And yet there is zero call for that when it comes to Biden. It's almost like they're not even watching these pr- Well, no, they're not. They're cutting them off when he says that he'll give them press conferences. I mean, it's just really sad to watch. It's embarrassing to quite frankly. Yeah. Yeah. Look, I look at it and this is not new, right? This is why he didn't campaign because they understood. This is why he's been kept out of the crossfire, why he was in a bunker. This is why they cut a feed, a White House feed. I've never seen that in my life. We're going to go to questions. And he's saying we're going to go to questions and they cut the feed. What do you want me to do? Nancy Pelosi or somebody? It was, yeah. And all of a sudden, cut the feed. This is not new. For me, I want to read into the sub-context here of whose pulling strings. Because as we're watching that, sure, that is dismal. It is abuse. We've said that forever. Jill Biden, man, I don't know. It's a whole nother level when your husband's struggling like that and you keep pushing him out there. Right? I mean, that's some sort of desperation to want to have power. Right? Because the man does need help. Any other human being? Today at Wataburger, if I walk in and I order something and the person that's serving me has mental laps like that, I would ask, are you okay? This is not an attack on Joe Biden because he's not a conservative. This is just any human being with that cognitive behavior. You'd go, there's a reason for concern. Okay. That being said, he's out there for a reason because it's smoke and mirrors. And who's pulling the strings in the back? When you start hearing Kamala is calling heads of state, you know, when you start seeing some crazy decisions made, that's my bigger concern. And actually, I said this the other day and I think the guys disagreed with me. I don't really even know how much he really knows what's really going on behind the scenes. How truly I believe he's being used. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Well, just a little bit of insight into how, of course, the mainstream media, social media, how they, of course, they can't help but twist everything to be about Trump because, you know, the man that's not in office anymore is a big threat to them. So they always have to, everything comes back to Trump with them. So this was, of course, on Twitter, it said, it was in the trending politics spot. President Biden appeared to forget the name of his Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, sparking discussion about the time former President Donald Trump referred to Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, as Tim Apple. It's like, no, no one was talking about that except you guys because you want to turn it around on Trump when we have an established pattern of these videos from Joe Biden. We have the White House press secretary constantly deflecting when she is asked, when is the president going to hold a press conference? When is the president going to take questions? He's not. They've said that he's going to. We have yet to see that. So once it happens, we would love to report it here on the news and why it matters. But so far, all we have received are deflections. And yes, no, he'll do it. Oh, no, yeah, he'll do it Thursday or something. That he'll totally do it. He's definitely going to answer questions from you guys. So it is interesting to see the deflection from the mainstream media, from all of these big tech outlets who, of course, helped the president get elected. Now they want to turn it to Trump. So what's the play there? We're going to deflect for how long and in America is just going to get tired. So you know what? We don't need to hear from him. It's OK. No, we're not. Yeah, sure. Well, I mean, those days are gone. And it really came from Barack Obama because Obama is very, very well-spoken, very polished out there. And politics has become a popularity contest. These are the biggest celebrities of our time, even more than athletes. So the days where you can go be president and your country doesn't hear from you, those days are gone. And sure, President Trump said, hey, the White House is going to communicate directly with the people. So now the people want to hear it. They want to hear from the guy and you say you're better than the guy that was there before. Tell us why we can't reach, can't talk to me. Well, you won't answer questions. But I don't see that it's going to happen. If you have hope that that's coming, a press conference, how? With a curated set of questions? With a curated set of audience. But they've been asking for questions prior to the press conference for a while. But even if they cut the feet because he kicks in, he's normal human. I want to answer some questions. I'm having fun over here. I go, well, no, you're not. Well, that's an end. And that's why you have to wonder how much of Biden you mentioned, well, why can't he just read the teleprompter? So how much of this is Biden saying, I'm fine. Come on, leave me alone. I'm fine. I got this. I can handle this. All of these critics who have been talking about me. Don't know what they're talking about. I'm going to show them. And spoiler alert, he does not end up showing them. No, because you know staffers are definitely come on. They definitely talking about it. I have to be talking about a teleprompter talking about, you know, they have to be. So maybe it is him saying, I'm not doing it. I can handle it and they go, OK, we'll just cut the feet. I've never seen that out. I was saying I was watching. I was saying, what? Right. We have a power out. I don't want to. I mean, something like that. Well, I'm just thinking, like, if that happened during Trump's administration, how many people would have gotten fired? Right. Like, that's not excellent. The White House is supposed to operate with excellence. And to a much higher standard for the feed, just go out all the sudden. I imagine if that happened with Trump's administration. Whoop, thank you. All right. So more news with the Biden administration, of course. Yesterday on International Women's Day, the Biden administration expressed openness to the idea of adding a third gender option for federal identification documents. This is, of course, pushed by the American Civil Liberties Union, on the ACLU. Remember all the way back when the ACLU was actually concerned with true civil liberties? Yeah, I know. It was a long time ago. But they want to make sure that they don't discriminate against non-binary people, because with all of the things that are going on in the country, this is the most important. Make sure that non-binary people feel included. So here is the Biden administration. This is the executive director of the newly launched Gender Policy Council, because you definitely need one of those talking about their openness for adding a third gender option on federal IDs watch. The president and the vice president campaigned during the election on giving a third gender option on federal government IDs to individuals who want them. Does the presidency value in saying an executive order to make that happen? I haven't looked yet to see whether that requires an executive order. I mean, I would note that we are very inclusive in our definition of gender, and we intend to address all sorts of discrimination and, you know, for equal rights for people, whether that's LGBTQ plus people, women, girls, men. So, you know, that's certainly something that we will look at. But I honestly don't know whether that requires an executive order. Sounds like we'll have to just look into it a little bit more and see what's required, but it's a good question. Oh my gosh, it's a great question. Are you kidding? Who doesn't want to know whether or not you can get a third gender option for four federal IDs. Thank God we have this gender policy council now to do all of this heavy lifting on these really, really important burdens for the country. Yeah, this is definitely not what we should be spending on times. And again, I'm just going to go back. I look, I'm an immigrant, right? And I'm telling you, I came here because this country by law and by constitutional, right, is free. So many of these things they say they fight for. You've had it before your grandfather was born. Right. So what you're actually doing is you want to retool it. You want to redefine it. You don't want freedom, but define freedom. Because the freedom that you want people to have, I'm not interested in. The freedom when you tell me what to eat, walk, sleep, and all of a sudden tell my three and five year old that, hey, can we introduce seven new genders to you? Because that's the same council that's also fighting with Dr. Levin, who's trans and health and human services who's now promoting what puberty blockers to three or seven council, right? So hogwash, absolute nonsense. It's an indoctrination of a society, 100%. And we've reached these levels of insanity at this point that there's just no reeling it back. There's no way to really come back from what we're doing. And we're seeing the insanity happen over and over again as we sit here and we hear about talking about, well, women's rights. I mean, that's a big one. That's the big forefront of everybody's mind. But then how do you reconcile that with trans rights also? But then also letting, look at what's happening with sports and female sports. And we've talked about this multiple times. But then where is the equality? Where, as a young girl, I'm going to have a daughter here in August. And I'm like, if I want to teach her about competing in her sports and competing in all these great things that come from sports, but then she really never has the opportunity to win or to compete at equal levels because they're letting biological males into these sports. I mean, where is the equality? It's not. There's not. Because it's not about equality. That's what I'm telling you. It's not about freedom. It's not about equality. It's about an agenda. Pushing a certain agenda. And if you really, with intellectual honesty, look at that agenda. It destroys. Why is it that Pick Rob Smith for crying out, a conservative gay man who served married to a man, you call Rob Smith and you ask him, hey, Rob, do you condone anything? He said, listen, don't bring that cue to me. LBGT is not even what he's saying. LBG, he stops there. He said, you bring all these other now. It's LBGTQ plus hyphen exclamation, whatever. Those are danger zones. And the gay community says so. They say, we don't endorse this. This is insane. This is nuts. But you got to swing the pendulum so far as what they're doing to push society so hard. And it's that whole thing of, I'm going to, I really only want 10 bucks for me. We're going to ask for 20. And if you're back, give me 15, I want this is it. You got to push it into breaking point, which is how do you come back from some of this stuff? Some of it you don't come back from. You don't. Yep. That made me think of, you know, yesterday again, Women's Day, I brought up the point on my social media that biological men do not just have the inherent right to be called women. Why find the title of woman to be, you know, very unique and somewhat special and reserved for, oh, I don't know, people with vaginas. And I was told that that was transphobic. And I'm just would like to make sure that the record reflects that believing in science does not mean you are transphobic. It just means that you believe in science. Okay. We've got more to come, including the White House press secretary telling us that now, magically putting kids in cages is the humane and moral thing to do. You will not believe it. If you have a high blood pressure, make sure you've taken your meds before. You listen to this one. First, we want to thank our sponsor, Bilt Bar. Amy, have I let you try Bilt Bar Young? Nope. We talked about it last time. Oh my gosh. I need one. You have to come to my dressing room after the show and I'll get, I'm like, I'm a drug dealer. She's got boxes on it. I need some. Bilt bars and I'm just handing them out to people because I know that they'll get addicted to them once I let them taste it. Good. Okay. They're delicious. I know Yaku's had it. Love them. He loves them. If you are looking for something to snack on, especially if you enjoy your sweets. Okay. I'm talking to you chocolate lovers. You enjoy a good chocolate candy bar, but you don't enjoy what it does to your waistline. You got to check out Bilt Bar. They are low calorie, low sugar, high protein. And they are there for you in your pantry when you are looking for something to satisfy that craving. All right. It's going to taste way better than the protein bar that you're eating right now that probably tastes like cardboard. They've got a ton of different flavors.

As we have seen in the past several months, now the border crisis continues to worsen. Now we have seen the administration deflect and explain why these are dipped. Look, these are not kids in cages like President Trump. Okay. These are kids in containers. It's much, much different. Oh, wait. What are they? They were talking about changing the name of these migrant detention facilities to like welcome centers. That's not really what it was, but it was reception centers. Thank you. That's right. Thank you. They told me in my ear, reception centers. They're not, no, they're not kids in cages. These are just reception centers that we shuffle them into and close the door so they can have their hands on the bars. But now, now it is totally humane and moral, according to the White House Press Secretary Watch. Border said that they discussed capacity used for unaccompanied children. Will they be making recommendations of the president? Is there a need for more capacity? Well, will we know just purely by the number, Steve, that there is going to be a need, right? Because we have a large number of kids on accompanied children who are coming across the border. We've made a policy decision as an administration that the humane and moral approach is to keep these kids safe and get them into facilities that are safe. You know, it's a little odd because I seem to recall the Trump administration faced with the same issue. And I was told by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that it was concentration camps. Yeah, concentration camps. Number one, there's a couple of things that I was so glad I was just on a Rudy Giuliani show this morning. We had discussed this and I was so glad she just said something. There's so many kids coming. Yes, I wonder why that is. A month ago, we said our surveillance tells us that 42% of the caravans that are coming are minors, children unaccompanied, right? Okay, so we're going to put them in facilities, a receiving center. So this is shipping and receiving. Are they goods? Reception centers. Reception centers. Are they goods? These are human beings. So maybe get your language right next time you want to talk about a child and say, you mean receiving the reception center. So it's not a box of coffee. Okay, this is a human being. Number one, it's called prima fascia. That child is exploited on his way to the border. Its child abuse in the other country to march a child 400 miles. Melnourished, dehydrated. Okay, most of them sexually abused, rape kits in the backpack. Coyote is not the animal. Thank you very much, Joe. But the bad guys bringing them over why it's a rite of passage. Right? Okay, so now you put them in the center. Yes, built by Barack Obama. Rightfully so. Separate them. All of a sudden overflow. Can't handle them. Let's start talking about human feces. Let's talk about sanitary. Let's start having those conversations. Thank you because I'm talking to CBP. Okay, so how long you hold the child? Let's say the whole number three, four days. Where does that child go now? Where? CPS? They're going to go into foster care system. That's as broken as can be. Let's have that conversation. You know where they go? Straight into the hands of the traffickers in the United States because now there's an undocumented child unaccompanied that nobody will look for. One might say, Amy, if the administration wanted to do the humane moral thing, they would focus their energy on making sure that these countries on our southern border knew that we cannot accept you. We cannot accept you. Instead, we're trying to broadcast to all of these countries. Hey, it's, I mean, we may need to hold you for a little bit, but hey, once we hold you, once you get on in, we're just going to trust that you're going to come show up for your hearing. Wink, wink. What do they expect to happen? Of course there are going to be people who are bringing their children across the border. Of course, there are going to be people who are letting their children in the care of someone else to take them across the border. You're broadcasting that you're going to accept them. So one might think, Amy, that if they truly cared about these kids, they would tell everyone, they would tell all of these countries, keep your kids at home. It is dangerous for them. Right. Yes. But an issue is not that we have these facilities to hold them. The issue is that there are too many that are coming across that we can't do anything with them. At least what Trump was doing was limiting the amount of people that were coming over here. Yes, we still had to receive them. I love when you're on the show because you shed so much light on what these centers were actually set up to do. You never hear about it on the media. It's not to be mean. No, it's actually the best way to protect them. It's right. Because like you've told us before in the past, they're separating them from who brought them over here. They're trying to figure out like, where do you go? Who brought you here? What's going on? How can we actually your parents? Can we actually keep you safe here? And in the meantime, like if we find out there's something going on, we can send you back, you know, if it's not a safe situation. So really, unfortunately, what Trump did was good. It just got such a bad rap because people didn't take the time to report on it. I know I could hardly find factual information on it. I had to get all my facts when you came on the show and really laid out what these centers were doing and how they actually were there to set up to protect the children. So yeah, I mean, we've got a huge mess at our border and it's getting bad down there. For a second. Let's say you're a border patrol agent, CBP, you're fighting for this country. Your number one job is to keep the country safe. That's your number one job. Now, a child comes across the border. That CBP agent has to, in a matter of 30 minutes, analyze the following. Is there a health care concern? Is he hungry? Is he close right? Is that the parent? Do they speak my language? Can they communicate? All of a sudden, oh, what about illegal food coming across the border? You do know that you cannot bring a mango into the United States without it being stopped at the border and being checked and radiated at times, but you can bring a child in. And how do they even have a clinic? What are we talking about? And we're also talking about being in the middle of a pandemic that I don't we don't even have enough testing facilities to test our own citizens and make sure that everyone here is safe and not spreading disease. How do we even have the capacity to truly test every single one of these people that are coming across the border to test them? Well, they're testing them and they're coming up positive and they're releasing their country. It's catching release. Yeah, I mean, this is what I'm saying. I mean, even now, and this is just truth when they identify a child as this child is now with a trafficker, right? They're releasing them into the country. Not just the child, the trafficker gets a court date, 90 days out. You got to show up to a parole officer. Good luck. That's what typically what criminals do. Right. They just show up. What are we talking about? No, how this party has gotten away with claiming that they are the ones that care about people that are loving, that are, you know, just care about human rights when this is happening down at our border. It's just so sad. It's all for the vote. Well, I'd say they have very effective messaging. It's very cunning. Yeah, it's very effective. But is it so unique, though, because in New York City, they cut a trafficker and a child and they fingerprint him and that guy walks the same day, no bail. And he gets a 90 day parole date to show up. So they're doing it on the border, but they're doing it in our cities. Yeah, literally. Yeah. All right, we've got more to come, including why Biden's education department decides that racially segregated groups, they're definitely not discriminatory. I mean, really good, really good for racial interaction, definitely. First, we want to thank our sponsor Gabby Insurance. I'm sure you are looking for all the ways that you can potentially save money. We had a pandemic. There were people who were forced out of business. Now is the time that everyone is counting their pennies. So if you are looking to, you know, maybe keep an extra $961 a year in your pocket. Yeah, that was exact. But let me tell you why. That is how much Gabby customers save per year on average on car and home insurance. So what Gabby does is Gabby takes all of the all of the major insurance carriers. And they give you an apples to apples comparison of your current coverage with all of these for with 40 of them. Did you even know that 40 existed? I didn't until I started using Gabby. They give you all of the comparison for all of the top insurance providers. So they will let you know, A, you may find a policy that is much cheaper than what you're paying now. But be this is the most important thing that they do. They're not in it to like sell you something. If you have the best policy already and you are already saving the largest amount of money, they tell you. They just say, congratulations, you actually have the lowest rate already. And that is how they're helping you. So again, they're not in it to make sure to sell you a policy. They truly are just trying to give you apples to apples. Make sure that you are getting the cheapest and most cost effective policy out there. You can relax using Gabby knowing you have the best rate out there. They're not going to sell your information either, by the way. So you're not going to get any annoying spam from them. Check out how much Gabby can save you. It's totally free to check. There's no obligation. You can go to gabby.com slash y that is G A B I dot com slash y Gabby dot com slash y. Now in the final days of the Trump administration, the Department of Education had determined that racial affinity groups were discriminatory because they obviously they are treating students and staff differently based on their race. I'm pretty sure that's what a lot of people fought against, including Martin Luther King Jr. We want to judge people on the content of their character, not the color of their skin. So the Trump administration had determined that these were discriminatory. Well, you're in luck because President Biden actually suspended this decision. The education department under President Biden has decided that this is totally okay. Racial affinity groups will be fine to be used in K through 12 and also higher education institutions across the country because they can give this is this I'm reading this. This is not me. I'm reading this. They can give black people a quote safe space and quote to discuss their experiences with racism while providing a separate space for white people to learn about their white privilege. So those of you out there who may be white, maybe you've had a hard time in life. Don't worry. You actually have had white privilege this whole time. You didn't even know it. Can you believe that? I'm I'm saying actually you're an African American. I am African American. I should I should have been talking to you. I'm an African American, right? Because it's not about skin pigment. Right. And again, I I'm a broken record in this. Your audience is going to say tell you I could say something else. I'm not gonna look at who's talking race always. Always. They cannot function without racial tension. And so I'm not surprised. They reverse hear this. This is that party is reversing a decision to judge people on character. No, no, no, no, no. We got to compartmentalize and segregate. That's what we got to do here. We got to segregate them, put them in box. One may think that they actually want to capitalize off of the racial division, right, that they are creating. Of course, of course, follow the money. What do you think? I mean, no, it's just so sad. Trump was trying to help us take a step forward. Now we are going backwards. And as progressive as we think we are in this society, we are continuing to intentionally, this party is intentionally, taking steps to get us backwards. And it is all an attempt to keep them in power. Like you said, they know that when everybody is divided and we're not a united front, we are not a united people, well, guess what? Someone has to be their savior. If you constantly feel like you are the victim, if you constantly feel like everything is stacked against you, well, don't worry, the government will come in and be your savior and they will help you. And all the while, they're the ones that are keeping this mentality to where we can never overcome that. And I really want to raise my children in a world where it doesn't, they don't see skin color. Remember when it used to be okay to say we can be colorblind? And that feels like we're reverting back to that. And I don't want to teach my children to look at that and to make decisions based off of people's color. I want them to be in a world where they realize that we are equal, that we are all Americans here, you know, when you're in this country and you're here legally and you're American citizen, like, we all have the opportunity to work hard, to succeed, to come out of our circumstances. That's what I want to train my children. And it just seems like that message is getting completely drowned out. So many people will say, how do you lift someone out of poverty? And we always go back to his education. It's actually the ability to think freely. It's the ability to dream. It's the ability to say, what if, the what if, what if it's me? What if I'm LeBron James? What if I say, Juan Barkley? What if I'm what if I'm right? And they suppress that by compartmentalizing. You suppress that. You put limits on on a child's in a community's mind. You limit them. You put boxes around them to control 100%. And that's how you keep society, hold society back because a true free people, right? What do things differently than this? I guarantee you, I've got whiplash because just what is it? Nine weeks ago, 10 weeks ago, they're the ones that were saying, how much racism there is in this country? And what are you racially charged nation? And now you bring a policy in that segregates people? Yeah, come on. Well, I mean, it shouldn't be any surprise for the Obama administration 2.0. Because as we saw President Obama under his leadership was when we saw the country really segregate and have this racial divide that he of course was provoking. And now this is basically the Obama admin 2.0. So it should not be a shock to any of us. Now, speaking of racially segregated groups, all of this talk about, you know, black versus white, all of these things, Don Lemon, let me let me let me show you a little flashback from Don Lemon, who back in 2013 actually spoke with Bill O'Reilly of all people about problems in the black community, what the black community can do to fix his problems. And he sounded, I mean, I don't know, a little bit like he had white privilege if we're judging by the criteria that is put upon us today. Listen to Don Lemon in 2013. So listen to this. The reason there is so much violence and chaos in the black precincts is the disintegration of the African American family. He's got a point. In fact, he's got more than a point, Bill. Raised without much structure, young black men often reject education and gravitate towards the street culture, drugs, hustling gangs. Nobody forces them to do that. Again, it is a personal decision. He is right about that too. But in my estimation, he doesn't go far enough because black people, if you really want to fix the problem, here's just five things that you should think about doing. Here's number five. And if this doesn't apply to you, if you're not doing this, then it doesn't apply to you. I'm not talking about you. Here's number five. Pull up your pants. Sagging pants, whether it's Justin Bieber or no name Derek around the way, walking around with your ass and your underwear showing is not okay. In fact, it comes from prison when they take away belts from the prisoner so that they can't make a weapon. What a difference a little under a decade makes. I couldn't imagine Don Lemon uttering any of those words today. Although, these are all still true ideas. And Yaku, I know that you speak a lot about fathers and fatherless communities and what transpires when we have fatherless communities, these things were not controversial back then. Apparently, now they are. They were common sense. And so even the left at that point fall in line with common sense, right? Inductrenated much, Don? I mean, how far has he shifted? How far has he abandoned what he once believed us right, which was just still the normal ones? When you break the nuclear family, particularly when you remove a father, now mothers, you are maternity connected, we all came out of a womb. That's it. Okay. But when you remove a father, it's catastrophic for any nation around the world. You can go anywhere around the world, right? You break it. When you do it by design, when you encourage it, and then when you fund it, follow the money, when you fund removing the black father from a household, okay? You do it with a reason. You know what you're doing. You know that you're taking Oakland, Oakland, Dallas, Texas, and you're putting your thumb on it. You know that's what you're doing. You know you're getting a voter block that's going to go on the doll, on the government system, on the food stamps system. And it's weird psychology that happens to a kid when breaks without a father, okay? When you don't have a father in the house, you are desperate. You're looking for a savior. It's what they want. You said it earlier. We will save you. Here's the golden ticket. Create the problem and present the solution. Yeah. Amy, I know several people that I think probably we all know, we all share in common, black men, conservative black men who would say the exact same thing that Don Lemon would say, and they would get called an Uncle Tom. Absolutely. I mean, yeah. That's the world that we're living. It's not funny at all. It's actually extremely sad because Don Lemon was right. I didn't know if those words would ever come out of my mouth. It's weird. Yes. But he was right now. I would love to see him do a playback on that, see where he stands on it now. See if he backtracks at all, or if he really did believe in what he was saying at that point, because now it seems like he did then he doesn't know. It's all for the ratings and the clips and the Trump derangement syndrome. That's what I was going to say. I was like, well, look at what's happened between there. He'd all started with Trump derangement syndrome and just, you know, escalated from there, unfortunately. But yeah, I mean, this is a shock. Any of us at this table that any conservative black American is going to, you know, they're not going to listen to them. Yeah. Have you listened to Ben Carson lately? There is so much wisdom coming out of that man. Yeah. And last time I checked, his skin pigment was dark. Yeah. Which means he won't be listened to by the mainstream media, of course. All right, back in a minute. GIRL-E-MAN, Brian Stelter, also known as Mr. Potato Head to a lot of you out there. He, now, I want to make something clear. He did not, unfortunately, on his program called Reliable Sources, did not have any time to address any of the Andrew Cuomo scandals going on, whether it be the, you know, I don't know, covering up a bunch of deaths in nursing homes and disabled homes, or all of the accusations lodged against the governor. But he did. However, I will have you know, with estrogen running through his veins, he did have a chance to make sure that his audience understands the ups and downs of the TV personalities working from home and just, you know, let's humanize. Let's humanize these people. It's just so hard for them just sitting at home and working. Watch. If it is successful, guys, very cool. We love it, Will. Next time he war pants, but hey, I can relate. This is me. I won't see it in with just two minutes notice talking with Wolf Blitzer about Trump's Twitter account being banned. No, no, I'm going to call BS on that one, Brian. That I, I don't believe that you walk around the house with no pants on because I don't believe anyone else in that house would allow that. I don't. I don't believe it one bit. You took the pants off for the picture, Brian. Yes. You took the pants off for the picture and nobody wants to see this, Brian. Okay. Nobody wants to see this from you. Also, a two minute warning. Is it a clip on Tykes? How long does it take to tie a jacket? Okay. The ring light. Mr. Potato hit with no pants. My eyes are burning. I'm fire. No one wants to see that, Brian. But again, we really have so many issues going on in this country. This is what we talk about. This is what he is dedicating on his program Time To is making sure that we humanize the news. We want to humanize Brian Seltzer, Chris Cuomo, Don Lemon, all of these people who dedicated basically the last four or five years of their lives dehumanizing you actually out there. You, if you're watching this program right now, they were dehumanizing you. They have spent all of this time talking about how you're in a cult. They have to deprogram you. But don't worry. It's not your fault. It's President Trump's fault. Now all of a sudden they want to make sure that we know that they're humans too, guys. Okay. They're just like you. They don't wear pants around the house. I wear pants around the house. I know. I'm like, okay, you know what? I would have I would have bought it if it was like pajama pants. Right. Right. But like there's no. No, can you? No, you guys don't do that. Do you? Just walk around the house with no pants on because you're not okay. I mean, you traumatize people. I know, right? I'm traumatized by seeing that. No, I'm not. He's not that important. But here's but here's the deal. We know you're a human. I just know you're a foolish one. Yeah, yeah. I'm not saying you're not a human. I'm just saying what's coming out of your mouth tells me that you're desperate enough to sell your soul to the highest bidder and have no rudder, have no spine, can't defend the country that fed you, that protects you, can't stand beyond the troops that that go out there and night and lose family members and limbs. I know you human. I just know there's different kinds. Yeah. And I mean, I got news for you, Brian. You're not you're not the hero in this story. You are not the hero as much as you try to paint yourself to be a hero as you know, Jim Acosta and all of these other blowhards do in the mainstream media. I can't help but think the average American looks at that and goes, yeah, guys, you're not you're not the story. You're not the story as much as you try to make yourselves the story. You're not right. I don't care how little pants you have on. It doesn't make up for how much I don't care about the substance of what it is that you're talking about. Your character is not there. Everything I feel that comes out of their mouth is spewing lies. So I don't care how human you are, how lack of the little pants you're wearing. You know, I that doesn't I don't watch them anyways, you know, as I have to, but. But how many how does not wearing pants make you human? Oh, because the rest of us, you know, in our zoom meetings, what do we how is that even I'm sitting here going has that even an indicator of see how so me show you I'm human. Yeah, I'm just like you. Let me relax. Let me walk around with no pants on. You know, you can show me you're human. I mean, get back in touch with reality. Care about people. Right. Care about the truth. Yeah. Do your job like do your actual journalistic job. For starters, maybe. I don't think he can handle that. I don't think girly man Brian Stelzer can handle that.
